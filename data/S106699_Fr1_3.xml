   <p>DIuine <hi>Plato,</hi> the great Master of many worthy Philosophers, and the constant auoucher, and pithy perswader of <hi>Vnum, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and <hi>Ens:</hi> in his Schole and Academie, sundry times (besides his ordinary Scholers) was visited of a certaine kinde of men, allured by the noble fame of <hi>Plato,</hi> and the great commendation of hys profound and profitable doctrine. But when such Hearers, after long harkening to him, perceaued, that the drift of his discourses issued out, to conclude, this <hi>Vnum, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and <hi>Ens,</hi> to be Spirituall, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, AEternall, Omnipotent, &amp;c.

      </gap>lous sensible and bodyly blysse and felicitie hereafter, might be atteyned: Straightway, the fantasies of those hearers, were dampt: their opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> was clene chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: yea his doctrine was by them despised: and his schole, no more of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hem visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <q>Which thing, his Scholer, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> narrowly cōsidering, founde the cause ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to be, For that they had no forwarnyng and information, in generall, whereto his doctrine tended.</q> For, so, might they haue had occasion, either to haue forborne his schole hauntyng: (if they, then, had misliked his Scope and purpose) or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to haue continued therin: to their full satisfaction: if such finall scope &amp; intent, had ben to their desire.
<q>Wherfore, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> euer, after that, vsed in brief, to forewarne his owne Scholers and hearers, both of what matter, and also to what ende, he tooke in hand to speake, or teach. While I consider the diuerse trades of these two excellent Philosophers (and am most sure, both, that <hi>Plato</hi> right well, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise could teach:</q>
and that <hi>Aristotle</hi> mought boldely, with his hearers, haue dealt in like sorte as <hi>Plato</hi> did) I am in no little pang of perplexitie: Bycause, that, which I mislike, is most easy for me to performe (and to haue <hi>Plato</hi> for my exāple.) And that, which I know to be most commendable: and (in this first bringyng, into common handling, the <hi>Artes Mathematicall</hi>) to be most necessary: is full of great difficultie and sundry daungers.

   <p>
      <q>Wherfore, seyng I finde great occasion (for the causes alleged, and farder, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of my <hi>Art Mathematike generall</hi>) to vse a certaine forewarnyng and Praeface, whose content shalbe, that mighty, most plesaunt, and frutefull <hi>Mathematicall Tree,</hi> with his chief armes and second (grifted) braunches:<note place="margin">
            <hi>The intent of this Preface.</hi>
         </note> Both, what euery one is, and also, what commodity, in generall, is to be looked for, aswell of griff as stocke: And forasmuch as this enterprise is so great, that, to this our tyme, it neuer was (to my knowledge) by any achieued: And also it is most hard, in these our drery dayes, to such rare and straunge Artes, to wyn due and common credit:</q>
Neuertheles, if, for my sincere endeuour to satisfie your honest expectation, you will but lend me your thākefull mynde a while: and, to such matter as, for this time, my penne (with spede) is hable to deliuer, apply your eye or eare attentifely: perchaunce, at once, and for the first salutyng, this Preface you will finde a lesson long enough. And ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will, for a second (by this) be made much the apter: or shortly become, well hable your selues, of the lyons claw, to coniecture his royall symmetrie, and farder propertie. Now then, gentle, my frendes, and countrey men, Turne your eyes, and bend your myndes to that doctrine, which for our present purpose, my simple talent is hable to yeld you.</p>
   <p>All thinges which are, &amp; haue beyng, are found vnder a triple diuersitie generall.</p>
   <p>For, either, they are demed Supernaturall, Naturall, or, of a third being. Thinges Supernaturall, are immateriall, simple, indiuisible, incorruptible, &amp; vnchangeable. Things Naturall, are materiall, compounded, diuisible, corruptible, and chaungea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Thinges Supernaturall, are, of the minde onely, comprehended: Things Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, of the sense exterior, ar hable to be perceiued. In thinges Naturall, probabilitie and coniecture hath place: But in things Supernaturall, chief demōstration, &amp; most sure Science is to be had. By which properties &amp; comparasons of these two, more easily may be described, the state, condition, nature and property of those thinges, which, we before termed of a third being: which, by a peculier name also, are called <hi>Thynges Mathematicall.</hi> For, these, beyng (in a maner) middle, betwene thinges su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall and naturall: are not so absolute and excellent, as thinges supernatural: Nor yet so base and grosse, as things naturall: But are thinges immateriall: and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, by materiall things hable somewhat to be signified. And though their particular Images, by Art, are agg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>egable and diuisible: yet the generall <hi>Formes,</hi> notwithstandyng, are constant, vnchaungeable, vntrāsformable, and incorruptible. Neither of the sense, can they, at any tyme, be perceiued or iudged. Nor yet for all that, in the royall mynde of man, first conceiued. But, surmountyng the imperfectiō of coniecture, weenyng and opinion: and commyng short of high intellectuall cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptiō, are the Mercurial fruite of <hi>Dianoeticall</hi> discourse, in perfect imagination sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistyng. A meruaylous newtralitie haue these thinges <hi>Mathematicall.</hi> and also a straunge participatiō betwene thinges supernaturall, immortall, intellectual, simple and indiuisible: and thynges naturall, mortall, sensible, compounded and diuisible. Probabilitie and sensible profe, may well serue in thinges naturall: and is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable: In Mathematicall reasoninges, a probable Argument, is nothyng regarded: nor yet the testimony of sense, any whit credited: But onely a perfect demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of truthes certaine, necessary, and inuincible: vniuersally and necessaryly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded:

   <p>Of <hi>Mathematicall</hi> thinges, are two principall kinde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap> which, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, is a thing <hi>Mathematicall. Magnitude</hi> is a thing <hi>Mathematicall,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Magnitude.</hi>
      </note> by participation of some likenes of whose nature, any thing is iudged long, broade, or thicke. A thicke <hi>Magnitude</hi> we call a <hi>Solide,</hi> or a <hi>Body.</hi> What <hi>Magnitude</hi> so euer, is Solide or" Thicke, is also broade, &amp; long. A broade magnitude, we call a <hi>Superficies</hi> or a Plaine. Euery playne magnitude, hath also length. A long magnitude, we terme a <hi>Line.</hi> A <hi>Line</hi> is neither thicke nor broade, but onely long: Euery certayne Line, hath two endes: The endes of a line, are <hi>Pointes</hi> called.<note place="margin">
         <hi>A point.</hi>
      </note> A <hi>Point,</hi> is a thing <hi>Mathematicall,</hi> indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible, which may haue a certayne determined situation. If a Poynt moue from a" determined situation, the way wherein it moued, is also a <hi>Line</hi>: mathematically produced. whereupon, of the auncient Mathematiciens, a <hi>Line</hi> is called the race or course of a <hi>Point.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>A Line.</hi>
      </note> A Poynt we define, by the name of a thing Mathematicall: though it be no Magnitude, and indiuisible: because it is the propre ende, and bound of a <hi>Line</hi>: which is a true <hi>Magnitude.</hi>

immortall, Corporall and Spirituall. Part of this profound and diuine Science, had <hi>Ioachim</hi> the Prophesier atteyned vnto: by <hi>Numbers Formall, Naturall,</hi> and <hi>Rationall,</hi> forseyng, concludyng, and forshewyng great particular euents, long before their comming. His bookes yet remainyng, hereof, are good profe: And the noble Earle of <hi>Mirandula,</hi> (besides that,) a sufficient witnesse: that <hi>Ioachim, in his prophesies, proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by no other way, then by Numbers Formall.</hi> And this Earle hym selfe, in Rome, <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ano.</hi> 1488.</note> set vp 900. Conclusions, in all kinde of Sciences, openly to be disputed of: and among the rest, in his Conclusions <hi>Mathematicall,</hi> (in the eleuenth Conclusion) hath in Latin, this English sentence. <hi>By Numbers, a way is had, to the searchyng out, aud vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng of euery thyng, hable to be knowen. For the verifying of which Conclusion, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to aunswere to the 74. Quaestions, vnder written, by the way of Numbers.</hi> Which Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, I omit here to rehearse: aswell auoidyng superfluous prolixitie: as, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Ioannes Picus, workes,</hi> are commonly had. But, in any case, I would wish that those Conclusions were red diligently, and perceiued of such, as are earnest Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruers and Considerers of the constant law of nūbers: which is planted in thyngs Naturall and Supernaturall: and is prescribed to all Creatures, inuiolably to be kept. For, so, besides many other thinges, in those Conclusions to be marked, it would apeare, how sincerely, &amp; within my boundes, I disclose the wonderfull my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, by numbers, to be atteyned vnto.</p>
   <p>Of my former wordes, easy it is to be gathered, that <hi>Number</hi> hath a treble state: One, in the Creator: an other in euery Creature (in respect of his complete consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution:) and the third, in Spirituall and Angelicall Myndes, and in the Soule of mā. In the first and third state, <hi>Number,</hi> is termed <hi>Number Numbryng.</hi> But in all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, otherwise, <hi>Number,</hi> is termed <hi>Nūber Numbred.</hi> And in our Soule, Nūber bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth such a swaye, and hath such an affinitie therwith: that some of the old <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> taught, <hi>Mans Soule, to be a Number mouyng it selfe.</hi> And in dede, in vs, though it be a very Accident: yet such an Accident it is, that before all Creatures it had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beyng, in the Creator, Sempiternally. <hi>Number Numbryng</hi> therfore, is the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion discerning, and distincting of thinges. But in God the Creator, This discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the beginnyng, produced orderly and distinctly all thinges. For his <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryng,</hi> then, was his Creatyng of all thinges. And his Continuall <hi>Numbryng,</hi> of all thinges, is the Conseruation of them in being: And, where and when he will lacke an <hi>Vnit:</hi> there and then, that particular thyng shalbe <hi>Discreated.</hi> Here I stay.

   <p>Thus haue I lightly passed ouer the Artificiall Feates, chiefly dependyng vpon vulgar <hi>Geometrie:</hi> &amp; commonly and generally reckened vnder the name of <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</hi> But there are other (very many) <hi>Methodicall Artes,</hi> which, declyning from the purity, simplicitie, and Immateriality, of our Principall Science of <hi>Magnitudes:</hi> do yet neuertheles vse the great ayde, direction, and Method of the sayd principall Science, and haue propre names, and distinct: both from the Science of <hi>Geometrie,</hi> (from which they are deriued) and one from the other. As Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiue, Astronomie, Musike, Cosmographie, Astrologie, Statike, Anthropographie, Trochilike, Helicosophie, Pneumatithmie, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadrie, Hypogeiodie, Hydragogie, Horometrie, Zographie, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, Nauigation, Thaumaturgike and Archemastrie. I thinke it necessary, orderly, of these to giue some peculier descriptions: and withall, to touch some of their commodious vses, and so to make this Preface, to be a little swete, pleasant Nosegaye for you: to comfort your Spirites, beyng almost out of courage, and in despayre, (through brutish brute) Weenyng that <hi>Geometrie,</hi> had but serued for buildyng of an house, or a curious bridge, or the roufe of Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster hall, or some witty pretty deuise, or engyn, appropriate to a Carpenter, or a Ioyner &amp;c. That the thing is farre otherwise, then the world, (commonly) to this day, hath demed, by worde and worke, good profe wilbe made.</p>
   <p>Among these Artes, by good reason, Perspectiue ought to be had, ere of <hi>Astronomicall Apparences,</hi> perfect knowledge can be atteyned. And bycause of the prerogatiue of <hi>Light,</hi> beyng the first of <hi>Gods Creatures:</hi> and the eye, the light of our body, and his Sense most mighty, and his organ most Artificiall and <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall:</hi> At <hi>Perspectiue,</hi> we will begyn therfore. Perspectiue, is an Art Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall, which demonstrateth the maner, and properties, of all Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diations Direct, Broken, and Reflected. This Description, or Notation, is brief<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> but it reacheth so farre, as the world is wyde. It concerneth all Creatures, all Actions, and passions, by Emanation of beames perfourmed. Beames, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall lines, (here) I meane, not of light onely, or of colour (though they, to eye, giue shew, witnes, and profe, wherby to ground the Arte vpon) but also of other <hi>Formes,</hi> both <hi>Substantiall,</hi> and <hi>Accidentall,</hi> the certaine and determined actiue Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall em<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

We may be ashamed to be ignorant of the cause, why so sundry wayes our eye is deceiued, and abused: as, while the eye weeneth a roūd Globe or Sphere (beyng farre of) to be a flat and plaine Circle, and so likewise iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb facs="14"/>
a plaine Square, to be roūd: supposeth walles parallels, to approche, a farre of: rofe and floure parallels, the one to bend downward, the other to rise vpward, at a little distance from you. Againe, of thinges being in like swiftnes of mouing, to thinke the nerer, to moue faster: and the farder, much slower. Nay, of two thinges, wherof the one (incomparably) doth moue swifter then the other, to deme the slower to moue very swift, &amp; the other to stand: what an error is this, of our eye? Of the Raynbow, both of his Colours, of the order of the colours, of the bignes of it, the place and heith of it, (&amp;c) to know the causes demonstratiue, is it not pleasant, is it not necessary? of two or three Sonnes appearing: of Blasing Sterres: and such like thinges: by naturall causes, brought to passe, (and yet neuertheles, of farder matter, Significatiue) is it not commodious for man to know the very true cause, &amp; occasion Naturall? Yea, rather, is it not, greatly, against the Souerainty of Mans nature, to be so ouershot and abused, with thinges (at hand) before his eyes? as with a Pecockes tayle, and a Doues necke: or a whole ore, in water, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to seme broken. Thynges, farre of, to seeme nere: and nere, to seme farre of. Small thinges, to seme great: and great, to seme small. One man, to seme an Army. Or a man to be curstly affrayed of his owne shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Yea, so much, to feare, that, if you, being (alone) nere a certaine glasse, and proffer, with dagger or sword, to foyne at the glasse, you shall suddenly be moued to giue backe (in maner) by reason of an Image,<note place="margin">

Straunge, this is, to heare of: but more meruailous to behold, then these my wordes can signifie. And neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse by demonstration Opticall, the order and cause therof, is certified: euen so, as the effect is consequent. Yea, thus much more, dare I take vpon me, toward the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of the noble courrage, that longeth ardently for the wisedome of Causes Naturall: as to let him vnderstand, that, in London, he may wish his owne eyes, haue profe of that, which I haue sayd herein. A Gentleman, (which, for his good seruice,<note place="margin">

Ye may easily gesse, what I meane. This Art of <hi>Perspectiue,</hi> is of that excellency, and may be led, to the certifying, and executing of such thinges, as no man would easily beleue: without Actuall profe perceiued.

Without all preparing of your Fundamentall Cubes: you may (alike) worke this Conclusion. For, that, was rather a kinde of Experimentall demōstration, then the shortest way:
<pb facs="19"/>
and all, vpon one Mathematicall Demonstration depending.
<q>Take water (as much as conueniently will serue your turne: as I warned before of your Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Cubes bignes) Way it precisely. Put that water, into your Pyramis or Cone. Of the same kinde of water, then take againe, the same waight you had before: put that likewise into the Pyramis or Cone. For, in eche time, your mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the lines, how the Water doth cut them, shall geue you the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twen the Radicall sides, of any two Cubes, wherof the one is Double to the other: working as before I haue taught you:<note n="*" place="margin">

      </q>
sauing that for you Fundamentall Cube his Radicall side: here, you may take a right line, at pleasure.</p>
   <p>Yet farther proceding with our droppe of Naturall truth: you may (now) geue Cubes, one to the other, in any proportiō geuē:<note place="margin">

      </note> Rationall or Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationall: on this maner. Make a hollow Parallelipipedon of Copper or Tinne: with one Base wāting, or open: as in our Cubike Coffen. Frō the bottome of that Parallelipipedon, raise vp, many perpendiculars, in euery of his fower sides. Now if any proportion be assigned you, in right lines:
<q>Cut one of your perpendiculars (or a line equall to it, or lesse then it) likewise: by the 10. of the sixth of Euclide. And those two partes, set in two sundry lines of those perpendiculars (or you may set them both, in one line) making their beginninges, to be, at the base: and so their lengthes to extend vpward. Now, set your hollow Parallelipipedon, vpright, perpendicularly, steadie. Poure in water, handsomly, to the heith of your shorter line. Poure that water, into the hollow Pyramis or Cone. Marke the place of the rising. Settle your hollow Parallelipipedon againe. Poure water into it: vnto the heith of the second line, exactly. Poure that water<note n="*" place="margin">
            <hi>Empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first.</hi>

   <p>Thus, in sundry waies you may furnishe your selfe with such straunge and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable matter: which, long hath bene wished for. And though it be Naturally done and Mechanically: yet hath it a good Demonstration Mathematicall.<note place="margin">

For, the most excellent Painter, (who is but the propre Mechanicien, &amp; Imitator sensible, of the Zographer) hath atteined to such perfection, that Sense of Man and beast, haue iudged thinges painted, to be things naturall, and not artificiall: aliue, and not dead. This Mechanicall Zographer (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Painter) is meruailous in his skill: and seemeth to haue a certaine diuine power: As, of frendes absent, to make a frendly, present comfort: yea, and of frendes dead, to giue a continuall, silent presence: not onely with vs, but with our posteritie, for many Ages. And so procedyng, Consider, How, in Winter, he can shew you, the liuely vew of Sommers Ioy, and riches: and in Sommer, exhibite the countenance of Winters dolefull State, and nakednes. Cities, Townes, Fortes, Woodes, Armyes, yea whole Kingdomes (be they neuer so farre, or greate) can he, with ease, bring with him, home (to any mans Iudgement) as Paternes liuely, of the thinges rehearsed. In one little house, can he, enclose (with great pleasure of the beholders,) the portrayture liuely, of all visible Creatures, either on earth, or in the earth, liuing: or in the waters lying, Creping, slyding, or swimming: or of any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap> that he may the more easilie fashion out, in patternes painted, the forme of what worke he liketh. And Geometrie, geueth to Architecture many helpes: and first teacheth the Vse of the Rule, and the Cumpasse: wherby (chiefly and easilie) the descriptions of Buildinges, are despatched in Groundplats: and the directions of Squires, Leuells, and Lines. Likewise, by Perspectiue, the Lightes of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, are well led, in the buildinges: from certaine quarters of the world. By Arithmetike, the charges of Buildinges are summed together: the measures are expressed, and the hard questions of Symmetries, are by Geometricall Meanes and Methods discoursed on. &amp;c. Besides this, of the Nature of thinges (which in Greke is called <gap reason="foreign">

<q>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny could I recite: But I deferre the precise and determined handling of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: being loth to detect the Folly &amp; Mallice of my Natiue Countrey men.<note place="margin">☞</note> Who, so hardly, can disgest or like any extraordinary course of Philosophicall Studies: not falling within the Cumpasse of their Capacitie: or where they are not made priuie of the true and secrete cause, of such wonderfull Philosophicall Feates.</q>
These men, are of fower sortes, chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ly. The first, I may name, <hi>Vaine pratling bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie bodies:</hi> The second, <hi>Fond Frendes:</hi> The third, <hi>Imperfectly zelous:</hi> and the fourth, <hi>Malicious Ignorant.</hi> To eche of these (briefly, and in charitie) I will say a word <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> or two, and so returne to my Praeface. <hi>Vaine pratling busie bodies,</hi> vse your idle assemblies, and conferences, otherwise, then in talke of matter, either aboue your Capacities, for hardnesse: or contrary to your Consciences, in Veritie. <hi>Fonde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Frendes,</hi> leaue of, so to commend your vnacquainted frend, vpon blinde affection: As, because he knoweth more, then the common Student: that, therfore, he must needes be skilfull, and a doer, in such matter and maner, as you terme <hi>Coniuring.</hi> Weening, thereby, you aduaunce his fame: and that you make other men, great marueilers of your hap, to haue such a learned frend. Cease to ascribe Impietie, where you pretend Amitie. For, if your tounges were true, then were that your frend, <hi>Vntrue,</hi> both to God, and his Soueraigne. Such <hi>Frendes</hi> and <hi>Fondlinges,</hi> I shake of, and renounce you: Shake you of, your Folly. <hi>Imperfectly zelous,</hi> to you, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> do I say: that (perhaps) well, do you Meane: But farre you misse the Marke: If a Lambe you will kill, to feede the flocke with his bloud. Sheepe, with Lambes bloud, haue no naturall sustenaunce: No more, is Christes flocke, with horrible slaunders, duely aedified. Nor your faire pretense, by such rashe ragged Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, any whit, well graced. But such, as so vse me, will finde a fowle Cracke in their Credite. Speake that you know: And know, as you ought: Know not, by Heare say, when life lieth in daunger. Search to the quicke, &amp; let Charitie be your guide. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
      <hi>Malicious Ignorant,</hi> what shall I say to thee? <hi>Prohibe linguam tuam a malo. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractione parcite linguae. Cause thy toung to refraine frō euill.

But, much more, ought they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to beware of forging, deuising, and imagining monstrous feates, and wonderfull workes, when and where, no such were done: no, not any sparke or likelihode, of such, as they, without all shame, do report. And (to conclude) most of all, let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> them be ashamed of Man, and afraide of the dreadfull and Iuste Iudge: both Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly or Maliciously to deuise: and then, deuilishly to father their new fond Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters on me: Innocent, in hand and hart: for trespacing either against the lawe of God, or Man, in any my Studies or Exercises, Philosophicall, or Mathematicall: As in due time, I hope, will be more manifest.</p>
   <p>NOw end I, with Archemastrie. Which name, is not so new, as this Arte is rare. For an other Arte, vnder this, a degree (for skill and power) hath bene indued with this English name before. And yet, this, may serue for our purpose, sufficiently, at this present. This Arte, teacheth to bryng to actuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience sensible, all worthy conclusions by all the Artes Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall purposed, &amp; by true Naturall Philosophie concluded: &amp; both addeth to them a farder scope, in the termes of the same Artes, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by hys propre Method, and in peculier termes, procedeth, with helpe of the foresayd Artes, to the performance of complet Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riēces, which of no particular Art, are hable (Formally) to be challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. If you remember, how we considered <hi>Architecture,</hi> in respect of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon handworkes: some light may you haue, therby, to vnderstand the Souerain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and propertie of this Science. <hi>Science</hi> I may call it, rather, then an Arte: for the excellency and Mastershyp it hath, ouer so many, and so mighty Artes and
<pb facs="28"/>
Sciences. And bycause it procedeth by <hi>Experiences,</hi> and searcheth forth the causes of Conclusions, by <hi>Experiences</hi>: and also putteth the Conclusions them selues, in <hi>Experience,</hi> it is named of some, <hi>Scientia Experimentalis.</hi> The <hi>Experimentall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Nicolaus Cusanus</hi> termeth it so, in hys <hi>Experimentes Statikall,</hi> And an other <hi>Philosopher,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>R. B.</hi>
      </note> of this land Natiue (the floure of whose worthy fame, can neuer dye nor wither) did write therof largely, at the request of <hi>Clement the sixt.</hi> The Arte carrieth with it, a wonderfull Credit: By reason, it certefieth, sensibly, fully, and completely to the vtmost power of Nature, and Arte. This Arte, certifieth by <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> complete and absolute: and other Artes, with their Argumentes, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, persuade: and in wordes, proue very well their Conclusions. <note place="margin">☞</note> But wordes, and Argumentes, are no sensible certifying: nor the full and finall frute of Sciences practisable. And though some Artes, haue in them, <hi>Experiences,</hi> yet they are not complete, and brought to the vttermost, they may be stretched vnto, and applyed sensibly. As for example: the Naturall Philosopher disputeth and maketh goodly shew of reason: And the Astronomer, and the Optical Mechanicien, put some thynges in <hi>Experience:</hi> but neither, all, that they may: nor yet sufficiently, and to the vtmost, those, which they do, There, then, the <hi>Archemaster</hi> steppeth in, and leadeth forth on, the <hi>Experiences,</hi> by order of his doctrine <hi>Experimentall,</hi> to the chief and finall power of Naturall and Mathematicall Artes. Of two or three men, in whom, this Description of <hi>Archemastry</hi> was <hi>Experimentally,</hi> verified, I haue read and hard: and good record, is of their such perfection. So that, this Art, is no fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall Imagination: as some Sophister, might, <hi>Cum suis Insolubilibus,</hi> make a slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish: and dassell your Imagination: and dash your honest desire and Courage, from beleuing these thinges, so vnheard of, so meruaylous, &amp; of such Importance. Well: as you will. I haue forewarned you. I haue done the part of a frende: I haue dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my Duety toward God: for my small Talent, at hys most mercyfull handes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. To this Science, doth the <hi>Science Alnirangiat,</hi> great Seruice. Muse nothyng of this name. I chaunge not the name, so vsed, and in Print published by other: beyng a name, propre to the Science. Vnder this, commeth <hi>Ars Sintrillia,</hi> by <hi>Artephius,</hi> briefly written. But the chief Science, of the Archemaster, (in this world) as yet knowen, is an other (as it were) OPTICAL Science: wherof, the name shall be told (God willyng) when I shall haue some, (more iust) occasion, therof, to Discourse.</p>
   <p>Here, I must end, thus abruptly (Gentle frende, and vnfayned louer of honest and necessary verities.) For, they, who haue (for your sake, and vertues cause) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested me, (an old forworne Mathematicien) to take pen in hand: (through the confidence they reposed in my long experience: and tryed sincerity) for the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng and reportyng somewhat, of the frute and commodity, by the Artes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall, to be atteyned vnto: euen they, Sore agaynst their willes, are forced, for sundry causes, to satiffie the workemans request, in endyng forthwith: He, so feareth this, so new an attempt, &amp; so costly: And in matter so slenderly (he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto) among the common Sorte of Studentes, considered or estemed.</p>
   <p>And where I was willed, somewhat to alledge, why, in our vulgare Speche, this part of the Principall Science of <hi>Geometrie,</hi> called <hi>Euclides Geometricall Elementes,</hi> is published, to your handlyng: being vnlatined people, and not Vniuersitie Scholers: Verily, I thinke it nedelesse.</p>
