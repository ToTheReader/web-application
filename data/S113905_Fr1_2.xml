   <p>OF those that separate from the Church of God, there are many sorts: Though the Brownists assume vnto themselves the title of Separation, and call themselves the
<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. Smyth, Differences, Title. Hen. Ainsvv. Defence against Mr. Sm. p. 1.</note> Churches of the Separation, yet is not this title sufficient to distinguish them; Separation being common to so many.</p>
   <p>Of the Brownists also there are sundry sects: Some
<note n="b" place="margin">Christian plea, pa. 216. 217.</note> separate from the Church of England for corruptions; and yet confesse both it &amp; Roome also to be a true Church, as the followers of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Iohnson: Some
<note n="c" place="margin">Iustific. p. 339. 340. 247.</note> renounce the Church of England as a false Church; and yet allow
<note n="d" place="margin">Relig. com. p. 1, etc.</note> private communion with the godly therein, as M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Robinson and his followers: Some
<note n="e" place="margin">Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poy. pag. 197.</note> renounce all Religious communion both publique and private with any member of that Church whosoever, as M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Ainsworth and such as hearken vnto him, being deepest and stiffest in their Schisme. The evil of this separation is great: First, the mindes of many are troubled and distracted hereby; even of such as do not separate, but have some liking thereof; especially if it be true which M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Robinson writes of them, to wit; that they
<note n="f" place="margin">Relig. comm. prefac. *iij.</note> seing it not to be for their purposes, that the world should so esteem of them, do vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly streyn and wring the neck of their consciences and courses, to look the contrary way, &amp;c. VVhat can be more miserable then to have the neckes of consciences thus broken by the doctrine of separation? Secondly, for those that separate but do not yet joyne vnto thē, or being joyned do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from actual communion, living alone and hearing the word of God in no Church, as some do; how great is their miserie also? M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Robinson him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<note n="g" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 36.—39.</note> shewes it at large, noting them to be Idol-members, such as break the commandement of Christ, loose the fruit of his ascension, and fayl their own edification and salvation many wayes, &amp;c. Thirdly, for those that being joyned vnto them do also live with them, seing they have in effect excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate themselves from all other Churches of Christ, and consequently from the fellowship of Christ Iesus himself and from the participation of his grace and glory so far as he reveales the same by dwelling in those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: It is therfore no wonder to heare Mr. Iohnson
<note n="h" place="margin">Treat. on Mat. 18. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac. A. 2.</note> complayning of the evilles among them, as Emulation, debate and other sins which dayly arise &amp; spread themselves to the great dishonour of God, &amp;c. Fourthly, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and greater evilles into which they are given up; it is apparāt that three or four hundred of the Brownists have brought forth more Apostate Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists and Arians sometimes in one yeare then ten thousand members of the Reformed Dutch Church in this citie, have done in ten yeares or more, though tempted and compassed about with seducers as much as any other. And this I may justly witnesse for the time of my abode in this
<note n="%" place="margin">Amsterdā.</note> place, where I have ordinarily bene present in the Classical assemblies, and seene the number of such as have fallen away, so far as is knowne vnto the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters hereof. And many other are the scandalles of this schisme, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them without &amp; against the Reformed Churches whose communion they disclayme. My purpose at this time is to defend the lawfull communiō of that particular congregation, whereof I am a minister: Reason and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion<pb facs="3"/>
      <note n="i" place="margin">1. Thes. 4.11 Act. 20.28. 2 Pet.
5.2.</note> require that we should first look vnto our owne estate, and to the flock that dependeth vpon vs. This controversie being first discussed, I doubt not but the lawfulnes of communion with the Church of England, will in great measure be manifested hereby, and a way prepared for them that are yet in errour to discerne the same. M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Ainsworth in his writings against me doth very often appeale vnto and call for the Iudgement of the Reader; herein I agree with him and do therfore also publish &amp; present these things vnto the view of Christian Readers: and have devided his last writing into Sections, not leaving out (to my knowledge) any one of his words; for their help that would compare things together, and so judge the more perfectly. The God of all grace blesse these weak endevours to the praise of his holy name and comfort of his people. Amen.</p>
