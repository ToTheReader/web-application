   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>IVERS haue hitherto diuersly
reported of this Action &amp; of the
Actors in it, according to their
owne seuerall intelligences attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thereof, and to the humours
they are led by. And albeit the
matter (falling out not many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
since) might seeme to be in
fresh remembrance of many: yet sundry there are which
hitherto know not the very particular dangerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
and outrages, into which these men burst out,
and the most part (I thinke) haue not heard what was the
originall cause of such their discontentment, or the
maine drift and purpose of all their designments, nor of
any the wayes and meanes by them vsed, for furthering
and atchieuing the principall scope they shot at, nor of
any their counsels and cariage of the action, nor yet who
were their complices that were made acquainted with
the matter, in some generall or more speciall termes.</p>
   <p>By want of knowledge of which things, sundry per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
and sinister conceits and misdeemings haue ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
and are blowen abroad amongst the people, which
seeme meete to be abated, and reformed in them.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
For the Papist our common enimie, in some late wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
from beyond the seas, hath (as I am informed) wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
these mens dealings to another end. And sundry at
home, who would seeme more moderate then many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their owne iudgement, yet in fauour of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or (which I iudge rather) vpon liking of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in matter of church-gouernement, haue allowed
their meanings to haue bene good, though they mislike
(somwhat they say) of the maner. Others seek to disguise
the very purposes of these mē, as if that which (in trueth)
was most, had bene least of all entended by them. There
are some also, purposing to extenuate the fault, and to
preuent that so iust a blot may not fall vpon the meanest
fauourer of pretended reformation, who will needs make
them to haue bene starke madde, and such as knew not
what they sayd or did. And there want not certaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
who vnder pretence of pitie and commiseration to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, are sayd not to spare to mutter abroad, that
matters are made worse and of greater consequence and
perill then they be in deed: and that these men with some
others were prosecuted with greater vehemencie and
sharpenesse, then the cause it selfe or qualitie of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
offences might iustly minister occasion.</p>
   <p>All which vntrue surmises and imputations, what doe
they els but apparantly and directly tend vnto the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
deprauation and slaunder of the honorable Iustice of
this realme and state? for assertion and clearing whereof
from such calumniations, and to make manifest also the
very trueth of these matters vnto all that are desirous to
be enformed aright in them: it is thought meete that this
treatise (for good considerations hitherto staied since it
was finished) should now at length be published.</p>
   <p>Whereby I make no doubt, but it will appeare to any
that shall be pleased to peruse it with a single eie, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb facs="3"/>
these causes are to be throughly looked into, for
the weight and danger of them: how honorable the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in them haue bene for maner: and how excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
milde and mercifull a course hath bene holden by
the state, not onely with some of the chiefe dealers, but
also with sundry others notable concurrents in the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who though they be sufficiently well knowen, yet hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
haue not bene so much as called into question:
howe farre soeuer (perhaps) they may seeme vnto some
(not vnwise) to haue waded therein, or to haue entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
intelligence of it, both dangerously and vndutifully.
So farre is her excellent Maiestie, and the whole state
from aggrauating mens offences, yea, and from taking
aduantage, euen when most iust occasion (sometimes) is
offered.</p>
   <p>I pray God this notable rare clemencie, may be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
answered (by those who both in this &amp; other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
stande not a litle neede of it, howe litle soeuer
they acknowledge it) with that measure of
dutifull remembrance and thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
which it woorthely deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
at their handes. 
Amen.</p>
