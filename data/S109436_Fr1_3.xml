                 <title>Tobacco tortured, or, The filthie fume of tobacco refined : shewing all sorts of subiects, that the inward taking of tobacco fumes, is very pernicious vnto their bodies; too too profluuious for many of their purses; and most pestiferous to the publike state. Exemplified apparently by most fearefull effects: more especially, from their treacherous proiects about the Gun-powder Treason; from their rebellious attempts of late, about their preposterous disparking of certaine inclosures: as also, from sundry other their prodigious practices</title>

   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER, grace in Christ, with an holy discerning spirit. So be it.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, if thou wilt more seriously bend thy best thoughts awhile towards some serious consideration concerning thine accustomed inward taking of filthie <hi>Tobacco fumes,</hi> it may be thy good hap (by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful goodnesse of our gracious God) to haue thereby thy fantasticall mind enlightened about a foule fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie error; thy crazie corps disburdened of many pestiferous humours, and thy prodigall purse more might<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ly priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from those sundry proflunious expences, wherewith (by tampering too boldly with filthie <hi>Tobacco fumes,</hi> as also, by conuersing too commonly with carousing companions, and other like chargeable courses attending hourely thereon) the same hath eftsoones bene shrewdly surprised, and (in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) most clearely euacuated.</p>
   <p>The true and timely apprehension of these three such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and present auailes, succeeding these Paganish and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish practises, may make thee in time (by the great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God) to veile thy bonnet for publike good: and herein withall, to become forthwith a Merchant Venturer, by aduenturing boldly vpon the seasonable venting forth of this late inuention, for the publike aduantage of whatsoeuer our trifling <hi>Tobacconists</hi>; vnlesse haply, those their vapouring euacuations (very chymically extracted from the fennish fumes of their filthie <hi>Tobacco)</hi> haue now too too fearefully ouerwhelmed their blindfold braines with such foggie fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalling mists, as do dangerously suppresse the senses them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
<pb facs="9"/>
and too too sottishly surprise the sway of sound reason.</p>
   <p>Although notwithstanding, I am in no doubt at all, but that thou thine owne selfe (hauing once in an approued ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, very sensibly apprehended the exceeding great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of this present Discourse for publike good) wilt forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hold for an infallible Axiome, that <note n="a" place="margin">

            </gap>.</hi>
      </note> A publike good, the more common it is, the better it is. And thereupon, as my selfe haue eftsoones bene moued by others, and now resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in my selfe, to communicate these my priuate thoughts to each particular person for publike good: so thou thine owne selfe, and all the rest of that reasonable sort (participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all ioyntly together with the publike profite thereof,) will all ioyntly together extoll the infallible wisdome of that onely approued Physition for bodie and soule, who hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way made vs so sufficiently and so Christianly wise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the vndoubted safetie of body and soule: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, will ioyntly and heartily pray for the healthfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of such, and so many as seeke (by any their sacred skils) to cause euery of vs so foundly to conceiue (though somewhat too late) the vnsoundnesse of al those the vnsound and sottish conceipts which haue hitherto haled men head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long an end, to the vntimely taking of filthie <hi>Tobacco fumes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If thy mind be still in a mammering doubt▪ whether the venimous condition of these poysonsome <hi>fumes</hi> be so pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous as this present Discourse doth seeme to purport, then turne thy present thoughts (I pray thee) towards the vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deaths of sundry such excellent personages as (tampering too much therewith) haue (euen now of late) not onely bene sodainly surprised by an vnnaturall death, but (which more is) their dead bodies being opened, had all their entrails as blacke as a coale, and the very fat in their bodies resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling (in all outward appearance) the perfect colour of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, or reesed bacon: whose names notwithstanding, I do here purposely conceale, for the very reuerence it selfe
<pb facs="10"/>
which I formerly bare to their persons and places.</p>
   <p>If notwithstanding all this, thou wilt not (as yet) bee brought vnto a present dislike of those the said <hi>fumes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, then turne thy serious and timely considerations to those fearefull effects, which (not long since) afforded their vntimely and terrible attendance towards those our disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and turbulent <hi>Tobacconists</hi> of former times. Who (for very loue of their <hi>Tobacco</hi> trafficke, and other disordered courses) neither spared their persons, nor purses, but wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoyled and consumed them both: to the manifest wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of many other besides, the publike contempt of good positiues lawes, the wilfull breach of his Maiesties peace, the rebellious resisting of his martiall power, with the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full spilling of their owne, and other mens bloud.</p>
   <p>Let no partiall affections (good Christian Reader) so far forth miscarrie, nor so violently inueagle thine vnsetled and wauering mind, as that thou shouldest once dare to applaud the disordered courses, and intemperate actions of any such barbarous Cannibals as do causelesly conspire, and preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously pretend to bring in a confused paritie throughout the whole State. With very base and most beastly degenerate minds are those monstrous Minotaures bewitched, no doubt, who may (by no meanes) be brought to endure, or to broke the renowmed estates of the Nobilitie, or Gentrie in any their countrey coasts: neither yet to like long of any his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties fauourites, whom the Almightie himselfe (for the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of sundrie their singular vertues) aduanceth to a timely honour. Howbeit, very true is the saying it selfe, and the truth thereof made too too apparent in such disordered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: namely, that <note n="b" place="margin">
         <hi>Res. rationis expers est ipsa improbitas.</hi>
      </note> Dishonestie it selfe is a thing euen vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destitute of all sense and reason.</p>
   <p>Well (whatsoeuer may be the successe with some others) I doubt not at all, but that these my poore labours for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good, will (from henceforth) make me as deepely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed in some other mens labours of like interchangeable trafficke: more especially, of those well minded persons who
<pb facs="10"/>
now begin to perceiue what present profite may eftsoones arise from this my lately erected new Mart for publike good. On the other side, if any idle, or odly conceited companions (at the vnexpected pitching vp of these my approued booth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes for publike good) do ouer pecuishly fall into sustian fumes, because these their filthie <hi>Tobacco fumes</hi> are thus so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly enforced to render a most filthie redolent smell in the very nostrils of such &amp; so many as are but competently furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with a sound and setled iudgment: yet vndoubtedly, the integritie and vprightnesse of mine honest plaine heart here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, will be sufficiently able (I hope) to mannage most stoutly mine authenticall intent for publike good, against all the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erie thunder-cracks of those our fuming <hi>Tobacconists,</hi> whose trifling courses do nothing else but breede the publike bane of our peace and prosperitie. And howsoeuer some malcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented <hi>Tobacconists,</hi> (of a very malicious spite) may couertly endeauour to kindle their fierie tongues (as it were with <note n="c" place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 120.4.</note>
      <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper coales</hi>) against either my person, or published Treatise, I doubt not yet, but as the integritie of mine honest intent for publike good, may sufficiently shelter my person for dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling herein: so am I strongly perswaded, that, that selfe same publike authoritie which so frankly affordeth free passage (with priuiledge) to this my published Discourse for like pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good, at the very first sparkling forth of those our <hi>Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conists</hi> fire-flashes (how fierce, and how flaming soeuer) will be authentically able, either to cause their turbulent rage to recoyle forthwith vpon their owne pates; or to besmeare their persons at least, with that odde satyricall Adage which termeth those our testie <hi>Tobacconists</hi>

      <hi>Thericleiou philos,</hi> that is in English, A fantasticall fauourite and follower of cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companions. Howsoeuer, the better sort (I am sure) will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily entertaine my good meaning herein, with that honest affection and Christian mind which is euermore accustomed to construe such a subiect as this, in the best and honestest sense: and therefore (leauing the successe whatsoeuer to the orderly disposing of the onely wise God) I will now
<pb facs="11"/>
shew thee forthwith my whole purpose and order herein.</p>
   <p>First, I haue propounded (as thou seest) the whole in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue manner, for the plainer demonstration of the matter it selfe, making <hi>Capnistus,</hi> and <hi>Hydrophorus</hi> the onely speakers therein. The first (that is <hi>Capnistus,</hi> signifying a fierie perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med fellow) resembleth our smokie and fumish <hi>Tobacconists:</hi> the other (<hi>Hydrophorus</hi> I meane, betokening a water-bearer) correspondently represents all such sound hearted subiects as are very well able (by the sway of sound reason, as it were with cold water) to quench the intemperate fierie flames of all our fuming <hi>Tobacconists.</hi> Hauing thus acquainted thee with my whole purpose and order herein, let vs now forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with proceede to the orderly prosecution thereof. Besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the almightie Iehouah to bestow that blessing vpon it, which may tend to the euerlasting glory of his most glorious name; the good of our Church and the common wealth; and our owne eternall comforts in Iesus Christ: So be it, euen so, Amen.</p>
