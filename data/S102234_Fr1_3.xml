   <head>OF THE PRAISE,
Vertue, and Efficacie of the
PSALMES.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Kingly Prophet Dauid,</hi> Psal. 47. 6. saith; O sing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
sing praises vnto our God, O sing praises, sing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
vnto our King: Sing praises with vnderstanding.
Againe, Psal. 95. 2. Let vs shew our selues glad in
him with Psalmes. And good reason haue we to sing
chearefully vnto God, for the Angels ioyne their presence &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation
with the singers deuotion, as the same Psalmist singeth,
Psal. 138. <hi>In conspectu angelorum psallam tibi;</hi> Euen before the Gods
will I sing praise vnto thee: Wherefore we ought diligently to take
heed, that by ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> idlenesse, negligence, and want of practise, wee
cause not the <hi>Angels</hi> to depart from vs. And indeed there is no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
man which can expresse in words, or conceiue in thought, the
vertues of the Psalmes, and the praises of the Lord, if with a pure
and serious attention of the heart they shall be performed as they
ought to be.</p>
   <p>In the Psalmes, are described the rewards of good, the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of euil men, the rudiments of beginners, the progresse of
proficients, and consummation of perfect men:</p>
   <p>The singing of Psalmes (as say the Doctors) comforteth the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull,
pacifieth the angry, strengtheneth the weake, humbleth
the proud, gladdeth the humble, stirres vp the flow, reconcileth
enemies, lifteth vp the heart to heauenly things, and vniteth the
Creature to his Creator, for whatsoeuer is in the Psalmes, condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
to the edification, benefit, and consolation of mankinde.</p>
   <p>Wouldst thou make a confession, and repent thee of thy sinnes?
Then sing with remorse and humility the seauen penitential Psalms
<pb facs="4"/>
of <hi>David,</hi> and thou shalt feele the sweet mercy of God and thy
minde refreshed with spirituall ioy.</p>
   <p>Wouldst thou pray? Then poure forth thy soule in the Psalmes
25. 54. 67. 70▪ 72. 86. 143. For the soule of man cannot either
feelingly expresse his misery, tribulation and anguish of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or more powerfully call vpon the mercy of God, then in these
Psalmes.</p>
   <p>Wouldst thou praise the Maiestie of God, or giue him thankes
for all his benefits? then sing the 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108,
111, 113, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150.</p>
   <p>If thou be so farre afflicted with outward and inward temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that thou seemest to be forsaken, then sing heartily the 22. 64.
69. Psalmes.</p>
   <p>If this present life be tedious vnto thee, and that with an ardent
desire thou waitest to see God, then sing the 42, 63, 84. Psalmes.</p>
   <p>If thou finde thy selfe quite deiected, and as it were forlorne in
trouble, then with compunction of heart sing the 13, 31, 44, 54, 56.
Psalmes, and when thou hast found ease and rest vnto thy soule,
O sing to the praise of God, the 30, 34, 103, 104. Psalmes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
whether in the time of aduersity, or prosperity, sing out the
song of the three Children, wherein euery creature is inuited to
praise God.</p>
   <p>But dost thou desire to exercise thy selfe in the diuine praises and
precepts of the Lord? Content thy selfe then and sing the 119.
Psalme, wherein although euen to the end of thy life thou shalt haue
sought and searcht all that thou canst, yet shalt thou neuer perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnderstand the vertues &amp; excellencies, or reach vnto the heights
and depths which are comprehended in it: for hardly is there a
verse in that whole Psalme wherein is not mention made of Gods
Law, Commandements, Testimonies and Precepts.</p>
   <p>In a word, he that would giue these heauenly Hymnes their due,
had need to compose a Psalme in praise of the Psalmes, that so the
deuout and ioyfull soule might with looking vp vnto God, reflect
vpon its own worke, and transport it selfe vnto the quire of Angels
and Saints, whose perpetuall taske is to sing their concording parts
without pause, redoubling and descanting; <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord
God of Hosts.</hi> And if Vocall Musicke be not full enough, let the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall
be added, <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 15. 2. They haue in their hands the
Harps of God, &amp; sing the song of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the song of the Lambe,
saying, <hi>Great and meruai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>us are thy workes Lord God Almighty.</hi>
Amen.</p>
