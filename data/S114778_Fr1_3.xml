      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OV are not ignorant, Christian Reader, that the hatred of the Synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath been a long time very deadly and open against the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church, and that it hath been secret against the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and couered ouer, with a shadow of outward Religion, and a vayle of deuotion. For although shee be much moued with the enuy at our florishing Church, and with the iniurie of her owne beauty so despised; yet because shee feeleth hirselfe so wounded in her head with a weapon from heauen, cast by the hand of man, shee is no lesse angry with God, that gaue the weapon, than with man that cast it.

      <hi>a new Creede.</hi> But shee was displeased
<pb facs="9"/> with the foure Euangelists, because they passed by their Pope as a vnknowne man. And therefore she created a fift Euangelist, who by the helpe of the Monkes might coyne a fift Gospell fitter for their purpose than the other. They deemed the true <hi>Iesus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Marie,</hi> crucified by Gods decree vpon Mount Calua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the saluation of men, to be but halfe a Sauiour. Therefore they deuised <hi>Francis, Peter Barnardons sonne,</hi> as if hee had beene pierced with the same wounds of Christ, and in the same parts, and consecrated him in the Laterane Councell to be the <hi>Typicall Iesus.</hi> Shee thought the twelue articles of the faith, gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by Christs 12. Apostles, not to be sufficient for saluation. And therefore published twelue new arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the faith composed in the Councell of Trent, and brought by <hi>Pope Pius the fourth,</hi> into the forme of a Creede, <hi>Paul the fift</hi> being the furtherer of it. O holy mother the Church, but ô father far more holy. In the meane time she preached <hi>Christs</hi> great loue &amp; bounty toward the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Popes</hi> reuerence and obsequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes toward <hi>Christ.</hi> But seing <hi>Babylon</hi> that old whore had learned to trimme and paint hir-selfe, but to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble her inward affections, and cunningly to cloake her hatred with loue, and her loue with hatred, euery wise-man is to forecast, being taught by former hurt and mischiefe, not any more what shee doth pretend, but what shee doth intend. Shee knoweth that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a reuealer of her idolatrie, luxurie, couetousnes, pride and crueltie. Shee fretts and chafes that no por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of honour and gouernment, but of labour and paines is allotted vnto the Pope by Christ his Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Shee is greeued at the heart that shee is foretold by the Apostles to be mysticall <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Pope to be <hi>that Antichrist.</hi> Shee abhorres the Scripture as a theefe doth the gallowes; shee despiseth the Apostles as her accusers; shee hates Christ as her Iudge, but with a secret hatred; as shee loueth Antichrist with a secret
<pb facs="9"/> loue, whose enemie shee doth earnestly counterfeit hir-selfe to be, that shee may seeme to be at familiar en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie with him. So shee doth counterfeit hirselfe to be a most dutifull worshipper of the Scripture, as of the former Councells: and doth often alledge it as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell doth, turned to a contrary sense, and doth alledge it but as a falsifier fraudulently corrupted: and shee is inwardly vext, that such a blow is giuen to her head by the Scriptures, not as they be expounded by vs, but as they be vnderstood by those Synodes. But shee takes nothing more greeuously then that in the supremacie of her iurisdiction, .i. in the chiefe article of her pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like religion, that two of their chiefest founders, as shee calls them, be so silent witnesses in this cause <hi>S. Peter,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Pet: 5.</note> &amp; <hi>S. Paul. S. Peter</hi> who did plainly forbid superioritie to any one Priest ouer the Clergie: &amp; styled himself most truly &amp; most humbly not an Arch-priest, but a fellow-priest: <hi>S. Paul</hi> who when of purpose he sent an Epistle to the Romanes, made no mention at all of the Pope and the prerogatiue of the Church of Rome, nor of the after-borne articles of the faith, which shee in great plenty brought in afterward. And when as of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he had reasoned of the perpetuall gouernment of the militant Church, and had gathered together many vnities; one God, one faith, one spirit, one body, one Lord, hee ouer-past one visible head,<note place="margin">Ephes: 4.</note> being forgetfull of their <hi>Peter.</hi> And no maruell, when as <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was forgetfull of himselfe. He did rather diuide the gouernment of the Church among all the Bishops, and would rather haue it an Aristocraticall gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with many vnder Christ, than Monarchicall vnder one: as the practise of the Church next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing for many ages did approue. For that the fiue Patriarches had equall authoritie, both <hi>Balsamon</hi> doth witnes, and the Councell of <hi>Neece</hi> doth confirme. And <hi>Francis Duarene</hi> writes, that <hi>Boniface the third,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Francis: Duar. de sacris benef: lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap: <hi>10.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>not before the</hi> 607. <hi>yeares, not without much adoe could obtayne of
<pb facs="10"/> Phocas to be created the vniuersall Bishop.</hi> The Pope then is indebted to a King-killer for all the glory of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and yet he seemeth to giue thanks to Christ, as if by his word, <hi>Feede my sheepe,</hi> hee had ordeyned the Bishops of Rome in Peter, as he writes himselfe, a fellow-minister, to be Kings so many ages before they were borne.<note place="margin">Cic. ad Petū ep: <hi>9.</hi>

            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>: <hi>8.</hi>
      </note> As <hi>Cicero</hi> when as a false decree of the Senate, was brought into Armenia and Siria as made against his minde, writes that thanks were giuen him from foraigne Kings, because he had named them to be Kings by his consent, whom he knew not that they were not onely named, but not so much as to bee borne. But the Nicene Councell doth greatly discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Romane Bishop, whom he maketh but equall to the Bishop of Alexandria. For therefore the Bishop had corrupted that Canon, which had restreyned the supremacie of the Bishop of Rome, nor being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content, did adde many yeares after fifty false Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons to twentie true of the Nicene Councell, that hee might make the whole world beleeue, that his supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie which was apparantly shortned by the Nycene Fathers being aliue, were enlarged by them being dead. As the same <hi>Cicero</hi> doth pleasantly sport himselfe with <hi>Antonie,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Philip: 1.</note> when as he had published certaine false decrees of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that the Citizens that were sent into banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him aliue, should be recalled being dead: and that the Citie that was denyed them of him aliue, should be granted being dead: and that many immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and priuiledges that were taken of him being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, should bee sold of him being dead: by which meanes <hi>Antonie</hi> did affect both an infinite and hurtfull power. So the <hi>Pope</hi> doth publish many acts as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from Christ, as from the Apostles, as from the Nicene Fathers, whereby hee doth vsurpe most proud and cruell gouernment in the Church. And he fetcheth them from the dead, for they were neuer made by them when they were aliue. In like manner hee brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb facs="10"/> in the Chalcedon Fathers being dead,<note place="margin">Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>up: of a Can: of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon.</note> denying that which they affirmed when they were aliue. Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, say the Fathers of Chalcedon, <hi>that the See of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople in matters Ecclesiasticall bee as well aduanced in matters ecclesiasticall as the Romane, being the next vnto it.</hi> Which words are falsly recited,<note place="margin">Distinct: <hi>22.</hi> Renovantes.</note> or rather filthily corrupted in the Canon Law; while he addeth a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to the last words, which altereth the sense of the whole Canon into a cleane contrary: <hi>yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding let it not be aduanced in matters ecclesiasticall as shee, but let her be the next vnto it.</hi> What should I make many words? The first six generall Councells, which may be thought to haue best of all knowne Christs minde, and to deliuer it most faithfully about the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Church, although they granted a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of order, and difference to the Bishop of Rome; yet they denyed him a supremacie of power and iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: and according to the sixt Canon of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Councell hembde in the See of Rome into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine limits, wherein being included shee should not breake forth. Yet for all that they brake ouer the bounds set downe both by God and Men. God that he might punish the contempt of the Gospell, brought so grieuous a sluggishnes vpon the world, and so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall an apostacie vpon the Church, that the time it selfe laying vp and hiding all meanes of helpe, did not only bring to light the bramble formerly hid in the ground, but brought it abroad, and set it aloft, and placed it aboue all the Cedars of Libanus: First, aboue Bishops in <hi>Boniface the third:</hi> after aboue Kings and Emperors in <hi>Gregorie the</hi> 7, whose wings being so often clipt by foure Councells, <hi>Wormes, Papta, Brixis and Montze,</hi> grew againe in the successors so farre that they flew at the last aboue <hi>Councells.</hi> Till the three generall <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells</hi> of <hi>Pisa, Constance,</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Constant: Con: Sess: <hi>1.</hi>
      </note> did not only displace <hi>Popes</hi> out of the <hi>Popedome,</hi> but decreed that Councels were aboue the Popes. For the <hi>Pisan Councell</hi> did cast
<pb facs="11"/> two Popes <hi>Gregorie</hi> and <hi>Benett</hi> out of their seats; and choose <hi>Alexander the fift.</hi> And the Councell of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> assembled by the summons of <hi>Iohn the</hi> 23. for refusing their tryall, and for his abominable symonie, and wicked life and manners, depriued him of his Popedome,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Sess:</hi> 10 <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. <hi>Sess:</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.</note> and after condemned <hi>Gregorie the</hi> twelfth not appearing, and cut him of as a withered member, and an incorrigible heretike and schismatike as they plainly termed him. And that it may seeme not to haue dealt rashly, <hi>This holy generall Synode,</hi> say they, <hi>lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, and representing the Church militant, hath immediate power from Christ (not from the Pope but from Christ) whose power any whosoeuer, of what estate and condition soeuer, euen the Pope himselfe is bound to obey. And farther declareth, if the Pope do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately refuse to obey the statutes, ordinances, and iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which either this holy Synode, or any other, hereafter ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Synode lawfully assembled, either now haue or hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shall decree, that he is to be constreyned to a condigne sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and worthily to be punished:</hi> and so <hi>Iohn the</hi> 23. being deposed and cast out, it choose <hi>Martin the fift</hi> for <hi>Pope.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Councell</hi> did long contend about the maioritie and superioritie as they terme it: but the <hi>Councell</hi> had the vpper hand. Here comes to my minde a certaine tale, not vnpleasant, of the spawne of a frog, which a Calfe had troden vpon in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Damme, which Calfe when one escaping from the rest, had described to the frogge his damme to bee a great beast; how bigge I pray said shee, and (puffing out hir selfe) thus bigge? greater by the half said the young one:<note place="margin">Horaec. Sermo: <hi>2</hi> Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>y: <hi>2.</hi>
      </note> what by so much, said the Frog, when shee had blowne vp hir-selfe more and more? not if you breake your selfe, said he, can you be equall to it.</p>
   <p>The Councell of Constance with her foote trode vpon two frogs, though they would haue fled from tryall, and declared it selfe to be greater and higher than
<pb facs="11"/> the <hi>Pope</hi> though he sweld neuer so bigge. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell had done well, if it had not crusht in peeces two Doues; and had not decreed that cuppe which Christ for diuers causes had commanded in his supper should bee giuen to the people, for moe and more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty causes, as they say, was to bee taken from them. Which the Councell of Basill did restore afterward,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Sess:</hi> 13.</note> being assembled by <hi>Martin the fifts Bull,</hi> and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the letters of <hi>Eugenius the</hi> 4. whom shee depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and being ratified by the Bull of <hi>Nicholas the fift,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Eugenius,</hi> declared the decree of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> about the power of the generall <hi>Councell</hi> against the <hi>Pope</hi> to be a truth of the catholike faith,<note place="margin">Basil: Con: Sess: <hi>16.</hi>
      </note> and adiudged him an heretike that did obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resist the two former truths.</p>
   <p>Therefore let the <hi>Pope</hi> either submit himselfe vnder the generall Councell, or by the iudgement of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell he must needs confesse himselfe to be an heretike. Hence is all their griefe, and their secret quarrell against the Scriptures, and the former Synods, and the latter also, (though they somwhat fauoured the Romish superstition) because they did represse her am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. Till at the last two other Councells, the Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane and the Tridentine, did lift vp the <hi>Pope,</hi> not onely aboue all Councells, but aboue all Scriptures, that hee at his pleasure might <hi>put out the Crowes eyes,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is, and as if hee were the 13 Apostle, set forth a doctrine at his owne liking contrary to the Scripture. After this sort after many ages, and dangers, the <hi>Pope</hi> got place aboue Bishops, Kings, Councels, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themselues.</p>
   <p>So great a worke it was to build the Romish seate.</p>
   <p>The very naked name whereof is opposed against all our encounters, as it were <hi>Gorgons head.</hi> Do we alledge the Fathers? what maruell is it, if when he perceiueth they stand against him, hee reiects them in seuerall, when hee contemnes them all in generall? Do we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="12"/> Councels? The former are corrected by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the better by the worse, and the more by the fewer. Do we alledge the Scriptures? what good do we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, when we haue a <hi>Sphinx</hi> at home, who can lay open the Scripture as it were a riddle according to his owne sense and his best auaile. Thus they reduce all things at the last to the mother the Church, or rather to the father of the Church. For they make the mother to be of the masculine gender, and bring the most generall generall, to one that is singular, that is, to the <hi>Pope</hi> for the time ruling. With whose spirit that Synagogue being filled, it seemeth closely to be offended with none of the Apostles more than with <hi>S. Paul:</hi> by whose silence, shee taks her selfe not only not to be assisted, but to be hurt by his testimonie, when as the merit of workes being abandoned, hee concludeth the onely mercy of God in Christ being apprehended by faith, to be mans iustice before God. Which conclusion doth ouerthrow all Poperie, as it shall afterward appeare. It doth plague the Synagogue: for it toucheth two things to the quicke, the Bishops miter, and the Monkes bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: for faith being placed in the only merits of Christ, hath diminished the Indulgences, the treasure of the Church, and makes the offrings to images to be more rare and sparing. So that the Synagogue, doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time as well closely accuse <hi>S. Paul</hi> of heresie, as <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin.</hi> I once heard two old popish Doctors, one of them a Fryer <hi>Ieronimite in Portugall,</hi> another a <hi>Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine in France</hi> say, when they were prest with <hi>Pauls</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, one of them <hi>that S. Peter without doubt was a Catholike, but Paul if he be not warily expounded seemes to smell of heresie.</hi> Thother, <hi>that places out of Paul, by the testimonie of Peter, were hard to be vnderstood, and had need of a Romish Commentarie;</hi> Peter I said made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hardnes, but not of the commentarie. In whose Epistle say they, <hi>whatsoeuer soundeth against the Romane faith therein wee do not attaine to the true sense,
<pb facs="12"/> that which the Rhemists haue obserued.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rhem: testam argument: epist: in gene.</note> For he in the first chapter (say the Fryers) <hi>did commend the faith of the Church of Rome, whereto Cyprian denieth that vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes can haue accesse.</hi> But in the 11. chapter, I say,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Epist:</hi> 50.</note> he warned the same Church, that if it departed from the bountifulnesse of God, it should take heed lest as the Church of Israel was cut off, so shee were not cut off also. It may therefore be cut off be it spoken by <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> leaue. For it is in act cut off, when it is fallen from that foundation, which is placed in the only mercy of Christ, apprehended by faith. That faith therefore of the Church which <hi>Paul the Apostle</hi> so much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and taught by his writings is one: and the faith of this Church which <hi>Paul the Pope</hi> hath left so defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his vnwritten traditions is another. And yet shee glorieth much, as I said, that <hi>Paul</hi> is hir founder; I had rather they would vse him as an author. But she will neuer doe it. Shee maketh more accompt of <hi>Pauls Bulls,</hi> than <hi>Paules Epistles:</hi> which the ancient Fathers did rightly tearme the key of the Scripture. Which most of the popish sort do so feare, that they cannot reconcile <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>S. Iames</hi> together, but oppose them one against thother,<note place="margin">The reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James.</hi>
      </note> as if <hi>Iames the Apostle had concluded that a man is iustified by his workes before God, not with faith alone, against the Apostle Paul;</hi> when as <hi>Paul</hi> doth not vnderstand the same faith and the same iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which <hi>Iames</hi> doth. For hee requireth faith placed in the heart: this reiecteth faith bragged on in the tongue. Hee requireth a liuely faith, this reiecteth a dead faith. Hee doth enforce a heauenly faith, which layeth hold on the promise: this casteth of a diuelish faith, which doth onely acknowledge Christs historie without application: hee doth commend and extoll fruitfull faith working by loue: this doth rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne a barraine faith voide of the duty of holinesse: he doth set forth the iustification before God, which <hi>Aquinas</hi> calleth the righteousnes of imputation, <hi>Iames</hi>
      <pb facs="13"/> the iustification before men, whom the same <hi>Aquinas</hi> calleth the righteousnesse of declaration. <hi>Moses,</hi> from whom either Apostle drew his testimonie, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ech, and doth take vp the controuersie, begun by the Aduersarie. The imputation of righteousnesse, whereof <hi>Moses</hi> maketh mention Gen: 15.6. went thirty yeares before that worke, for which they dreame that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iustified before God. Which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of time <hi>Paul</hi> most earnestly weighing, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that faith was imputed to <hi>Abraham</hi> to obtaine righteousnesse before God 15 yeares, as <hi>Moses</hi> noteth, before hee begat <hi>Isaac,</hi> and other 15 yeares at the least before he would haue sacrificed him.</p>
   <p>They know not well how to loose themselues out of this indissoluble knot, whosoeuer thinke that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes was imputed to <hi>Abraham</hi> before God, because he killed his sonne who was not as yet borne, when as the Holy Ghost doth pronounce him to be righteous: which <hi>S. Iames</hi> himselfe v: 23 seemeth to vnderstand, as <hi>Oecumenius</hi> gathereth out of the place. that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was the image of iustification, which is wrought by faith alone, when it was imputed to him for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">ver: 23. ver: 21.</note> that he beleeued: and of that iustification also which is by workes, when hee would haue offred his sonne <hi>Isaac</hi> vpon the Altar. Therefore faith did make perfect the person of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the worke did iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the faith, and declare ech to be perfect. Is this a fight? is this an opposition? especially betweene two holy Apostles, who writ their Epistles with the instinct of the same spirit. But no one thing doth more neerly gaule the Synagogue, then that <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle by the direction of the spirit, writ the commentarie of the mysterie,<note place="margin">Apoc: 9. 2 Thess: 2. 1 Tim: 4.1.</note> which <hi>S.

      <note n="q" place="margin">Gal. lib. <hi>2.</hi> de sanitate tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enda.</note> Galen <hi>writeth that the cause of many diseases in the body as hereditarie proceedes from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt seede, and from putrified nourishment. The disease of the soule is hereditarie, from corrupt seede</hi> as Iob saith, <hi>which is encreased by custome of sinning, as with impure nourishment. Now as the diseases of the bodies are cured by contraries, so the diseases of soules: which God being</hi>

      <hi>dead begetteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by immortall seede, being againe begotten feedeth them with pure nourishment, being sicke &amp; diseased healeth them with holesome medicines, that is with the pure word of God, who is to be accounted the true Father, Pastor and Phisition of the soule. Yet he vseth men to that purpose as instruments, whom he sendeth and moueth, that first they preach forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and absolution from all their sinnes promised freely by faith in Christ to the penitent: and after enioyne two things to him that is forgiuen; One, that he pay backe againe the dutie of holinesse to the blessed trinitie alone, for so vnspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a blessing of saluation; The other, that he afford all the helpe of charity to man for Gods sake, being the liuely Image of God: setting before the obedient at the last inward peace vpon the earth, and an eternall inheritance in the heauens. So the men of God doe raise vp a man that is sorrowfull with the promise, direct a man that goeth astray with the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, comfort him that is fainting with the reward: but the men of God doe speake outwardly, the spirit of God doth worke inwardly.

      <note n="y" place="margin">Greg. Nyss. de orat. Dom. Serm <hi>5.</hi>
      </note> as Gregorie Nyssen teacheth. <hi>The resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring then of the image blotted out, is the rising againe of man being dead. This is the nature, this is the disposition of the Apostles doctrine: it doth depresse man, that it may extoll God: it doth cast off corrupt nature, that it may bring in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace. A man therefore must liue in God, yea farther by God, before he can either will, or thinke any good; a meere passiue subiect of grace at the first, while being as it were made warme by the spirit of Christ, hee beginneth to will his owne conuersion, and is made a voluntarie instrument of grace, by no imbred or infused force of the will, but by the
<pb facs="15"/> power of the seede of grace, and of the new life which hee had from God. Paul doth thus distinguish betweene a man to be converted, and converted. He maketh him to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the seruant of sinne, because he is ouercome of sinne; this free in part, because he is made free by the Sonne: not appointing him free in part, lest he make him sacrilegious, nor this altogether a seruant, lest he might make him sluggish. He doth not therefore take from the vnregenerate, all power of willing, but all power of well-willing, that he may not lift vp the crest of his naturall pride; and he granteth to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate some power of well-willing, that he may not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the strength of spirituall diligence.

A sinner therefore dead in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, liueth righteous in Christ, and liueth not to himselfe, but to God: but yet so liueth, that he feeleth in himselfe the fight of the spirit and the flesh, which the Apostle acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not onely in other Christians, but in himselfe, for the comfort of others:</hi> I do not that good I will, <hi>saith the Apostle,</hi> but the euill I would not that I do: <hi>which a bad man, did not badly expresse:</hi>
      <q>
         <l>I hate and what I hate, against my will must be,</l>
         <l>What I would cast away, to beare is greife to me.</l>
      </q>
      <hi>But that the Apostle speaketh of the motions of concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, whereto the will doth not consent, this of the beastly affections, whereto the will is wholy addicted. Which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding by the working of the naturall conscience, hee saith he hateth. But assoone as a man begins to liue in God, sinne begins to dye in man. For it hath receiued a deadly wound in the roote in respect of guiltinesse: while it be cured by perfect buriall it remaines dead, not cut off, that we may be humbled; not imputed, lest we should be cast downe. Sin dwelleth in vs as a Iebusite subdued, not expelled; subdued, it taketh feare from vs; not expelled, it shakes off securitie, that to striue with it, it is farre more safe, than to haue no enemie at all. In this fight Gods grace doth helpe vs, strengthning vs with a double sacrament: of Baptisme, and the Lords Supper: there the fountaine of regeneration is
<pb facs="16"/> powred out, here the bread of life is set before vs: there is a healthfull bathe to wash vs when we are fowle, here is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall feast to feede vs when we were faint: so that from each we may take strength to resist. So the power of God is made perfect in our infirmitie, which when out of our owne skarres it stirreth vp in vs a courage to fight, so from helpe ministred from thence it puts into vs sure hope that we shall ouercome. For it bringeth griefe out of the fall for sinne, and stirreth vp strife out of griefe with sinne, and out of strife bringeth the victorie of sinne: So out of poyson it gets a remedy, and out of the sicknesse it getteth health. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it in the meane while depriue vs of inward comfort, while wee waite for the eternall tryumph: But in the fight it shewes vs the propitiation; after the fight, which endeth in death, it presently openeth the holy place of holyest, so that neither peace of conscience is wanting to them being aliue, and their soules shall haue rest when they are dead. Thus it commeth to passe, that these broken relikes of sinne in the sonnes of God, by Gods grace do much profit, when out of them they make an antidote against pride, neither are puft vp with the merits of their owne works. Wherby the doctrine of Trent ought to be accounted the more abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which doth decree</hi> that eternall life is to be restored to the faithfull, for the merit of workes, <hi>which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle propoundeth not as the reward of a seruant, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of a sonne; not payed for spirituall obedience, but giuen to the spirituall generation, as</hi> Austin <hi>expounds the Apostle: the crowne of righteousnesse in respect of Christ, who merited: a crowne of mercy, in respect of vs for whom he merited, to be giuen by the iust iudge, not for the weight of mans merit, but for the force of Gods promise: to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> according to their workes, not for their workes,<note place="margin">Gregor: in <hi>7.</hi> Psal: peniten.</note>
      <hi>as Pope Gregorie distinguisheth out of the Apostle. The studie therefore of good workes is to be vrged, because God shall iudge</hi> according to thy works: <hi>but merit is to be detested, because it shall neuer saue thee</hi> for good works. <hi>For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer you do well is of God, not of the merit of man, but of
<pb facs="17"/> the blessing of God. You doe owe it therefore to God, as the creature to the Creator, as a captiue seruant to his redeemer: acknowledge thy selfe a seruant, who of right dost owe dutie vnto thy Lord: and whereas God doth call thee his sonne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge grace, and forget not nature. Neither thinke thou hast deserued any thing, if thou haue done well, because thou oughtst to haue done so. Besides remember, that there is some filthines from the flesh mingled with thy worke though good, which doth purely flow from the spirit, that that very thing, that we seeme to liue iustly, is a fault, if our work, when Gods seueritie iudgeth it, Gods mercie doe not excuse it before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, so that the fault in the worke must first be forgiuen to the penitent, by grace, before the worke it selfe bee crowned by promise. Lastly the Apostle saith that</hi> the afflictions of this life are not worthy of the glory which shall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, that if a man should serue God a thousand yeares, and that most zealously, he should not deserue for the merit to be halfe a day in heauen,<note place="margin">Anselm. de mensura crucis.</note>
      <hi>Anselme</hi> said, <hi>although we die a thousand times, although wee performe all the virtues of the minde, yet wee can doe nothing worthy of earthly blessinges, and such as are present, which we daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from God, much lesse heauenly and future which wee looke for as</hi> Ierome,<note place="margin">Jerom. in hunc loc.</note> Chrysostome, and Basill <hi>haue taught. But take away merite, and the desire of virtue will waxe cold. It may be in bastardes, who serue God with a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile, and mercenarie minde, but in sonnes it is not so, who worship God the father with a free &amp; voluntary spirit, which the spirit of adoption hath giuen them, who testifieth to their spirites that they be the sonnes of God, the inheritors of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and coheires with Christ. And if the free loue of God, whereby he being moued did bring thee backe from death to life, and forgaue thee all thy transgressions, and healed all thy infirmities, and hath crowned thee with his mercies, (marke what the Prophet saith) not with thy merites, but with his mercies: if this free loue I say shall not drawe from thee free obedience, nothing shall euer draw it from thee.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>There be many forceable arguments whereby the Apostle
<pb facs="17"/> perswadeth vs to liue holily, soberly, and iustly, that with good workes we set forth Gods glory, which workes though they appease not God, yet they please God, and make our elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vocation thereby sure vnto vs. But there is nothing more powerfull then the fatherly loue of God, to prouoke to goodnesse the ingenuous mindes of sonnes.</hi> This is the will of God euen the sanctification and saluation of vs all: <hi>to the which endes he chose vs from eternitie, hee called and iustified vs in time, and he shall glorifie vs to eternitie. So the mercie of</hi> Iehouah <hi>toward his sonnes is from eternitie to eternitie, for whom he hath preordained saluation in chosing them, declared it in calling them, begun it in iustifying them, and shall perfect it in glorifying them. They that being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by the spirit of God doe certainely know that they bee in the grace of God now present, and shall be euer hereafter, entring into the state of grace by faith, and standing therein by faith, and glorying vnder the hope of the glorie of God, by faith, as the Apostle teacheth: which place</hi> Chrysostome <hi>doth thus expound,</hi> that hee that hath giuen his faith to God, that there ought not onely a full perswasion to be assured them of those things which are giuen presently, but of those that are to come, as if they were now giuen. <hi>That the state of regeneration should be thought to bee more certaine, then of creation. The state of the first Adam was changeable, of the second vnchangeable, whose true and liuely members all the sonnes of God are to be esteemed. Wherefore of the state of Christ be vnchangeable, the state of them that are truely Christians, who being grafted into Christ by faith do liue, and shall liue by their faith (as the Apostle noteth out of the Prophet) must needes be vnchangeable. For it was granted to</hi> Adam, <hi>that hee was able not to die, as</hi> Austin <hi>speaketh, but to a Christian that he cannot possibly die. Three things saith</hi> Bernard <hi>I consider, wherein all my hope doth consist:</hi>
      <list>
         <item>1. <hi>The loue of adoption.</hi>
         </item>
         <item>2. <hi>The truth of the promise.</hi>
         </item>
         <item>3. <hi>And the power of the reward.</hi>
         </item>
      </list>
   </p>
   <pb facs="18"/>
   <p>Which do so strengthen and confirme my heart, that no want of merites, no consideration of our profit, no accompt of the heauenly blessing can driue mee from the depth of that hope wherein I am surely grounded. Therefore let my foolish thought murmure all it can, saying who art thou? or how great is that glory, or by what merites dost thou hope to obtaine it? And I will confidently answere, I know whom I haue trusted, I am in great assurance, because my God in great loue hath adopted me, because he is true in his promise, and able to performe it. Thus <hi>Bernard</hi> out of the Apostle: <hi>Who makes it plaine that the state of regeneration is most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly confirmed to euery sonne of God, not onely by Gods promise, but by Gods Oath. Whom hee maketh partaker of the right faith, and of working loue, and of liuely hope, and of earnest repentance, and of new obedience, and calleth him the heire of the promise. To whom God as being willing to make the immutable certainety of his counsell knowne plentifully, as to</hi> Abraham <hi>the Father, so to</hi> Abrahams <hi>sonne, did not onely promise, but sweare that hee would performe that to him which he had promised.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note>
      <hi>For in God it is all one to sweare and to say. Yet that we should haue strong consolation, who follow after to obtaine the hope set before vs, which hee hath appointed as a sure and strong anker, entred within the veile,</hi> i. <hi>heauen, whither Christ the forerunner is entred before vs, he hath confirmed our immutable state vnto vs by two immutable things his promise and his Oath. Let the prayer of Christ be ioyned to the oath of God, wherein hee praieth to God the father, that he would imbrace vs with the same loue, that he embraced Christ himselfe,</hi> i. <hi>with eternall loue: and would crowne vs with the same glorie, as hee crowned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: and did not onely pray for vs, but died also, and rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and was receiued into heauen, that hee should for euer make intercession for vs. Who hath left vnto vs his holy spirit, whereby he hath sealed vnto vs the heauenly inheritance. And therefore God hath assured eternall saluation to his sons, not onely by promise, but by Oath, but by prayer, and
<pb facs="18"/> sacrifice of Christ, and by the seale of the holy Ghost, that wee should not doubt thereof. And yet that wicked Councell of Trent decreed,</hi> that none could know by the certainetie of infallible faith that hee is in the state of Grace, much lesse shall bee, but that euerie one should bee in doubt and feare of his owne Grace. <hi>That it seemeth to haue vtterly ouerthrowne all the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of mans saluation laid by the Apostle, as it shall plainly appeare by the discourse vpon the popish Creede.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie Marinarius <hi>did withstand that wicked decree euen in the Councell it selfe,</hi> who taught the perseuerance of the faithfull was secure, and their securitie to be perseuered in. Ambrose Catharinus <hi>did likewise resist, who maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> that a sonne of God by the certaintie of faith doth know that he is in the state of grace, as any man may be sure that there is Rome, yea and that without doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or feare, so that he openly did resist the Councell. Albertus Pighius <hi>did afterward oppose himselfe, who of set purpose doth defend</hi> that our righteousnesse is imputed to vs by faith alone vnto life. <hi>The</hi> Councell of Colen <hi>may thee ioyned to these, wherein many learned Diuines</hi> True it is, <hi>say they,</hi> and it is required to the iustification of a man, that he certainely beleeue, not only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that they who do truly repent shall obtaine mercy by Christ, but that the man that beleeueth shall obtaine forgiuenesse of his sinnes by faith in Christ: <hi>which they learned out of the Apostle by the interpretation of</hi> Bernard. <hi>Thou hast Gentle Reader the Glasse of Christ, the summe of the Apostolike doctrine, to be set before the doctrine of the Trent Councell, who doth strike vs with a curse for the same, more fully hereafter to be propounded and maintayned. The power whereof is such, that it doth clip the winge of humane pride, that it doth aduance the glory of Gods grace, that it doth stirre vp an earnest desire of godlines, and doth fasten a sure anchor of saluation: that the sonnes of God may be made lowly in sinne, thankefull in blessing, holy in life, and cheerefull in death.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="19"/>
   <p>This doctrine Trent Councell doth ouerthrow, from whence those twelue articles of faith proceeded, which <hi>Pius the</hi> 4. brought into the forme of a Creede, enioyned to be publikely professed of his, by his Bull vnder an oath: which though they had their birth and beginning from heretikes, yet they carry the name of the true faith, and counterfeit the Apostles to be their parents, that the greater store of Christians may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to receiue them. As wee heretofore haue heard that <hi>Lambert</hi> counterfeting the name and kindred of the Earle of Warwicke, had many followers, when in truth he was the bastard of a villanous Priest: So if any shall compare these twelue bastardly and false articles of the Popes creede, with the true and right articles of the Apostles creede, hee shall finde them to be as like the Apostles, as the bastard of <hi>Simon</hi> the Priest, was like the soone of the Duke of <hi>Clarence.</hi> The schoolemen and the Canonists haue had great adoe between them, whether the Pope could make any new articles of the faith. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> as a worshipfull moderator takes vp the matter in <hi>Tortus. He diuides the articles into two sorts. He writes that some are of immediat reuelatiō, others drawn &amp; fetch from them, which notwithstanding are to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with a catholike beleefe.</hi> How foolishly I shall shew hereafter, now only I shew what they hold. Articles of the first sort <hi>Bellarmine</hi> denieth may be made of the Pope. As much as if he should deny the sunne could be made by the Pope, so many ages fastned to his globe by the hand of God. The articles of the second stampe hee doth plainly affirme may be made by the Pope; as if he should say, that he professeth himselfe to be the author and maker of that booke, whereof he is the expounder and interpreter.</p>
   <p>Now the Iesuites haue diuided those that were drawne from the first into two other kindes, which are so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly coucht together that they can hardly be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished. Some of them consist in practise, whereby
<pb facs="19"/> treason is nourished, other consist in doctrine, wherby superstition is cherished. Those they scatter mystically and closely, these plainly and openly. Those I call pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall and mysticall, which concerne the Popes power in deposing of Kings by the sentence of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and absoluing subiects from the oath of fealtie: and conspiracies and rebellions to be concealed vnder the seale of confession; and Clerkes to bee exempted from the iudgement of a secular Prince; and the power of the Pope aboue the Councell, and other wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked conclusions of the same kinde, with the <hi>schoole of Paris</hi> hath lately condemned. And a certaine Priest termed a more moderate answerer, that hee may more couertly and freely teach the professed articles of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, doth ouerthrow those mysticall articles of rebellion: for which cause he complayneth that their salary is denyed him, and the Priests of his order by the Pope. Whom I thinke good hee should answer, as the Asse answered Balaam, <hi>Am not I thine Asse, whereon thou wert wont to ride euen till this day? Tell me if euer I did the like before, and now I haue once offended in telling the truth, why wilt thou beate mee, and take my prouender from me?</hi> If such Priests will giue eare to me, let them forsake so vnthankfull, and vniust a master, and come ouer to our side. For I feare lest while they secretly sow their open articles of superstition among our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that they will draw them from the faith of Christ, and beget schollers for Iesuites, whom they will infect with their hidden articles of rebellion, and bring them from their allegeance and obedience to the King. These are fetcht from the first, bastards borne of bastards, vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pers bred of vipers, the last more wicked than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, shortly bringing forth an of spring more vilanous. Those that are fetcht from immediate revelations, as they bee supposed, make truth the way for heresie, as the authors thereof pretend iustice for wickednesse. But this is the disposition of all heretikes, that out of
<pb facs="20"/> a generall truth propounded, they alway assume and draw out heresie, which as a witch doth cast in a sacred furie into their deceiued mindes. The <hi>Pelagians</hi> from the generall allegation of Gods grace and helpe, do ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a speciall rule of their heresie, which as poyson they distill more easily into the mindes of their simple Auditors. The Papists holding those articles of Christ generally, do infuse hereticall poyson deepe into their mindes being seasoned with the sweet of those generals. I will giue you one example, which doth farther spread it selfe. They beleeue in generall that Christ is ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp into heauen, and sits at the right hand of God, and shall come from thence to iudge both the quicke and the dead. Yet the Priest doth daily bring Christ from thence, to wit, out of heauen into the sacrament, so that he is corporally present in the sacrament, when it is manifest that hee is conteyned in heauen till all things be fulfilled. But here they distinguish, <hi>that Christ shall come once from heauen visibly to iudgement, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth invisibly euery day into the sacrament.</hi> O notable deduction, that ouerturneth the principle from whence it is drawne! O notable distinction, which doth by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing vtterly ouerthrow the principall article But so doth heresie besmere ouer the lip of the cuppe as it were with honie, that it may be taken and goe downe the more merily. As <hi>Pius the</hi> 4, who brought in the Constantinople creed, which he calleth the Rom: creed, as a preface before the new creede being their owne. Which when it seem'd to me to be vnworthily done, I thought good to discourse of this new Creede of the faith, composed by the Pope in a wicked intent, being the summe of Antichristianitie, in a Latin Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, diuided into three bookes. The first Dialogue bringeth in Antichrist as an Actor on the stage: the second and third as a Doctor in the chayre. The first doth fully describe the practise of the Beast, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is termed <hi>Pragmaticall Antichrist,</hi> or <hi>Hildebrand
<pb facs="20"/> restored to life.</hi> Taking that name from <hi>Caesar Baronius,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Caes: Baron: in sentent: sua contra Venet.</note> who to prouoke <hi>Paul the fift</hi> against the Venetians; <hi>Me thinkes</hi> (saith he) <hi>I see sitting in Peters chaire, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie the</hi> 7. <hi>and Alexander the</hi> 3. <hi>two rootes of the Church libertie now decayed, both issuing out of the Citie of Senes, whence your Holinesse takes your beginning; whereof the one did bring vnder Henry that obstinate Emperor, thother did vanquish Fredericke very stoutly opposing himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. You must take in hand the same quarrell.</hi> Therefore <hi>Paul the</hi> 5. in <hi>Baronius</hi> iudgement is <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand brought to life againe.</hi> And if the Pope by Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius perswasion doe Gregorize or Alexandrize with Princes, I pray to God for Iesus Christ his sake, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue our Prince, that hee may Henrize and Frederize, but with better successe with the Popes. The second and third Dialogue discourse of the articles of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and therefore is entitled <hi>Dogmaticall Antichrist,</hi> or <hi>The Popes Creede,</hi> because it conteyneth the articles publikely to be professed: but chiefly that incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible supremacie, which to the Papists is a transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, when it had not a being with the Apostles, being the head of Goliah, an euill head, or a head full of all mischiefes, which you shall perceiue in the second Dialogue by all meanes defended, yet you shall say with a stone cast out of the word of God to bee well broken. But because hee hath made a scepter of his Crosiers staffe, the second Dialogue is rightly termed <hi>The ruling Pastor.</hi> I follow after as I can but not with equall paces, certaine notable Fathers of our Church, who when as they first refute the graue (as they seeme) and probable opinions of Antichrist earnestly and soundly: doe afterward pleasantly and wittily laugh at his foolish and harmefull Institutions. <hi>Truth doth somtime laugh at heresie, because shee is safe and secure,</hi> as Tertullian saith. Scu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tile iesting doth not beseeme a Diuine, but a witty conceit, arising from the matter in question, which ridiculous Antichrist cannot choose
<pb facs="21"/> but vtter to euery one be he neuer so sober, in his fained grauitie, and pastorall maiestie. Wisely said the Poet,
<q>
         <l>An earnest iest</l>
         <l>Doth more stoutly and better somtime set out great matters.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>But the Papists take it in ill part, that their Pope, compared to the King is scoft at, as though hee exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Empire in <hi>Iaponia</hi> beyond the fieldes of <hi>Cutica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindon:</hi> and they be greiued that the Cardinalls vanitie proudly comparing himselfe to the King, is pleasantly flouted at: but that the flourishing meddow in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie deuised by the old Doctour is scoft at, they take very hainously. But who may not thinke that such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious comparisons, such proud vanities, such foolish old-wiues-tales should not rather bee laught at with a pleasant iest, then put off with an earnest argument? as the Prophet laught at the wicked fooleries of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alites</hi> and the Apostle called the circumcision of the false Apostles pleasantly concision. So ridiculous bee these toyes, which they tearme holy deceites, their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities be so insolent, which they cast vpon the people as bridles to deceiue them, that a wise man euen in the darke night of poperie could not choose but deride the Pope.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Henrie</hi> the second when hee had honourably enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Popes Legate at <hi>Windsor,</hi> and in hunting had caught a stagge, <hi>Looke my Lord</hi> said he, <hi>how fat the stagge is, and yet he neuer heard Masse.</hi> And when <hi>Ottobone</hi> an other of the Popes Lagates, was purposed to lay a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie curse vpon certaine noble men that rebelled, and came to that purpose to <hi>Killingworth</hi> being attired in his purple robe, and his red Cardinalles hat, it is said that they being all in white, and putting a surplasse vpon a Surgeon whom they had got to curse <hi>Ottobone</hi> with the like curse, brake out into this iest, that <hi>a curse of one in white was as terrible as the curse of a purple Priest.</hi> That which was lawfull for Kings and Peeres the popish sons of the Pope, to vtter against the pride and superstition
<pb facs="21"/> of the Pope: I pray let it bee lawfull for a King, who doth not acknowledge the Pope for his Father, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue sometime with a pleasant iest that superstition which he hath learned out of the word to be not onely very hurtfull, but often very foolish. As that learned <hi>Marnixius</hi> in his Bee-hiue, when he derideth both the other vanities of poperie, and also those fained cells in hell with a continued irony, and pleasant dissembling: I should maruell if the Pope and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> should not like the two South-sayers laugh betweene themselues, when they see the world so fit to be cousoned by them. But I my selfe truly will follow after not iests but argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And I rather greeue, then laugh when I thinke of the Pope, that great scourge of God. Neither doe I hate a Papist but popery: I taxe heresie not the men: and I wish an ouerthrow to heresie, saluation to the men.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Our bookes are taught this fashion to bring in,</l>
      <l>To spare their persons and to taxe their sinne.</l>
   </q>
   <p>I would not haue thought it meete to taxe the person of a Iesuite, if he had not laide open his person who is more deare vnto vs then our liues, to the sword of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, being first wounded with the quill of a goose. Whose booke might haue profited the very slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers themselues euen to their saluation, if they had had in them but one crumme of grace: whereto agreeth that speech of the wise Poet.</p>
   <q>
      <l>He doth deserue both pricke and praise</l>
      <l>Who so with profite pleasure layes.</l>
   </q>
   <p>But whenas the Iesuits do shew themselues not only Aristarchi, that is reprehenders of our writings,<note place="margin">Cicero in piso.</note> as the Orator said, but censors like Phalaris, neither doe they set a note vpon our writings, but persecute our writers with fire and fagot: and doe not only sprincle ouer our bookes with blacke salt, but our Court with hell dust: they may con our men thankes, who for such deedes, giue but such wordes: and suffer themselues sometime
<pb facs="22"/> to be galled with the freedom of style, whom they haue hurt with the furie of their wickednesse. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our owne men should haue beene more fauourable to our owne writers being so excellent for holinesse and learning, whom yet I heare of some (I hope they bee but a few false brethren) like to <hi>Ianus,</hi> are wont to bee though lightly bitten and reprehended. Who if they be not ours, they might doe very well, if, they would more open themselues: if they be ours, as I rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, let them fauour our holy labours: vnlesse they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to heare of some writer of ours, which <hi>Lelius</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine criticall reprehender heard out of <hi>Martiall.</hi>
   </p>
   <q>
      <l>When Lelius carpeth mine and keepeth in his verse,</l>
      <l>Or let him hold his prate, or else his owne rehearse.</l>
   </q>
   <p>For it is both greeuous and vnseemly that their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings should be closly bit with a Theonine tooth, by false brethren, whose throates are first assailed with a leonine crueltie by open enemies. There is almost none of our writers, who haue not written that the <hi>Pope</hi> is Antichrist; But there be certaine men among vs very moderate, forsooth, and politicke, who would not haue the Aduersarie so angered and stirred vp with so sharpe a conclusion, and that thereby all hope of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and peace betweene the parties should bee cut off: betweene whom they thinke to bee a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of wordes, but little or none at all of things: that God is alike deare to each Church, and that the litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of each is alike accepted of God, that saluation is in both, when each doth rest vpon Christ the foundation, that a Papist may, although halting come to heauen, and that the hatred of Papists is not so great as we make it, and that it is not conceiued by their owne accord, but that it is encensed by such bitter disputations: and that the quarrell had been ended, if certaine hot spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Theologians had not encreased the controuersie. These luke-warme Christians, that seeme to bee of no side and of both sides, seeme to dispute soberly and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litickly.
<pb facs="22"/> But your religious wisedome, Christian <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> doth better vnderstand, that the Romane Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue is full of idolatrie, and that it doth therefore hate God, and by <hi>Moses</hi> iudgement, is againe hatefull to God: neither was <hi>Caine</hi> prouoked with any iniurie of <hi>Abels,</hi> but by his owne malice and hatred of godlines: And though both of them were wont to sacrifice to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Adames</hi> house, yet <hi>Caines</hi> sacrifice was reiected, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> accepted, and the worke pleased God for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, not the person for the worke; that which <hi>Saint Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> gathereth out of <hi>Moses,</hi> because the person was first made righteous by faith, as the Apostle taught <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and that therefore there is no lesse difference of worship and faith betweene a Protestant and a Papist, then was betweene <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abell.</hi> And that the Synagogues anger against our Church is as implacable, as <hi>Caines</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Abell,</hi> and <hi>Ismaels</hi> against <hi>Isaac,</hi> and that before it was stirred vp with the blast of contention, it was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with hatred of the promise. And as the hatred of <hi>Ismael</hi> against the promise, which he derided, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with a visard of circumcision, brake out against the sonne of the promise; so the hidden and secret ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the Synagogue of Rome against the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the tables of the promise, as I said, being couered with a certaine shew of voluntarie religion, did greiuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breake and burne out against our Church the heire of the promise, so that <hi>Agar</hi> doth not leaue off to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute <hi>Sara</hi> againe, the Haidmayde her Mistris in the house of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And when it can bee proued that <hi>Caines</hi> sacrifice was as well accepted of God as <hi>Abels,</hi> then I will grant that the Papists Masse be as acceptable to God, as the Liturgie of the Protestants; and when it can be euicted that Christ alone apprehended by faith without our workes, is not the foundation of the <hi>church</hi> I wil grant that the same is the foūdation of both Churches. Lastly, when it shall appeare that <hi>Ismael</hi> the sonne of the handmaide borne by the power of nature,
<pb facs="23"/> is coheyre of the house of <hi>Abraham</hi> with <hi>Isaac</hi> the sonne of the free woman borne by the force of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, then I will grant that an obstinate Papist, may come halting to heauen. In the meane time I will warne these luke-warme and halting Protestant, that they will giue sentence in Gods matters according to the certaine truth of God, not out of their prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting charitie, and that there be no middle counsell to be taken: neither let them trust, the Pope being more ioyntly and easily intreated by them, will be the more easie and gentle to them. Whom we by short conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions out of holy <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> excellently expounded by notable worthies of our Church, although a little more bitterly and roughly, then seemeth good to some, we shew to be Antichrist. I confesse that this is a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and darke prophecie, whose importance doth reiect the vanitie of tales, whose obscuritie requireth more cleare light of interpretation. So it falleth out some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time that the exposition is larger, the conclusion shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For a short exposition and a long conclusion are faultie alike when hard and controuersies of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are handled. For a short exposition wants light, and a long conclusion wants sharpenesse of wit. The Aduersarie doth offend in both, while hee is busied in the interpretation of the prophecie, for it doth lessen things of weight, neither doth it make plaine matters obscure. For hee doth depresse the excellencie of the prophecy by stuffing it vp with the vanitie of many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and being satisfied with vncertaine coniectures of Fathers, and with their naked names, hath not driuen away the obscuritie. So it falleth out, that from strange and vnkinde expositions of the prophecie, they gather weake and idle conclusions. In the vnfoulding of this mysterie, the holy fathers haue stood vs in good steed, and more had, if they had beene Prophets. But when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they (<hi>Daniel</hi> being the Authour) doe teach that the vnderstanding of the prophesie, is to be taken from the
<pb facs="23"/> performance of it, and grant that <hi>truth is the daughter of time,</hi> we that are fallen vpon the endes of times, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the parts of the prophecie betweene themselues with great study and reuerence, and bringing light to the text, out of the context, and to the context out of the euent, because Christ hath opened the booke that was sealed vp, nor called it an<note n="a" place="margin">A thing sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led &amp; hidden.</note>

      <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse,</hi> we do from thence more confidently drawe a conclusion, not as an Article of faith, but as asure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the doctrine of Christ. Although the popish Synagogue, which without any testimonie of Scripture makes this the thirteenth Article of their faith, <hi>I beleeue that the Pope is the Ʋicar of Christ,</hi> may iustly pardon the reformed Church if being taught by so many testimonies of Scripture, it make this to be an Article of their faith, <hi>I beleeue that the Pope is Antichrist.</hi> Now I did foresee that when I made a looking glasse for <hi>Paul</hi> the 5. it would come to passe, that the Iesuites, who do so often traduce the King of <hi>great Britaine,</hi> with their slanderous and infamous libels, would bee much mooued to anger, that I often vsed the name of their Pope in this manner. For what will they say? darest thou an obscure fellow speake so often to the Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so great a Prince? or conceiuest thou any hope that being an hereticall minister, thou canst conuert so great a Doctor? Whereby thou hast got naught else for thy labour, but that thy folly and pride should be knowne to all men. These I presage will bee the embleames of the Iesuitish stile, whereto (thy selfe <hi>Reader</hi> shalt bee an Arbitrator) I shortly answere. I see that the Pope of his owne is accounted a great Father, but thrust as a small Prince by his great neighbour Princes into a small corner of the south: but how bigge soeuer he be, I speak to the Pope as not to a politicall Prince, but politicall Antichrist. I fauour his ciuill dignitie whatsoeuer it be, but I spare not his spirituall impietie. But what? doe I take in hand to conuert the Pope? no more then I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
<pb facs="24"/> to <hi>wash an Ethiopian.</hi> I am not yet so madde. I know <hi>that the belly hath no eares.</hi> And it may be <hi>Paul</hi> the fift, as it is said, is dead. What then? but <hi>Paul</hi> being dead the Pope is aliue. One head groweth vp vnder an other. For the popedome is a <hi>Hydra.</hi> I doe not defend that this or that Pope, but that the Pope is Antichrist. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth now Christian Reader, that I exhort and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee by thy saluation, that the hatred of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue being contemned, though thou well know Christ, to knowe him with mee daily better out of the Scriptures, that both of vs may more earnestly loue him, and more earnestly follow him being loued, and further that you know him peraduenture suspected by you, to be Antichrist, more certainely by the euent of the prophecie, that being known each may pursue him with an holy hatred, and right execration; to which purpose I first set before thee the Glasse of Christ and view of Christianitie, now I set before thee the Popes looking-Glasse and the picture of ANTICHRIST.</p>
