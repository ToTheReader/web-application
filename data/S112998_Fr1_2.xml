   <head>¶ TO THE RIGHT Honourable Sir <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Walsingham,</hi> Knight, principall Secretarie to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, and one of her Highnesse moste Honourable priuie Councell: <hi>Antony Munday,</hi> vvisheth the happie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaunce of earthly Honour, as also to be partaker of the endlesse ioy in the life to come.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>OMPARING THE</hi> passed course of time (Right Honourable) with the succeding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance: I fynde that neither state, Prince or people, which might with moste authoritie make
<pb facs="3"/>
boast, either for royaltie of Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or tranquilitie of yeeres: but at one time or other they haue felt the maligne stroke of Fortune, either by enuye of princely rule, ambitious desire of vnstable prefermēt, or some tragicall and wicked intent, issuing from the roote of all disloyaltie, Treason. In vaine it were to spend time in repetition of circumstaūces, to make proofe either of the one or the other: our eyes are filled with the registred reportes heereof, and our eares made acquainted, with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of vnhappy accidents, yea, the more my greefe to thinke thereon, our natiue Countrey hath lately witnessed, a Stratagem according with former infortunes. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though mallice, in diuers of these vngracious acts, had purposed and appointed a wished end of his bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy desire; yet notwithstanding his
<pb facs="3"/>
extremest occasions, some one or other haue beene reserued, to giue warning of such mischeeuous and iminent daungers; where through, the Prince and People haue beene happily deliuered, and mallice alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vtterly disappointed. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of which true and loyall seruice, the faithfull perfourmers thereof, haue not onely attained the worthy fauour of their Soueraigne, but also haue beene enritched with the continuall looue and amitie of the Subiectes.</p>
   <p>These things (right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) ioyntlye considered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the late occasions so happily preuented, to see time growne to such an iron and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate nature, contrarie to that it hath beene in the aforenamed dayes; I am not onely confounded in a number of dismaying thoughts, but also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb facs="4"/>
my selfe as altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.</p>
   <p>It is not vnkowen to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in what occasions passed, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling an vnlooked for cause of daunger, to my gracious Soueraigne and her Realme: how not I alone, but I cheefely as one, gaue foorth such vnreprooueable notice of ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harmes, as bewrayed their secret trayterous intent, and also notably conuicted the aduersary. For which seruice, beyond my desert, I haue found the plentifull measure, of my Princesse fauoure and goodnes, as also the noble goodwill of her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Counsell, of which high calling, as God and her Maiesty hath created you one: so am I in dutie to pray for your continuall welfare, whose Honourable freendship hath exceeded my poore demerit. But when I thinke on the vndeserued
<pb facs="4"/>
ingratitude, wherewith mine owne Countreymen vnkindely rewarde me; I am forced to say, as one some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time sayd, <hi>A man is no where wurse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, then in his owne Countrey.</hi> If I had come as their aduersaryes did, for the subuersion of their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able estate, and bloody ouerthrowe: then might I well haue contented my selfe, to be condemned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche, and thrust foorth into infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But comming as I did, to open the gap of trouble secretly ment vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; I finde not so much as I haue deserued, but yet a great deale more then I am able to suffer. Euery man will deskant on matters after his owne imagination, cōmend &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn as pleaseth his humor, but that which is more, diuers prating Boyes (wherof I cā name some) wil take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thē to defēd their cause, who haue beene found such hainous offenders;
<pb facs="5"/>
if some of them were publiquely chastened, it would charme the tongues of a number more, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they perceiue them to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; ioyne with them in euill spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches together for company.</p>
   <p>My desire is therefore to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that some good order may be appointed for such lewde and talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue companions, and that they who are innocent of such wicked crimes, whereby (by them) they are malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously slaundered, may not be dealt withall after this manner; for the enemy dooth very well perceiue it, and smileth to see vs so shamefullie handled, besyde, the lyes and fables by such idle fellowes imagined, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them more bolde in theyr Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles, to exclaime and defame euen as pleaseth them.</p>
   <p>To approoue my woordes true, two seditious and Traiterous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
<pb facs="5"/>
haue lately beene printed and dispersed abroad, the one in French, the other in English; contayning such horrible and detestable slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, bothe against Honorable, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull, learned and godly persons, as themselues, who are the Authors thereof, if they were not altogether giuen ouer as reprobate, might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to publish abroade. And yet will they say, they vse such mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, pietie and grauitie in all their actions, as no men are able to doo the like; how voyde they are of such vertuous gifts, I will not reason my selfe, but appeale to your Honor, and a number godlie and learned men, who I knowe haue seene their vnchristian like behauiour, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their dayly deedes and gesture, but also in their mallicious and slaunderous Libelles. These two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed Bookes (right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
<pb facs="6"/>
comming to my handes, and the famous vntruethes therein with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise considered; I prepared my selfe to write this breefe Aunswer, which, in dutie and humilitie, I commend to your Honourable view. How it shall please you to like thereof, I am not to enter into oppinion: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, I haue good hope, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as I meant it, your Honour will accept it, which was and is, to displease none, but to pleasure and profit all men if I might, especially your Honor, to whom I wish more then heere I can vnfold, bothe of earthly honor, and heauenly happines.</p>
