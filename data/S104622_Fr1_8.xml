   <head>The Argument of the Booke</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat tyme there reigned in Edon so manye Royall crowned kings, amongst the rest there was a King called <hi>Anastres Castri</hi>: who chose for chiefe of all his Courte one <hi>Berozias,</hi> whome hee made high treasorer of all his Realme, a man right noble in his deedes, and rich of possessions: &amp; him he loued and trusted so much, that hee put his princelye person and whole affaires of his Realme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his handes. It happened one daye there was presented to the king a Booke, in which was written many goodly dedes and secrets, and amongst the heape this was one. Howe that in India were marueylous hie moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, in which there grewe certaine sortes of herhes and trees, which if they were kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
<pb facs="15"/>
and confected afterwards in a certaine kinde: they should drawe out of that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous composition such a remedie, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they might raise to life again the dead. The king no sooner read this wonder, but he burned straight to knowe the troth thereof: wherefore in haste (as soone as might bee) he dispatched <hi>Berozias,</hi> and bade him hie him thither, commaunding him to see if he coulde finde it true. And bicause it was a hard and painefull enterprise, he furnished him with golde and siluer, not onely suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but more than needed, that he shoulde not lacke. Then he deliuered him his letters of recommendation to all those kings of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, praying them to further this worthie man in his noble attempt, purposed to good ende. <hi>Berozias</hi> licensed nowe of the King to depart (furnished with money and letters) went into that countrie, and arriued in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia
<pb n="9" facs="15"/>
presented straight the king his maisters letters: by meanes wherof he was receyued of the Magistrates as was pertinent to the Imbasie of so highe a Prince. And his message deliuered, they vnderstanding the cause of his comming, offered themselues with all the wise men they had to fauour his enterprise, and to further it all they could. And thus honorably accompanied of al the sage and wise men, conducting him through all the Mountaynes and Countries there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, they had and gathered all they found written for the conditing of so precious an electuarie. And all they ioyning togithers to make this confection, proouing it a great while, could neuer finde it worke such effect as to raise any one from death to life againe. So that they saw by proofe that all that was written in the booke concerning the electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was meere false and vntrue. This thing
<pb facs="16"/>
grieued much <hi>Berozias,</hi> that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne to the king <hi>Anastres</hi> his maister and bring no better newes with him: howbeit consulting with these graue and wise men before his departure, how he might doe, not to retourne home in vaine, there was giuen him by a famous Philosopher of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, a goodly treatise, who serched himself also to finde that secrete, and in the ende he vnderstoode that it was the Booke which was so called. And so, O graue <hi>Berozias,</hi> thou shalt say vnto the king, and returne to him with ioye.</p>
   <p>The hilles which we ought to seeke, are the wise and learned men. The trees and herbes growing vpon those hilles, doe beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken wisedome and learning: which springs of the vnderstanding and iudgementes of the learned. The medicine or electuarie condited of those herbes, are the bookes full
<pb n="10" facs="16"/>
of most learned writings, composed by the high and deepe wittes, and with this oyle or Baulme they reuiue the deade. For with such knowledge the ignorant and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are instructed: whom wee maye iustly recken deade and buried.</p>
   <p>Therefore tasting the sweetenesse (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually reading) of the doctrine of the sages, they receiue health and resurrection. This interpretation greatly reioyced <hi>Berozias,</hi> in so much as hee besought the Princes and sage men that they would giue him but the copie of that booke to carie to the King his Maister, which (although the booke were alwayes in the handes of those Kings, for that it was ful of Morall Philosophy) was graunted him, licensing him to translate it out of the Indian into the Persian tongue, with the helpe and knowledge of all those learned Philosophers, which was so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularlye
<pb facs="17"/>
done that it bare the vaunt of all Morall Philosophie. The Booke receiued with due and infinite thankes rendered to those noble Kings and Sages, for the great honor and curtesie they had done him: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rozias</hi> departeth home, and being come to his Maister, presented him the booke with relation of his whole entertainment.</p>
   <p>The King hearing so noble an expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so wise and discreete an interpretation, thankefully receyued the Booke, esteming it aboue any other present. And thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth he procured with great diligence to haue alwayes bookes, and those he studied, desirous of knowledge, seeking to entertaine in his Court wise and learned men: iudging (as is true) that bookes and wisedome are the greatest treasure and delight to man. Appointing in his Palaice a great librarie, wherein aboue the rest he placed this booke
<pb n="11" facs="17"/>
for chiefe, being full of examples and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions for mans life, and also of Iustice and the feare of God: in praise and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of whom we begin this worke, shewing therein the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all daungers and deceits of this miserable worlde</p>
