   <head>THE LIFE OF
OVID.</head>
   <p>PVBLIVS OVIDIVS NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SO,
descended of the ancient
Family of the <hi>Nasones,</hi> who had
preserued the dignitie of Roman
Knights from the first originall of that
Order, was borne at <hi>Sulmo,</hi> a Citie of
the <hi>Peligni,</hi> on the 14. of the Calends
of April, in the Consul-ships of <hi>Hirci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
and <hi>Pansa,</hi> both slaine at the battell
of <hi>Mutina</hi> against <hi>Marcus Antonius.</hi>
While yet a boy, his quicke wit and
ready apprehension gaue his parents
an assurance of a future excellencie:
in so much as his father <hi>Lucius</hi> sent
him to <hi>Rome</hi> (together with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a yeere elder than he, and borne
on the same day) to bee instructed by
<hi>Plotius Grippus,</hi> that Art might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the accomplishments of nature.
In his first of youth he was much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
vnto poetrie, wherein hee had

But co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tinually reproued by his
father for following so vnprofitable a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> with an ill will he forsooke the

      </gap> and <hi>Porcius Lairo;</hi> of
whose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>quence and learning he was
a great Admirer. Neither attained he
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> in to a vulgar commendation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

      </gap> by <hi>Marcus Annaeus Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>a</hi>
among the principall Orators of
those times. His prose was no other
than dissolued verse: his speech wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
briefe, and powerful in perswasion.
Hauing past through diuers offices of
Iudicature, and now readie to assume
the habit of a Senator: his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and father being dead, impatient
of toyle, and the clamours of litigious
Assemblies, hee retired himselfe from
all publick affaires to affected vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and his former abandoned studies.
Yet such was the mutuall affection
betweene him and <hi>Varro,</hi> that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of Command, &amp; serued vnder
<pb facs="4"/>
him in the wars of <hi>Asia:</hi> from whence
he returned by <hi>Athens,</hi> where he made
his aboad, vntill hee had attained to
the perfection of that language. Hee
was of a meane stature, slender of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
spare of diet; and, it not too amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
euery way temperate. He drunk
no wine but what was much alayed
with water: An Abhorrer of vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Lusts, from which it should seem
that age was not innocent: neat in
apparell; of a free, affable, and courtly
behauiour; whereby he acquired the
friendship of many, such as were
great in learning &amp; nobilitie; among
whom not a few of Consular dignitie:
and so honoured by diuers, that they
wore his picture in rings cut in preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
stones. A great Admirer, and as
much admired, of the excellent Poets
of those times, with whom hee was
most familiar and intimate. Being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
by some of them to leaue out
three verses of those many which hee
had written, hee gaue his consent, so
that of all he might except three only:
<pb facs="5"/>
whereupon they priuately writ those
which they would haue him abolish,
and he on the other side those which
he excepted, when both their papers,
being showne, presented the same
verses, the first and second recorded
by <hi>Pedo Albinovanus,</hi> who was one of
the arbiters,
<q>
         <l>Semi bouemque virum, semi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>irumque bouem.</l>
         <l>Sedg lidum Borean, egelidum{que} Notū.</l>
      </q>
whereby it appeareth that his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wit did not want an answerable
iudgement in suppressing the libertie
of his verse, had he not affected it. An
ample patrimonie he had in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
of <hi>Sulmo;</hi> with a house and a
temple in the citie, where now stands
the Church of <hi>Sancta Maria de Tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba;</hi>
and where now stands the Church
of <hi>Sancta Maria de Consolatione</hi> he had
an other in <hi>Rome,</hi> not farre from the
Capitoll; with pleasant Hort-yards
betweene the wayes of <hi>Flaminia</hi> and
<hi>Claudia,</hi> wherein hee was accustomed
to recreate himselfe with his Muses.
Hee had had three wiues: whereof
<pb facs="5"/>
the first being giuen him in his youth,
as neither worthie nor profitable,
soone after (according to the custome
of the <hi>Romans</hi>) he diuorced: nor liu'd
he long with the second, although
nobly borne, and of behauiour incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.
The chastitie and beauty of the
third he often extolleth; whom hee
instructed in poetrie, and to his death
entirely affected. Neither was her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
inferior to his; liuing all the
time of his banishment like a sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
widow; and continuing to the
end exemplarie faithfull. But in this
euery-way happy condition, when his
age required ease, and now about to
imploy his beloued vacancie in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niew
and polishing of his former la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
he was banished, or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ined
to <hi>Tomos</hi> (a citie of <hi>Sarmatia</hi>
bordering on the Euxine Sea) by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus
Caesar,</hi> on the fourth of the Ides
of December, and in the one and fifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
yeere of his age, to the generall
griefe of his friends &amp; acquaintance;
who sailed into <hi>Thrace</hi> in a ship of his
<pb facs="6"/>
owne, and by land performed the rest
of his voyage. The cause of this his so
cruell and deplored exile is rather
coniectured than certainely knowne.
Most agree that it was for his too
much familiaritie with <hi>Iulia</hi> the
daughter of <hi>Augustus,</hi> masked vnder
the name of <hi>Corinna.</hi> Others, that hee
had vnfortunately seene the incest of
<hi>Caesar:</hi> which may be insinuated, in,
that he complaines of his error, and
compares himself to <hi>Actaeon.</hi> But the
pretended occasion was for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of the Art of Loue, as intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
lasciuious, and corrupting good
manners. A pretence I may cal it, since
vnlikely it is that he should banish him
in his age for what he writ whē hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a man, &amp; after so long a conniuance.
Yet <hi>Augustus,</hi> either to conceale his
owne crime or his daughters, would
haue it so thought: neither would
Ov <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> reneale the true cause, lest hee
should further exasperate his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
After he had long in vaine solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his repea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e by the mediation of
<pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>Germanicus Caesar,</hi> and others that
were neere vnto the Emperour; or at
least to bee remoued to a more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Clime; his hopes (as he writes)
forsaking the earth with <hi>Augustus,</hi> he
dyed at <hi>Tomos</hi> in the fifth yeere of the
raigne of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> hauing liued seuen
yeeres in banishment. As <hi>Tibullus</hi> and
hee were borne in one day, so he and
<hi>Liuie</hi> dyed on an other; that his birth
and death might bee nobly accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
He had so wonne the barbarous
<hi>Get's</hi> with his humanitie and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
actions (hauing also written a
booke in their language) that they
honoured him in his life with trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
garlands, and celebrated his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
with vniuersall sorrow; ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
his tombe before the gates of
their citie, hard by a lake which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
his name to this day. His se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
was found in the yeere,
MDVIII. with a magnificent couer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
presenting this Epitaph.</p>
