   <head>THE CONCLVSION TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>MAKE accompt, good Reader, that this discourse is a Letter, &amp; this which now thou art reading, is the Postscript of it. Thou hast seene the torments of Hell, and the ioyes which are imparted to the elect in heauen. Thou hast seene that if thou dye in mortall sinne, thou wilt for euer be chayned in those torments; &amp; for euer be depriued of those ioyes.<pb n="246" facs="124"/>Take heed therefore of all sinne; and especially take heed of the sinne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Schisme</hi> or
<hi>Heresy,</hi> which are of the greatest that can be cōmitted. The nature of <hi>Heresy,</hi> consisteth in this, That a man will make election of some one doctrine, or more, which is contrary to the beleefe of that true Church, which is celebrated in the <hi>Creed</hi> of the first Councell of <hi>Nice;</hi> to be <hi>One,</hi> to be <hi>Holy,</hi> to be
<hi>Catholike,</hi> &amp; to be <hi>Apostolike.</hi> Be sure thou be of that one true <hi>Church,</hi> which soeuer that be (for thogh myself be resolued, yet I will not heere handle that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, by way of Controuersy;) but there is but one wherin a Christian can be saued, one in the faith which it professeth, howsoeuer it may be accounted many, in respect of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite persons which it conteyneth, and consequently of the particular Churches which it imbraceth. The nature
<note n="a" place="margin">Wher in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of heresy, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</note> therfore of <hi>heresy,</hi> doth not
<pb n="247" facs="124"/>consist in the multitude or quality of the Articles of Religion, which are held, in difference from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and direction of the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church; but it consisteth properly, in the pride and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that hart, which dares pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a priuate opinion, of any one, or seuerall Countries, or any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of holy Scripture (which interpretation, is also no more then a
<note n="b" place="margin">For he will make the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur affirm and deny what he will.</note> meere opinion) before the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of that
<hi>Church,</hi> which is, &amp; is still to be instructed and taught by the holy Ghost. And this sinne, is of so high a nature, as that vnlesse it be remoued by pennance, the man in whome it liues, shall
<note n="c" place="margin">No heretike without repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce can be saued.</note> dye a double death, and neuer behould the face of God; howsoeuer he may, otherwise, seeme to be a person of most holy life, &amp; so ful of Charity, as to sell his state, and giue it all to the poore; and of so valiant and Christian a hart, as,<pb n="248" facs="125"/>amongst Infidels, to suffer death, &amp; torments for the name of Christ. For to proue that euen this will not serue the turne of an Heretike towards sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, see heere the authority of the greatest Fathers of the church cōcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this point. Who

Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, and S, Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> (besids, that in the way of practice, the Church of their tyme, did cōdemne many men for <hi>Heresy,</hi> who held, though it were but one point of doctrine, in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety to the Catholike Church (and somtymes of some such doctrine, as in it selfe, did not seeme to be of most importance) they do also declare, and that in most cleere and constant words, in what certainty of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are, who dy in any Heresy at all. <hi>Whosoeuer,</hi> saith S.

<pb n="249" facs="125"/>is an alien, he is a prophane person, he is an enemy.</hi> And to this effect, he also sayth, if such an one should euen giue his life for the confession of the name of Christ, he should yet (by the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of this holy Father) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the flames of Hell for his Heresy, and not be receiued to the ioyes of heauen for his constancy; &amp; he expresseth himself in these words, <hi>Non esset illi corona fidei, sed poena per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiae.</hi> S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> in like manner, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> affirmeth it to be,<note place="margin">
