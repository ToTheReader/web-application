   <head>An Aduertisement to the curteous reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, before thou enter into the discourse of the hidden knowledge of this honourable excerise of the weapon now layd open and manifested by the Author of this worke, &amp; in such perfectnes tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated out of the Italian tongue, as all or most of the marshal mynded gentlemen of England cannot but commend, and no one person of indifferent iudgement can iustly be offended with, seeing that whatsoeuer herein is discoursed, tendeth to no other vse, but the defence of mans life and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: I thought good to aduertise thee that in some places of this booke by reason of the aequiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of certaine Italian wordes, the weapons may doubtfully be construed in English. Therefore sometimes fynding this worde <hi>Sworde</hi> generally vsed, I take it to haue beene the better transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if in steede thereof the <hi>Rapier</hi> had beene inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: a weapon more vsuall for Gentlemens wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and fittest for causes of offence and defence: Besides that, in Italie where Rapier and Dagger is commonly worne and vsed, the Sworde (if it be not an arming Sworde) is not spoken of. Yet would I not the sence so strictly to be construed, that the vse of so honourable a weapon be vtterly
<pb facs="6"/>
reiected, but so redd, as by the right and perfect vnderstanding of the one, thy iudgement may som what be augmented in managing of the other: Knowing right well, that as the practise and vse of the first is commendable amongst them, so the second cannot so farre be condemned, but that the wearing thereof may well commend a man of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and reputation amongst vs. The Sworde and Buckler fight was long while allowed in England (and yet practise in all sortes of weapons is prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie,) but now being layd downe, the sworde but with Seruing-men is not much regarded, and the Rapier fight generally allowed, as a wapon because most perilous, therefore most feared, and thereupon priuate quarrels and common frayes soonest shunned.</p>
   <p>But this peece of work, gentle Reader, is so gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly set out in euery point and parcell, the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest secrets of the handling of the weapon so clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnfolded, and the perfect demeaning of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die vpon all and sudden occasions so learnedly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed, as will glad the vnder stander thereof, &amp; sound to the glory of all good Masters of <hi>Defence,</hi> because their Arte is herein so honoured, and their knowledge (which some men count infinite) in so singuler a science, drawen into such <hi>Grounds and Principles,</hi> as no wise man of an vnpartiall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="6"/>
and of what profession soeuer, but will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse himself in curtesie farre indebted both to the Author &amp; Translator of this so necessarie a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, whereby he may learne not onely through reading &amp; remembring to furnish his minde with resolute instructions, but also by practise and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise gallantly to perfourme any conceited enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise with a discreete and orderly carriage of his bodie, vpon all occasions whatsoeuer.</p>
   <p>Gentle Reader, what other escapes or mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings shall come to thy viewe, either friendly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate thee to beare with them, or curteously with thy penne for thine owne vse to amend them.</p>
   <closer>Fare-well.</closer>
