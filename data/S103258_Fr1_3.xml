   <head>The Authour to the learned Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, my selfe being a Lay man, and altogether vnskilfull in Artes, I am therefore to entreat of thee (being a scholer) that thou wilt not so much regard the maner and forme of this my weake worke, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and substance it selfe, which is no other thing in effect, but certaine manifest proofes from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, that the Church of Rome doth erre, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by such ancient witnesses, as the Papists themselues allow for lawfull; and so forcible are those witnesses against those Romish aduersaries, that if hereafter any of them shall go about to reply against this Treatise ensuing, they shall but thereby the more lay open their owne follies and shame, in striuing against the inuincible streame; for great is the Trueth, and it will preuayle: yea, what can more confound the learned aduersary, or (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth <note n="*" place="margin">Tit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. 10. 11.</note>) condemne him to erre in his owne iudgement, then to find himselfe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnable (without absurd cauelling and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct dealing) to resist the weakenesse of a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="3"/>
Lay man, fighting in Trueths behalfe? for notwithstanding my Sixe demaunds to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Papists, be the simplest booke that euer hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath bene brought foorth against them, yet are they not able to reply directly against it, without absurdity. Whereupō, I doubt, they will seeme to skorne to vouchsafe it an answere.</p>
   <p>But here by the way, I acknowledge (and that sincerely) that it is vnmeete for any Lay man, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though neuer so great a scholer, to take to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the office of ministery in the Church, or to clime vp to the Pulpit, before he be lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to that holy and reuerend function<hi>:</hi> But for Lay men decently to instruct and admonish one another, it is no nouelty, but a thing allowable in the Church many yeeres since, as witnesseth S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> who sayth playnely, <note n="*" place="margin">Vpon the Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>stle to the Colo. Chap. 3.</note> that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth teach, that Lay men ought to haue the Scriptures abundantly, and to instruct and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish one another, &amp;c. But if it be tolerable for Lay men to admonish one another, it followes then (because all are not scholers) that some of them may be also tolerated to write simply and playnely, and according to that maner of speach which the common vulgar sort do vsually speake, who neuer speake more eloquently, then when they speake trueth sincerely and playnely, and then they thinke they speake very well, if they be
<pb facs="3"/>
vnderstood very well.</p>
   <p>But perhaps, some learned Aduersary will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect (according to his vsuall maner) against these proofes, which I haue here cited from some of the ancient Fathers, liuing in the Church aboue a thousand yeeres since, that they haue bene brought forth already by diuers learned men, &amp; long since answered by learned men also, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in vaine for me being a Lay man vnlearned, to cite them againe, thinking that I haue but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered them here and there out of other mens workes, where they haue bene collected before, and for that cause likewise, from me the lesse to be regarded.</p>
   <p>These things being obiected, I answere, True it is, that the same proofes haue long since bene brought forth against the Aduersaries, &amp; by thē also answered; but how well, or how ill they haue bin answered, let that be tryed by those Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which are of soūd iudgement; for this I da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e auouch, that a lawfull witnesse being brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any mā, it is no lesse then an absurd answer in that man whosoeuer, to reply, that the same witnesse, in speaking of one thing, doth thereby meane another<hi>:</hi> But into the same strayte are all Heretiks brought, by resisting the apparāt truth. And this is a principall marke to be aymed at in this our corrupt age, in which there is so much
<pb facs="4"/>
dissension and controuersie among professed Christians. For if our aduersaries might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to answere so absurdly, and to passe from one poynt to another, before some one poynt onely be throughly decided; all the labour wee take, to cleanse them from their infectious spots of errour, would proue but labour in vayne: but (God be thanked) the faithfull know well, how to preuent the silly shiftes of Heretikes, and so with little labour, eyther to conuert them, or confound them: for commonly the Heretike may be condemned by his owne mouth, his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine contradicting some trueth in Scripture, which himselfe professeth to beleeue: for where traditions and customes of men are regarded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore holy Scripture, there ignorance doth soone beget errour; especially if diuers things called by one name, be not so perfectly distinguished, but that the one may be taken for the other.</p>
   <p>But let the ignorant learne, first touching faith. A true faith which worketh by loue, is one thing; and a verball or vaine faith another.</p>
   <p>Secondly, touching iustification; A iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before God, is one thing; and a iustification before men, another<hi>:</hi> for God iustifieth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inward heart, (by the good tree, true faith:) but man iustifieth according to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward declaration, (by the fruits proceeding frō
<pb facs="4"/>
that tree<note n="*" place="margin">Luke. 6. 43.</note>, good workes.) S. <hi>Paul</hi> treating of the first iustification, denyes not the second; for he sayth, <hi>If Abraham were iustified by workes, he hath wherein to reioyce, but not with God, &amp;c.</hi>
      <note n="γ" place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> S. <hi>Iames</hi> treating of the second, denyes not the first<hi>:</hi> for he graunts, <hi>Abraham beleeuing God, it was imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for righteousnesse, &amp;c</hi>
      <note n="γ" place="margin">Iames. 2.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, touching the Church<hi>:</hi> The society of the faithfull, which liue by true faith, (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hell gates not possible to preuayle against them) is one thing; and a visible congregation, which may professe Christ by words, and deny him by deeds, another.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, touching Baptisme; the outward Sacrament, the washing of the outward man, is one thing, and the inward grace, the clensing of the inward man, another.</p>
   <p>Fiftly, touching the Eucharist: The outward Sacrament also, foode for the Body, is one thing; and the inward matter, euerlasting life for the soule, another<hi>:</hi> and so foorth in the like.</p>
   <p>Now, the faithfull, knowing well the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in these things, and that the one may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes taken without the other, will neuer permit the aduersary to passe away vncorrected) with any vntrueth therein, be it neuer so little; because from one error, another may ensue; but not possible directly, an errour to proceede from
<pb facs="5"/>
trueth: for Gods word is not both Yea and Nay in one thing, but absolutely Yea, or Nay, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> testifieth <note n="γ" place="margin">2. Cor. 1.</note>.</p>
   <p>As touching the maner of my collecting here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I may iustly auouch it, from the first authors themselues<hi>:</hi> but admit it were otherwise, yet let no man be so vayne, as to thinke the trueth to be of lesse force in one place then in another, but let him rather learne this wisdome from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that although <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or whosoeuer plant and water, yet it is God onely that giues the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of increase<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 6, 7.</note>. </p>
   <p>And because God may giue that heauenly blessing to whom he will, and without respect of persons <note n="γ" place="margin">Ephe. 6. 9.</note>, in hope of the same blessing vpon this my little labour, (rude and harsh in maner and forme, though in substance according to trueth) I will now require no more of thee (courteous Reader,) but that thou wilt permit it thy fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pasport, (and not to reiect the maner of it, more then to respect the matter in it;) in so doing thou shalt declare thy selfe a most faithfull friend to the simple Trueth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not iustly to offend any whosoeuer.</p>
