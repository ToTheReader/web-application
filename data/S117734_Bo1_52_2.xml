   <head>All those that will not reade this plaine Epistle,
Lay downe the Booke, on Gods name, and goe whistle.</head>
   <p>HOnest mens Sonnes (if I giue you a wrong name, I aske your Fathers pardon) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
euery one that eates Mutton, may truely bee suspected for sheepe-biter,
yet I hope my Sheepe shall finde no such dogged dealing amongst you. There are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
three sorts of Creatures, two of which are so much repugnant to a Sheepe, that
I thinke there will neuer be an union betwixt them, which are a wolfe and a Dog;
the third is a Goate, which although they may graze or pasture one with another, as
Christians and Infidels are wouen together in the linsey woolsey web of the World,
yet I did neuer know any kind of familiaritie betweene them. And be thou in nature, a Wolfe, a Dog,
or a Goate, that readst this, I passe not, but I rather pittie thy accursed inclination, then stand in any
feare of thy Butting or Byting: she honest minded Reader shall finde my subiect or Theame both lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
and Honourable: and those who hold the name of <hi>Shepheard</hi> in contempt or derision, may herre
find truly proued, that the whole World doth not now containe, nor euer will retaine any men, who for
Goodnesse, Honour, true Worth, Worthinesse and respect, that can or dare make comparison with the
Shepheards of former Agos. And though <hi>VIRGIL, OVID, MANTVAN,</hi> and many of our learned
English and Scottish Poets, haue made their inuentions trauell vp the top of the forked Mountaine of
<hi>Parnassus;</hi> yet I would haue the Reader know, that if they, each of them had <hi>Argos</hi> eyes, of suruay and
obserue, and as many hands as <hi>Briareus,</hi> to write, yet for all their paines, diligent search and collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,
my weake cpabitie can finde matter enough to make an honest Pamphlet out of what they haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene,
neglected, or made slight account of. Foure things, I haue, doe, and euer will obserue in my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;
which are, not to write prophane, obsceane, palpable, and edious Lyes, or scandalous Libels. In
keeping which Decorum, I hope I shall keep my selfe within the limits or bounds of good men Respect.
And this Aduertisement more I giue the Reader, that there are many things Imprinted vnder the
name of two Letters, <hi>I. T.</hi> for some of which I haue beene taxed to bee the Author: I assure the world
that I had neuer any thing imprinted of my writing, that I was either afraid or ashamed to set my name
as large to it; and therefore if you see any Authors name <hi>I. T.</hi> I vtterly disclaime it: for I am as I
haue bin, both I, and <hi>T.</hi> which with addition of Letters, is yours to bee commanded in any laudableen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours,</p>
