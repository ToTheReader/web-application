   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F thou be ignoraunt (gentle Reader) and desyrous to knowe, either how profitable this Historie of Plantes is, or how wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be studied, either how harde &amp; how highly in times past esteemed, what be the causes of the hardnesse therof, how they may be remedied, and why the Authours hereof (after so many learned both auncient and late writers) tooke vpō him the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of the same: or why in his Innotations &amp; last edition he hath reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked certayne thinges which in the first escaped him: for thy instruction &amp; reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in these matters, I referre thee to the same Authours two Prefaces, wherin he learnedly, &amp; as briefly as the nature of the matters will permitte, discourseth therof sufficiently. But if thou wouldest know of me, why I haue takē vpon me the translation &amp; publication of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same in this our natiue tonge, as I might without any great labour yeelde thee many iust and reasonable causes of my so doing, if I thought it greatly expedient or necessarie so to do: so I thinke it sufficient for any, whom reason may satisfie, by way of answeare to alleage this action &amp; sententions position: <hi>Bonum, quo communius, eo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius &amp; praestantius</hi> a good thing the more common it is, the better it is. Seing then y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> my translation shall make this good &amp; profitable historie (which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath lien hid from many of my Countriemen, vnder the vayle of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen language) familiar and knowen vnto them: and if it be good (as no good man wil denie) to enlarge a good thing, and to make many partakers thereof: then can there not lacke iust cause to be alleaged of this my doyng: neither thinke I, that any will mislike or repine thereat, except such, as either enuie the Weale of others whom they accompt simpler then them selues, and therfore recken vnworthy to be in their owne language made partakers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: or els are so studious of their owne priuate gaine, that they feare, least by this meanes some parte therof may be lessened: whyles others vnderstanding the nature and vertues of Plantes and herbes, shalbe the lesse beholding to their scrupulous skill. But the good and vertuous Phisition, whose purpose is rather the health of many, then the wealth of him selfe, will not (I hope) mislike this my enterprise, whiche to this purpose specially tendeth, that euen the meanest of my Countriemen (whose skill is not so profounde that they can fetche this knowledge out of strange tongues, nor their habilitie so wealthy, as to entertaine a learned Phisition) may yet in time of their necessitie, haue some helpes in their owne, or their neighbours fieldes and gardens at home. If perchaunce any list to picke a quarrell to my translatiō, as not being either proper or not ful, if I may obteine of him, to beare with me til he him selfe shall haue set foorth a better, or til the next impression, and the meane while (consydering that it is easier to reprehend a mans doings, then to amend it) vse me as a whet stone to further him selfe, I wil not muche striue: for I seeke not after vayne glorie, but rather how to benefite and profite my Countrie. Fare well. ({inverted ⁂})</p>
