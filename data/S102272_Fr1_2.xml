                 <title>A Catholike confutation of M. Iohn Riders clayme of antiquitie : and a caulming comfort against his caueat. In which is demonstrated, by assurances, euen of protestants, that al antiquitie, for al pointes of religion in controuersie, is repugnant to protestancie. Secondly that protestancie is repugnant particularlie to al articles of beleefe. Thirdly, that puritan plots are pernitious to religion, and state. And lastly, a replye to M.

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS my defence, against <hi>M. Ihon Rider</hi> (tearmed Deane of <hi>S. Patricks</hi>) contayning <hi>A Catholick Confutation</hi> of his Cauteriated clayme of antiquitie on his syde, and a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming comfort agaynst his pretended <hi>Frendly caueat to Irland Catholicks;</hi> after longing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit vnto you, after loathing to be imployed about it, and after lingring to partake you therwith, Dearly beloued Contrymen, I now present, to your confirmation, and consolation. My longing was nether for any mercenarie respects, nor popular applauds, but only for your aforsaid confirmation, and consolation. My loathing was, to incowntre a spirit of contradiction, esteeming the price of his paynes a countenancing of a falshood, it imported not how impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, yf confidently, and contentiously. My lingring was, by being vacant to recollections vsual among them of my profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and by a doubtful deliberation of my Superiors, whether any further awnswer was due to such an aduersarie, who nether durst permitt that I should imprint this my defence, and whom the right honorable his Maiesties Cownsell pronounced, by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick act, to haue bene an vnfitt aduocat, or proctor, to iustifie their profession, and vnable to ratifie his owne printed allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
   <p n="2">2. But, wheras I am to incountre him in the whole purport of my booke, and also to tender resolutions equally belonging to all Catholicks in general; I thought good in this dedication to you, Contrymen Catholicks, without digression to digresse, in
<pb facs="3"/>
acquainting you of what predecessors you are discended, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks, or Protestāts, holy or impiouse, famouse or obscure: that you be not longer strangers at home, and ignorāt of our different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations; he saying, that your first Christianitie was Protestant, and I auerring that it was only Catholicke, as now this woord and tearme is vsually taken.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Two things I would fayne in the begyning obtayne. First, that none censure my relation in this preface to be of tediouse prolixitie, vntill he pondre how many discussions of doubts it contayneth. Secondly, that during my vnfowlding, admirable, incredible, and hidden secreacies of our Contryes former prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence in Religion, and learning, no Readers would for preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated opinions or erroneouse prescriptions in their myndes, more distrust these records, then they can lawfully disdayne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities by which they wilbe maintayned. Wherfore omitting all remote examinations belonging to our Contryes first inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and other trifels wonted in like treatises to be curiously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred;<note place="margin">The first part of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lāds ould Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> I will only, and abruptly, search, the first Christianitie, and degree of learning, and pietie, of our Christian ancestours.</p>
