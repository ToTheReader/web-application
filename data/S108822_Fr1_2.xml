   </head>
   <p>HErein may Fully, Effectually, and plainly appeare, the iust and true intent of <hi>LEWES,</hi> the (<hi>Now French King,</hi>) in the behalfe, and for the generall good of his <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and all his loyall and true harted Subiects therein: Whereby he earnestly, with a full and well inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Resolution, doth desire, aime at, and intend, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie &amp; most flourishing Estate of that <hi>most Christion King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and well-gouerned people: To the great comfort of them in generall, and assured hope of his most happie Raigne ouer them. To his timely (<hi>Infant beginning, Honour;</hi>) by intending of their Eternall benefites: For which cause, let vs looke home with a speciall eye, vnto the well &amp; due intended Reformation and Execution of these Lawes and Edicts, lately made in <hi>Paris,</hi> by their hopefull King, That hath (as you may hereafter see) not onely renued diuers olde Lawes and Edicts concerning Combats, and other lawes, with speciall remedie for offenders therein: But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hath inlarged and declared the same in <hi>Parliament,</hi> the 18. day of March last. Wherein hee hath also set downe and published for generall good, the very Law of Lawes, or absolute cause and directest meanes of true continuance, and due performance and keeping of these, or other lawes fit for any <hi>worthy Prince</hi> in any <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> made for
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <pb facs="3"/>
good, to be performed and kept according to their true intents, which is performed in this King, <hi>Queene Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, &amp;c.</hi> Assembled in Parliament, fully, freely, firmely, and effectually set downe and made knowne within all that kingdome, to all persons, that they shall be duly iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, absolutely and effectually performed and kept, by all persons whatsoeuer within their iurisdictions, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of any person, For byrth, kindred, affiance, or any other cause whatsoeuer, wherein he also taketh away all hopes of graunts, fauours, pardons, remissions, or any meanes whatsoeuer. To be discharges to any of the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors of the said Lawes; So that those wilfull persons that will presume notwithstanding those good lawes, with so due and effectuall declaration thereof, are well worthie (in my opinion) by the lawes of God and man, for their great presumption therein, to vndergoe and endure the penalties in those, or any other good Lawes contained. These are true, iust, and direct meanes, to shew that God gaue not vnto men lawes in vaine, but that if they would presume to breake or offend against those good lawes by him or his Deputies in any Common-wealth made and ordained, That then those persons so offending, should suffer or forfeit, according to the true intent and meaning of those good lawes, what, when, or wheresoeuer, that without any manner of hope of fauour (to imbolden them therein) they might make and be examples to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to beware to sinne, or offend any iust lawes contrarie to their true intents, for which they weare and are made and ought to be duly and truly performed and kept, for the vpholding of peace, plentie and vertuous actions in generall: And the auoyding and beating downe of sinne and vice in generall, according to the diuine founding, and true intent of good lawes in generall, which God grant may hereafter be well established, redressed, renewed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, performed and kept, within these lands: To the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glorie of God, The honourable and perpetuall memorie of our King, The euerlasting memorie of all the
<pb facs="3"/>
good instruments therein. The beating downe sinne, the rewarding of vertue, the speedie doing of true iustice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene partie, and partie, the most good of this great and flourishing Cōmon-wealth, And happy comfort of all his Maiesties true hearted subiects therein in generall. Blame me not in being long herein, for in some lawfull, and some law lesse proceedings, which some too many, too well knoweth, in many causes, is to great length: All which, I will leaue nowe to touch: And so proceede to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lawes and Edicts lately made in <hi>Paris,</hi> herein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned against the generall wearing of gold and siluer lace, and diuers other sortes of gilt workes, &amp;c. With many other things which they haue found as harmefull weedes or instruments of pride, most idle and vnfitting to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered longer amongst them, to hurt and abuse their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Common-wealth. And I trust in Cod our worthie King and his honorable priuie Councell, with the Lords, Bishops, and Iudges, and other good members of this Common-wealth; will (in due time) of themselues, and by good example from other Princes, make, amend, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, declare, and publish, (to a vertuous end) our good and holesome lawes in this Common-wealth, whereby to banish and beate downe (as in their good discretions shall <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
