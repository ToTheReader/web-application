                 <title>A treatise of metallica : But not that which was published by Mr. Simon Sturteuant vpon his patent, which is now by order cancelled and made voyd, by reason of his standing out-lawed at the time of the grant, and so still continuing, and his neglect, and not performance o the workes. Whereupon priuiledge, by patent, is granted by the Kings most excellent Maiesty, to Iohn Rouenzon, Esquire, for the making of iron, and other mettals and materials with sea-cole, pit-cole, &amp;c. for one and thirty yeares. According to which patent and direction therein, this treatise, composed by the same Iohn Rouenzon, is published in print before the end of Easter tearme, viz. the 15 of May. 1613. And containeth a briefe explanation, demonstration, or discouery of the inuentions priuiledged, and the meanes, instruments, engins, furnaces, &amp;c. with the materials, things, and workes to be made by the said fewels</title>
