   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE truest and securest precepts of <hi>Policie</hi> are those, which either are drawen from the prudent resolutions, or vnadvised errors of great Princes in the deliberations of their most important affaires, or from the study of <hi>Policie;</hi> all consisting in a severe, and iudicious censure of the actions of the <hi>Great:</hi> and the studious in Histories, which haue the gift to know how to examine them well, draw out of them most excellent rules, for the wel-governing of many people: which being very true, it is no marvaile, if the best Writers of matters of State have growen extreamely odious to those that raigne; by reason, that as Princes willingly lend an eare to the praises which happen to be given them, although they come from the pen, or mouth of an <hi>impudent Flatterer,</hi> so likewise they haue in exceeding abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation all censures which are made vpon their actions: it being an insupportable miserie vnto them, that their imprudence, and calamities, should serve for instructions vnto others, not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the like faults. This truth assures me, that these my present <hi>Advertisements</hi> from <hi>Pernassus,</hi> (where in a sporting manner the actions, interests, true ends, and defects of many Princes, not very iust, coming to be censured, touched, discovered, and noted) would bring them infinite displeasure, if they should be openly published. Wherevpon, I, that at any hand will not give disgust
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
to any person private or publike whatsoever, haue fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to keepe them from the Presse, as from the fire: for the length of time maturing things, that, which for infinite respects, in our Age is odious, the present Princes wanting, and those affaires growing olde, which now liue: and that in regard of their importance are held in great ielousie, I hope that these my Labours will then with particular liking bee read of the Vertuous, whom I indevour to please and delight: In the meane time I haue presumed to hide these my Writings in your Lordships Librarie, vnto whom I present them, to the end they may be published to the world at such time as they cannot giue distaste to any one. But then my desires shalbe accomplished, when these my Workes, such as they are, may giue vnto your Lordship that satisfaction, which I so exceedingly desire, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the infinite devotion I beare vnto your Name, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable obligations, wherein I stand ingaged vnto you, which haue created me a debtor vnto you in so great a summe, that if I should spend my whole life in your service, yet I should thinke I had done nothing, but that still I should die ingratefull.</p>
