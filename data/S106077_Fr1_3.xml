   <p>ALthough, gentle Reader, I haue done as the Iay, who decked her selfe with the fethers of other Byrds, to the ende, she might seeme to be the more glorious, yet I doubte not but if euery Byrd should pluck his fether from this my deuise, it would not be left altogither destitute, nor so vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly naked, but ther would yet remayne some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy to be perused, althogh I do know my abylitie to be such, as it is to far insufficient to satisfie thy learned delights, the which hath somewhat abashed mee to become a wryter, yet I doubt not, but wher my pen through ignorāce hath in any place erred, if there thou wouldest vouchsafe, but to supply my wante of skil with my zelous pretence, and my well wylling mynd, it would serue for a mends, sufficiēt to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paise a greater faught, then I trust I haue cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytted: my good will you see, and I doubt not but when thou hast perused the matter through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thou wilt perceiue my good pretence, &amp; beare with my lacke of knowledge. As for those car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping correcters &amp; curious scanners, such as wil soner finde three faughts, then they be able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende one, I may compare them to those, that in the day of battaill, dare not come to the fight themselues, but wil conuey themselues to a hyll, or some sure place to behold other mens doings, iudging who fighteth best, but it is an olde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, he that passeth through a Towne, and wyll throw a stone at euery cur that barketh,
<pb facs="4"/>
shal haue in the ende, but a wery arme, I esteme not therfore of thē, nor of their iudgements, but onely submit my selfe to the friendly reportes of the wyse and learned, and of euery other well disposed Reader, nothing doubting, as I haue sayde, but such wyll beare with my inabylitie, and except of my good wyll, which is all that I craue, and thus farewell.</p>
