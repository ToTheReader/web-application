   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a thing I thinke, good Reade, if not impossible, yet exceeding difficult, for a Minister of Gods word to open his mouth with so much discretion, but that if hee seeke to beate downe the false hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, the weake Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian will come betwixt, and take the blow vpon his owne head, which was neither meant nor due vnto him; and contrarily, if he feeke to raise vp the weake Christian, the presumptuous hypocrite will by and by lay hold on those words, and peruert them quite, to the nourishing of his foolish securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. My care hath beene to tread so euen a path in the following Treatise, that I might not giue any iust occasion to the such mistaking of either party. And I hope I haue so tempered my pen, that the poore Christian shall not (vnlesse in an ouer-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame brunt of tentation) be lesse able to enioy his proper consolation for any thing that hath beene here vttered, to the discarding and amazing
<pb facs="3"/>of hypocrites; nor the hypocrite (vnlesse out of an extreamity of wilfull blindnesse) be able to nestle himselfe warme, in the misapplying of comforts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to those alone, that bee such as hee alone seemeth to be. Now what thou art that shalt reade this booke, I cannot possibly know; and how thou wilt censure of me for it, as I cannot coniecture, so neither will I be carefull or trouble my selfe about it. If thou shalt commend me, I hope I haue a little better insight into mine owne imperfections, than to bee tickled with thy prayses, which perhaps thine ignorance, or partitality may giue, rather than any desert of mine (which I know to bee none at all of any good thing) may call for and challenge: but if thou shalt reproach and dispraise me, sure I should haue both more wit, and somewhat else to doe, than to make any account of thy disliking and censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words; knowing (as I doe know well enough) what thou art, my fellow seruant, not my Master; a fellow-prisoner, not a Iudge. Wherefore if thou beest wise, saue a bootlesse labour of speaking either well or ill of mee; neither of which can aduantage thee, or doe me any good or hurt; and rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow thy selfe in reaping some profit by that which I haue here written, with a desire and intention of profiting thee. If I haue spoken what thou knewest not before, now informe thy selfe: if what thou knewest, but consideredst not, now digest thine own knowledge, and (hauing an addition of one more witnes to the truth thou didst formerly confesse) know it surer, know it better. If I seeme to thee to vtter truth, imbrace it, because it is truth; if to erre,
<pb facs="3"/>consider by what reasons thou canst conuince me, of hauing erred; and let mine errour occasion thee with more firmenesse to cleaue to the truth. In a word, thou mayest (if thou wilt) get some good by reading; if thou wilt not, who can helpe it? And (that I may bee bold a little to touch the sore of those that reade bookes, specially Sermons, which yet there be not many that will reade) let mee put thee in mind, that the common fault of hearers, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to readers also: they heare alone, to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the speakers gifts, or to censure his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: they heare not with any intention of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting their thoughts vpon themselues, to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure themselues, and find out their owne faults. So in reading Sermons, the greater number reade only to see what a man can say: to iudge of his learning, reading, wit, phrase, &amp;c. and to carpe at his defects in any of these. Long enough may such both heare and reade, afore either the pen or the tongue will conueigh any goodnesse into their hearts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou please to bestow paines in perusing these Sermons, reade them with none other inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that one of trying thy selfe, whether thou beest an hypocrite, yea or no; so dare I promise thee some fruit of thy reading: for either (in finding out thine hypocrisie) thou shalt perceiue thine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happinesse, and bee capable of helpe; or else (in meeting with vprightnesse) thou shalt enioy thy good estate, and be encouraged to proceede. Thus with my best prayers to God for thee, and the good successe of all good labours to doe thy soule good, and with a request of reaping one particular
<pb facs="4"/>prayer of thine for me, if thou reapest any good by these lines, I bid thee kindly farewell, and rest</p>
