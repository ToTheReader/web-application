      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen as (ryght Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) I hadde fynished this my rude translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Marcus Tullius Cicero his Booke of old age, begonne and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by me this last yere hauing a quiet time of vacation among my frendes in Chesshyre, therby to exclude and avoyde that lothsome and horrible Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Idlenesse, whych holye Ambrose apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye calleth the Pillowe or Cussyon of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, I called my wittes to counsayle and studyed in my mind to whom my symple trauayle therein employed might beste bee dedicated. Amonge all others, I could find none, vnto whome the whole processe of
<pb facs="3"/>the matter, and the excellencye of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument seemed better to agre, then to your Lordshippe. Vsing therefore the graue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise of the famous Philosopher and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Ethnike (for so doubtethe not Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus to cal him) Seneca, vvho vvilleth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that meaneth to bestovve any gift or present vpon anye maner of person, not onelye to haue a diligent eye and respecte, that his sayd gift be such, as to his estate and degree is meete and agreeable, but also such as to the dignitie and calling of the receauer is apt and conuenable: I humblye offer this litle Treatyse of Olde age vnto youre ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as vnto him, in vvhō Olde age to the great reioycing of al your vvelvvillers most triūphantly flourisheth: trusting, yea rather not doubting, but that your L. vvil as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourablye accepte it, as the noble king Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxerxes (surnamed Memor) did a Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vvhiche one of his subiectes presented him vvithal or as at an other time, hee did a lytle fayre riuer vvater, vvhyche a poore Persian Peazaunte (seeinge manye people
<pb facs="3"/>thicke and threefolde to brynge revvardes to the kinge, and he hauinge nothinge, yet loth to come behinde vvith the significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his poore loyal hearte tovvarde his Soueraigne) offerred vnto him in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovvnesse of his tvvo handes: or (to take an example neerer home, and of a Prynce of later dayes) as the politique and prudent Loys the eleuenthe of that name kinge of Fraunce, did a Radishe roote, presented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym by the handes of his poore vassall and Subiecte Conon the Burgonion. And because besyde a fruictful and learned dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of age, there be herein also enterla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced manye proper conclusions and feactes contryued in the prayse and comendacion of Husbandry, vvherin not onelye meane gentlemen and honourable Senatours, but also mighty monarches and puissaūt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in old time toke great delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, together with a chronologie of diuers heroical and vvorthy enterprises, atchieued partly by martial provvesse, partly by vvise dō and pollicy: these al semed most fit to be
<pb facs="4"/>dedicated vnto youre excellencye, vvho is and of longe time hath bene the principall husband of this famous Realme vnder our royall and soueraigne Princesse, and others her Graces noble Predecessours: vvho also most honourablye and faithfully haue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her highnes and theym in their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and vvaightye affayres booth at home and in other forraine Realmes in great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure and estimation. VVhom God hath blessed vvith so prosperous a race of longe lyfe, to see the Children of your Childrens Children: ympes for their tovvardnes not lyke to degenerate from the vertue of their great Graundfather, neyther to forsake the steppes of their noble Graundfather. Here wil I vvade no farder, to speake any thing, of the vertuous geftes incorporate in your noble breast, partly because it mighte pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raduenture seeme to smel of that vglie vice, vvhiche I dooe and euer haue detested, (I meane Adulation) and partly because they sufficiently cōmend themselues to the eye of the vvorld, in so much that in respect of
<pb facs="4"/>them, my vvordes might be but as it vvere a candle lighted at high noone to helpe the shyning of the bright Sunne at midsomer. VVherfore in receyuing this vvorthy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natoure and his smal traine, vvhom in this Dialogue he entroduceth reasoning and tal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king one vvith an other of the cōmodities and discommodities of old age into youre patrocinie and protectiō (vvhose sugred sē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and pregnaūt style, fraughted vvith a legion of vvitty persvvasions and eloquet argumentes, Penned by that incomparable Phenix of al eloquence among al that euer vvrate either before or since his dayes, I for lack of knovvledge haue racked from gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Elegancie, and oute of Romayne govvnes more boldly I feare then vvyselye chaunged into Englys he Liuerayes) you shal acquire and purchase great praise and glorie. Assuring your self, that in defending and shrovvdinge thē against the poysoned and slaunderous infamyes of serpentine Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophantes, and the cancard assaultes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious tongues, vvhiche seede on no other
<pb facs="5"/>repast but spightful disdaine and hellishe rancoure, your L. shal do a thing (vnlesse I be much deceyued) greatly sounding to the generositie of youre noble hart and highe estate. For vvhat greater praise can there be then to be a patrone of vertue, and of them that are vertuous? Againe, vvherin is the honoure of the Honourable soe much ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished, dymmed and Eclipsed, as in bolste ring vice, and supporting the vvicked? Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept therfore (Right noble Lord this poore earnest penye of my vnfayned good vvil into your tuition, vvherby I shal be any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and encouraged hereafter perhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes to attempte some vvaightier matter.</p>
   <p>In the meane season, humblye and vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly submittinge my selfe and al that I can do, to your Censure and commaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, I surceasse anye longer to trouble you. Beseching God the Authoure and gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of al good thinges, so to infuse his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious giftes into you, that after the Epilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue and last Pageaunt of this mortal and transitorye lyfe (VVherin youre L. vvith
<pb facs="5"/>much vvorshippe, more honour, and most authorytie these lxxxxvi. yeres hath ben a worthye and honourable Actor) you may be tranflated into the ioyes celestial, and be made partaker of his glorious kingdome Amen.</p>
