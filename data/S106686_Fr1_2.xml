      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which was onely priuately compos'd,</l>
   <l>For your delight, Faire Ornament of Worth;</l>
   <l>Is here, come, to bee publikely disclos'd:</l>
   <l>And to an vniuersall view put forth.</l>
   <l>Which hauing beene but yours and mine before,</l>
   <l>(Or but of few besides) is made hereby</l>
   <l>To bee the worlds: and yours and mine no more.</l>
   <l>So that in this sort giuing it to you,</l>
   <l>I giue it from you, and therein doe wrong,</l>
   <l>To make that, which in priuate was your due:</l>
   <l>Thus to the world in common to belong.</l>
   <l>And thereby may debase the estimate,</l>
   <l>Of what perhaps did beare some price before:</l>
   <l>For oft we see how things of slender rate,</l>
   <l>Being vndiuulg'd, are choisely held in store:</l>
   <l>And rarer compositions once expos'd,</l>
   <l>Are (as vnworthy of the world) condemn'd:</l>
   <l>For what, but by their hauing beene disclos'd</l>
   <l>To all, hath made all misteries contemn'd.</l>
   <l>And therefore why had it not beene ynow,</l>
   <l>That Milton onely heard our melodie?</l>
   <l>Where <hi>Baucis</hi> and <hi>Philoemon</hi> onely show,</l>
   <l>To Gods and men their hospitalitie:</l>
   <l>And thereunto a ioyfull eare afford,</l>
   <l>In mid'st of their well welcom'd company:</l>
   <l>Where wee (as Birds doe to themselues record)</l>
   <l>Might entertaine our priuate harmonie.</l>
   <l>But fearing least that time might haue beguild</l>
   <l>You of your owne, and me of what was mine,</l>
   <l>I did desire to haue it knowne my Child:</l>
   <l>And for his right, to others I resigne.</l>
   <l>Though I might haue beene warn'd by him, who is</l>
   <l>Both neare and deare to mee, that what we giue</l>
   <l>Vnto these times, we giue t'vnthankfulnesse,</l>
   <l>And so without vnconstant censures, liue.</l>
   <l>But yet these humours will no warning take,</l>
   <l>Wee still must blame the fortune that wee make.</l>
   <l>And yet herein wee doe aduenture now,</l>
   <l>But Ayre for Ayre, no danger can accrew,</l>
   <l>They are but our refusalls wee bestow,</l>
   <l>And wee thus cast the old t'haue roome for new:</l>
   <l>Which I must still addresse t'your learned hand,</l>
   <l>Who mee and all I am, shall still command.</l>
