      <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F any should aske mee (as mine own thoughts doe) vpon what confidence J adventure in this Censuring Age, the Publishing of this poore ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discourse; I would then answere
<pb facs="3"/> them (as now I doe my selfe) that, when I review and consider the Nakednesse thereof, I cannot va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it worthy of the Title of such a <hi>Mite,</hi> as deseruedly might, when cast into the Treasury, finde accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Nor is it my care and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to please the Humours of those, who can, with sweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, spend that time in Censuring of other mens endeavours, which they might with as good Honesty imploy in the Bettering of their owne. There is a <hi>Carpere vel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li nostra vel ede tua,</hi> which I leaue to their Graue considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vntill such time, as after some long-expected <hi>Parturiunt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> the world happily finde as good cause to laugh at their folly,
<pb facs="3"/> as they at other mens good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Never was J yet taught ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to flatter, or (without offence given) to feare <hi>Mortality,</hi> much lesse to make a <hi>Time-seruing</hi> Disposition the least part of my happinesse; and therefore if any shall thinke it fit to vilify these my weake endeavours, (that there may betweene vs be no loue lost) I shall care as little for their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as they doe, or can, for this my labour. Tis <hi>your</hi> deserving <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> and that in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar towards my selfe, which hath (I may truly say) enforced me thus farre to appeare vnto the world; and therein to expresse that I am ready (though not able) to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence that kinde loue, which by me
<pb facs="4"/> hath beene receiued from you: The beginning whereof I then happily enjoyed, whiles it pleased your good Father, my much Honoured Friend, to commit you vnto my Charge and tuition; in which time, as my small Labours were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly rewarded by a full Hand, so were my true desires towards <hi>You</hi> further encouraged by many pregnant Testimonies of your good and louing disposition, which, since that time, hath fully appeared in many reall expressions. Beside, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will confesse too that your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing goodnesse hath beene fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spread in a willing readinesse towards this your <hi>Colledge;</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring most worthily the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and flourishing estate thereof
<pb facs="4"/> (which stands yet (blessed be the <hi>Highest</hi>) vnquestionable) and still thankefully acknowledging their loue towards you, whose care hath beene imployed in the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the same. So that most here haue some cause, but my selfe most of all, to honour (at the least in a <hi>true desire</hi>) the good Deserts of so worthy a friend. For this cause desiring to devote vnto you some part of my weake and slender labours in testimony of my thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnesse, I haue at the last adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured on this small Parcell; the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect whereof will, I know content you well, as being that, which <hi>your selfe</hi> with your <hi>vertuous Lady</hi> in the goverment of your family, as good stewards, daily
<pb facs="5"/> practise; only my vnworthy moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of so good à <hi>Matter,</hi> might iustly expect to fall short of Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but that I am well assured of your <hi>Goodnesse</hi> therein too. If any shall, for your sake, be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to afford hereto à favourable Aspect, I shall thankefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them my <hi>Courteous</hi> Readers; and to him, that is not purposely Curious, some small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting Benefit may happily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew. Each man, if not wilfully blinde, may see how that <hi>All things</hi> hy Gods disposing Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence become daily <hi>new</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> and that tis therefore necessary, he should in <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Soule</hi> bee <hi>Such</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> However, J am fully assured of <hi>Your</hi> Readinesse in
<pb facs="5"/> embracing a seasonable <hi>Memen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> tending vnto this purpose; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially seeing that as all men haue some cause thankefully to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the <hi>Renewing</hi> of all things vnto them; so <hi>You</hi> much more: Considering that, besides the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant sufficiency of <hi>worldly rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> by the Providence of your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly directed <hi>Father</hi> still flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards you, <hi>God</hi> hath so quickly invested you with <hi>New Dignities</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (Knighthood</hi> and <hi>Iustice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>) imploying you farther in a <hi>new charge,</hi> the <hi>Guidance</hi> of a great <hi>Family,</hi> of which you are made the <hi>Head;</hi> and (which is the Complement of your other feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities) hath seasonably blest you
<pb facs="6"/> with an hopefull <hi>Sonne;</hi> à <hi>Sonne</hi> borne to you by a sweetly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Lady,</hi> who is, both of your Happinesse a ioyfull Partaker, &amp; also a true <hi>Consort</hi> in your loue to Gods words. So that nothing remaines now, but that you <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi> to endeavour (as you haue begunne) the <hi>Renewing</hi> of your <hi>Heart</hi> in <hi>Thankefulnesse</hi> vnto that God, who hath so plentifully crowned you with those <hi>New blessings.</hi> And, that you may thus labour continually to make a sanctified vse thereof, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing of them vnto your selfe, (which otherwise cannot be look'd for) and also the setting forth of Gods glory (who bestowed them on you) you haue for Gods dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb facs="6"/> of your heart, the daily prayers of him, who desires to bee and remaine ever</p>
