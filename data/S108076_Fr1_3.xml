them, &amp; adiudged them, &amp; their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors; The Bishops their Courts &amp; their Chancellors with thē, who doe execute the same; The <hi>theses</hi> or <hi>positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> named &amp; numbred in the page ensewing next the title page, of this <hi>Epitome,</hi> had they infected but some fewe affected to the studie of this lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp; discouraged them therein, it had beene too much: But they take impression in some of our Bishops in some of the Kings dominions (I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept England) of whō some wil haue no vicars generalls, but doe sit (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them) in their <hi>Consistories,</hi> where, by that occasion, whilst they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thinking they determine (well) the causes brought before thē, they determine (ill) many times therein; whose owners thereby, somtimes the widow, sometimes the Orphan, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both, do suffer amongst others:

And no maruell why; For though <hi>Persons, things,</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> all that lawes doe handle, or can handle in the generall, are but 3, for whatsoever law we vse, consists in one of these 3, <hi>Persons, things,</hi> or <hi>actions;</hi> yet there is in each of these so many points of learning in the law, that without the reading or practice thereof, or both, can no man Iudge aright; Iudge he may, and Iudge aright, as he that shootes &amp; hits a marke he sees not; so the blinde man hits the Crowe, as the <hi>prouerbe</hi> is; a fearefull adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Iudgment; will a man adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a <hi>riuer</hi> he knowes not, and knowes there is a danger in it, but knowes not where abouts, without a guide? <hi>A</hi> wise man will not, some ventrous doe; but die, or live, as they hit, or misse the danger; dayly experience teacheth this in

waters; more frequent in Iudgments; wherein the wisdome of the law, hath set a guide, to guide him in Iudgment, in matters of Iudgment of the <hi>Church,</hi> in whō it invests the same in his person, place, or dignity; and hath not the law, nor the practice of it, to Iudge accordingly, by his profession, as our <hi>Reuerend Fathers</hi> the Bishops meere divines, haue not; And therefore haue, or ought to haue their <hi>Vicars generalls</hi> to guide them in Iudgmēt, or guide the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without them, otherwise, if they iudge amisse, or proceede amisse, in Iudgment, and so destroy it, though otherwise iust, as many times they doe, as dayly experience shewes it in our Courtes of Appeales and Quarrells in <hi>Jreland,</hi> they are inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable before GOD, and man.</p>
   <p>That Appeales are made, and
