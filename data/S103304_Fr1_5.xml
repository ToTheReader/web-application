   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE good entertainment which this Treatise of The whole Armour of God,</hi> hath found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Gods people, emboldeneth me againe to publish the same. The same it is for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which thou haddest before: for I find no iust cause to alter any part of the substance thereof. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here and there something hath beene added, to make such points as seemed too concise and obscure, more perspicuous.</p>
   <p>Some there were, that finding the head of <hi>Fasting</hi> in the Table, looked for a distinct and larger discourse of that point, which when they found not (for I did but briefly by the way touch it, as an helpe to Prayer) they entreated mee to take a little more paines thereabout. To their good motion I haue yeelded, and according to my poore abilitie, and little lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, I haue more copiously handled that very-needfull, but too-much-neglected dutie of <hi>Fasting.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I was further informed that the point of <hi>not praying for them that sinne against the Holy Ghost,</hi> would much trouble the consciences of some, if they were not informed in the nature of that sin; and thereupon I haue beene mooued to annex a Treatise concerning that sinne: in handling whereof, lest Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tan should take aduantage vpon weake consciences, from the<pb facs="6"/> fearefull issue thereof, to exclude themselues or others (who haue not fallen into that sinne) from all hope of pardon. I haue (treading in the steps, and following the path wherein Iesus Christ hath gone before mee) with the seuerity of Gods <hi>Iustice</hi> in affording no pardon to that sinne, mixed the riches of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> in offering pardon to all other sinnes: so as this Treatise affordeth more matter of hope and comfort, then of feare and despaire.</p>
   <p>In this Edition there are for thy helpe more distinctions of seuerall points then were before. For that which before was set forth as one Treatise, is now diuided into three seuerall Treatises, and the Treatise of the <hi>Sinne against the Holy Ghost,</hi> added thereto, maketh a fourth.</p>
   <p>These seuerall <hi>Treatises</hi> are also diuided into their distinct
<hi>Parts:</hi> and againe subdiuided into sundry <hi>Sections:</hi> ouer eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of which the summe and head of the matter therein hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is set. Thus both great light is giuen for better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and also a ready way is made for finding out the seuerall points contained in this Booke.</p>
   <p>A Table of all these <hi>Diuisions,</hi> aud of the distinct heads of euery of them is set before the Booke, that if it please thee, thou mayest at once take a briefe view of all.</p>
   <p>That which I especially haue aymed at for thee, is thy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall edification. That which I earnestly desire of thee, is the helpe of thy faithfull prayers.<note place="margin">Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court in <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friers London,</hi> Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 31. 1618.</note> Pray for me</p>
