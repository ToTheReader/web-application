   <head>¶To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> AM loath to woce thee,
by styling thee courteous,
kinde, gentle Reader,
but rather desire, that the
subiect matter of the
Booke might allure thee
to read it. The French
Author thereof, hath intituled it, <hi>TheWise Old
Man:</hi> by which title, hee seemes to implie, that all
are not wise that are old, which if it be so, hee then
seemes to glance at our English Prouerb: <hi>No foole
to the old foole.</hi> Howsoeuer hee lessons both
young and old what they should be. As for my part,
I thinke it not fitting to preface the wholesome docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and instructions contained in it, which as good
Viandes are offered to thy taste, least I should take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
thine appetite to read it, and make thee to surfeit
<pb facs="6"/>
before thou hast fed. All that I haue to doe, and lesse
I cannot doe, is to craue thy fauourable construction
of that I haue done. For I modestly confesse, I haue
beene too ouerweening and bold, to take vpon me to
translate so worthy a Worke, of the worthy French
Author thereof, <hi>Monsieur Symon Goulart,</hi>
my selfe being no higher a graduate in learning, then
a common Grammarian, and no better skilled in the
French language, then what mine owne practise and
study hath enhabled mee to be. But vpon the first
reading of him, I was so delighted, that my fingers
did euen itch to set pen to paper, and to vnclaspe so
good a Worke, which was shut vp from thy vse and
benefit vnder a strange tongue. Make much I pray
thee of him now, because hee speakes to thee in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
and if he speake it not well, I craue thy pardon,
for I am in fault, that haue taken vpon mee, to make
him speake our language, before I well vnderstand
his. Yet I hope I haue hit of his meaning, though I
vary from his wordes, as all Translators must doe.
And now I am a suiter for pardon, I doe wooe thee
by these Epithites of courteous, kinde, gentle Reader,
charitably to censure mee, for taking vpon me, to put
into English so worthy a Worke, with so weake a
hand: which fauour I hope I shall the rather obtaine
at thy hands, for that I haue done it, out of a good
<pb facs="6"/>
will to thee, and not out of any skill in mee, which I
doe disclaime, and therefore I desire to hide mee from
thee, and not otherwise to be knowne vnto thee, then
I am to the worthy Gentleman, to whom I haue
beene hold to commend the patronage of this Worke.
And so I leaue thee (courteous Reader) to God,
and wish thee to be with God, when
thy time is to goe to him, and will
still bee thy well wisher in
all good things.</p>
