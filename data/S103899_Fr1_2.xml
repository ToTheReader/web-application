      <hi>TO MY VERY GENTLE, AND</hi> LIBE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall frendes. M. Barnabe Barnes, M. Iohn Thorius, M. Antony Chewt, and euery fauorable Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ouing M. Barnabe, M. Iohn, and M. Antony, (for the rest of my partiall Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menders must pardonme, till the Print be better acquainted with their names) I haue lately receiued your thrise. curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Letters, with the Ouerplus of your thrise-sweet Sonets annexed: the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallestgiftes, Ibeleeue, that euer you bestowed vpon so slight occasion, and the very prodigallest fruites of your floorishing wittes. Whose onely default is, not your, but my default, that the matter is nothing correspondent to the manner; and miselfe must either grosely forget miselfe, or franckly acknowledge misimple selfe an vnworthy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of so worthy commendations. Which I cannot read without blufhing, repeate without shame, or remember without griefe, that I come so exceeding-short in so exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue great accountes; the summes of your rich largesse, not of my poore desert; and percase deuised to aduertise me what I should be, or to signifie what you wish to be; not to declare what I am, or to insinuate what I may be. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, and Curtesie were euer bountifull in the ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying veine: and it hath bene reputed a frendly Pollicy, to encourage their louing acquaintance to labour the attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those perfections, which they blason in them, as already atcheiued. Either some such intention you haue,
<pb facs="3"/>
by way of Stratageme to awaken my negligence, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle my confidence; or you are disposed by way of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uility, to make me vnreasonably beholding vnto you for your extreme affection. Which I must either leaue vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited; or recompense affection with affection, &amp; recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende me vnto you with your owne Stratageme, fitter to animate fresher spirites, or to whet finer edges. Little o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thervse can I, or the world reape of those great-great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, wherewith you, and diuers other Orient wittes haue newly surcharged me, by tendring so many kinde Apologies in my behalfe, and presenting so many sharpe Inuectiues against my aduersaries: vnlesse also you purposed to make me notably ashamed of my cōfessed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiēcy, guilty of so manifold imperfectiōs, in respect of the least semblance of those imputed singularities. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer your intendiment in an ouerflowing affection was, I am none of those, that greedily surfet Ofselfe-conceit, or sottishly hugge their owne babyes. <hi>Narcissus</hi> was a fayre boy, but a boy: <hi>Suffenus</hi> a noble braggard, but a braggard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      <hi>Nestor</hi> a sweet-tongued old-man, but an Old-man: and <hi>Tully</hi> (whom I honour in his vertues, and excuse in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersightes) an eloquent Selfe-loouer, but a Selfe-loouer. He that thought to make himselfe famous with his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening and brauing <hi>Il'e, Il'e, Il'e,</hi> might perhaps nourrish an aspiring imagination to imitate his <hi>Ego, Ego, Ego,</hi> so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously reiterated in his gallant Orations. Some smirking minions are fine fellowes in their owne heades, and some cranke Princockes iolly men in their owne humours: as desperate in resolution, as the dowtiest ranke of Errant knightes; and as coye in phantasie, as the nicest sort of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pring dam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>ous selues. I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,
<pb facs="3"/>
&amp; who hath not seene some lofty conceites, towring very high, &amp; coying themselues sweetly on their owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting winges, young feathers of old Icarus. The gay Peacocke is woondrously inamored vpon the glittering fanne of his owne gorgious taile, and weeneth himselfe worthy to be crowned the Prince of byrdes, and to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronished in the chaire of supreme excellency. Would Christ, the greene Popiniay, with his newfangled iestes, as new, as Newgate, were not asmuch to say, as his owne Idoll. Queint wittes must haue a Priuiledge to prank-vp their dainty limmes, &amp; to fawne vpon their owne tricksie deuises. But they that vnpartially know themselues; seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine their owne abilities; vprightly counterpoise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes with sufficiencies; frankly confesse, the greatest part of their knowledge, to be the least part of their ignorance; aduisedly weigh the difficulties of the painfull and toyle-someway, the hard maintenance of credit easely gotten, the impossible satisfaction of vnsatisfiable expectation, the vncertaine ficklenesse of priuate Phantasie, &amp; the certaine brittlenesse of publique Fame; are not lightly bewitched with a fonde doting vpon their owne plumes. And they that deepely consider vpon the weakenesse of inward frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the casualtie of outward fortune, the detraction of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, the virulency of Malice, the counter-pollicy of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and a hundred-hundred empeachments of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reputation: that aswell diuinely, as philosophically haue learned to looue the gentlenesse of Humanity, to embrace the mildnesse of Modestie, to kisse the meekenesse of Humilitie, to loath the odiousnesse of Pride, to assuage the egrenesse of Spite, to preuent the vengeance of Harred, to reape the sweet fruites of Temperance, to tread the smooth Path of Securitie, to take the firme course of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce,
<pb facs="4"/>
and to enioy the felicitie of Contentment: that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously haue framed themselues to carry Mindes, like their Bodies, and Fortunes, as apperteineth vnto them, that would be loth to ouerreach in presumptuous conceit: they I say, and all they that would rather vnderly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche of obscuritie, then ouercharge their mediocritie with an illusiue opinion of extraordinary furniture, and I wott not what imaginarie complementes; are readier, and a thousand times readier to returne the greatest Prayses, where they are debt, then to accept the meanest, where they are almes. And I could nominate some, that in effect make thesame reckoning of Letters, Sonets, Orations, or other writinges commendatory, that they do of meate without nourishment, of hearbes without vertue, of plants without fruite; of a lampe without oyle, a linke without light, or a fier without heate. Onely some of vs are not so deuoide of good manner, but we conceiue what belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to ciuill duty, and will euer be prest to interteine Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie with curtesie, &amp; to requite any frendship with frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: vnfainedly desirous, rather to recompense in deedes; then to glose, or paint in wordes. You may easely persuade me to publish, that was long sithence finished in writing, and is now almost dispatched in Print: (the amendes must be addressed in some other more materiall Treatise, or more formall Discourse: and haply <hi>Nashes S. Fame</hi> may supply some defectes of Pierces Supererogation): but to suffer your thrise-affectionate Letters, and Sonets, or rather your thrise-lauish beneuolences to be published, which so farre surmount not onely the mediocrity of my present endeuour, but euen the possibility of any my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture emproouement; I could not be persuaded by any elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or importunacy in the world, were I not as mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously
<pb facs="4"/>
reuiled by some other without reason, as I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiuely extolled by you without cause. In which case he may seeme to a discreet enemy excusable, to an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent frend iustifiable, that is not transported with his owne passion, but relyeth on the iudgement of the learnedest, and referreth himselfe to the Practise of the wisest. In the one, esteeming <hi>Plutarch,</hi> or <hi>Homer,</hi> as an hundred Autors: in the other Valuing <hi>Cato,</hi> or <hi>Scipio,</hi> as a thousand Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. I neuer read, or heard of any respectiue, or conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate person, vnder the degree of those, that might reuenge at pleasure, contemne with autority, assecure themselues from common obloquy, or commande publique reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (mighty men may finde it a Pollicy, to take a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or extraordinary course), so carelesse of his owne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; so recklesse of the present time, so senselesse of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, so negligent in occurrents of consequence, so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in his proceedings, so prodigall of his name, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide of all regarde, so bereft of common sense, so vilely base, or so hugely hawtie of minde; that in case of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous imputation, or vnworthy reproch, notoriously scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered-abroad, thought it not requisite, or rather necessary, to stand vpon his owne defence according to Equity, and euen to labour his owne commendation according to the presented occasion. Discourses yeeld plenty of Reasons: and Histories affourde store of Examples. It is no vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory to permit with consideration, that abused Modesty hath affected with discretion. It is vanity to controwle, that true honour hath practised: and folly to condemne, that right wisedome hath allowed. If any dislike Immodesty indeede, despise vanity indeede, reprooue Arrogancy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, or loath Vainglory indeede; I am as forward with Tongue, and Hart, as the foremost of the forwardest: and
<pb facs="5"/>
were my pen aunswereable, perhaps at occasion it should not greatly lagge behinde. To accomplish, or aduaunce any vertuous purpose, (sith it is now enforced to be stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring) it might easely be entreated, euen to the vttermost extent of that little-little Possibility, wherewith it hath pleased the Greatest to endowe it. Howbeit Curtesie is as ready to ouerloade with prayse; as Malice eger to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw with reproch. Both ouershoote, as the manner is; but malice is the Diuell. For my poore part, I hope the One shall do me as little harme, as fayre weather in my ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: I am suer, the other hath done me more good, then was intended, and shall neuer puddle or annoy the course of the cleere running water. Albeit I haue studied much, and learned little: yet I haue learned to gleane some hādfulls of corne out-of the rankest cockle: to make choice of the most fragrant flowers of <hi>Humanitie,</hi> the most vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearbes of <hi>Philosophie,</hi> the most soueraine fruites of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,</hi> and the most heauenly manna of <hi>Diuinitie:</hi> to be acquainted with the fayrest, prouided for the fowlest, delighted with the temperatest, pleased with the meanest, and contented with all <hi>weather.</hi> Greater men may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, and can atchieue greater matters; I thanke God, I know the lēgth, that is, the shortnes of mine owne foote. If it be any mans pleasure to extenuate my sufficiēcy in other knowledge, or practise, to empeach my ability in wordes, or deedes, to debase my fortune, to abridge my commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, or to annihilate my fame, he shall finde a cold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary of him, that hath layed hoat passions awatering, and might easely be induced to be the Inuectiue of his owne Non-proficiency. Onely he craueth leaue to esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate his credit, and to value his honesty, as behooueth euery man, that regardeth any good: and ifwithall it be
<pb facs="5"/>
his vnfained request, that Order should repeale disorder; moderation restraine licentiousnesse; discretion abandon vanity; mildnesse assuage choller; meeknesse alay arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; consideration reclaime rashnesse; indifferency attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per passion; Curtesie mitigate, Charity appease, &amp; Vnity attone debate: pardon him. Or in case nothing will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with fury but fury, and nothing can winne desired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but pretended hostility, that must driue-out one naile with another, &amp; beat-away one wedge with another according to the Latin Prouerbe; Pardon him also, that in the resolution of a good minde, will commaund, what he cannot entreat; and extort, what he cannot persuade. That little may be done with no great adoo: and seeing it may as surely, as easely be done, I am humbly to beseech established Wisedome, to winke at one experiment of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturous Folly; neuer before embarked in any such actiō, and euer to eschewe the like with a chary regard, where any other mediation may purchase redresse. I will not vrge, what conniuence hath bene noted in as disfauorable cases: it is sufficient for me to pleade mine owne acquitall. Other prayse he affecteth not, that in a deepe insight into his innermost partes, findeth not the highest pitch of his Hope, equiualent to the lowest pit of your commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if by a gentle construction, or a fauorous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, he seemeth any thing in others opinion, that is nothing in his owne Censure; the lesser his merite, the greater their mercy; and the barrainer his desert, the frute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller your liberality. Whose vnmeasurable prayses I am to interpret, not as they may seeme in some bounteous conceit, but as they are in mine owne knowledge; good wordes, but vnfitly applied; frendly beneuolences, but wastfully bestowed; gallant amplifications, but slenderly</p>
