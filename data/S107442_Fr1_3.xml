   <head>TO THE WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull vertuous and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentlewoman, and my appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued louing cousin, Mistris <hi>Euelyen</hi> wife to the worshipfull Maister <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Euelyen</hi> Esquire, one of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Iustices of peace, in the county of Surry the encrease of all outward blessings and spiritual comforts, be multiplyed through Iesus Christ.</head>
   <p>IT is a thing better knowne then well considered of, that in the mysticall body of Christ Iesus, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery member hath his seuerall office, whereon it must attend, the weakest as well as the strongest, and in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the great ruler of heauen and earth, each seruant hath his seuerall
<pb facs="6"/> talent, which hee must employ the meanest as well as the worthiest, for want of greater abilitie, I haue done my best endeauour to shew the way to euerlasting blessednesse, for the doing whereof, I had rather vndergoe the censures of such as are curious, then depriue those of a benefite that are religious and spiritually minded, perhaps I shall be tossed by some with the stormy winds of euill censures, but for them I passe not, so I can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit any: this part of the Psalme I am sure is excellent for the purpose, and <hi>Ierome</hi> doth call this booke of the Psalmes, the treasures of learning. Seeing therefore it was promised that vnder the kingdome of Christ, the meanest or least should bee like vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> therefore trie your selfe if by grace you are partakers of Dauids di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition, recorded in this Psalme, you may be out of doubt that you shall
<pb facs="6"/> be also partaker of his approbation, for the Lord is no accepter of persons what he approues in one, he will also approue another; therfore follow <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> in the practise of Pietie, and then you shal be partaker of his praise which he receiued from God, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall complaint of the world is, that there is no end of making many books because there is little or no fruit in those that reade them; but as the grasse on the house top, which withers afore it commeth foorth, whereof the mower filleth not his hand,<note place="margin">Psal. 129.6.</note> nor the gleaner his lap, neither they which goe by say, the blessing of the Lord be on you, we blesse you in the name of the Lord: therefore read to some purpose, that is, intend of a reader to become a doer, so shall you auert this curse and reproch from you, so shall God and man call you blessed, and blessed shall you feele your selfe in so doing, now
<pb facs="7"/> if you shall lay this to heart in the strength of your yeares, it shall be your chiefest wisedome, for it is religion and godlinesse that shall embalme your name, and make it shine before men, and glorifie your soule amongst Angels.<note place="margin">Luk. 7.37.</note>
      <hi>Maries</hi> boxe of oyntment shall neuer be forgotten, for godlines hath the promise of this life, and that which is to come, and that without it there is no internall comfort to bee found in conscience in this world, nor eternall happinesse to bee hoped for in the next, hoping it shall finde entertainment at your hands, and that you will finde time at your lea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure to peruse it desiring your fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptance of my good meaning in this behalfe, I humbly take my leaue, recommending you to the Lord, and to the word of his grace, the God of heauen so vouchsafe to water you and yours, with the dew of
<pb facs="7"/> heauen, that with the godly man in this Psalme your generation may bee blessed, and that at the end of this life your reward may be true blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which mercie the Lord grant you for his Sunne Iesus Christs sake, Amen.</p>
