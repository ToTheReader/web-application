   <head>TO THE FREND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reader, VVillyam Bulleyn sendeth Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or as mutch good Reader, as foure yeares last past, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysed (in a Booke of myne, called the <hi>Gouernment of health,</hi> whych I dedicated to a Knyghte of great worshyp in the North, called Syr Thomas, the Baron of Hilton) to set forth an other Booke of healthfull Medicines: Euen so, by the space of one yeare next after the same, I trauayled to performe my Promyse made, &amp; so finished my Copy: whych Copy dyd pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe in Shipwracke, &amp; so my Labour was lost. And not only my Labour, but also my Lyfe, by sundry malicious and deuilishe Inuentions, by, and through one William Hilton: in nature, Brother to the foresayd Baron of Hilton, but in Condicions, nothing lyke at all: for hee wanted hys gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; good nature. Now, after that God had deliuered me from the great perill of thys Man, that is to say: conspiring of my giltles death, &amp; hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse lyfe, towards him and hys: Eftsoones this man attempted an other new displeasure agaynst me for debt: colouring hys Malice by a pretence of lawe. By which Action, finally I was imprysoned, me thought a long tyme (for there are but fewe Ghestes, that haue pleasure in sutch Innes.) And being thus in Pryson, me thought I had not onely conuenient tyme, but also a quiet Conscience, to trauel, in renuing my late Booke, or lost Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, whych in deede, I am not able to finyshe, being preuented wyth so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Troubles, and Lets of my sayd Enemy, whose doings at large, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to sylence, least I should seeme to wryte, a Story or Tragedy, or els a description of hys folly, in the place of Phisicke: no lesse also can I, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare some cause of my let, and why my Booke came not forth ere thys tyme. accordingly as I promysed. But blame mee not, good Reader, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I put hym in my Booke, whych would haue put mee from thys Lyfe. And thys Booke, whych I haue done, Gentle Reader, take it in good part, I pray you, for that is my desyre.</p>
   <p>Fyrst, I haue made you a Booke of Simples, as Herbes, Fruictes. &amp;c. For I had no small pleasure in the natures of them, being mooued of the Heathen men, so to do: whose names do, &amp; euer shal remayne, among sutch as read of Simples. <hi>Galen</hi> cōmendeth vnto vs, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> loue &amp; cunning y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      <hi>Orpheus, Museus, Hesiodus, Homerus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rufus Ephesius</hi> had in Herbs. Who can forget <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simachus,</hi> a worthy noble Capitayn to Alexander? who, whē he was woū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded very deepe, found an herb which healed him, &amp; called y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same herb, by his owne name: <hi>Artemisia</hi> a noble Queene, called Mugwort, after hir owne name. <hi>Helena</hi> found fyrst y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vertue of <hi>Enulacampana. Gentian</hi> was named by <hi>Gentias</hi> king of <hi>Illyria</hi>: with many mo noble Men &amp; Womē, which delited
<pb facs="4"/>
in the Flowers, &amp; Fruictes of the groūd whose names for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> most part you shall fynde in the Simples. I cannot forget <hi>Attalus,</hi> the kyng of the lesse <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Euax</hi> a kyng of <hi>Arabie,</hi> who wroate good Bookes to <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour: wyth many good Worckes of Compoundes. Among all, <hi>Dioscorides</hi> a noble Knyght of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whych serued <hi>Antonius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> lyke a worthy Souldiour in the Fielde: and excelled all other in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knowledge of Herbes. &amp;c. Let vs not forget, the passing Wysedome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> who had knowledge most excellent in naturall Phylosophy, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as Morall: and taught the Queene of <hi>Saba</hi> all the vertues of herbs. How worthy were <hi>Archelaus</hi> Kyng of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Agamemnon</hi> Prince of the <hi>Argiues,</hi> whych were noble Kynges, yet were they Heathen, sauing <hi>Salomon.</hi> Whose chiefe delightes, were not in <hi>Bacchus</hi> Bankets, or <hi>Venus</hi> Games: but spent theyr tyme pleasauntly, in the sweete Fieldes amonge Fruictes, Flowers, &amp; Spices of delight. Would GOD in sutch Uertues, the Chrystians were theyr Equalles. When you haue read the Simples following, then approacheth the <hi>Chirurgian</hi> Plaster, and Salue prepared ready, to make whole the wounded Man holpen by <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and <hi>Auicen</hi> to finishe hys cunning cure. Then cōmeth the Apothecarie <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> wyth ryche <hi>Cordials, Pilles, Electuaries,</hi> and Purgations of eche kynde, wyth hys mayster the Physician, who doth dispense euery Medicine in Tyme, Place, Quantity, and good order, to hys Pacient wyth good Diet, trauell, sleepe: and finally, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> perturbacions of the Mynde. At whych place good Reader, I should haue declared of other Iudgements, as Pulse, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryne, and the proper Cures of euery Feuer, afflicting the Body: whych hereafter, by Gods grace, I shall bryng to passe, if tyme wyll suffer mee to lyue. And vntill sutch tyme, most gentle Reader, take this in good part, from the hands of him, who thincketh it well bestowed vpon thee, if curteously thou doe receyue the same agayne. Thus fare thou hartily well. Thyne euer to hys small power.</p>
