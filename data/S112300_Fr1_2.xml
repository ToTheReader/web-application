                 <title>Hay any worke for Cooper: or a briefe pistle directed by waye of an hublication to the reverende byshopps : counselling them, if they will needs be barrelled vp, for feare of smelling in the nostrels of her Maiestie [and] the state, that they would vse the aduise of reuerend Martin, for the prouiding of their cooper. Because the reuerend T.C. (by which misticall letters, is vnderstood, eyther the bounsing parson of Eastmeane, or Tom Coakes his chaplaine) to bee an vnskilfull and a beceytfull [sic] tubtrimmer. Wherein worthy Martin quits himselfe like a man I warrant you, in the modest defence of his selfe and his learned pistles, and makes the coopers hoopes to flye off, and the Bishops tubs to leake out of all crye.

   <head>A man of worshipp / to the men of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship / that is / Martin Marprelate gentleman / Primate / &amp; Metropolitane of all the Martins wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer. To the Iohn of al the sir Iohns / and to the rest of the terrible priests: saith haue among you once againe my cleargie masters. For</head>
   <p>O Brethren / there is such a deal of loue growne of late I perceiue / betweene you and me / that although I would be negligent in sending my Pistles vnto you: yet I see you cannot forget me. I thought you to bee verye kinde when you sent your Purcivaunts about the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to seeke for me. But now that you your selues haue taken the paines to write / this is out of all crie. Why it passes to thinke what louing &amp; carefull brethren I haue / who although I cannot be gotten / to tell them where I am / because I loue not the ayre of the Clinke or Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house in this colde time of Winter / and by reason of my busines in Pistlemaking / will notwithstanding make it knowne vnto the world / that they haue a moneths mind towards me. Now truly brethren / I find you kinde / why ye do not know what a pleasure you haue done me. My worships books were vnknowne to many / before you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>T.C.</hi> to admonishe the people of England to take heed / that if they loued you / they woulde make much of their prelates / and the chiefe of the cleargie. Now many seeke after my bookes / more then euer they did. Againe / some knew not that our brother Iohn of Fulham / was so good vnto the porter of his gate / as to make the poore blinde honest soule / to be a dum minister. Many did not know / eyther that Amen / is as much as by my fayth / &amp; so that our Sauiour Christe euer sware by his fayth: or that bowling and eating of the Sabboth / are of the same nature: that Bb. may as lawfully make blinde guydes / as Dauid might eate of the Shew bread: or that father Thomas tubtrimmer of Winchester / good old student / is a master of Arts of 45. yeares standing. Many I say / 
<pb facs="3"/> were ignorant of these thinges / and many other prettie toyes / vntil you wrote this prettie booke. Besides what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer you ouerpasse in my writings / and did not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say / that I hope wilbe iudged to be true. And so Iohn a Bridges his treason out of the 448. page of his booke / you graunt to be true. Your selues you denie not to bee pettie popes. The B. of sir Dauids in Wales / you denie not to haue two wiues / with an hundred other thinges which you do not gainsay: so that the reader may iudge that I am true of my worde / and vse not to lye like Bb. And this hath greatly commended my worshipps good dealing. But in your confutation of my book / you haue shewed reuerende Martin to be truepenie in deede: For you haue confyrmed / rather then confuted him. So that brethren / the pleasure which you haue done vnto me / is out of all scotche and notche. And shoulde not I againe be as readie to pleasure you? Naye / then I shoulde be as vngrateful towards my good brethrē / as Iohn of Cant. is to Thomas Cartwright. The which Iohn / although he hath bin greatly fauored by the said Thomas / in that Thomas hath now these many yeares let him alone and said nothing vnto him / for not answering his books / yet is not ashamed to make a secrete comparison / betweene himselfe and Thomas Cartwright. As who say / Iohn of Lambehith / were as learned as Thomas Cartwright. What say you old deane Iohn a Bridges / haue not you shewed your selfe thankfull vnto hir Maiestie / in ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing hir supremacie in the 448. page of your booke. I will lay on load on your skincoat for this geare anon.</p>
   <p>And I will haue my penyworths of all of you brethrē ere I haue done with you / for this pains which your <hi>T.C</hi> hath taken with me. This is the puritans craft / in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me to be confuted I knowe: Ile be euen with them to. A craftie whoresons brethren Bb. did you thinke / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> puritans <hi>T.C.</hi> did set Iohn of Cant, at a <hi>nonplus,</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/> and gaue him the ouerthrow / that therefore your <hi>T.C.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias Thomas Cooper bishop of Winchester / or Thomas Cooke his Chaplaine / could set me at a <hi>nonplus.</hi> Simple fellowes / me thinkes he should not.</p>
   <p>I gesse your <hi>T.C.</hi> to be Thomas Cooper (but I do not peremptorily affirme it) because the modest olde student of 52. yeres standing / setteth Winchester after Lincolne &amp; Rochester in the contents of his booke / which blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my / would not haue bin tollerated by them that saw and allowed the book / vnlesse mistres Coopers husband had bin the author of it.</p>
   <p>Secondly / because this <hi>T.C.</hi> the author of this booke is a bishop / and therefore Thomas Cooper / he is a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop / because he reckoneth him selfe charged amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers / with those crimes whereof non are accused but bishops alone / pag. 101. lin. 26. Ha olde Martin yet I-see thou hast it in thee / thou wilt enter into the bowels of the cause in hand I perceue. Nay if you wil commend me / I will giue you more reasons yet. The stile and the phrase is very like her husbands / y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> was somtimes woont to write vnto doctor Day of Welles. You see I can do it in deed. Again / non would be so groshead as to gather / because my reuerence telleth Deane Iohn / that he shall haue twenty fists about his eares more then his owne (whereby I meant in deede / that manye would write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him / by reason of his bomination learning / which otherwise neuer ment to take pen hand) that I threatned him with blowes / and to deale by stafford law: Whereas that was far from my meaning / and could by no means be gathered out of my words / but only by him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>Eulojin</hi> for <hi>Enlogeni</hi> in the pulpit: and by him whom a papist made to beleeue / that the greek word <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logeni,</hi> that is to giue thanks / signifieth to make a crosse in the forhead: py hy hy hy. I cannot but laugh / py hy hy hy. I cannot but laugh / to thinke that an olde soaking
<pb facs="4"/> student in this learned age / is not ashamed to be so impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to presume to deale with a papist / when he hath no grue in his pocked. But I promise you Sir / it is no shame to be a L. bishop if a man could / thogh he were as vnlerned as Iohn of Glocester or William of Liechfeld. And I tel you true / our brother Westchester / had as liue playe twentie nobles in a night / at Priemeero on the cards / as trouble him selfe with any pulpit labor / and yet he thinks him self to be a sufficient bishop. What a bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op such a cardplaier? A bishop play 20. nobles in a night? Whie a round threpence serueth the turn to make good sport 3. or 4. nights amongst honest neighbours. And take heede of it brother Westchester: it is an vnlawfull game if you will beleeue me. Foe / in winter it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to take a litle sport / for an od cast braces of 20. nobles when the wether is foule / that men cannot go abroad to boules / or to shoote? What would you haue men take no recreatiō? Ye but it is an old said saw / inough is as good as a feast. And recreations must not be made a trade and an occupation / <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>a master Martin Marprelate. I tel you true brother mine / though I haue as good a gift in pistle making / as you haue at priemeero / and far more delight then you can haue at your cards / for the loue I beare to my brethren / yet I dare not vse this sport / but as a recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation / not making any trade therof. And cards I tel you though they bee without hornes / yet they are parlous beasts. Be they lawful or vnlawful take heed of them for al that. For you cannot vse them but you must needs say your brother <hi>T.C.</hi> his Amen / that is / sweare by your faith / many a time in the night / wel I will neuer stande argling the matter any more with you. If you will leaue your card playing so it is / if you wil not / trust to it it wil be the worse for you.</p>
   <p>I must go simply and plainly to worke with my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren / that haue published <hi>T.C.</hi> Whosoeuer haue publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<pb facs="4"/> that booke / they haue so hooped the bishops tubbs / that they haue made them to smel far more odious then euer they did / euen in the nostrels of all men. The booke is of 252. pages. The drift thereof is / to confute certaine printed and published libelles. You bestowe not ful 50. pages in the answeare of any thing that euer was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in print. The rest are bestowed to maintaine the belly / and to confute: what think you? Euen the slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inuentions of your owne braines for the most part. As y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it is not lawfull for her Maiestie to allot any lands vnto the maintenaunce of the minister / or the minister to liue vpō lands for this purpose allotted vnto him / but is to content him selfe with a smal pention / &amp; so small / as he haue nothing to leaue for his wife &amp; childrē after him (for whom he is not to be careful / but to rest on gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) and is to require no more but foode and raiment / that in pouerty he might be answerable vnto our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ and his apostles. In the confutation of these points / &amp; the scriptures corruptly aplied to proue them / there is bestowed aboue an 100. pages of this book / that is / from the 149. vnto the end. Well <hi>T.C.</hi> whosoeuer thou art / &amp; whosoeuer Martin is / neither thou / nor any man or woman in England shal know while you liue / suspect and trouble as many as you wil / and therefore saue your mony in seeking for him / for it may be he is neerer you then you are ware of. But whosoeuer thou art I say / thou shewest thy selfe to be a most notorious wicked slanderer / in fathering these things vppon those whome they call puritans / which neuer any enioying common sense would affirme. And bring me him / or set downe his name and his reasons that holdeth any of the former points confuted in thy book / and I wil proue him to be vtterly bereaued of his witts / and his confuter to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stark mad / or a stark enemy to al religion / yea to her Maiestie &amp; the state / of this kingdome. No no / <hi>T.C.</hi> puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
<pb facs="5"/> hold no such points. It were well for bishops / that their aduersaries were thus sottishe. They might then iustly insence her Maiestie and the state against them / if they were of this minde. These obiections / in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation whereof / thou hast bestowed so much time / are so farre from hauing any puritane to be their author / as whosoeuer readeth the book / were he as blockheaded as Thomas of Winchester himselfe / hee may easily knowe them to be obiections onely inuented by the authour of the booke himselfe. For although hee bee an impudent wretch / yet dareth he not set them downe / as writings of any other: for then he woulde haue described the author and the booke by some adient.</p>
   <p>The puritans in deede / holde it vnlawfull for a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to haue such temporall reuenews / as whereby tenne ministers might be well maintained / vnlesse the sayd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenews come vnto him by inheritance.</p>
   <p>They holde it also vnlawfull / for any state to bestowe the liuings of many ministers vpon one alone / especially when there is such want of ministers liuings.</p>
   <p>They holde it vnlawfull for anye minister to be Lorde ouer his brethren. And they holde it vnlawfull for anye state to tollerate such vnder their gouernment. Because it is vnlawfull for states / to tollerate men in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

   <p>They affirme that our Sauiour Christe / hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den all ministers to be Lords / Luke. 22.25.

If you cannot confute my former assertions / you do but in vain thinke to maintaine your selues by slaunders / in fathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vppon the puritanes / the ofspringes of your owne blockheads. And assure your selues / I wil so besoop you if you cānot defend your selues in these points / as al the world shal cry shame vppon you / you think protely to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape the point of your Antichristian calings / by giuing out that puritans hold it vnlawfull for her maiestie to leaue any lands for the vse of the ministers maintenance, I cannot but commend you / for I promise you / you can shift of an haynous accusation very pretily.</p>
   <p>A true man bringeth vnanswerable witnesses against a robber by the high way side / &amp; desireth the iudge / that the lawe may proceede against him. O no my Lord saith the thiefe / in any case let not me be dealt with. For these mine accusers haue giuen out / that you are a drunkard or they haue committed treason against the state: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you beleeue my slander against thē / that they may be executed: so when I come to my trial / I shalbe sure to haue no accusers. A very prety way to escape / if a man could tel howe to bringe the matter about. Now bretheren bishops / your manner of dealing / is euen the very same. The puritans say truly / that al Lord bishops are pety Antichristes / and therefore that the magistrates ought to thrust you out of the common welth. Nowe of all loues say the bishops / let not our places be called in question / but rather credit our slanders against the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans / whereby / if men would beleeue vs when we lie / we would beare the world in hand / that these our accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers are Malcontents and sottish men / holding it vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the maiestrat to alott any lands for the ministers portion / and vnlawful for the minister to prouide for his family. And therefore you must not giue eare to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations
<pb facs="6"/> of any such men against vs. And so we shal be sure to be acquited. But brethren doe you thinke to be thus cleared? why the puritans hold no such points as you lay to their charg. Though they did / as they do not / yet that were no sufficient reason / why you being pettye popes / shoulde be maintained in a christian common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Answeare the reasons that I brought against you: otherwise / Come off you bishops / leaue your thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes / and content your selues with your hundreds / saith Iohn of London. So that you do plainly see / that your Cooper <hi>T.C.</hi> is but a deceitful workeman / and if you commit the hooping of your bishopricks vnto him / they wil so leake in a short space / as they shalbe able to keepe neuer a Lord bishop in them. And this may serue for an aunswere vnto the latter part of your booke / by way of an Interim / vntil more worke for Cooper be published.</p>
