resounded by this voyce

passages thereof.</head>
   <p n="1">
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Spirit of God (by summoning all
Estates, and exempting none) preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
that wretched preuarication of all
rankes, and conditions of man-kind, now
adayes, whereby they vse so frequently,
and so foolishly to cast, translate, and bandy the sinnes of the
time from one to another.</p>
   <p n="2"> Iudgement begins at Gods owne House, and Church-men
if they offend but as others, yet shall they be punished
(euen because they are Church-men) more then others, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they repent.</p>
   <p n="3"> In a religious Common-wealth, the common people are
encompassed with blessings from God on euery side, from the
Church, and from the Court, both set vp by God for bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
to their soules, bodies, goods, and good names.</p>
   <p n="4"> No dignity of person, nor preheminence of place, is
exempted, or excepted from Gods iustice, but euen the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ones that offend, are often more euidently, more exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily,
and more seuerely punished then others of inferiour
ranke and condition.</p>
   <p n="5"> It dearely and nearely concernes all degrees in Court,
Church, and Common-wealth, that they attend as well to
<pb facs="9"/>
the ripping vp of their sinnes, and to the Denuntiation of
Gods Iudgements for the same, as to the Promulgation of
Gods mercies, that all Estates hauing a sence, and sight of
their iniquities, may breake them off by repentance, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
pardon by Iesus Christ our Lord.</p>
   <p n="6"> No voyce, nor rebuke of God, or good men laying
forth the hideousnesse, and horror of sinnes neuer so often
to the view of the conscience, can preuaile with the mighty
hunting <hi>Nimrods</hi> of this World, to restraine their rage,
and furious madnesse, but still they make their greatnesse
in Church, Court, and Common-wealth, baties, and guiles for
their gaine and glory.</p>
   <p n="7"> God of his endlesse, boundlesse, and bottomelesse pity,
compassion, and mercy, for Christ his sake, doth fauourably
and fatherly premonish before he punish.</p>
