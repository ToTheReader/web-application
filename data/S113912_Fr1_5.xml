   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which J intend in this treatise, is, to shew that there are many Christian Churches as well in <hi>Europe,</hi> as in the other parts of the world, that doe not adhere to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, nor acknowledge the Pope for their head. Invaine therfore, and to no purpose, doe many of that party run up and downe the world, and cry up the Church of Rome, for <hi>that one, holy, catholicke Church,</hi> which is so assisted by the holy Ghost that it cannot erre, whē she is indeed but a member (and no sound one neither) of that body; as being miserably infested at this day (which also the learned and sober men amongst themselves cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) with many new &amp; fond opinions, and with superstitious practices not a few.</p>
   <p>The Greeke Church may, for ought I
<pb facs="14"/>know, by the same reason say, that she is that one <hi>infalible, Catholicke Church,</hi> that all are Schismatickes that cōmunicate not with <hi>her,</hi> &amp; that out of <hi>that church</hi> there is no salvation to be had. One thing Iadde by way of caution: J haue cited many of the opinions &amp; practices of those Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that live in the Easterne, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of the world, but J doe not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to justify them in every particular; J would not be so understood: it sufficeth for my present purpose, to shew, that many Millions of Christians in the world, differ from the Papists, J, and that in the most of those things, wherein they, and we do disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, &amp; which is the maine of all, that few, or none of all these doe acknowledge the Church of Rome for their Mother, or have any dependance on her.</p>
   <p>The God of peace make peace in Christendome, and grant that all they that confesse his holy name may agree in the truth of his holy word, and live in unity and godly love. Amen. So prayeth</p>
