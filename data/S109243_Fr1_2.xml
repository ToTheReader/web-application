      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S no argument more proueth the excellency of
Poesy then the contempt is throwne upon it by
silken gulls and ignorant Cittizens, so there
is no blemish taketh from the beauty of this onely <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehending-art,</hi>
so much as the same where-with
her owne professors brand her, for I may truely vary that
of the <hi>Tragoedian, Quemcun{que} poetam vides, miserum
dicas,</hi> I speake it especially in regard of that free title
better times allowed this heauenly Science, now made
captiue by each vnworthy hand; in recouery whereof I
haue, so farre as my weake power extended, procured the
publishing this oppressed and much martird <hi>Tragedy,</hi>
not that I promise to my selfe any reputation hereby, or
affect to see my name in Print, vsherd with new praises,
for feare the Reader should call in question their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that giue applause in the action; for had this wind
moued me, I had preuented others shame in subscribing
some of my former labors, or let them gone out the in diuels
name alone: which since impudence will not suffer, I am
content they passe together; it is then to publish my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
concerning the wrong of worthy personages, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with doing some right to the much-suffering Actors
that hath caused my name to cast it selfe in the common
rack of censure, accompanied with so weak comforts, as this
Triuiall worke can giue it, and that my gratitude may be
in the first place, I must in dispight of any iustly neglected

      </gap>nicke confesse to haue receiued so much worthy respect,
&amp; approued so much generous honesty in thē, that with any
indifferent hazard, I will study to make good their losse,
and my gratitude. I write this, led by no Mercinary
hopes to share in their Fortunes, which hath so put out
somes eyes, that measuring others sight by their owne
weakenesse gaue her out for blind; but led by that spirit
knoweth no sinne equall to ingratitude: As for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
imputation, granting all obiections, I cleere my selfe
by these two positions, <hi>No man can faine any ill of a
Parricide,</hi> the greater alway including the lesse; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so tollerable, especially in Oratory, which is an vnse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
branch of Poesy, that it subsists not without ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauation;
the second is, <hi>No man can intitle another to
his crimes,</hi> for, <hi>Alia est cognatio culpae, alia sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
from which I so farre abhorre, as my owne discent is
not obscure but generous, if this will not giue satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
know I liue vnder too safe a law to feare the stab of a
Rouing boy, and for any wrong, <hi>Equo marte,</hi> I forgiue it,
daring thus far to boast my knowledge, that I cannot be a
coward, I write succintly, knowing the bounds of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
the rather because I wish no other perusers, then those
to whom I dedicate my selfe; though herein I speak against
the Printers profit, if these accept my impolished labours,
I promise the next shall be coockt for the stomacks of the
Criticall, messe it selfe. <hi>Sanabimur si separemur a coe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
