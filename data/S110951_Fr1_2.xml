CCCCC. xlv. Wrytten for the pleasure of the moost noble prynce and lorde, lorde Frederyke coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye Palatine vpon Rhene, duke in Bauary. &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doubte not most noble and benigne lorde, but that your highnes kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the texte of Moses in hys fyrst booke enty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Genesis, wherin he sheweth and declareth that God almyghty created all thynges of nought, &amp; of none other thyng but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by hys deuyne worde &amp; breath of hys mouth, made all thys whole vnspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able worke of heauen, earth, the sea and al that in thē is conteyned, aswel visyble as inuisyble: &amp; that he doth yet styl with out ceassing or intermission worke what soeuer is done amōge al his cretures by the same his deuyne power. For in such
<pb facs="3"/> wyse hath god (as ye wolde say) inward<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly powred him self into al his creatures that al men (onelesse they be clene desty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of syght, or voyde of al reason) may se that God is contynually with vs, and that he gouerneth and susteyneth all his creatures by certayne meanes, and she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth his diuine goodnes emonge al his creatures by the heauenly influences. And thys poincte also the moost wyttye and lerned men, I meane naturall Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, haue after a sorte wel percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and through their awne reason and cleare wyt haue so ferre atteigned, that they haue agreed in thys, that there is one only God, &amp; that al creatures are by one certaine excellent diuine sapience ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, vpholden and susteyned. And these Phylosophers also haue come so nyghe to the verite, &amp; to the knowledge of God in their hygh contemplacions, that they haue determyned and auouched al thys
<pb facs="3"/> whole, wonderfull, fayre and ineffable workemanshyp of God, as namely the heauens, the sonne, the moone with all other sterres and creatures, to haue ben created and made by the hyghest artify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer &amp; chefe fourmer of al thynges. which God moost entyrely loueth mākynde &amp; fauoureth the same, because he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graued &amp; enplāted in the hartes of men his diuine wyl &amp; pleasure by the light of nature &amp; the enducyng of the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; hath made mankynde an image like vnto him self, &amp; his sprite immortal incomprehensyble, &amp; quycke or swyft of knowlege, much apt to cōtemplacion, &amp; euermore hauing minde to his oryginal that is to God and to thynges ghostly, prone, diligent, fayne, &amp; much desyrous. ¶ He hath furthermoe so sensybly &amp; vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sybly clothed &amp; couered the soule, with fleshe, bloud &amp; other materiall substaūce taken of the earth, and made it sēs<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>le &amp;
<pb facs="4"/> perceyuable to the sence of touchynge, that it loueth earthly, trāsytory, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or mundayne thinges. Plato auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth man to be the soule onely, whiche soule hath the body but as a certayne ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bernacle and instrument. And whā it is infused into the body, it is as ye woulde say obscured or darkened &amp; (as it were) enbraked or enprisoned in a derke dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, so that it forgetteth all heauenly thynges, &amp; maketh searche to inquire of thinges vnnecessarie, as what God doth in heauen, &amp; what thynges men dooe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them selues: &amp; not what thinges God worketh emōg vs in the worlde by his creatures, as namely of the skye, the sunne, the moone, &amp; the other planettes and of the whole fyrmament, where the heauēs selfes neuertheles shewe fourth hys ryghteousnes, as wytnesseth the Psalmest, in suche wyse that al thynges cha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="4"/> folowe &amp; ensue by the course &amp; influence of the sky, &amp; by the reuolucion of planet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes &amp; of the stars fyxed. All which thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges although thei be vnto your excellē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy manifest &amp; by your owne experiēce suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficiently knowen, yet ye may somewhat more clearely vnderstande &amp; perceiue as wel by this pronosticaciō of mine, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by the practises of other mē that haue wryttē in this kind: that the Eclypses of the two great lightes, &amp; of the other syg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in heauē, without doubte do induce &amp; sygnifye great perels, of the worlde, &amp; dissensyons emonge those persons that haue the power of the world, &amp; be rulers &amp; gouerners in the same: which thing is of me in the chapters here ensuinge in this lytle worke of my practyse in many places shewed &amp; declared. ¶ And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much also as I know most noble prince your highnes by reson of your noble ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tues mete to be in a prīce: &amp; furthermore
<pb facs="5"/> by reason of a singuler prudence geuē to you of God, that ye haue a specyal incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion, &amp; a singuler affeccion towardes experyence, and towardes all artes. I haue thought it best in presētynge myne obeisaūce &amp; seruice, to dedicate thys my Pronosticacion vnto your hyghnes, hū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly besechyng that the same wyll accept and take in good part this my lytell la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. If at any time I can do plesure vn to your hyghnes in greater thynges, I acknowledge my whole studye, dyligēce and trauayle boūde thervnto, yea and promise my self also to be both prompt &amp; ready from tyme to tyme. In the meane whyle, besechyng that God almyghtye wyll longe, kepe and gouerne your high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes prosperously in reast and peace, and lucky state of al thynges.</p>
