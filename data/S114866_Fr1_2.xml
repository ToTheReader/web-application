      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader seeing the Holy-ghost hath lefte us an honourable memory of Davids worthies who helped him to attaine his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 11.</note> who was but a type of our King Iesus Christ, I think it necessary to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest some of those famous doctrines this servant of Christ M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. John Forbes taught in his life time, touching the right of Christ Iesus, which God the father gave him to ordaine all things in his Church. This truth of God he witnessed more than <hi>30.</hi> yeares, not onely unto the losse of his living, and unto bonds; but also unto banishment, for defending that it is not lawfull for anie Prince or Potentate to commaund anie human devises, for to compell them to be used in the worship of God, and for mainteyning
<pb facs="3"/>
this endured these great tryalls. And about <hi>4.</hi> years after he was chosen preacher to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paine of the English Merchant Adventurers, and after he had served them <hi>22.</hi> years he was displaced by our King, and shortly after the Lord tooke him out of this world, he having served in the Ministery <hi>42.</hi> years, he now (as or hope is) is with the assembly of those which have been killed for the Word of God, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie which they mainteined, who doe cry, <hi>How long Lord, which art holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our bloud on the persecutours of thy truth</hi>? But this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is thought strange unto the world, for the Papists doe say, that the Pope hath authority to institute ceremonies in the Church, which he himselfe doth judge fit, and our prelates, with their doctours, doe affirme that Princes and Potentates of the world have authority with the assembly of their Bishops, to institute ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, rites, and orders, such as they doe judge fitting to worship God by, and they are indued with deep Philosophie, and learned arts, which I doe confesse are good, so as they be allwaies ruled by divine truth, but otherwise we are
<pb facs="3"/>
commaunded to avoyd them Col. <hi>2.18.</hi> And the Holy-ghost calleth them, when they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to divine truth <hi>the deep learning of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> as he hath in this epistle manifested. Against them both this servant of IEsus Christ doth clearly manifest, that no human devises or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that Christ hath not appointed for his worship, may be used in his worship, for <hi>God the Father hath placed him farre above all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallities, and powers, and might, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and every name that is named, not onely in this world but also in that that is to come,</hi> as the Holy-ghost doth shew us in manie places, and that Christ is King and ruler in his Church.</p>
   <p>Pilate and Caesar were content that Christ should be accounted High priest of his church, and that he should be their Prophet, but for him to affirme he is a King, that cost him his life, Caesar could not indure it: So in this age, princes cannot indure that his church should receive no ordinaunces and decrees but those that the Apostles established, for they will have their own superstitions used in the worship of God, yet here the Holy-ghost doth sereously condemn it, and that Christ must have the whole prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
<pb facs="4"/>
in his worship, and that his ministers must maintein this, as they will answer it at his glorious appearing, to judge all the world, these sermons doe manifest this strait charge hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Holy-ghost to withstand all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man superstitions which are brought into Gods worship, they were taken by pen, by one of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary hearers, the chief of these I had in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting two years before he departed this life, and I shewed them to him, and I tould him I would publish them without naming anie authour, he answered if I did publish them, the adversaryes would know it to be his worke, to which I ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, that then I would not publish them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I did survive him.</p>
   <p>If all the sermons this reverend divine taught out of this epistle were published, it would be proffitable unto this generation, and to that to come, for he doth manifest that as God by Moses ordayned him to be his penman to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his church under the law: So Christ hath made this Apostle his penman to appoint what ordinaunces his church must practise untill his second appearing, and that with the straitest charge we doe read of, that his servants may not
<pb facs="4"/>
admitt of anie other devices to be brought into his worship, as they wil answere it at the great and dreadfull appearing of all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jesus Christ, with his holy Angells, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence all opposers of his truth according to their works.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>This Author doth mention that in all Ages God hath had his faithfull witnesses as in the 48 page appears, and Mr. Foxe hath instanced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and here I think fitt to ad some others, in the dark time of Popery, which hee hath not.</hi>

   <p>Doctour <hi>Fulck</hi> in his answere to the Rhemish Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, doth say, that the Church of <hi>Leodium,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, was under great persecution under <hi>Pope Pascus,</hi> for affirming him Antichrist.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Iesuite</hi> saith that one <hi>Cesarius</hi> writes, that ihe doctrine of these <hi>Waldenses</hi> was spread in more then a thousand cities, and that they had an army of <hi>70000.</hi> that were destroyed by <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Momford,</hi> with a small armie: but there is no mention of an armie, which they had in the Chronicles.</p>
