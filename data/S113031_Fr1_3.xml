      <l>So cocker'd vp in mischiefe? or hast bin</l>
      <l>Train'd vp by Furies in the schoole of vice,</l>
      <l>Where the licentious Deuils hoyst the price</l>
      <l>Of vncought mischiefe, &amp; make a set reward,</l>
      <l>For hell-hound slanderers that nought regard</l>
      <l>Their reputation, or the wholesome Lawes</l>
      <l>Of Vertues Common-wealth, but seek applause</l>
      <l>By rayling and reuiling to depraue</l>
      <l>The mirrour of Creation, to out-braue</l>
      <l>Euen heauen it selfe with folly: could the straine</l>
      <l>Of that your barren-idle-donghill braine,</l>
      <l>As from a Chymick Limbeck so distill</l>
      <l>Your poyson'd drops of hemlocke, and so fill</l>
      <l>The itching eares of silly swaines, and rude</l>
      <l>Truth-not-discerning rusticke multitude</l>
      <l>With sottish lies, with bald and ribald lines,</l>
      <l>Patcht out of English writers that combines</l>
      <l>Their highest reach of emulation but to please</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="5"/>The giddy-headed vulgar: whose disease</l>
      <l>Like to a swelling dropsie, thirsts to drinke</l>
      <l>And swill the puddles of this nasty sinke:</l>
      <l>Whence through the channels of your muddy wit,</l>
      <l>Your hotch-potcht work is drawn and the slimy pit</l>
      <l>Of your inuectiue pamphlet fild to th'brim</l>
      <l>With all defiled streames, yet many swimme</l>
      <l>And bath themselues (oh madnes) in that floud</l>
      <l>Of mischiefe, with delight, and deem that good</l>
      <l>Which spoyls their reasō, being not vnderstood.</l>
      <l>When people view not wel your diuellish book,</l>
      <l>Like nibling fish they swallow bait and hooke</l>
      <l>To their destruction, when they not descry</l>
      <l>Your base and most vnreuerent blasphemy.</l>
      <l>How in the ruffe of fury you disgrace</l>
      <l>(As much as in you lies) and doe deface</l>
      <l>Natures best ornament, and thinkst th'ast done</l>
      <l>An act deseruing commendation;</l>
      <l>Whereas thy merits being brought in sight,</l>

      <l>Woman the crowne, perfection, &amp; the meanes</l>
      <l>Of all mens being, and their well-being, whence</l>

      <l>Wherein the bodies frame, th'intellect and mind</l>
      <l>With all their operations doe first finde</l>
      <l>Their Essence and beginning, where doth lie</l>

      <l>And admiration of such glorious wits,</l>
      <l>Which Fame the worlds great Herauld sits,</l>
      <l>Crowning with Lawrel wreaths &amp; Mittle bows,</l>
      <l>The tribute and reward of learned browes,</l>
      <l>And that this goodly peece of nature be</l>
      <l>Thus shamefully detested, and thus wrong'd by thee.</l>
      <l>How could your vild vntutour'd muse infold</l>
      <l>And wrap it selfe in enuious, cruell, bold,</l>
      <l>Nay impudent detraction, and then throw</l>
      <l>And hurle without regard your venom'd darts</l>
      <l>Of scandalous reuiling, at the hearts</l>
      <l>Of all our female sexe promiscuously,</l>
      <l>Of commons, gentry, and nobility?</l>
      <l>Without exceptions hath your spungie pate</l>
      <l>(Voyd in it selfe of all things but of hate)</l>
      <l>Suckt vp the dregs of folly, and the lees</l>
      <l>Of mercenary Pasquils, which doe squeese</l>
      <l>The glaunders of abuses in the face</l>
      <l>Of them that are the cause that humane race</l>
      <l>Keepes his continuance: could you be so mad</l>
      <l>As to depraue, nay to call that bad</l>
      <l>Which God calls good? can your filthy clawes</l>
      <l>Scratch out the image that th'Almighty drawes</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="6"/>In vs his pictures? no! things simply good,</l>
      <l>Keep stil their essence, though they be withstood</l>
      <l>By all the complices of hell: you cannot daunt</l>
      <l>Not yet diminish, (how ere you basely vaunt,</l>
      <l>With bitter termes) the glory of our Sex,</l>
      <l>Nor, as you michingly surmize, you vexe</l>
      <l>Vs with your dogged rayling, why! we know;</l>
      <l>Vertue oppos'd is stronger, and the foe</l>
      <l>That's queld and foyld, addeth but more</l>
      <l>Triumph to th' conquest then there was before.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Wherefore be aduised, cease to raile</l>
      <l>On them that with aduantage can you quaile.</l>
