      <hi>TO THE MOST Illustrious and Mightie Prince CHARLES, Prince of Great</hi> Britaine, <hi>Grace in this life, and Glory in the life to come.</hi>

   <opener>
      <salute>Religious and most gracious PRINCE.</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Treatise, that chiefely concerneth Christ Iesus, and directeth to him, the Prince of all glory and of our saluation; doth most fitly belong to you a Prince of such worth, and of so great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. Let it please your grace therefore fauourably to accept of the
<pb facs="5"/>same, which with all humilitie and submission, I one of your meanest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants doe present vnto your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: By such acceptance, as you will giue to the world, notable and comfortable testimonie, that you are an earnest imitator of the godly cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of your pious and Princely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Paterne and a Patrone of godlinesse and learning, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by a
<note n="*" place="margin">Idenius in discursu de virtutibus Principum, in Epistola nuncupat.</note> stranger is iustly called, <hi>Nostri huius saeculi miraculum,</hi> and to whom we may speake, as <hi>Varus Germinus</hi> that Orator said to <hi>Caesar</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Caesar, qui apud te audent dicere, magnitudinem tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ignorant; qui non audent, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitatem.</hi> So you will also giue euident and ample declaration, that you are an happie follower of your
<pb facs="5"/>heauenly Father, your most blessed Creator and Sauiour,
<note place="margin">Psal. 113.5.</note>
      <hi>who hauing his dwelling on high, abaseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to behold the contemptible things of this earth, who did graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously receiue
<note n="*" place="margin">Mar. 12.43.</note> two mites from a poore widow, and of whom a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde is accepted according to that a man hath,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.12.</note> and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he hath not?</hi> But if any shall say, that by presenting these small trauels to so high a Prince, I doe presumptuously, and that by publishing them in such a learned na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I doe superfluously: This, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, is the comfort encouraging me, that goodnesse (God be thanked) in your sacred person is conjoyned with greatnesse, that Courtesie and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie in you, doe grow vp with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb facs="6"/>and eminency, hoping assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your Grace will be well content, to suffer me patiently at this <hi>one</hi> time to write to you: who at <hi>all</hi> times (as <hi>my</hi> bounden duetie requireth) shall ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly pray for you,
<note place="margin">Psal. 20.4.</note> euen <hi>that the great God may grant you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your heart, and fulfill all your purpose,</hi> for his glory and your eternall felicitie.</p>
   <p>Againe, if it be said, that I come with the dimme light of a small can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, where many bright torches are already shining, and with a rurall pipe where many siluer trumpets are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodiously sounding: This is my heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the most learned and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, are the most modest and gentle censurers, they wil reuerence the grace of God, euen in his simplest seruants;
<pb facs="6"/>the most iudicious and spirituall with
<note n="*" place="margin">Vacui la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boris inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus aliorum, &amp; omnem collocant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peram su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, vt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendant quod queant reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere.</note>
      <hi>the spirit of meekenesse,</hi> will take in good part the vnworthy labours of their inferiours, in any way tending to the edification of the Church of Christ Iesus.</p>
   <p>Now in the humblest manner I can deuise, I craue your Princely pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, pardon for my boldnesse and presumption; and prostrate vpon the knees of my heart, I instantly beseech the Almightie and most mercifull God to blesse your highnesse, <hi>with heauenly
<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 49.25.</note> blessings from aboue, with blessings of the deepe that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beneath;</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.29.</note> that the soule of our hopefull Prince <hi>may be bound in the bundle of life</hi> with the Lord thy God, who will teach your Highnesse by his holy Spirit,
<note place="margin">Psal 17.8.</note> and keepe you as
<pb facs="7"/>the apple of his owne eye, and satisfie you with long life, and glorifie you with endlesse saluation in his heauenly kingdome for euer,
