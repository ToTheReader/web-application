   <opener>
      <salute>Good Reader,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is no new thing, (for stuffe and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) which I offer to thee in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing tract: how can I, in an Argument of this nature, wherein the obiect deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the minde and pen of the Writer? If therefore nouelty be thy ayme, saue thy labour. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the manner and order of expression, this I would say, That as the Ancients, looke what they desired to fasten vpon themselues or their children, they were wont to conueigh it in the familiarity of a Song or Rime, that it might become their owne with ease: So doe I heere, vnder the ease and familiarnesse of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme, (which is no other then a forme of godlinesse) reach out to thee and thine, a direction to Heauen, so that if hereby the truth as it is in Iesus, may be emplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in thy spirit in any measure, I haue my desire. Thou wilt say, Who-euer denyed but Catechisme serues to this end? I answere, I wish that the practice of all that catechize and are catechized did approue it. The slight
<pb facs="3"/> answer of men betrayes them, who being asked, If their Minister did preach to day? answere, No: hee did but Catechize: If the Preaching of a Catechist were conceaued as his best worke, could men so speake? No surely, were Catechizing vsed to such solemne ends, none but barbarous and blynd ones could be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the eminency and fruit thereof. I taxe none: I onely adde, As I blesse God that Catechizing is so frequent, and that there are many able Preachers who ayme at a profitable course: So I wish that all who do not, would follow such examples.</p>
   <p>As touching you, my Christian Auditors: You know, one full third part of my poore labors hath beene thus (and in this order and ayme) to Catechize. And whereas <hi>Iob</hi> serued in the preaching hereof, that the particulars grew to a larger extent then I looked for; you know that once a yeere at least, I gaue you a briefe view of all the parts in a few Sermons. Which course because I saw to be profitable then: therefore (bethinking my selfe now in this my priuacy, how I might witnes the continuing care of my heart for your good) I haue conceaued the reuiuing of that Method, to be the best way to recommend my loue vnto you. Written copies I saw would prooue so chargeable, that few would haue enioyed any benefit heereof: and threfore I yeelded for your ease (to that which my selfe would haue shunned) to print the Copy.</p>
   <p>I proceeded, you know, (in my Ministery) towards the end of the Satisfaction, being the second Branch of the second part. I haue by my labor since (with Gods blessings) added the rest of the Parts and their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb facs="3"/> to the end: handling both one and other (for the most part) according to the proportion of my larger course: at least few points of Substance omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Your losse (in a sort) becomes your gaine in this, That wereas scarce in 2 yeeres you should haue heard that which is heere added: Lo, now you haue it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to you at once. Let not (in any case) this gaine of yours become your losse by carelesnesse: but let it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by our diligence become a double gaine to you and yours.</p>
   <p>Now to the intent that this view of Catechisme may be profitable, in few words conceaue it thus. Three words containe all my scope in this Tract: Sinne, Grace, Obedience, Sinne, in the first part, that each vnregenerate man may know how to get out of his false peace, seeing himselfe in the glasse of the Law to be that cursed one. Grace, in the second, that each humbled one vnder his burden, may (in the mirror of the Gospell, and the offer of Reconciliation) behold and embrace the hearty and vnfeigned meaning of the Lord to forgiue and saue him. Obedience in the third, that each forgiuen soule may know, that God, in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him mercy, aymes not onely at the ease of the soules burden, but at his owne honor, in laying on another burden, (though eazy and sweet) of liuing by faith, and obeying his Cōmandements. Set these three then before thy eye as the scope of the whole: And so each part shall not onely profit thee in the seuerall branches, but much more in the connexion of the scope thereof; all tending to make the soule happy here and heereafter. If then thou meet in the first part with many Articles &amp; heads of weight, rest not in the doctrine
<pb facs="4"/> of the things, but conceaue them from first to last, as steps and degrees to conuince thee of sinne: that the sence of thy naturall estate may make thee and leaue thee such an one in thine owne eyes, as thou art in the LORDS. If in the second thou meete with sundry discourses of the way and meane of Deliuerance, dwell not vpon the points them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but consider their scope, that GOD, in offring thee Christs Righteousnes to bee thine, speakes as truly and according to his purpose, in this, as hee did in the first, that hee might conuince thee of his Righteousnes. Likewise in the third so reade and mediate of the grounds therein contained, as remembring that all of them tend to this one marke, That the truth as it is in Iesus, must conuince thee of as great a necessity of putting off the old and putting on the new man, as before it did of thy Righteousnesse. And thus thy reading ouer and ouer this Treatise with meditation and prayer, may through the Grace of Gods Spirit, lead thee towards Heauen.</p>
   <p>And now behold, I would euen desire that, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> dealt with his Prophecies,<note place="margin">Iere. 36.2.</note> he wrote them in a Role, that they might be in daily view, and better beleeued: So those of my people (for I accuse but some) who would neuer by the preaching of these poynts, vnderstand the coherence and vse of this Summe of Godlinesse, might now stand vpon this Pisgah,<note place="margin">Deut. vlt. 1.</note> and behold this <hi>Canaan</hi> of Practicall Religion, and that goodly <hi>Lebanon</hi> thereof especially, I meane the Doctrine of fayth in recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and the new Creature. The vse of the whole Posie of al the Flowers herein bound together is, That
<pb facs="4"/> yee bee better grounded in knowledge, and heare Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons dayly with better vnderstanding, discerning and practice. Read therefore and consider. Pray for bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing also, that this Treatise may returne into your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes with double fruit. If you profit not, how shall strangers? In hope whereof, I commend your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lord, and my selfe to your prayers. Farewell.</p>
