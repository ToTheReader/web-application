   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE loue that naturally men beare to peace and quiet is so great, that there can fall no controuersie emong such as be of the better sorte, but they seeke meanes euer to compounde and pacifie it. Either they referre the decision of it to the Iudge ordinarie of the lawe, or if they mistruste th'exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof, either bicause the iudge doth not fullie vnderstande the matter, or els for that they thinke him partiall of either side, they seeke the arbitrement and sentence of some good man, whome they thinke bothe to vnderstande perfitely right and iustice, and take him to be affectionate of neither parte. In which doing they flee not from the lawe, but seeke the true and right vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing thereof without affection at his handes. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering this order (Christian Reader) and moued with the Charitie that should binde vs all,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> waying with my selfe the great controuersie that hath benne in this age about sundrie pointes of Religion, namely in the article of our Iustification: seing also that the matter tendeth not to the losse of patrimonie or landes, but to the plaine disherison of life euerlasting, and that emong vs, who all professe to be the children of peace: I haue bene desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse to propounde some meane of Pacification. And bicause I see the trauaile that sundrie men haue taken as it were pleading in this cause, hath not ended the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, either bicause the doers were thoughte to be
<pb facs="106"/> parties of the one side, and thereby affectionat: either bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause being borne in this age, and liuing in the time of the controuersie, they had not the autoritie and credite of Iudges: I haue thought good to moue all such as finde in them selues either controuersie or doubt concerning that matter, to putte their owne opinion in arbitrement and compromisse. Not calling them hereby from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, which as a Soueraine lawe the diuine wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath lefte vnto vs, but leading them to the true vnderstanding of the holy Scriptures, vttered by such <hi>as God hath placed in his Churche,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. <hi>Danie.</hi> 12.</note>
      <hi>to be Pastor us and teachers to instructe manie to rightuousnes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I offer for Arbitrators, not men of this age such as may be thought any waie partiall or suspected, but such as in all mens iudgementes, and for all respectes, be or should be without exception. For the principall pointe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, I offer S. Augustine, a reuerend and most ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Bishop in the Catholike Churche, not onely in high estimation in all Christian Regions, emong all estates and degrees during his life, but also for his excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue worthely after his death taken for a Saincte, and for his singuler learning and knowledge in holy Scriptures, taken for one of the foure Doctours, and that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallest of the Latin Churche, as one meete, whome all learned menne should followe as a lanterne and light in decision of matters of greatest weight. Who also in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of the holy Scriptures, may be the more safely trusted, for that he had in all his writinges a speciall care, not to seeke his priuate and singular opinion in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of them,<note place="margin">Lib. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. <hi>12.</hi> cap. <hi>25.</hi>
      </note> as appereth by his owne woordes, saying, <hi>that God hath terribly geuen vs warning, that wee
<pb n="2" facs="106"/> should not drawe his truthe to our owne priuate constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, leste wee were depriued of it.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luther. in Sermone Germa. ad mulieres partus In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicita. afflictas. Phi. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc. in decla. de S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stino. Caluinus Institut. cap. <hi>18.</hi>
      </note> And therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his opinion, thou arte sure to haue the opinion of that moste learned age, that he liued in. Againe, bicause that time framed vnto it selfe no newe doctrine, thou knowest also by him, what was the opinion of the Church before his time, euen from the Apostles vnto his age. And bicause he hath not ben contraried in that matter of any godly and learned, before this oure age, yea and in this our age is highly commended of suche as haue bene of greatest credite, euen of the contrary side: thou knowest by him what hath bene the opinion of the Churche in all times touching the questiō of our Iustification. Which he decideth thus farr, to wit, whether faith without good woorkes may saue a Christian man, or no.<note place="margin">The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines Treatie of saith and vvorkes.</note> Where vnto he was moued by a corrupte opinion of some menne in his time. For whereas whole countries then, were not yet fully conuerted to Christe, and therefore diuers of al ages as they were brought to the faith, came yearly to be christened: some were of opinion, that as manie as would beleeue the right faith, though they liued vngodly, yet might be receiued to Baptisme, and be saued through faith and the Sacramentes, without good workes. Against whome he wrote this godly and learned Booke enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled: <hi>De Fide &amp; operibus,</hi> of faith and woorkes, prouing therein at large, that faith without good life can saue no manne.</p>
   <p>And bicause the value and estimation of good workes hath been, and yet is, called in question, to wit, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte God maketh of them, and whether any reward be geuen vnto them especially of life euerlasting, and
<pb facs="107"/> whether they be necessarie and able to healpe vs to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the same: I haue also chosen certaine Arbitrators touching the especial and chiefe workes commended by Christe, as Praier, Fasting, and Almes dedes. And those suche men, that in their handes thou mayste without daunger put thine opinion and iudgement. For Praier I haue chosen S. Chrysostome: for Fasting S. Basil and S. Leo: for almose deedes S. Cyprian, and S. Leo againe. The first and second Confessors, but so liuing for certaine yeares, that they daily looked to be Martyrs. The third al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a Confessor, but such as in his life by a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of 630. Bishops was called S. Leo, and since his death hath ben so taken of the Churche,<note place="margin">Concil. Chalcedo. Sess. <hi>3.</hi>
      </note> and hath also for his most excellent learning bene surnamed Leo the Greate. The fowrth, a flower of the worlde in his life for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and learning, and in his death a moste constante and vndoubted Martyr. S. Cyprian and S. Augustine, liued in Africa: S. Basil in Asia: S. Leo in Europa: S. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome parte of his life in Asia, parte in Europa. And so by these doo we heare, as it were speaking in them, the voice of the whole Catholike Church,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</note>
      <hi>which is the piller and staie of truthe:</hi> against the whiche no man well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised will frame him selfe a singular opinion. For vnto the Churche is <hi>the holy Ghost the teacher of al trueth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ioan.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.</note> which promise no priuate man hath. Their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie is suche, that the latest and lowest of them al liued within 400. yeres after Christe. Peruse and way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affection (gentle Reader) the Treaties of these holy Fathers. I might require thee also to stand to their deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, bicause there is no exception to be taken against them. But that I leaue to Gods gracious working, and
<pb n="3" facs="107"/> thine owne good will: bicause I take not vppon me to be Iudge of the cause, but a motioner toward peace: Only this muche I saie of them, that whereas Iudges should be voide of hatred, freendshippe, enmitie, and pittie,<note place="margin">Salust. de bel. Catil.</note> these men are suche. For as S. Augustine saieth of them and of others like: <hi>Nullas nobiscum,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Aug. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra. Iulia. Lib. <hi>2.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>vel vobiscum amicitias attenderunt, vel inimicitias exercuerunt: Neque nobis, neque vobis irati sunt: neque nos, neque vos miserati sunt: Quod in Ecclesia inuenerunt, tenuerunt: Quod didicerunt, docuerunt: quod à patribus acceperunt, hoc filijs tradiderunt:</hi> They neither regarded friendshippe, nor were at enmitie with vs, or you: they were neither angry with vs, nor you: nor tooke compassion of vs, or of you. Looke what they founde in the Church, that they held: suche as they learned, they taught: what they receiued of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that deliuered they to their children.</p>
   <p>Take therefore Christen Reader, if thou be a childe of the Churche, these thy Fathers lessons. <hi>Aske thy Fathers,</hi> saieth the holy Scripture, <hi>and they will shew thee:</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.</note>
      <hi>enquire of thy Elders, and they will tell thee.</hi> These be thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, these be thy Elders. These are suche, of whom Christe saied, <hi>he that heareth you, heareth me,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Lucae,</hi> 10.</note>
      <hi>he that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piseth you, dispiseth me.</hi> These are the high Pastours of Christes Church, of whom Christ saied,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.</note>
      <hi>he that heareth not the Churche, let him be to thee, as an Heathen and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicane.</hi> These are the lightes of the Church, of whom Christe saied: <hi>You are the light of the worlde:</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>Acto.</hi> 13.</note> whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours saied also of them selues, that <hi>they were placed to be a light to Nations, to woorke saluation euen to the vttermost of the earth.</hi> Of whome also an other saied: <hi>He that knoweth God, harkeneth vnto vs.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 4.</note>
      <hi>He that is not
<pb facs="108"/> of God, harkeneth not vnto vs. In this we trie the Spirite of Truthe, and the Sprite of Errour.</hi> If thou wilt then be lead by Truthe, and not seduced by Errour, harken to these holy and learned Fathers, all Bishoppes and chiefe Pastours in the Churche of Christe, in that time and age, whiche the Aduersaries them selues accompte for the purest. Let these hardely be thy Arbitrers in deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of these present controuersies. They lacked no learning to know the Truthe. They wanted no vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to write as they knewe. They can not be partiall: They knewe neither parties. They liued, taught and flourished in the time of Truth by the Aduersaries owne Confession. To speake farder in the commendation of these most holy and learned Fathers, it were but a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. There nedeth no candle, when the day light shineth. Where good wine is, there nedeth no garland to hange out. These Fathers commends them selues. All the Christian worlde reuerenceth them, and crediteth them, as holy Fathers, as most learned Doctours, as singular lightes of the Churche of Christe, bothe Greke and Latin. To whom this publike testimony of all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome suffiseth not, to him nothing will suffise.</p>
   <p>Reade therefore, Christian Reader. Vse, and peruse. And reading these, remember that thou readest not any writer of late yeares, any priuate learned man, any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Iudgement or doctrine. But that thou readest in these the doctrine of the primitiue Churche, Auncient and generally approued Fathers, briefely the publike Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony and common voice of all Christendom. And that not certaine of their sayinges, culled out from the whole, but their whole and full Treaties, word for word
<pb n="4" facs="108"/> as they wrote them, laied before thee. Last of all, not any suche writinges, as they wrote by waie of controuersy as against an Aduersary, but partly a settled and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted doctrine, such as S. Augustines Treatie is, partly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies and sermons made and pronounced to the whole people (suche as all the rest are) in whiche kinde of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the Pastour of Goddes people, will be most aduised what he speaketh, and muche more what he writeth. To make an ende: Thou hast hitherto hearde learned men prouing and debating matters now in controuersy, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Fathers sayinges, gathered together, with their owne deuise and industry. Nowe thou hearest the Fathers them selues to tell their owne tales. Thou seest the maner of their writing, Thou learnest by their owne talke, what their faith was. Onely I haue made them to speake in English, as faithefully, as truly, and as familiarly, as I coulde possibly doo, not swaruing one iote from their wordes and meaning. Accepte my poore labour in good parte, which I haue taken to edifie many, to offend none. And our Lorde of his mercy geue bothe to thee (gentle Reader) and to me, of his holy Grace, that we may folow and practise in woorkes, that which these holy Fathers do teache vs in woordes. That as sinne hath bene the cause of this horrible schisme and manifolde heresies that nowe raigne, so amendement of life maie be a meane to stay the raging course there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to call vs home to vnite againe, to the honour of God, and peace of his Church. Amen.</p>
