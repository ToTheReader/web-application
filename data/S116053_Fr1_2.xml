   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing wee all haue receiued, and allow it for truth, That the ignorance of the Law doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse none of offence; and also, That the Law doth helpe the watchfull, and not the slothfull man: therefore it behoueth each person, first to seeke the knowledge of those Lawes vnder which he doth liue, and whereby he is to receiue benefit, or to sustaine perill, and next, with al industry to frame his obedience vnto them, or hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to submit himselfe to the censure of them. And though wee find by experience, that some men by the sluggishnesse of their natures, others by the carelesnesse of their owne welfares, and a third sort wholly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer to pleasures and vanities, do little respect to know, and lesse to obey our criminall &amp; capitall Laws, being things of great moment and importance, and therfore doe ofttimes tast the smart of them, and repent their follies when it is too late: Notwithstanding, for that there be many others which do endeuour to read them, and imploy their industrie to conceiue them; some for the increase of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, others, in their actions to be directed by them, and many for the eschewing of the penalties of them, &amp; yet do not wholly addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the studie of the Law: therefore, as neere as I can, to satisfie the desires, and to giue contentment to al the persons aforesaid, I haue done my endeuor in this Treatise, to lay open to all them that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to read, and thereby to know, which be the offences that the Law doth in generall tearmes condemne, and do most tend to the breach or blemish of the peace of the Realme, and to the dislike of all the good
<pb facs="4"/> members thereof, and what punishments she hath imposed vpon the transgressors therein, and by whom, &amp; in what maner to be inflicted. If one man do pretend title vnto, &amp; sue to recouer any land, lease, or goods of anothers, all strangers stand indifferent, and meddle no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but onely wish well to him that hath the best title, &amp; desire that iustice may be done, and right may preuaile: but if a Treason, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Burglarie, Robberie, Theft, notorious Riot, Forgerie, Periurie, Extortion, or Oppression be committed, then each man in conceit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it his owne case, &amp; doth in a sort take it to bee done to himselfe; and all persons generally do find fault with the transgressors therein, they exclaime of them, condemne thē, &amp; in their hearts cry <hi>Crucifige</hi> vpon them. And therefore the crimes aforesaid, &amp; such like, may bee tearmed generall offences, partly, for that they do redownd to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall dislike of all the good members of the realm; and partly for that they tend to the breach or blemish of the peace, being a thing generally imbraced or wished for, &amp; which the king &amp; all his good subiects are bound, and in a sort haue vndertaken to maintaine: and therefore as the king hath an interest in them, or iurisdiction ouer them all, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the offendors in them, as transgressors of his lawes, and disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his peace, and people, so hath euery other well gouerned mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Commonweale, a care and regard of them, foreseeing that he may receiue the like wrong, and tast the same abuse, by the said, or other such malefactors meanes; and for that cause doth proclaime o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen warre against them, and is as desirous to root them out, as the husbandman his thistles out of his good corne, or the gardner his net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles from his sweet flowers. Wherefore, seeing a guiltie person in any of the crimes aforesaid, is persecuted, in deed, or consent, by all wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing well to the Weale-publique, or their owne priuat estates: it is requisit that good men which eschew to offend for the loue of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and euill men, which feare to offend for the dread of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, should both know those lawes which they are to make vse of, and the penalties which be threatned to the infringers thereof, to the intent that the good man hauing a will to stand, may trust to his feet, remaine firme, and continue his integritie; and the euill minded man beginning to stagger, may bend his endeuour to stay, and slide no further. All which by this worke (good Reader) I labour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, to the intent, that the well meaning man being made the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb facs="4"/> and he that before was lewdly disposed, the lesse hurtfull, may both at the last meet and ioyne in seeking and furtherance of that peace which will be comfortable to the King and Realme, and pleasing both to God and man. The question may be asked me, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I intitle my Booke, <hi>De pace Regis &amp; Regni,</hi> and yet do chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make mention therein, of those crimes which doe most disturbe the peace of the King and the kingdome, and so make the Booke and the title as it were <hi>oppositum in subiecto?</hi> Whereunto I answer, That the peace whereof I do write, is not obtained by the said offences committed, but by the lawes that do punish or restraine them, which lawes also I haue set downe at large in this Treatise, being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall marke that I desire the Reader to behold: As, many Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans haue written large volumes of seuerall infirmities in mans bodie, and then expressed which bee the Medicines to cure them; not to the intent to allure the Reader to seeke the disease, but how to preuent it before he hath it; or how to be rid of it when he hath taken it. And seuerall Diuines haue composed whole Tomes, of Pride, Malice, Couetousnesse, and such like offences, not to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to intice the fraile man to fall into them, but to shew the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of them, how grieuous they bee in Gods sight, and how hee hath threatned deepely to plague the offendors therein, to the end they might dehort and discourage transgressors from them, and might allure and winne them to humilitie, forgiuenesse, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, charitie, repentance, and other vertues. And so I name my Booke of the quiet euent, and not of the persecuting cause; of the patient cured, and not diseased; of the sinner reclaimed, and not persisting in vice; of that peace which I would haue, and wish might flourish, and not of those Lawes that by awe do worke it. For these Lawes whereof I doe write, and some others,<note place="margin">How the Lawes doe preserue the peace of the King.</note> doe preserue the peace of the King, in that they doe assure vs who is our King, doe settle and continue the Crowne on his head, do put the Sword and Scepter in his hand, doe attribute to him seuerall Regall Titles, Honours, and Prerogatiues, doe bind his Subiects to performe all loyaltie, duetie, and obedience vnto him, and lay heauie punishments vpon the withstanders or deniers thereof. These Lawes bee as his Priuie Counsellours, inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly respecting the preseruation of his person, peace, Crowne,
<pb facs="5"/> and dignitie: These be as his Gentlemen Pentioners, attending daily in his presence, to do him all princely honor and seruice: These bee as the Yeomen of his guard, waiting day and night to protect his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in peace, from all forcible assaults, and other perils: These bee as his great and goodly Shippes, which lye houering on the Seas, and his strong castles and forts of defence, which stand firmly vpon the land, wherewith he doth preuent forrein hostilitie, represse inward tumults, and so keep himself and his people in peace: These be as the Iudges, Iustices, Sherifes, Constables, and other Officers, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching euerie houre and moment in all the Shires, places, corners, and creekes of the Realme, to represse outrages, and to maintain his peace: And lastly, these be to him as his mynt, by which he doth coyn gold and siluer to defend himselfe and his people in the time of warre, and to support his honour and royall estate in the time of peace.<note place="margin">How the Lawes doe preserue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie person in peace.</note> And also by the protection of these Lawes euerie good member of the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth receiue the like benefit of peace: for in feare of them each person doth enioy his life and limmes in peace, and is defended from the bloudie minded murderer, and manqueller, and the rage of the furious quareller and fighter: And in feare of them the housekeeper resteth in peace, with his wife and family vnder his owne roof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being assaulted by burglers: And in feare of them the traueller iournieth in peace from one country to another, without being spoiled by robbers: And in feare of them the Grasiers cattell do feed quietly in his pasture, without being stolne by theeues. The terrour of the Lawes do ofttimes restraine cholericke or contentious spirits from Batteries, Riots, Routs, Forcible entries, and other outrages; and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous and greedy persons, from practising or procuring of forgeries; and godlesse and irreligious people, from persuading or committing of periuries; and false and guilefull persons, from putting in vre of frauds and deceits; and impudent and shamelesse men, to wrest from others by briberie, extortion, or oppression. And diuers there be, who neither by the lawes of God, of nature, or reason, will be bridled and reduced to vertue, yet by the penalties &amp; feare of some of our capital and criminal laws, do yeeld to be curbed, &amp; refrain from the practise of their vicious liues, of whom the saying of the Poet may be verified, <hi>Oderunt peccare mali formidine poenae.</hi> And so I may truly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, that the Lawes whereof I do write, be the meanes of the peace
<pb facs="5"/> of the K. and the kingdom: And so long as the offences in this Treatise specified shall be reformed, or duely checked by these Lawes, <hi>Florebit pax Regis &amp; Regni.</hi> But though peace be mine end, and peace the marke that I roue at, yet there be some that thinke, that the diuulging of our criminall and capitall Laws, in our mother tongue, will not be a meane of that peace which I do so much ayme at, for that, as they surmise, the same Lawes may then be misconstrued by euerie ignorant and vnlearned person, that can read English, and the sence and meaning thereof may be mistaken, the reader himselfe may be led into errour, and others may be misinformed by his imbecilitie of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, seeing the same reader is able only to looke into the letter of the law, and not to discerne of the intent of the makers, or of the true sence thereof: And do alledge for their reason, the same that was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected at the making of the Statute of <hi>Ann̄ 34. H. 8.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>St.</hi> 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8.</note> ordained for the restraint of seuerall persons to read the Scriptures in the English tongue, for feare of raising of heresies and schismes in Gods church, surmising then, that ignorance was the mother of deuotion, as these men now would make her of obedience: But if the same parties will looke backe, they shall find the said Statute repealed,<note place="margin">
         <hi>St.</hi> 1. <hi>E.</hi> 6. 12</note> and by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and practise of the former, &amp; our present age, the reason afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said refelled. Men may not surcease to read the Scriptures, because the diuell misconstruing the Psalme,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. <hi>Math.</hi> 4.</note> would haue persuaded thereby Iesus Christ the sonne of God, to cast himselfe downe headlong from the pynacle of the Temple: Nor for that the Saduces being deceiued in a place of Deutronomie,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. <hi>Math</hi> 22.</note> would haue inferred by the woman which maried seuen brethren, that there is no resurrection of the dead: Nor for that S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistles did write certaine obscure things to be vnderstood,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</note> which vnlearned and vnconstant men depraued as they did other Scriptures, to their owne destruction: For this deprauing, misconstruing, or wresting of the lawes of God, or man, out of their true meaning, &amp; proper sence, doth conuince the reader of ignorance, pride, selfe loue, or folly, and doth nothing impeach the credit of the same laws, nor the necessitie or conueniencie of them, nor the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat iudgement of the law-makers. We perceiue by the questions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrers, &amp; argumēts, which oft do arise amongst the reuerent Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and learned men in the lawes of our Realme, touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and true meaning of diuers of our Statutes and common
<pb facs="6"/> lawes, that the old Prouerbe is true, <hi>Nemo nascitur artifex, viz.</hi> No man is borne vnto, or at the first can obtaine the perfect vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of any learning, science, or art whatsoeuer, but euerie person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth in ignorance, &amp; then increaseth in knowledge by little &amp; lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, according to his capacitie and diligence: For, as the Pomander doth giue a pleasant sauour only whē it is rubbed, and the flint doth yeeld fire onely when it is beaten; so knowledge in all lawes and other learnings, is obtained onely by much studie, due consideration, &amp; deep digestion thereof, as an hole is made in the hard stone, by the often dropping of the soft and liquid water. And therfore, if the busie sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of other mens knowledge, and carper at their ignorance, will with the eyes of his mind looke into the old and new Testament, and euery booke, place, and particle thereof, and into the workes of euerie Rabbie, Counsell, Father, Doctor, and other Expositor of the same, thereby to learne which parts of the said Testament be written Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storically, which prophetically, which metaphorically, which hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically, and which literally, and how euery of them are to be construed &amp; takē: and into al the books of controuersies in religion, which haue bin written in all former ages, and this our present time, and all the reasons produced for the maintenance of each seuerall persons opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then will bend his care vpon the church of God, and learne by the report of the Ecclesiasticall Hystoriographers, related from the first creation of man vntill this day, when, where, by whom, &amp; whose meanes she hath flourished and increased, and again, when, where, &amp; by what meanes she hath bin obscured and blemished: And also will haue respect to the Cosmographers and Chroniclers of the seuerall kingdomes and prouinces of the world, who did describe the scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, the nature and disposition of the people of each countrey, their forme of gouernment, their seuerall laws and customes, the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie and barrennesse of their soyls, and how in times they haue flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished and decayed: And further, will reuolue in his mind the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of volumes which haue bin written of the Common and Ciuile Lawes, and of the rites of other kingdomes, nations, and cities: And also will take notice of the infinit number of singular men, which in seuerall ages haue written learnedly and profoundly, of Grammer, Logicke, Rhetorick, Philosophy, Physick, Arithmetick, Geometry, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, and Astronomie, and published to all posteritie the seuerall
<pb facs="6"/> grounds, principles, and maximes of euerie of them: And moreouer, will diligently hearken vnto the number of volumes collected in seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ages, of the procreation, nature, and course of life, of all the beasts of the field, the wormes of the earth, the fowles of the ayre, and the fishes of the sea: and of the beginning, increase, &amp; vertue of all trees, hearbs, roots, plants, &amp; things vegetatiue: and of the operation of all stones, mynes, quarreyes, metals, and other things which grow vpon the face of the earth, or lye hidden in the ground: And further, will take a view in his memorie of the millions of bookes which haue been written in the Syriake, Chaldie, Hebrew, Greeke, and Latin tongues, for the increase of all sorts of learning and knowledge: And lastly, will giue his heart leaue to thinke of the huge multitude of Treatises, which haue beene composed in verse, mytre and rime, in a sweet and harmonicall tune: and then if the same curious carper at other mens ignorance, after his said due consideration had of all the writings and writers aforesaid, and of their seuerall deepe wisedoms, knowledges, and vnderstandings in the arts, sciences, and things aforesaid, and how necessary, beneficiall, or comfortable they be to man, will returne home againe, and looke into his owne breast and bosome, and examine himselfe seriously what he doth lacke of all the artes and sciences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, and also how farre from perfection he is in his owne profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, I doubt not but whatsoeuer before he thought of himselfe, he wil now find that he hath but a small drop, sparke or particle of learning or knowledge, in respect of that he wanteth, and which hee may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue to haue beene in some others, and that hee hath no cause to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne the ignorance of others, but rather to pitie his owne, and to say with the old Philosopher, <hi>Hoc solum scio quod nihil scio.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cratippus.</note> Many wholly deuoted to their owne opinions, do desire to maintaine Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, &amp; to strain all their wits to defend them, though their asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons seeme neuer so improbable, and their arguments neuer so weak to others: as appeareth by <hi>Rodolphus Agricola,</hi> who did write a book <hi>De vanitate scientiarū,</hi> which the whole wisdome of the world in all ages hath so much admired and honoured: and by <hi>Erasmus Roterodamus,</hi> who compiled a Treatise <hi>Of the prayse of folly,</hi> attempting therein, to proue by a farre fetched argument, that the folly of man and woman together, is the onely cause of the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and continuance of mankind vpon the face of the earth, and that
<pb facs="7"/> the fault and folly of <hi>Adam</hi> in eating of the forbidden apple, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to Gods commaundement, being the breach of the peace betweene God and man, was the cause that moued Iesus Christ the son of God, to descend from the bosome of his father, to take flesh of the blessed virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> to suffer his passion for the sinnes of man, and so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new peace betweene God and man. And therefore we must not insist vpon the priuat conceits, or particular phantasies of a few opinatiue persons, but shall do well rather to obserue what care our fathers from one age to another, did take, and what ordinances they establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in Parliament, that seuerall penall, criminall, and capitall lawes and statutes should be read or proclaimed in Churches,<note place="margin">
         <hi>St.</hi> 25. <hi>E.</hi> 1. 3 <hi>St.</hi> 7. <hi>R.</hi> 2. 6 <hi>St.</hi> 33. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>St.</hi> 5. <hi>El.</hi> 1.</note> in Faires, in Markets, at the generall Assises, and Quarter Sessions of euerie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, at Leets, and Lawdayes, and in the Halls of euerie Inne of Court, and Chauncerie, and how the same is continued, and duely put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise at this day, to the intent that the same lawes, and the penalties thereof, should be heard, learned, knowne, and vnderstood by all sorts of persons willing to perceiue and apprehend the same. But if there be any, who persuading themselues that they doe search further into the bowels of reason or experience, than all our foresaid law-makers and others haue done, and will by disputes encounter the publishing or reading of our foresaid lawes in the English tongue, I must and will patiently content my selfe, suffer them to affirme what they please, and say with mine old Schoolemaster <hi>Cato, Arbitrij nostri non est quid quis{que} loquatur.</hi>
