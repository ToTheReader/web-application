   <p>INtending at first (gentle reader) to make a briefe relation of tenne Martyrs, in the holie yeare; and by the maner of proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding against them, to declare that they suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red meerly for Religion; I put M. Iohn Rigbie his processe first (though he was not the first of these Martyrs) because I ment to set the same downe more at large, as being most notorious, and most amply hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in publique place of Iustice. But when I had donne so much, and (by reason of a iorney that I made) leift it with a freind to publish, for the common good; vpon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine considerations, it was not pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And hearing also, that it hath pleased God, to glorifie six more Martyrs, I would in nowise omit to adde their names herunto. By which occasions I vvas forced also to change the former title, to make it confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the whole contents.</p>
