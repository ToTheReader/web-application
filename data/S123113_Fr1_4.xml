   <l>ME thinges I heere some busy Criticke say</l>
   <l>Who's this that singly vshers on this Play?</l>
   <l>'Tis boldnes I confesse, and yet perchance</l>
   <l>It may be constur'd loue, not arrogance.</l>
   <l>I do not heere vpon this leafe intrude</l>
   <l>By praysing one, to wrong a multitude.</l>
   <l>Nor do I thinke that all are tyed to be</l>
   <l>(Forc'd by my vote) in the same creed with me.</l>
   <l>Each man hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>iberty to iudge; free will,</l>
   <l>At his owne pleasure to speake good, or ill.</l>
   <l>But yet your Muse alreadie's knowne so well</l>
   <l>Her worth will hardly find an infidell.</l>
   <l>Heere she hath drawne a picture, which shall lye</l>
   <l>Safe for all future times to practisse by.</l>
   <l>What ere shall follow are but Coppies, some</l>
   <l>Preceding workes were types of this to come.</l>
   <l>'Tis your owne liuely image, and setts forth</l>
   <l>When we are dust the beauty of your worth.</l>
   <l>He that shall dully read and not aduance</l>
   <l>Ought that is heere betrayes his ignorance.</l>
   <l>Yet whosoeuer beyond desert commends</l>
   <l>Errs more by much then he that reprehends,</l>
   <l>For prayse misplac'd, and honor set vpon</l>
   <l>A worthlesse subiect is detraction.</l>
   <l>I cannot sin so heere vnlesse I went</l>
   <l>About, to stile you only excellent.</l>
   <l>
      <hi>Apollo's</hi> guifts are not confind alone</l>
   <l>To your dispose, He hath more heires then one,</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="4"/>And such as do deriue from his blest hand</l>
   <l>A large inheritance in the Poets land</l>
   <l>As well as you, nor are you I assure</l>
   <l>My selfe so enuious, but you can endure</l>
   <l>To heere their praise, whose worth long since was knowne</l>
   <l>And lustly to, prefer'd before your owne.</l>
   <l>I know yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> would take it for an iniury,</l>
   <l>(And 'tis a well becomming modesty)</l>
   <l>To be paraleld with <hi>Beaumont,</hi> or to heare</l>
   <l>Your name by some to partiall friend write neere</l>
   <l>Vnequal'd <hi>Ionson:</hi> being men whose fire</l>
   <l>At distance and with reuerence you admir'd.</l>
   <l>Do so and you shall find your gaine will bee</l>
   <l>Much more by yeelding them prioritie</l>
   <l>Then with a certamety of losse to hould</l>
   <l>A foolish competition; Tis to bould.</l>
   <l>A tasque, and to be shunde, nor shall my prayse</l>
   <l>With to much waight ruine, what it would rayse.</l>
