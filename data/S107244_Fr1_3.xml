   <l>Of chiualrie as soueraygne and patron.</l>
   <l>Full hote and drye of complexion:</l>
   <l>Irous woode and malencolyke,</l>
   <l>And of nature brent and collerike.</l>
   <l>Of colour shininge like the fiery glede,</l>
   <l>Whose ferse lokes ben as ful of drede,</l>
   <l>As is the leuene that alighteth lowe,</l>
   <l>Downe by the skies from Iupiter his bowe,</l>
   <l>So bene thy stremes passing dispyteous,</l>
   <l>And to beholde so inly furious.</l>
   <l>Thou causer art with thy fyrie beames,</l>
   <l>Of werre and strife in many sūdrye realmes.</l>
   <l>Whose lordshyp cheifest is in Capricorne,</l>
   <l>But in the crabbe is thy power lorne.</l>
   <l>And causer art of conteke and of strife.</l>
   <l>Now for the loue of her Vlcanus wife,</l>
   <l>With whom whilom y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> were at mischiefe take,</l>
   <l>So helpe me now onely for her sake,</l>
   <l>And for the loue of thy Bellona,</l>
   <l>That with the dwelleth beyonde Cirrha,</l>
   <l>In Lybye londe vpon the sandes rede:</l>
   <l>So be my helpe in this great nede,</l>
   <l>To do succour my stile to dyrecte,</l>
   <l>And of my penne the traces to correcte.</l>
   <l>Whiche barrayne is of aureat lycoure.</l>
   <l>But in thy grace I finde some succoure:</l>
   <l>For to conuoy it with thine influence,</l>
   <l>That stumbleth aye for fault of eloquence.</l>
   <l>For to reherse or writen any worde:</l>
   <l>Now helpe o mars y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> art of knighthode lorde:</l>
   <l>And hast of manhode the magnificence.</l>
   <l>And other goddes y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> arne of highe prudence,</l>
   <l>This worke texplete that ye not refuse,</l>
   <l>But maketh Clyo for to be my muse,</l>
   <l>With her systren that on Pernasus dwelle,</l>
   <l>In Cirrha by Helycon the welle.</l>
   <l>Renning full cleare with stremes cristallyn.</l>
   <l>And called is the fountayne Caballyn,</l>
   <l>That springeth by touche of the Pegase.</l>
   <l>Helpe me also o thou Callyope,</l>
   <l>That were mother vnto him Orpheus.</l>
   <l>Whose dytees weren so melodius,</l>
   <l>That the werbles of his resowninge harpe,</l>
   <l>Appeased all the wordes sherpe:</l>
   <l>Bothe of Parchas and furyes infernall,</l>
   <l>And Cerberus so cruell founde at all.</l>
   <l>He coyed also bothe beast foule and tree.</l>
   <l>Now of thy grace be helpyng vnto me.</l>
   <l>And of thy golden dewe let the lycoure wete,</l>
   <l>My dulled brest that with thy hony swete:</l>
   <l>Sugrest the tunges of Rethoryciens,</l>
   <l>And maystresse art to all musciens.</l>
   <l>Now be mine helpe tenlumine w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thy worke:</l>
   <l>Which am beset with cloudes dimme &amp; derke,</l>
   <l>Of ignoraunce in making to procede:</l>
   <l>To be to theym lustye that shall it reade.</l>
   <l>And in herte I am so full of drede,</l>
   <l>Whan prudent lysters hereto shall take hede:</l>
   <l>Who as in makinge more skill can than I:</l>
   <l>That they vouchesafe I pray full beningly,</l>
   <l>Of theyr goodnesse to haue compassion:</l>
   <l>Where as I erre in my translacion.</l>
   <l>For god I take highly to witnesse:</l>
   <l>That I this worke of hertie lowe humblesse,</l>
   <l>Toke vpon me of good entencion,</l>
   <l>Deuoyde of pride and al presumpcion.</l>
   <l>For to obey withouten varyaunce,</l>
   <l>My lordes biddynge fully and plesaunce.</l>
   <l>Which hath desyre sothely for to sayne,</l>
   <l>Of very knighthod to reporte agayne,</l>
   <l>The worthinesse if so I shall not lye:</l>
   <l>And eke the prowesse of olde cheualrye.</l>
   <l>Bycause that he hath ioye and great deintye,</l>
   <l>To reade in bokes of olde antiquitye.</l>
   <l>To finde onely howe he may vertue sewe,</l>
   <l>By theyr ample also and to eschewe:</l>
   <l>The cursed vyce of slouthe and idelnesse.</l>
   <l>So he enioyneth in verteous businesse,</l>
   <l>In all y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> longeth to manhode dare I sayne,</l>
   <l>He busyeth him and therto is so fayne,</l>
   <l>To haunte his bodye in playes marciall,</l>
   <l>Through exercise to exclude slouthe in all,</l>
   <l>After the doctrine of Vigecius.</l>
   <l>Thus is he manfull and eke vertuous,</l>
   <l>More passingly than I can of hym write.</l>
   <l>I want conning his renowne to endite.</l>
   <l>So much of manhode men may in him sene,</l>
   <l>And for to witen whō that I would meane,</l>
   <l>He eldest sonne is of the noble kinge,</l>
   <l>Hēry y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fourth of knighthode well and spring.</l>
   <l>In whom is shewed of what stock he grewe,</l>

   <l>In sothfastnes and this no fable is,</l>
   <l>Called Henry eke y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> worthy prince of Wales.</l>
   <l>¶To whom shall longe as by succession,</l>
   <l>For to gouerne this Brutis albion,</l>
   <l>Which hath me bydde the drery pyteous fate,</l>
   <l>Of them of Troye in ynglyshe to translate.</l>
   <l>The siege also and destruction.</l>
   <l>Lyke as the latyn maketh mencion,</l>
   <l>For to compile and after Guido make,</l>
   <l>So I could and write it for his sake.</l>
   <l>Bycause he would that both to highe &amp; lowe,</l>
   <l>The noble storye openly were knowe.</l>
   <l>And in our tunge about in euery age,</l>
   <l>Written it were as well in our language,</l>
   <l>As in the latyn and the frenshe it is.</l>
   <l>That of the storye we the truthe not mys.</l>
   <l>No more than doth eche other nacion:</l>
   <l>This was the fine of his entencion.</l>
   <l>¶The which emprise anon I ginne shall,</l>
   <l>In his worshyp as for memoryall.</l>
   <l>And of the tyme to maken mencion,</l>
   <l>Whan I began on this translation,</l>
   <l>It was the yeare sothly for to seyne,</l>
   <l>Fourtene complete tho of his fathers reygne.</l>
   <l>The time of yeare shortly to conclude,</l>
   <l>Whan .xx. grees was Phebus altitude.</l>
   <l>The hour whā he hath made his stedes draw</l>
   <l>His rosen chariet lowe vnder the wawe,</l>
   <l>To bathe his beames in the wawy sea,</l>
   <l>Gresed lyke golde as men myght playnly se,</l>
   <l>Passyng the bordure of our Occion.</l>
   <l>And Lucina of coloure pale and wan,</l>
   <l>Her colde arisynge in Octobre dyght,</l>
   <l>Tenchase the darkenes of the frosty nyght,</l>
   <l>That then amiddes was of the Scorpion.</l>
   <l>And Hesperus gan fast to wester down,</l>
   <l>Her course to haste againe the morowe gray.</l>
   <l>When Lucifer the nyght to voyd away,</l>
   <l>The messenger is called of the day.</l>
   <l>Our hemispher to put out of Affray,</l>
   <l>With bright kalēdes of Phebus vprist shene,</l>
   <l>Out from y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> boundes of Proserpin y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> quene.</l>
   <l>Where Pluto dwelleth the darke region,</l>
   <l>And there the furyes haue theyr mansion.</l>
   <l>Tyll after soone Apollo lyst not tarye,</l>
   <l>To take his soiourne in the Sagittarye.</l>
   <l>¶Which time I gan the prologue to behold,</l>
   <l>Of Troye boke ymade by dayes olde.</l>
   <l>Where written was of Auctours vs beforne,</l>
   <l>Of al the dede the very trewe corne,</l>
   <l>So as it fell seuered from the chaffe.</l>
   <l>For in their hande they holde as for a staffe,</l>
   <l>The truth onely which they haue compyled,</l>
   <l>Vnto this fyne that we were not begiled,</l>
   <l>Of necligence thorough foryetfulnesse,</l>
   <l>The which serpent of age by longe processe.</l>
   <l>Engendred is fiersely vs to assayle,</l>
   <l>And of the trouth to maken vs to fayle,</l>
   <l>For nere writers all were out of minde,</l>
   <l>Not storyed onely but of nature and kinde,</l>
   <l>The true knowing shuld haue gon to wrake,</l>
   <l>And our wittes from scyence put abacke.</l>
   <l>Ne had our elders serched out and soughte,</l>
   <l>The sothfast pythe to impe it in our thought,</l>
   <l>Of thinges passed fordyrked of theyr hewe,</l>
   <l>Which through the writing be refreshed new.</l>
   <l>Of Aūceters and left to vs be hynde.</l>
   <l>To make a myrrour onely to our minde.</l>
   <l>To se eche thinge truly as it was,</l>
   <l>As bright and cleare as it were in a glasse.</l>
   <l>For nere theyr writynge nowe memoryall,</l>
   <l>Death w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> his swerde shuld haue slayne all,</l>
   <l>And ydimmed with his sodayne showres,</l>
   <l>The great prowesse of these conquerours.</l>
   <l>And derked eke the brightnesse of their fame,</l>
   <l>That shineth yet by reporte of her name.</l>
   <l>For vnto vs their bokes represent,</l>
   <l>Without fayninge the waye that they went,</l>
   <l>In theyr dayes when they were alyue,</l>
   <l>Agayne the trouth who so euer striue,</l>
   <l>Or counterplede or make any debate,</l>
   <l>The south is redde of high or lowe estate,</l>
   <l>Without fauour who so lyst take hede,</l>
   <l>For after death clerkes litell drede,</l>
   <l>Of theyr deserte for to beare wytnes,</l>
   <l>Nor of a tyraunt the truthe to expresse.</l>
   <l>¶As men deserue without excepcion,</l>
   <l>With lak or pris they graūt their guerdon.</l>
   <l>Wherfore me semeth euery maner man,</l>
   <l>Shulde by his lyfe in all that euer he can,</l>
   <l>For vertue sake eschewe to do amys:</l>
   <l>For after death playnly as it is,</l>
   <l>Clerkes willlyn write and except none,</l>
   <l>The playne trouth when a man is gone.</l>
   <l>And by olde time for theyr writinge trewe:</l>
   <l>They cheryshed were of lordes y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thē knewe.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="5"/>And honoured greatly as in tho dayes.</l>
   <l>For they enacted and gilt with theyr sayes,</l>
   <l>Theyr high renowne their māhod &amp; prowes:</l>
   <l>Their knighthod eke and theyr worthines.</l>
   <l>Their trihumphes al and eke their victories,</l>
   <l>Their famous cōquest &amp; their fonge glories.</l>
   <l>¶Fro point to poynt rehersinge all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> trouth,</l>
   <l>Without fraude neclygence or slouth.</l>
   <l>They did theyr labour and theyr besinesse,</l>
   <l>For elles certayne the great worthinesse:</l>
   <l>Of all theyr dedes had bene in vayne.</l>
   <l>For dyrked age elles would haue slayne,</l>
   <l>By length of yeares the noble worthy fame,</l>
   <l>Of conquerours and playnly of theyr name,</l>
   <l>For dimmed eke the letters aureat.</l>
   <l>And eke deffaced the palme laureat,</l>
   <l>Which y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they wan by knighthod ī their dayes.</l>
   <l>Whose freting ruste newe and newe assayes,</l>
   <l>For to eclipse the honour and the glory,</l>
   <l>Of highe prowes which clerkes in memory,</l>
   <l>Haue truly set through dilygent laboure,</l>
   <l>And enlumined with many curious floure,</l>
   <l>Of Rethorike to make vs comprehende,</l>
   <l>The trouth of all as it was tho kinde.</l>
   <l>Bysied them and faithfully trauailed,</l>
   <l>Agayne all that that age wold haue assayled,</l>
   <l>In theyr bokes euery thinge yset,</l>
   <l>And with the key of remembraunce is shet.</l>
   <l>Which lasteth yet and dureth euer in one.</l>
   <l>Recorde of Thebes that was so longe agone.</l>
   <l>Of which the ruyne and destruction,</l>
   <l>Ye may beholde by good inspection.</l>
   <l>Croppe and roote right as it was in dede,</l>
   <l>On Stace loke and there ye may it rede.</l>
   <l>Howe Polynece and Eteocles,</l>
   <l>The brethern two ne could not liue in peace:</l>
   <l>Till Thebes brought was to his ruyne.</l>
   <l>And all the maner howe they diden fyne,</l>
   <l>That death also of worthy Tideus,</l>
   <l>And howe Edipp with teares full pyteous,</l>
   <l>Wept out his eyen and all his drery payne,</l>
   <l>And how y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> smokes departed were in twaine,</l>
   <l>At the feast of fyres funerall.</l>
   <l>In great Stace ye may reden al.</l>
   <l>The syre engendred by brotherly hatred,</l>
   <l>Where through y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> deathe was the cruel mede.</l>
   <l>¶In very sothe of many worthy man,</l>
   <l>Lyke as mine Auctour well rehearse can.</l>
   <l>Of Troye also that was of latter yeares,</l>
   <l>By diligence of these Cronycleres.</l>
   <l>Ye may beholde in theyr writinge well,</l>
   <l>The strife werre the siege and euery dell.</l>
   <l>Right as it was so many yeares sin passed,</l>
   <l>Whose storye yet age hath not diffaced,</l>
   <l>Nor cruell deathe with his mortall strokes,</l>
   <l>For maugre death ye may beholde in bokes,</l>
   <l>The storye fully rehersed newe and newe,</l>
   <l>As freshe as floure of coloure and of hewe.</l>
   <l>From day to day quicke and nothinge feinte,</l>
   <l>For clerkes haue this storye so depeynt,</l>
   <l>That death nor age by any other weye,</l>
   <l>The trouth may not make for to deye.</l>
   <l>¶Al be that some haue the trouth spared,</l>
   <l>In their wrytynge and playnty not declared.</l>
   <l>So as it was nor tolde out faythfully,</l>
   <l>But it transformed in theyr poesy,</l>
   <l>Through vayne fables which of entencion,</l>
   <l>They haue contriued by false transsumptiō.</l>
   <l>To hide trouth falsly vnder cloude.</l>
   <l>And the sothe of malyce for to shroude.</l>
   <l>As Homer did the which in his writinge,</l>
   <l>I feyned hath full many dyuers thynge,</l>
   <l>That neuer was as Guydo lyst deuise.</l>
   <l>And thinges done farre in anotherwise,</l>
   <l>He hath transformed then the trouth was,</l>
   <l>And feyned falsly that goddes in this case.</l>
   <l>¶The worthy Grekes helpe to warrey,</l>
   <l>Agayne Troyens &amp; how that they were sey,</l>
   <l>Lyke lyfely men among theym day by day.</l>
   <l>And in his dytyes that were freshe and gay,</l>
   <l>With sugred wordes vnder hoony sote,</l>
   <l>His galie is hyd lowe by the roote.</l>
   <l>That it may not outward be aspyed,</l>
   <l>And all for he with Grekes was alyed.</l>
   <l>Therfore he was to theym fauorable,</l>
   <l>In much thyng whych is not commendable.</l>
   <l>Of theym that lust to deine after ryght,</l>
   <l>For in making loue hath lost his sight.</l>
   <l>To gyue a prys where none is deserued,</l>
   <l>Cupide is blinde whose domes ben obserued,</l>
   <l>More after lust then after equytye:</l>
   <l>Or after reason how the trouth be.</l>
   <l>For syngulertee and false affeccion,</l>
   <l>Reyseth ful ofte by vayne lausion,</l>
   <l>A man to worshyp that deserueth none.</l>
   <l>By false reporte and thus full many one,</l>
   <l>Without merite hath his fame blowe,</l>
   <l>Wherof another the renowne is vnknowe,</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="6"/>That ī armes hath sūdry meruailes wrought</l>
   <l>Of whō peraunter speaketh no mā nought.</l>
   <l>For fauour only is fostred more thē rightes,</l>
   <l>That hindred hathe many worthy knightes.</l>
   <l>¶Ouide also poete egally hath closed,</l>
   <l>Falshed with trouthe y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> make the men enosed:</l>
   <l>To which parte that they shall theym holde,</l>
   <l>His misty speche so hard is to vnfolde.</l>
   <l>That it entriketh readers that it see.</l>
   <l>Virgil also for loue of him Ene,</l>
   <l>In his Eneyd reherseth much thinge:</l>
   <l>And was in partie trewe of his writing.</l>
   <l>Except onely that him list somwhile,</l>
   <l>The traces folowe of Homeris stile.</l>
   <l>¶And of this syege wrote eke Lollius,</l>
   <l>But tofore all Daretus frigens.</l>
   <l>Wrote most truely after that he fonde,</l>
   <l>And Ditus eke of the Grekes londe.</l>
