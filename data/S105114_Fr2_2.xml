      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He end, and highest hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse of a Christian man, is to honour God in this life, and to dye well: the way to die well is to liue well; and no better prouocation to good life, nor prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue to a good death, then a continuall and serious meditation of the mortality of this life, the certainty of our end, the vncertainty when and how, the terriblenesse of the last iudgement, and the account that each one must make then, who haue not made it here before, &amp; crossed the debt-book of their sins
<pb facs="4"/> by the Lambe of God. This made an ancient Father crye out: <hi>When I thinke of that day, I feare and tremble, for whether I eate or drinke, or what euer I doe, I thinke I heare that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Trumpet sounding in mine eares: Arise yee dead and come to iudgement.</hi> And to this end, the holy men of elder times willingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained all occasions that might helpe them in these holy cogitations.</p>
   <p>One euidence thereof is this short and sweet Dialogue, which (as a fore-runner of others that may follow) being diuulged, and desired by many to bee englished, I am therefore induced to make it common: This being an age that needs all helps to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and inticements to deuotion: And this the rather in as much, as though it was made in the mist of Popery, euen not long after the Diuell was let loose; yet is it not tainted with Popish corruption, nor scarce smels of any superstition, whereas it is stuft with godly truthes, and wholsome instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. My thoughts intended and dedicated it to your selues, and that worthy, vertuous, and religious Gentleman, now with God, (the brother to one of you in nature, and to you all in faithfull Christian loue.) But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he needs it not, God hauing prouided better things for him and his soule now feeding on finer foode in Gods glorious
<pb facs="4"/> presence, and blessed vision of the Deity: take you it therefore, and that part of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite that might heereby haue falne to him and that part of my loue which heerein I shewed, him diuide among you: and as hee hath left behinde him to this Society, and all that knew him, the sweete smell of a good name, for his many religious and morall vertues: so let me leaue behinde me this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Monument of the much loue my heart owes you, and shall bee willing to testifie by my best seruice, as to this whole and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Society in generall, so to your selues in particular. To whom (without wrong to any other, I speake it) I haue beene peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly beholden, and by whom my studies haue beene much aduanced.</p>
   <p>Now the God of Grace and Mercy, so guide you in the wayes of holinesse and good workes, that at your ends your body may not blame your soule, nor the soule the body; but both soule and body may haue cause to glorifie God their Creatour, Redeemer and Sanctifier, in whose loue I leaue you, and rest yours in all Christian duety.</p>
