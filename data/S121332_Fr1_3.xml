   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>TALIE is the Face of <hi>Europe; Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> the Ere of <hi>Italie.</hi> It is not only the Fairest, but the Strongest, and Actiuest part of that Beautifull and Powerfull Nation. In dismembring of any sensitiue Bodie we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue some one limbe to out-liue all the rest, as if all had bequeathed their Motion to that one, and left it sole Executor of Life. It seemes in the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the last Monarchie, the <hi>Genius</hi> of it made trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration to <hi>Uenice.</hi> In her the VVisedome, Fortitude, Iustice, and Magnanimitie of old <hi>Rome</hi> doe yet moue and stirre. That which now Vsurps that name is not <hi>Rome,</hi> but her Carkasse, or rather Sepulcher. All but her Ruines, and the Cause of them, (her Vice) is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to <hi>Uenice;</hi> of whome I may truly affirme their VVarres haue ingendred the Peace, and their Peace the plentie of all Christendome. Few States haue performed matter more worthie writing than that; few Historians composed lines more worthy reading than this: I meane not for curiositie of stile, but integritie. Not that they had not, but that this Subject needed not Rhethoricall il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration. The nakednesse of Truth is her best Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Noble actions are eloquent, not only in any Language, but without any, euen in mute Pictures. Touching my Translation, though I haue not, as some that write by Precedent, followed euery letter of my
<pb facs="4"/>
Copie, nor Ecchoed my Author in euery word, yet I haue not contradicted or denied him in any sense. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching my stile, I haue not made it so high, but that the lowest vnderstanding may get ouer, nor affected any thing so much, as not to affect. For my chiefe ambition was, that my lines might rather be fit to crowne my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders braine, than hang in his eare, and make him a Man, than a Parrot. To conclude, those bright and translucent iudgments which shall shine vpon my worke, will soone dissolue, and cleare any mist of errour that shall arise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and so warme and cherish my endeuours, that the second crop may bee more worthie tasting. But those which, like the spies of Ignorance, come on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to finde fault, if they lose their labour in mee, perhaps may saue it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and exercise that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious humour nearer home.</p>
