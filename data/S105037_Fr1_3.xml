      </gap>ous imployments in that famous Citty, should be, and
<pb facs="5"/>I hope is, the attayning of such a traffike, that may more redound to the profit of your Soules, then your temporall Estates: since you know well that a sure and solid founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of true Religion wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Eternall Saluation; and the contrary eternall woe and misery, though otherwise one were neuer so fortunate in all worldly prosperity.</p>
   <p>The worke it selfe is but of some few houres reading, and the Author I hope will not be distastfull vnto yow in respect of his person, though otherwise of a different Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession &amp; habit. And though
<pb facs="5"/>I doubt not, but that many of your haue already seene other learned Bookes of like subiect: yet because this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foardeth so great variety of forcible Motiues, both sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly chosen, and most apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed, to settle mens Consciences in so waighty an affayre as this is; I haue therfore thought good to present it to your View, though in a more humble, and far lesse polished stile, then so profitable a subiect deserueth.</p>
   <p>And heerunto I was the more encouraged by vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the great fruite and
<pb facs="6"/>profit which many haue all ready, and do dayly reape by a diligent perusall of this Booke in other languages, hoping for no lesse in our owne then it hath produced in the Latin, French, and Dutch; especially in men so zealous in that Profession, which hath by in these later tymes preached vnto you: Which zeale of yours would no doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> be more feruent, if Gods Grace by other moth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es proposed, should open your eyes to see the cleernes of the Catholike Verity.</p>
   <p>Neither should it offend you, that (your Consciences
<pb facs="6"/>hauing byn setled▪ these 60. yeares last past in the Faith that was then proposed vnto you) now a new reuiew of matters belonging to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be offered. For synce the Scripture doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish vs that Heresies must of necessity be, and false Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers would come to disturbe the peace and vnity of the Church (of which sort, as is apparent by her contrary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, this our vnfortunate Age hath byn most fertile:) it is doublesse no disgrace, or signe of leuity or inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by a diligent and iudicious examen to try which of all
<pb facs="7"/>these diuers spirits is of God, and which is that Catholike Church so often commended vnto vs in the Scriptures, as nothing more plainely and seriously.</p>
   <p>In which important search the Reading of this little, but golden Treatise, will by Gods grace affoard such light to discerne Truth from Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and such meanes to find out the true gate of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith which only lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to saluation, as may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the most Iudicious; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they reade with that humblenes of spirit, as they ought to do, who desyre to
<pb facs="7"/>know the Truth.</p>
   <p>In reading therfore, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der attentiuely euery Passage, &amp; ponder the waight and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of ech Reason, not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting the same ouer, as many do, transpotted with curiosity to read all new Bookes that come forth; and I doubt not you will receaue aboundant satisfaction.</p>
   <p>Read then (most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Cittizens) the ensuing <hi>Consultation,</hi> with an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fferent and vnpartiall eye, that you may enrich your soules with the treasure of true knowledg &amp; doctrine which leadeth to eternall Life and
<pb facs="8"/>Happines. Wherof I humbly beseech his diuine Maiesty to make you partakers, to whom I haue heerewith dedicated both my selfe and seruice, to remayne</p>
