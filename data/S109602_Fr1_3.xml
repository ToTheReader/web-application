Prophet. I will set vp thy seede after thee, which<note place="margin">2. Kings. 7. Psalme. 89.</note> shall proceede out of thy body. Which sentence most worthy Earle (although not spoke of your Noble parentage) in your honor may be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which I doubt not your honor considereth. Knowing therefore moste honorable, the great loue and effection which your honor euer hath and doth beare to Vertue and good Letters, I was thereby moued the more boldly after I had gathered togither this small handfull of floures (named the Alphabete of Prayers) to dedicate the same to your Honor, as the fruites of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, nothing doubting, but that it shall moste acceptablye come into your fauourable and sure protection. And for so much as Prayer is the key that openeth to Vertue, I thought good moste honorable, to set forth to the open shew of the world and to thencrease of Vertue, thys little Volume or Treatise, most humblye beseeching your Honor to accept it as my good wil, crauing your pardon if any thing haue escaped mee for want of Learning. And I according to my boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den dutie, shall call daily (with my most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hearty Prayers) to Almighty God to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe that he hath begon in you, with prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous preseruation of your health, long to liue in Honor, loye and Felicitie. Amen.</p>
