   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou shalt vnderstonde moost dere reader / when I had taken in hāde to looke ouer the new testament agayne &amp; to cōpare it with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> greke / and to mende whatsoeuer I coulde fynde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysse &amp; had almost fynesshed y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> laboure: Geor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge Ioye secretly toke in hand to correct it also by what occasyon his conscyence knoweth: &amp; preuēted me / in so moche / y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> his correccyō was prynted in great nombre / yer myne begāne. When it was spyed and worde brought me: though it semed to dyuers other y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> George Io<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ye had not vsed y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> offyce of an honest mā / sein<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge he knew y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I was in correctynge it mysel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe: nether dyd walke after y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rules of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> loue &amp; softenes which christ / &amp; his desciples teache vs / how y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we shuld do nothynge of stryfe to moue debate / or of vayne glorie or of couetous<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes. Yet I toke y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> thīge in worth as I have do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne dyuers other in tyme past / as one that have moare experyēce of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> nature &amp; dysposiciō of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> mānes cōplexion / &amp; supposed that a lytle spy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se of couetousnes &amp; vayne glorie (two blynde gydes) had bene y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> onlye cause y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> moued him so to do / aboute which thynges I stryue with no man: &amp; so folowed after &amp; corrected forth &amp; caused this to be prynted / without surmyse or lokynge on his correctyon.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="13"/>But when the pryntynge of myne was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most fynesshed / one brought me a copie &amp; she<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wed me so manye places / in soche wyse altered that I was astonyed &amp; wondered not a lytle what furye had dryuē him to make soche cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unge &amp; to call it a diligent correctiō. For tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row oute Mat. Mark &amp; Luke perpetually: and ofte in the actees / &amp; sometyme in Iohn &amp; also in the hebrues / where he fyndeth this worde Resurrecciō / he chaungeth it into y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lyfe after this lyfe / or verie lyfe / and soche lyke / as one that abhorred the name of the resurreccion.</p>
   <p>If that chaunge / to turne resurreccion into lyfe after this lyfe / be a dylygent correccion / then must my translaciō be fautie in those pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces / &amp; saynt Ieromes / and all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> translatours that euer I heard of in what tonge so euer it be / frō y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> apostles vnto this his dylygēt correc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyō (as he calleth it) which whither it be so or no / I permyt it to other mennes iudgemētes.</p>
   <p>But of this I chalenge George Ioye / that he dyd not put his awne name therto and call it rather his awne translacion: &amp; that he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeth boo pepe / &amp; ī some of his bookes putteth in his name &amp; tytle / and in some kepeth it oute It is lawfull for who will / to translate and shew his mynde / though a thousand had trās<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lated before him. But it is not lawfull (thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me) ner yet expedyēt for the edifienge of the vnitie of the fayth of christ / that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer will / shall by his awne auctorite / take ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther mannes translacion &amp; put oute &amp; in and
<pb facs="13"/>
chaunge at pleasure / &amp; call it a correccion.</p>
   <p>Moreover / ye shall vnderstōde that George Ioye hath had of a longe tyme marvelouse y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginaciōs aboute this worde resurrecciō / y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it shuld be taken for the state of the soules af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter their departinge frō their bodyes / &amp; hath also (though he hath been reasoned with ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of &amp; desyred to cease) yet sowen his doctryne by secret lettres on that syde the see / &amp; caused great division amōge y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> brethrē. In so moche that Iohn Fryth beynge in preson in the tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re of Londō / a lytle before his death / wrote y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we shuld warne him &amp; desyer him to cease / &amp; wolde have then wrytten agaynst him / had I not withstonde him. Therto I have been sen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce informed y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> no small nōber thorow his cu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riosite / vtterly denye the resurreccion of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fles<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>she &amp; bodye / affirminge y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the soule whē she is departed / is the spirituall bodye of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reccion / &amp; other resurreccion shall there none be. And I have talked with some of them my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe / so doted in that folye / that it were as go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>od perswade a post / as to plucke that madnes oute of their braynes. And of this all is Geor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge Ioyes vnquyet curiosite y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hole occasion / whether he be of the sayde facciō also / or not / to that let him answer him selfe.</p>
   <p>If George Ioye wyll saye (as I wot well he will) that his chaunge / is the sence &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of those scriptures. I answer it is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner sayde then proved: howbeit let other mē iudge. But though it were y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> verie meaninge
<pb facs="14"/>
of the scripture: yet if it were lawfull after his ensample to every man to playe boo pepe with the translacions that are before him / &amp; to put oute y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wordes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> text at his pleasure &amp; to put in every where his meaninge: or what he thought the meaninge were / that were the next waye to stablyshe all heresyes and to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stroye the grounde wherewith we shuld im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them. As for an ensample / whē Christ sayth Io. v. The tyme shall come in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> which all that are in the graves shall heare his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce &amp; shall come forth: they that have done go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od vnto resurreccion of lyfe / or with the resur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reccion of lyfe / &amp; they have done evell / vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> reccion or with the resurreccion of damnaciō. George Ioyes correccion is / they that have do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne good shall come forth into the verie lyfe / &amp; they that have done evell into the life of dam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naciō / thrustinge cleane oute this worde resur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>recciō. Now by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same auctorite / &amp; w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> as good reason shall another come &amp; saye of the rest of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> text / they y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> are in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sepulchres / shall hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re his voyce / that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sence is / the soules of thē that are in the sepulchres shall heare his voy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce / &amp; so put in his diligent correccion &amp; mocke oute y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> text / that it shall not make for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> resur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>recciō of the flesshe / which thinge also Geor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge Ioyes correcciō doth manyfestlye affirme. If the text be lefte vncorrupt / it will pourge hir selfe of all maner false gloses / how sotle soever they be fayned / as a sethinge pot ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth vp hir scome. But yf the false glose be
<pb facs="14"/>
made the text / diligentlye oversene &amp; correct / wherewith then shall we correcte false doctri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne &amp; defende Christes flocke from false opini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons / &amp; frō y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wycked heresyes of raveninge of wolves? In my mynde therfore a lytle vnfay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned love after the rules of Christ / is worth moche hie learninge / &amp; single &amp; sleyght vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stondinge that edifieth in vnitie / is moche bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter then sotle curiosite / &amp; mekenes better then bolde arrogancye and stondinge over moche in a mannes awne consayte.</p>
   <p>Wherfore / concernynge the resurreccion / I protest before god and oure savioure Iesus Christ / and before the vniversall congregaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that beleveth in him / that I beleve accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dynge to the open and manyfest scriptures &amp; catholyck fayth / that Christ is rysen agayne in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> flesshe which he receaved of his mother y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> blessed virgin marie / &amp; bodye wherin he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we shall all both good and bad ryse both flesshe &amp; bodye / &amp; apere together before the iudgement seat of christ / to receave every man accordynge to his dedes. And that the bodyes of all that beleve &amp; contynew in the true fayth of christ / shalbe endewed w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> lyke immortalyte and glorie as is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bodye of christ</p>
   <p>And I protest before God and oure saviou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Christ &amp; all that beleve in him / that I hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> soules that are departed as moche as maye be proved by manifest &amp; opē scripture / &amp; thinke the soules departed in the fayth of Christ &amp; love of the lawe of God / to be in no worse case then y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> soule of Christ was / frō y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me <pb facs="15"/>
y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he delivered his sprite into the handes of his father / vntyll the resurreccion of his bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dye in glorie &amp; immortalite. Neverthelater / I cōfesse openly / y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I am not persuaded y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they be all readie in the full glorie that Christ is in / or the elect angels of god are in. Nether is it anye article of my fayth: for if it so were / I se not but then the preachinge of the resurrec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciō of the flesshe were a thinge in vayne. Notwithstondinge yet I am readie to beleve it / if it maye be proved with open scripture. And I have desyred George Ioye to take opē textes that seme to make for y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> purpose / as this is. To daye thou shalt be with me in Paradise / to make therof what he coulde / and to let his dreames aboute this worde resurreccion goo. For I receave not in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scripture y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> pryvat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretaciō of any mānes brayne / without opē testimony of eny scriptures agreinge thereto.</p>
   <p>Moreover I take God (which alone seeth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> heart) to recorde to my conscience / besechinge him y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> my parte be not in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bloude of Christ / if I wrote of all y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I have wryttē thorow ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te all my boke / ought of an evell purpose / of envie or malice to anye mā / or to stere vp any false doctrine or opinion in the churche of Christ / or to be auctor of anye secte / or to dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we disciples after me / or that I wolde be este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or had in pryce above the least chylde y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is borne / save onlye of pitie &amp; cōpassion I had &amp; yet have on the blindnes of my brethrē / &amp; to bringe them vnto the knowledge of Christ / &amp;
<pb facs="15"/>
to make every one of them / if it were possible as perfect as an angell of heavē / &amp; to wede ou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te all y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is not planted of oure hevenly father / &amp; to bringe doune all that lyfteth vp it selfe agaynst the knowledge of the salvacion that is in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bloude of Christ. Also / my parte be not in Christ / if myne heart be not to folowe &amp; ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve accordinge as I teache / and also if myne heart wepe not nyght &amp; daye for myne awne synne &amp; other mennes indifferētlye / besechin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge God to cōvert vs all / &amp; to take his wrath from vs / &amp; to be mercifull as well to all other men / as to myne awne soule / caringe for the welth of the realme I was borne in / for the kinge and all that are therof / as a tender hear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted mother wolde do for hir only sonne.</p>
   <p>As concerninge all I have translated or other wise written / I beseche all men to reade it for that purpose I wrote it: even to bringe them to the knowledge of the scripture. And as farre as the scripture approveth it / so farre to alowe it / &amp; if in anye place the worde of god dysalow it / there to refuse it / as I do before oure savyour Christ &amp; his congregacion. And where they fynde fautes / let them shew it me / if they be nye / or wryte to me / if they be farre of: or wryte opēly agaynst it &amp; improve it / &amp; I promyse them / if I shall perceave that there reasons conclude I will confesse myne igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raunce openly.</p>
   <p>Wherfore I beseche George Ioye / ye &amp; all other to / for to translate y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scripture for them
<pb facs="16"/>
selves / whether oute of Greke / Latyn: or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue. Or (if they wyll nedes) as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> foxe when he hath pyssed in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> grayes hole chalengeth it for his awne / so let them take my transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions &amp; laboures / &amp; chaunge &amp; alter / &amp; correcte &amp; corrupte at their pleasures / and call it their awne translaciōs / &amp; put to their awne names / &amp; not to playe boo pepe after George Ioyes maner. Which whether he have done fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully &amp; truly / with suche reverence &amp; feare as becōmeth the worde of God / &amp; with soche lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ve and mekenes &amp; affeccion to vnite and circū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spexcion that the vngodlye have none occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to rayle on the verite / as becōmeth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vauntes of Christ / I referre it to the iudgemē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes of them that knowe and love the trouth. For this I protest / that I provoke not Ioye ner any other man (but am prouoked / &amp; that after the spytfullest maner of provokynge) to do sore agaynst my will and with sorow of harte that I now do. But I nether can ner will soffre of anye man / that he shall goo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke my translacion and correct it without na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me / &amp; make soche chaungynge as I my selfe durst not do / as I hope to have my parte in Christ / though the hole worlde shuld be gevē me for my laboure.</p>
   <p>Finally that new Testamēt thus dyligēt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly corrected / besyde this so ofte puttinge oute this worde resurreccion / and I wote not what other chaūge / for I have not yet reede it over / hath in the ende before the Table of the
<pb facs="16"/>
Epistles and Gospelles this tytle: (Here endeth the new Testament dyly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gentlye ouersene and correct and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted now agayne at Andwarp / by me wydow of Christophell of Endho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. In the yere of oure Lorde. A .M. D. xxxiiii. in August.) Which tytle (reader) I have here put in because by this thou shalt knowe the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the better. Vale. ☞ ▪ ☞ ❧</p>
