   <p>
      <hi>CHristian Reader,</hi> this booke was long since promised, my attendance was the cause of the stay, but at length it is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. I had rather with <hi>Cato</hi> craue pardon for my fault, in doing this, then keepe my selfe cleere from committing this fault: for I haue herein satisfied the importunity which imposed it, on me, and the necessity of the cause which drew me, to it. In the <hi>Triumph,</hi> that is proued true which <hi>Tully</hi> spake of <hi>Athenago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras:</hi> Of his offence hee spake nothing, but complained of his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There was small cause of the <hi>Authors</hi> flying, lesse of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling. His reproachfull tearmes, defiling and besmearing those many and worthy <hi>Divines,</hi> I could haue returned in the same lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: hardly can any that shall answer him, avoid it, without calumny, or so pay him his owne, without note of infamy. But in these labours, nothing is to be more praied for, then a sanctified spirit, and therefore I haue as much as possibly I might, avoided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that may seem contumelious or malitious. It resteth, that I find <hi>Christian,</hi> and <hi>brotherly interpretation,</hi> in this labor, by those that shall pervse it. My hast may betray the manner of my writing, not the matter. And it may be, I shall find some such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,<note place="margin">Hier Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oem. in l. 2 cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met. in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seā.</note> as <hi>S. Hierom</hi> did: <hi>Alij</hi> (saith he) <hi>quasi parva contemnunt, &amp; quicquid dixerimus contractare despiciunt; alij magis ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum silentium, quàm nostrum studium probant; quidam in eo, se disertos arbitrantur &amp; doctos, si alieno operi detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hant.</hi> If such <hi>Readers</hi> meete with my booke, I feare not. If my book meet with such, I care not. The better sort I hope to find, &amp; leaue attentiue, and will pray for all meanes of their instruction in this world, and salvation in the better world.</p>
