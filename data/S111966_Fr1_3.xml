   <head>AN ADMONITION VNTO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>East the shortnesse of this Commentarie (gentle Reader) and thereby perhaps the hardnesse of the same, might either hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or discorage thee in the reading ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I thought good to admonish thee of these few things. First, the meaning of the Author was not to write any large or full volume at this time, but briefly, yet exactly, to set downe the method and order, &amp; as it were the frame of this Prophecie: and so to distribute the same into diverse branches and members, that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion auoyded, thou mightest distinctly see to what part of the storie of the Church, and to what point of time, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing is to be referred. As for the matters contained herein, he thought it sufficient in few words to note and interpret the same. Notwithstānding my hope is, thou shalt find so much expressed briefly, as may in good part satisfie thy desire, and giue thee occasion to consider further of the particulars themselues, when thou shalt see the sence and meaning of them for thy direction. Many I know haue written more largely of this booke, whose labours are not to be contēned. Here breuity was sought, that all things, that all things being in a maner at once set before thine
<pb facs="6"/>
eye, thou mightest both more easily comprehend that which is sayd, and better imprint it in thy memory. If thou shalt here find any thing different from the iudgement of others, let it not offend thee: considering that in mysteries of this sort, it hath alwayes bene free for men of learning, and excelling in gifts, without either disgrace to those that went before them, or preiudice to them that follow after them, to deliuer that which they have receiued, and to commend the same vnto the iudgement of the Church. Now that thy labour may be with more ease, and with greater frute and delight; reade not the commentarie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but with present view and consideration of that part of the text wherunto it doth appertaine: for which cause thou shalt finde the text and the commentarie belonging vnto it, alwayes printed vpon the same page. As for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine words of Art which could not be auoyded, and some other vnwonted speech, they shall I trust nothing hinder thy proceeding, because that which is obscure in them at the first sight, will by that which followeth be made light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and plaine vnto thee. It shall also be profitable for thee, when thou art entred into the reading of this litle worke, not to suffer thy selfe to be distracted or carried away by wearinesse or vnconstancie, vntill thou haue seene the end of the booke: that comparing all things together, thou mayest make accompt of thy labour and profiting herein: both for the truth of the matter propounded, and for thine vse and frute by the same. Also it shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thee, if not attaining to vnderstand all things at the first reading, thou shalt for the excellencie of the matter, which alwayes bringeth some difficultie with it, not refuse
<pb facs="7"/>
to repeat it the second, and if need rquire the third time. The often noting of the particular Chapters and verses is more certainly to direct thee to that, the knowledge or remembrance whereof is necessarie vnto the present place, for thy further instruction. For the Tables I haue contracted them as I thought might be more commodious for thee. Vnto this commentarie of <hi>Iunius</hi> is added the briefe notes of <hi>Beza</hi> and others in a diuerse character, and that in the margent of the text, whereunto thou art directed by the letters of the alphabet: as vnto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie by arithmeticall figures. For the translation of the text, I haue in a maner wholly vsed that which is most common and in euery mans hand: onely for plainnesse sake and more euidencie, I haue in some few places, framed the same vnto that later edition of the Latine, which as I thought, did more nearely approch vnto the originall Greeke copie. Thus commending thy studies vnto the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Gods most holy spirit, I bid thee farewell in the Lord Iesus. The <hi>5.</hi> of Februarie, <hi>1591.</hi>
