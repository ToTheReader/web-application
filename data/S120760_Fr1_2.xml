      <head>A PROLOGVE to Phisicions.</head>
      <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Gregious doctours and maysters of the Eximious and Archane Science of phisick of your Vrbanitie Exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate not your selues against mee, for making of this little volume of phisicke. Considering that my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is for an vtilitie and a cōmon wealth. And this not onelie, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so I doe it (for no detriment) but for a preferment of your laudable science, that euerie man shuld esteme, repute, and regard the excelent facultie. And also you to be extolled and highlie to be preferred, that hath, and doth studie, practise, and labour, this saide Archane Sience, to the which none inarcious persons can nor shall attaine to the knowledge: yet this notwithstanding, fooles &amp; incipient persons, yea and manie that doth thinke themselues wife (the which in this facultie be fooles in deed) will enterprise to smatter and to meddle to minister medicines, and can not tell how, when, and at what time the medisine should bee ministred, but who is bolder then blind Bayerd, for a Lady, agentilewoman, a blind priest, a fie on such a one now a daies wilt practise either by a blynd booke, either else that they haue beene in the companie of some doctour of Phisicke, or else hauing an Author of Phisicke, or Authors, and will minister after them, and can not tell what the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour ment in his ministration. The philosopher saith, when the Philosopher doth make an end, the Phisicion doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, where shall he or she begin that can but write &amp; reade, and doth vnderstand little learning or none. O Lord what a great detriment is this to the noble Science of phisicke, that ignoraunt persons will enterprise to meddle with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
<pb facs="3"/> of phisick, that Galen, prince of phisicions in his Terapenticke doth reprehēd &amp; disproue, saying. If phisiciōs had nothing to doe with Astronomy, Geomatry, Logicke, &amp; other sciences, Coblers, Curriars of lether, Carpenters and Smithes, &amp; al such maner of people would leaue their craftes, and be phisicions, as it appereth now a daies that many cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers be, fie on such ones, whereupon Galen reprehended Tessalus for his ignorance: for Tessalus smattered and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with phisicke, and yet he knew not what he did, as many doth now a daies, the which I may accompt Tessalus folish disciples. Auenzoar saith, euerie phisicion ought to know first learning, &amp; then practise, that is to say, first to haue Grā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to vnderstand what he doth rede in latin. Then to haue logick to dicusse or diffine by argumentation the truth from the falsehode, and so econuerso. And then to haue a rethorick or an eloquent tongue, the which should be placable to the hearers of his words. And also to haue geomatry, to ponder and waie the dregs or porcions the which ought to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred. Arithmetick is necessarie to be had concerning nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration: but a boue all things next to Grammer, a phisiciō must haue surelie his Astronomy, to know, how, when, and at what time euerie medicine ought to be ministred, and then finallie to know natural philosophy, the which cōsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the knowledge of naturll things. And all these things had, then is a man apt to studie phisick by speculation. And speculatiō obteined, then boldlie a mā may practise phisick. And whosoeuer he or shee be that will practise phisicke in ministring medicines, not hauing these aforesaid sciences, shal kill many more then he shall saue, for &amp; any such blinde phisicion helpe or heale one person, the person so healed is healed more by chance then by any cūning, euen like as the blind man doth cast his staffe, peraduenture he hit the thing that he doth cast at, peraduenture not hit it, wherfore I do aduertise euerie man and woman, of what degree or estate soeuer they be, lacking the speculation of phisick, to beware to minister mediciens although they take nothing for their labour, nor for the medicines, for if they haue not a doctourrs
<pb facs="3"/> learning and also knowing their simples how they shall cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them, and what operation they be of, and how, and whan, &amp; at what time they should be ministred, such igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant persons may doe great harme, although they doe think no euil, and let them think and make the best they can, yet for their presumption they shall offend both god and man. There be some blind phisicions that will excuse themselues saying, that they doe folow their booke or bookes, nay, nay it is not so, for they doe folow their folish presumptuous minde, for if doctours of phisick should at al times folow their bookes, they should doe more harme then good. And some blind phisicions will say, I was taught of such a doctor to practise this thing and that thing, such practising doth kill manie men that might liue many yeeres. Wherefore to conclude, I aduertise al marcious phisicions to beware here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in the ministration of interial medicines, for they doe not onelie offend god and their neighbour, but also they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the kings actes and lawes, the which willeth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth with great penaltie that no man should enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise to medle with phisick, but they which be learned and admitted, as it doth appere more largelier in the Introduction of knowledge desiring all maner of Phisicions to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented &amp; to practise them with this my writing, for in this matter I haue now discharged my consciēce in shewing the truth as god knoweth, who send al maner of phisicions a true knowledge in phisick, that they the which be sick &amp; disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, may haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</p>

      <head>A Propheme to Chierurgions.</head>
      <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hierurgerie is a laudable science &amp; worthie to be estemed &amp; regarded for the great vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of it, for it is a science vrgent, needful, and necessarie for the preseruation of mans life, wherfore masters of chierurgery, ought to be expert in their facultie, hauing good wittes and memorie, euermore to be diligent and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable about their cures, and to bée of a good iudgement in the knowledge of the disease, and to minister such sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues &amp; medicines as is according to the infirmity, sicknesse, or sore.</p>
      <p>Also they must haue a good eye and a stedfast hand, for chierurgerie taketh the name of two wordes of Gréeke, of <hi>Chier,</hi> which is an hand, and of <hi>Ergasomei,</hi> which is operacion, which is to say, operation or working with the hand, for Chierurgerie cōsisteth in working medicienes and other necessarie things concerning the science with the hand. Also Chierurgions ought to be wise, gentil, sober, circumspect and learned, and not dronken, and to promise no more then they be able to perfourme with gods helpe, and not to be boisterous about his pacients, but lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly to comfort them.</p>
      <p>Also euerie Chierurgion ought to know the complexion of his patient, and to consider the age, the weakenesse, and strenth, and diligently to consider if the sicknes, sore, or impediment, be perticuler by himselfe: or else that it haue any other infirmitie concurrant with it: or els that the sicknes in the exterial partes haue anie féeding from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall partes, and that they be circumspect in incisions and Scarifications and Flebothomy, and sure in Anothomy, and in no wise to let blud in anie perticular place, there where the signe hath anie dominion.</p>
      <p>Furthermore chierurgions must be circumspect in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching gréene wounds that be festered and fistiled, and that
<pb facs="4"/> they clense and scoure the wounds from all corruption, and that they heale not the wounds to quickly, making the wound whole aboue, and false vnderneth. And in any wise let them be sure in serching of the déepnes of wounds and fistules, and according to the déepnes to make the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Moreouer Chierurgions must know the oposicion and the coniunction of the Moone, and in what signe the Moone is in euerie day, and to know what signes be attractiue, what signes be recentiue, what signes bée expulciue, and what signes be digestiue. Also they must konw the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of all maner of breades, of drinkes, and of meates. And to haue euer in a redines their instruments and their salues, and their ointments, and in periculus causes one Chierurgion ought to consult with an other, &amp; to haue the counsel of a doctour of phisicke, for there is no man can bée to sure to helpe a man, as god knoweth, who kéepe vs al.

      <head>A Preamble to sicke men, and to those that be wounded.</head>
      <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Do aduertise euerie sicke man, and al other men the which hath any infirmytie, sicknes, or impediment, aboue all things to pacifie himselfe, or to arme himselfe with patience, and to fyre his heart and minde in Christs death and passion, and to call to his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, what paine, what aduersitie, &amp; wat penurie, and pouertie Christ did suffer for vs. And he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> can thus pacifie himselfe, and féele his owne paine in Christes passion, shall mittigate his paines and anguish, be it neuer so great. And therefore let euerie sicke person stick as fast to Christ in his paines and sicknes, as Christ did stick fast to the Crosse for our sinnes and redempcion. And then if the pacient wil haue any counsel in phisicke: first let him call to him his spirituall phisicion, which is his Ghostlie father, and let him make his concience cleane, &amp; that he be in perfect loue &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, &amp; if he haue done anie wrong let him make restitution
<pb facs="5"/> if he can, and if he be in debt, let him looke to it, &amp; make a formal will or testament, setting euerie thing in a dew or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the wealth of his soule, wise men be sure of their testaments making manie yéeres before they die, and doth renew it once a yéere as they increase or decrease in goods or substance. Al these aforesaide things ghostly and godly prouided for the soule, then let the pacient prouide for his bodie, and take councel of some expert phisicion, how and in what wise the bodie may be recouered of his infirmitie, &amp; than to commit his bodie to the industrie of his phisicion, and at all times redie to folow the will, mynde, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of his phisicion, for whosoeuer wil do y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> contrary, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith. <hi>Seipsum in terimit qui precepta medici ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruare non vult,</hi> that is to say. Hée doth kill himselfe that doth not obserue the commandement of his phisicion.</p>
      <p>After all this, marke this matter well, that if there bée anie Physicion or Chirurgion, which is with anye sicke man, woman or childe, let no man disquiet them that be in the house, nor tell them what they should doe, let euerie person be tendable about them, and doe as they shall Commaund them.</p>
      <p>And let euerie man in the house please and serue the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicion or Chirurgion honestlie, and let them lacke nothing, to the ende, that they may be the more deligent to doe the thing that they goe aboute: which is to recouer the sicke person, for and if the Phisition or the Chirurgion be check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not gentlie intreted, and haue no more then they do command, it will discourage them so much, that they wil haue no ioy nor pleasure to doe their cure. I had rather not to meddle with phisicions and chirurgions, then to haue them, if I should displese them: for if they be displesed, ther is neither Lord nor Ladie, nor no other person can haue any seruice or pleasure of them, for this matter looke further in the Introduction of knowledge, and there shall you sée what is good both for the Soule and body in God.

      <head>THE PREFACE TO the readers of this booke.</head>
      <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Readers, I haue taken some paine in making this booke, to doe sicke men plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and whole men profyt, that sicke men may recuperate their health, &amp; whole men may preserue themselues from sicknesse, (with Gods helpe) aswell in phisicke as in chirurgerie. But for as much, as olde auncient and auten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike autours or doctours of phisicke, in their bokes, doth write many obscure termes, geuing also to many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers infirmities, darke and hard names, difficile to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, some and most of all being Greeke wordes, some &amp; fewe being Araby wordes, some being latin words, and some being barbar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="3 letters">
            <desc>•••</desc>
         </gap> words. Therefore I haue translated al such obscure words &amp; names into English, that euerie man openly and apartly may vnderstand them.</p>
      <p>Furtheremore all the aforesaide names of the saide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities be set together in order, according to the letters of the Alphabete, or the A.B.C. So that as manie names as dothe begine with A. be set together and so forth, all other letters as they be in order. Also there is no sickenes in man or woman, the which may be from the crowne of the heade to the soole of the foote, but you shall fynde it in this booke, aswell the sicknesse the which doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to chirurgerie as to phisicke, and what the sicknesse is, and how it doeth come, and medicines for the selfe same. And for as much as euerie man now a daies, is desirous to reede briefe and compendious matters. I therfore in this matter pretende to satisfie mens mindes as much as I can, naming this booke according to the matter, which is. The Breuiarie of health: &amp; where that I am very briefe in shewing briefe medecines for one sicknes. I doe it for two causes, the first cause is, that the Archane science of phisicke
<pb facs="6"/> should not be manyfest and open, for then the eximious science should fall into great detrement, and doctours the which hath studied the facultie should not be regarded so well as they are. Secondarilie if I should write all my mynde, euerie bongler would practise phisicke vpon my booke, wherefore I doe omit and leaue out manie things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishing that I haue omitted to doctours of high iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of whom I shall be shent for part of these things that I haue written in this booke: how be it in tihs matter I doe set God before mine eyes and charitie, considering that I doe write this booke for a common welth, as god knoweth my pretence, not onelie in making this booke, but al other bookes that I haue made, that I did neuer looke for no reward, neither of Lord, nor of Prynter, nor of no man liuing, nor I had neuer no reward, nor I will neuer haue none as long as I doe liue, god helping me, whose perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and fatherly blessing light on vs all.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="section">
      <head>The apendex to all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses that folovveth.</head>
      <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ordes, Ladies, &amp; Gentle men, learned and vnlearned, of what estate or degrée so euer you be of, thinke not that no man can bée holpen by no maner of medicines, if so be God doo send the sicknesse, for he hath put a time to euerie man, ouer the which time no man by art nor science can not prolong the time: for the number of the monthes &amp; daies of mans life god know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. But this aforesaid time these monthes and daies, a man may shorten or a breuiate many waies concerning
<pb facs="6"/> that God hath giuen man in this life frée will, the which of his righteousnes as longe as we doe liue, hée can not take it a waie from vs. Now we hauing this frée wil, diuers times we doe not occupie it to the will of god as it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ppereth both for soule and bodie, we do kill our soules as much as doth lye in vs, when that we doe breake anie of his commandements, or do sinne deadlie, for that matter he hath prouided a spirituall medicine, which is repētaūce &amp; amēdemēt of life. Also we do kill our bodies as much as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in vs (except that a man doe kill himselfe wilfullie) as many daily doth (contrarie to gods will) as well the one as the other, when a man doth a breuiate his life by surfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, by dronkennesse, by pencifulnesse, by thought and care, by taking the pockes with women, and leprousnes, and manie other infectious sicknesses, beside robbing, figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, killing, and manie other mischances, which is not gods will that such thinges should be done, but God knowing at the beginning of the creation of the world, that man would be prone manie waies to a breuiate his life, made them prouision that man might be holpen, by his grace, and then the vertue the which he did giue to herbes, wéedes, trées, rootes, fruites, and stones. The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vertue of the which, few men or none doth know them, except doctours of phisicke, and such as doe labour to haue the knowledge of their operations.</p>
      <p>And this knowledge notwithstanding let no man think that there is no phisicion nor chierurgion can make a man sodenlie whole of his infirmitie, as Christ and his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and manie other Saintes did, for they must haue lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, time and space as their liuing and practise is, for sicke men, &amp; womē, be like a péece of rustie harnis, the which can not be made bright at the first scouring, but let a man continew in rubing and scouring, and than the harnis wil be bright, so in like maner a sicke man can not be made whole of his malady or sicknes the first daie, but he must cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with his mediciens.</p>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <p>But héere let euerie man that is sicke, beware of blind phisicions and chirurgions the which be ignorant and can not tell what things doth pertaine to their science, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all men beware of vacabounds &amp; runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates that wil smatter with phisick, for by such persons many sicke men haue béene decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the more pitie, God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, who helpe vs all now and euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
