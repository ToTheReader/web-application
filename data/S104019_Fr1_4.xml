      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is accounted an especiall Honour in the <hi>GARTER;</hi> that it makes them, which for theyr vertue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts are admitted of it, Companions even unto <hi>KINGS</hi> and <hi>PRINCES.</hi> Those therefore, which are ioyned together in so
<pb facs="6"/>
strict a bond of Vnitie, and made the same in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all Noble qualities; farre bee it from my thoughts to take asunder: or to select <hi>Particulars,</hi> out of a <hi>Generall</hi> bodie, so united. The rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I now addresse my selfe unto You, in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Cause; wherein your whole <hi>Fraternitie,</hi> is ingaged ioyntly. It is almost Three hundred yeares, since that most excellent <hi>Order,</hi> never before ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at once, with such and so many Noble spirits; was by the <hi>Founder</hi> of it, Dedicated to St. <hi>GEORGE</hi> of <hi>CAPPADOCIA.</hi> A <hi>Saint,</hi> more than a Thousand yeares before that Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, crowned with <hi>Martyrdome:</hi> And ever since, continually famous in the Church of <hi>GOD.</hi> Onely some few of late, on what authoritie I know not; have tooke upon them to discharge him, both of his place in Heaven, and reputation in the Church. In which, though their opinions are so contrary, that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly there can bee no agreement made betweene them: yet they agree together to disgrace that holy <hi>Martyr:</hi> For by the first ranke of them, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly affirmed, that <hi>GEORGE</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> so much honoured in the <hi>Christian world,</hi> is but a <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> a <hi>Larva;</hi> onely some strange <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera,</hi> the issue of an idle braine; one that had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any being on the Earth. The others, as unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionably, have made him in his life, a dangerous and bloudy <hi>Hereticke:</hi> and since his death, a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Soule amongst the damned. On both sides, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis pro imperio.</hi> For this cause, it hath often beene one of my chiefest wishes, that some of those,
<pb facs="6"/>
whose names are great for learning, and eminent in point of knowledge; would undertake the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of this iniured <hi>Saint.</hi> But finding none, that have as yet adventured in it: I rather chose to put my selfe upon the taske, than that <hi>Saint GEORGE</hi> should longer suffer in his honour, and this Realme in him. The worke, such as it is, next under his most sacred Maiestie, I consecrate to you (most excellent <hi>Kings, Princes,</hi> and <hi>Peeres</hi>) and to the honour of that most noble Order, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you are; and in defence of which you were all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, at your severall Installations. You celebrate <hi>St. GEORGE'S</hi> Feast, with many stately and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Ceremonies: you weare his image and representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as your chiefest Ornament; you count it an especiall honour, to be called his <hi>Knights.</hi> I doubt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but <hi>St. GEORGE</hi> thus vindicated from the pennes and stomacke of his <hi>Enemies,</hi> will finde a gracious welcome to you: and that you will be pleased for <hi>St. GEORGE'S</hi> sake, to entertaine a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable opinion both of the Worke and of the Author. In a full hope whereof, I doe with all Humilitie and Reverence, subscribe my selfe</p>
