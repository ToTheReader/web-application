      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T IS no Nouelty lately practised by the Protestāts of our age; it hath alwaies beene the vsual trade, and inueterate guile of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes in former tymes, to corrupt, falsifie, and depraue, not onlie the Bookes, and Writings, but the wordes, sayings, and other Conferences they haue held with the professours of the Catholike Church.
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
      <hi>Origen</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ruffin in Apol. pro Orig.</note> complayneth how his bookes were thus abused by the enemies of God, and <hi>Sowers of Cockle,</hi> euen in his owne dayes. <hi>S. Augustine</hi>
      <note place="margin">Aug. in breui. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</note> writeth, that the <hi>Donatists</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuicted of falshood in a Collation he had with them, did after maliciously calumniate, and traduce the sentence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen against them, as falslie pronounced. The <hi>Arians, Pelagians,</hi> and other auncient Sectaries were attainted of the like crime. And now our <hi>Puritans,</hi> and Protestants are proued guiltie of the same, or far more treacherous dealing, by which they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to vnderproppe the rotten beames of their ruinous, vnconstant, &amp; declining doctrine.</p>

Of this was <hi>M. Iewell</hi> guilty, as <hi>D. Harding</hi> in manie of his writings, &amp;
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
      <hi>M. VValsingham</hi> in his <hi>Search,</hi> haue eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dētly discouered. Guilty was <hi>M. Reynolds</hi> in publishing his Conference with <hi>M. Hart,</hi> wherein he forged diuers things to the credit of his owne, and disaduantage of his Opponents cause, of which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so much as dreamed. Therefore <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> trulie auerreth of these, and such like heretikes, that, <hi>by their labours and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions, they endeauour not so much to attayne the truth, as to seeme victorious:</hi> they more eagerlie thirst after the applause of men, then the glory of God: <hi>they seeke such things as apertayne to themselues, not such as belong to Iesus Christ.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>3. In which kind, most notable now of late, and most fresh in memorie, is the pride and arrogancie of <hi>D. Featly,</hi> who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudentlie boasted of his supposed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest in a meeting which he, &amp; <hi>D. VVhite</hi> had with <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> and <hi>M. Sweete:</hi> from which neuerthelesse he cowardlie fled; wholie discomfited, and blotted with the
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
ignomonie of a desperate Retraite. No lesse shamefull (though in a conflict lesse famous) is the vanitie of <hi>M. VValker,</hi> in bragging of the Conference betweene him and <hi>M. Smith,</hi> which himself hath set forth stuffed with such a heapeof false and guilefull relations, as he may seeme (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prophet) <hi>to haue made lying to be protected.</hi> Nothing trembling at that<note place="margin">Isa. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      <hi>as a bowe of lying, and not of truth</hi> &amp;c. <hi>His tongue is a wandering arrow; it hath spoken guile.</hi> For in relating the arguments and answers which passed on both sides, some he changeth, some he corrupteth: heere he leaueth out, there he foisteth in: one while he disioynteth the wordes, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while he dismembreth, &amp; peruerteth the

sense: in fine he maketh such a misshapen and confused Chaos of malicious slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, of foolish &amp; impertinent additions, as may well become one of his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and bastardly brood; which the iudicious Reader may playnlie perceaue by the true narration I shall heer deliuer, without inserting any more then shallbe necessarie for the iust reproofe of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries forgeries, or redargution of other speaches purposelie omitted, and suppressed by him.</p>

So
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>
powerfull is the aduerse faction in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vs downe, and openlie disgracing vs with their calumnious libels; and so vigilant and watchfull in stopping all possible meanes we should take, to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest our innocencie. But such violent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression cannot still continue; the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes teares, the Orphans cryes will at length be heard; and Christs afflicted flocke, our silenced pennes, may find a tyme to lay open our sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the wrong which is done vs, by their false crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
