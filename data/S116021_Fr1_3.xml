      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREas this little trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise offereth it selfe to the viewe without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors name, herein who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he be that compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, whether hee bee Dutch, French, or Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish desireth to hold him excused. Hee thought it more conuenient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the holy vniuersall and Apostolique Churche it selfe speaking in her owne person, name, and voyce: that so she might debate her owne cause being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique &amp; not priuat against her aduersary the Pope with greater grauitie and maiestie. For as the Lorde hath not geuen equabilitie of estate to all persons alike, &amp; as one and the selfe same maner of speache accordeth not with all sortes of men: So was it not seemely to depende the generall greeuaunce of all nations, &amp; the vniuersall complaint of all people vpon the mouth of any one priuate person: as neither woulde one maner of pleading in so weightie a matter become any one priuate Aduocate. With another maner of coūtenāce speaketh <hi>Cicero</hi> as a Consul and Iudge, then when as a priuate Orator hee pleadeth at the common barre. Certes our lot hath beene so vnluckie to light vppon these dayes nowe, all matters being so on all parts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenimed with poyson, and so on all sides waxen can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kred and incurable, that neither indeuoure nor petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, praier, nor wholsome admonition of any priuate person were able in any respect to auaile. For this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane rufler maketh not so slender an accompt of his Peacockes plummes, as to vouchsafe any priuate coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sale

or correction. This hydeous Hydre requireth too be matched with mightier countenances and powers of greater estate: whether the Lord Christ himself wyl vouchsafe to destroy this monster with the breath of his mouth frō out of heauē: or whether the excellent maiestie of mightie Potentates and Monarches of the earth, vniting all theyr Councelles in one wyl not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine of their authorities royal to become publique Vmpieres here, &amp; yeeld their princely assistāce to the suppressing of this insolēt outrage. Wherfore if ought in this treatie may seeme (gentle Reader) to haue byn vttered with ouermuch bitternesse of speach: Imagine in thy minde of this discourse, as though it proceeded not from any one particular member of the Churche alone, but from the whole Church it selfe, or from Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Paul, or else frō the whole parliament of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles proclaiming their generall consentes, voyces, and mutuall agreements by their authoritie Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique: who, as did in times past with incredible tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and industrie plant and enlarge the boundes of Christs Church, so if they were liuing now, and beheld with their eyes the merueilous misdemeanors and dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>orders of the Churche, without all peraduenture they woulde thunder out far more bitter and sharper stormes of reproouing speaches against this horrible aduersarie of Christe. The Lorde Iesu blesse thee, Christian Reader.</p>
