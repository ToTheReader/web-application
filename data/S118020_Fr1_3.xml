   <head>TO THE VERTVOVS, and religious priestes, as also the godlie constant, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick laitie of Ireland I. C. vvisheth the grace of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance in Chriest his catho: church.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Being (louing bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrē and cuntrimē) to performe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pilgrimage, did heare there vvas a persecutiō intended in our cuntrie against
<pb facs="5"/>our catholick religion, as also a proclamation published against the priestes &amp; professors therof. I thought good to aefer my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed tourney to those holie reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and to recollecte my self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some place, that I may asvvell de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clare my duetie to the catholick church, in these her troubles &amp; persecutions, as also signifie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you my vnfained affectiō, &amp; christian charitie in these your aduersities. and seeing it is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine precept to loue our negbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and being affirmatiue, it bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to put it in execution in
<pb facs="5"/>their destresses and in time of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie. <hi>I</hi> thought good to comfort you in your sorrovves, and to counsell you in your doubtes vvhich be vvorkes of mercie, &amp; also to bevvayle your miseries so the apostle did,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> vvhen he said <hi>quis infirmatur &amp; ego non infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> vvho is sick or indisposed, and I feele it not? So also did Iob vvhen he said <hi>flebam super eum qui afflictus erat &amp; compatieba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur anima mea pauperi</hi> the:
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Iob</hi> 30.</note> affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of my negbour did cause me to vveepe, and his poouertie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to compassiō. I send ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="6"/>vnto you this Mnemosynum or memoriall asvvell for your consolation in your troubles, as also for your resolution in your doubtes, I made it first in Latine and thought onlie to dedicat it vnto the priestes and religious of our nation, but being readie to go to the presse, I vvas persvva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by certaine graue religious persons to translate it vnto En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, being a language more vul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gare and cōmon vnto you, hoping it may vvork some good effect in such as could not vnderstand it in the latine. and although my
<pb facs="6"/>onlie purpose is to spare no paines vvhere I may do the greatest good <hi>&amp; dum tempus habemus bonum operari</hi> to bestovv the residue of my fraile life, and vncertaine daies vvhere J may do god &amp; his church the best seruice, yet I found great difficultie to ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue it printed in English for too causes, the one, vvas, vvhat I had to disraise my charges; I should bestovv it in the printing being a language altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>knovven vnto the printer, and therfore more charges and longer time should be required, the other
<pb facs="7"/>that I should be vvray my ovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne insufficiencie therin, vvhich vnto me is not so natural asvvell for my birth, as for my bringing vp, but I hope a fault in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is not an offence before god, vvhich respecteth more the invvard intention of my hearte, then the outvvard characters by vvhich J declare the same.
