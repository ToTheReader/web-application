   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue no humour to play the
Curious in a forraine Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
or, vnrequested, to carrie
any hand in my neighbours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.
It hath more congruitie
with Royall dignity, wherof God
hath giuen me the honour, to prescribe Lawes at
home for my Subiects, rather then to furnish for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
Kingdoms and people with counsels. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
my late entire affection to K. <hi>Henrie IV.</hi>
of happy memorie, my most honoured brother, and
my exceeding sorrow for the most detestable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide
acted vpon the sacred person of a King, so
complete in all heroicall and Princely vertues; as
also the remembrance of my owne dangers, incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the practise of conspiracies flowing from
the same source, hath wrought me to sympathize
<pb facs="3"/>
with my friends in their grieuous occurrents: no
doubt so much more daungerous, as they are lesse
apprehended and felt of Kings themselues, euen
when the danger hangeth ouer their owne heads.
Vpon whome, in case the power and vertue of my
aduertisments be not able effectually to worke, at
least many millions of children and people yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,
shall beare me witnes, that in these daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of the highest nature and straine, I haue not
bin defectiue: and that neither the subuersions of
States, nor the murthers of Kings, which may
vnhappily betide hereafter, shal haue so free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
in the world for want of timely aduertisment
before. For touching my particular, my rest is vp,
that one of the maynes for which God hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
me vpon the loftie stage of the supreme
Throne, is, that my words vttered from so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
a place for Gods honour most shamefully tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
and vilified in his owne Deputies and
Lieutenants, might with greater facilitie be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>
   <p>Now touching <hi>France;</hi> faire was the hope
which I conceiued of the States assembled in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
at <hi>Paris.</hi> That calling to minde the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of their Noble Kings, and the warres of
<pb facs="3"/>
the League which followed the Popes fulminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as when a great storme of haile powreth down
after a thunder-cracke, and a world of writings
addressed to iustifie the parricides &amp; the dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of Kings, would haue ioyned heads, hearts,
and hands together, to hammer out some apt and
wholsome remedie against so many fearefull at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
and practises. To my hope was added no
little ioy, when I was giuen to vnderstand the
third <hi>Estate</hi> had preferred an Article or Bill,
the tenor and substance whereof was concerning
the meanes whereby the people might be vnwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
of this pernicious opinion; <hi>That Popes
may tosse the French King his Throne like
a tennis ball,</hi> and <hi>that killing of Kings is an
act meritorious to the purchase of the
crowne of Martyrdome.</hi> But in fine, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
was encountred with successe cleane contrary
to expectation. For this Article of the third E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
like a sigh of libertie breathing her last, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
only so much the more to inthrall the Crowne,
and to make the bondage more grieuous and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
then before. Euen as those medicines which
worke no ease to the patient, doe leaue the disease
in much worse tearmes: so this remedie inuented
<pb facs="4"/>
and tendred by the third Estate, did onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate
the present maladie of the State: for
so much as the operation and vertue of the
wholesome remedie was ouermatched with pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
humours, then stirred by the force of
thwarting and crossing opposition. Yea much
better had it beene, the matter had not beene
stirred at all, then after it was once on foote
and in motion, to giue the Truth leaue to lie
gasping and sprawling vnder the violence of
a forraine faction. For the opinion by which
the Crownes of Kings are made subiect vnto
the Popes will and power, was then avowed
in a most Honourable Assemblie by the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Prelate in great authoritie, and of
no lesse learning. He did not plead the cause
as a priuate person, but as one by representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that stood for the whole bodie of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.
Was there applauded, and seconded with
approbation of the Nobilitie. No resolution
taken to the contrarie, or in barre to his plea.
After praises and thankes from the Pope,
followed the printing of his eloquent harangue
or Oration, made in full Parliament: a set dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
maintaining Kings to be deposeable by
<pb facs="4"/>
the Pope, if he speake the word. The saide O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
was not onely printed <hi>with the Kings
priuiledge,</hi> but was likewise addressed to me
by the author and Orator himselfe; who presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the reading thereof would forsooth driue
me to say, <hi>Lord Cardinall, in this high sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
your Honour hath satisfied me to the
full.</hi> All this poysed in the ballance of equall
iudgement, why may not I truly and freely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
the said Estates assembled in Parliament
haue set Royall Maiestie vpon a doubtfull
chance, or left it resting vpon vncertain tearmes:
and that now, if the doctrine there maintained
by the Clergie should beare any pawme, it may
lawfully be doubted, who is King in France?
For I make no question, he is but a titular King
that raigneth onely at an others discretion, and
whose Princely head the Pope hath power to
bare of his Regall Crowne. In temporall matters,
how can one be Soveraigne, that may be fleeced
of all his temporalties by any superiour power?
But let men at a neere sight marke the pith
and marrowe of the Article proposed by the
third Estate, and they shall soone perceiue the
skilfull Architects thereof aymed onely to make
<pb facs="5"/>
their King a true and reall King, to be recognised
for Soueraigne within his own Realme, and that
killing their King might no longer passe the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of works acceptable to God.</p>
   <p>But by the vehement instance and strong cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of the Clergie and Nobles, this was borne
down as a pernicious Article, as a cause of schisme,
as a gate which openeth to all sorts of heresies: yea
there it was maintained tooth and nayle, that in
case the doctrine of this Article might go for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
doctrine, it must follow, that for many ages
past in sequence, the Church hath bin the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Antechrist, and the synagogue of Satan.
The Pope vpon so good issue of the cause, had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
I trow, to addresse his letters of triumph vnto
the Nobilitie and Clergie, who had so farre ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued
themselues faithfull to his Holines; and
to vaunt withall, that he had nipped Christian
Kings in the Crowne, that he had giuen them
checke with mate, through the magnanimous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of this couragious Nobilitie, by whose
braue making head the third Estate had bin so
valiantly forced to giue ground. In a scornefull
reproach he qualified the Deputies of the third
Estate, <hi>nebulones ex foece plebis, a sort or a
<pb facs="5"/>
number of knaues,</hi>
      <note place="margin">I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement frÅ diuers parts, that in the Popes letters to the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie these words were extant, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they haue beene left out in the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; rased out of the copies of the said letters.</note>
      <hi>the very dregges of the
base vulgar, a packe of people presuming
to personate well affected Subiects and
men of deepe vnderstanding, and to read
their masters a learned lecture.</hi> Now it is no
wonder, that, in so good an office and loyall carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
towards their King, the third Estate hath
outgone the Clergie. For the Clergie denie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to haue any ranke among the Subiects of
the King: they stand for a Soueraigne out of the
kingdome, to whome as to the Lord Paramount
they owe suit and seruice: they are bound to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
that Monarchie, to the bodie whereof they
properly appertaine as parts or members, as els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
I haue written more at large. But for the
Nobilitie, the Kings right arme, to prostitute
and set as it were to sale the dignitie of their
King, as if the arme should giue a thrust vnto
the head; I say for the Nobilitie to hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
euen in Parliament, their King is liable to
deposition by any forraine power or Potentate,
may it not passe among the strangest miracles and
rarest wonders of the world? For that once gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
this consequence is good and necessarie; That
in case the King, once lawfully deposed, shal stand
<pb facs="6"/>
vpon the defensiue and hold out for his right, he
may then lawfully be murthered. Let me then
here freely professe my opinion, and this it is: That
now the French Nobilitie may seeme to haue some
reason to disrobe themselues of their titles, and to
transferre them by resignation vnto the third E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.
For that bodie of the third Estate alone
hath carried a right noble heart: in as much
as they could neither be tickled with promises, nor
terrified by threatnings, from resolute standing
to those fundamentall points &amp; reasons of State,
which most concerne the honor of their King, and
the securitie of his person.</p>
   <p>Of all the Clergie, the man that hath most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned,
or set his owne honour to sale, the man
to whome France is least obliged, is the <hi>Lord
Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Perron:</hi> a man otherwise inferiour
to few in matter of learning, and in the grace of a
sweete style. This man in two seuerall Orations,
whereof the one was pronounced before the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
the other had audience before the third E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
hath set his best wits on worke, to draw that
doctrine into all hatred and infamie, which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
Kings to be indeposeable by the Pope. To
this purpose he tearmes the same doctrine, a bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="6"/>
of schismes, a gate that openeth to make way,
and to giue entrance vnto all heresies; in briefe, a
doctrine to be held in so high a degree of detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that rather then he and his fellow-Bishops will
yeild to the signing thereof, they will be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
like Martyrs to burne at a stake. At which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
or obstinacie rather in his opinion, I am in
a manner amased, more then I can be mooued for
the like <hi>brauado</hi> in many other: for as much as
he was many yeares together, a follower of the late
King, euen when the King followed a contrarie
Religion, and was deposed by the Pope: as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
not long before, in a certaine Assemblie hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
at the Iacobins in Paris, he withstood the
Popes Nuntio to his face, when the said Nuntio
laboured to make this doctrin, touching the Popes
temporall Soueraigntie, passe for an Article of
faith. But in both Orations, he singeth a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
song, and from his owne mouth passeth sentence
of condemnation against his former course and
profession. I suppose, not without solide iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
as one that herein hath well accommodated
himselfe to the times. For as in the raigne of the
late King, he durst not offer to broach this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
(such was his fore-wit:) so now he is bold
<pb facs="7"/>
to proclaime and publish it in Parliament vnder
the raigne of the said Kings sonne: whose tender
yeares and late succession to the Crowne, do make
him lie the more open to iniuries, and the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill
to bee circumuented. Such is nowe his after
wisedome.</p>
   <p>Of these two Orations, that made in presence
of the Nobility he hath, for feare of incurring the
Popes displeasure, cautelously suppressed. For
therein hee hath beene somewhat prodigall in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
this doctrine, maintained by the Clergie,
to be but problematicall; and in taking vpon him
to auouch, that Catholikes of my Kingdome are
bound to yeeld me the honour of obedience. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
on the other side he is not ignorant, how this
doctrine of deposing Princes and Kings the Pope
holdeth for meerely necessarie, and approoueth
not by any meanes allegiance to be performed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me by the Catholikes of my Kingdome. Yea if
credit may be giuen vnto the abridgement of his
other Oration published, wherein he parallels the
Popes power in receiuing honours in the name of
the Church, with the power of the Æ²enetian
Duke in receiuing honours in the name of that
most renowned Republike; no meruaile that when
<pb facs="7"/>
this Oration was dispatched to the presse, hee
commaunded the same to be gelded of this clause
and other like, for feare of giuing his Holinesse
any offensiue distast.</p>
   <p>His pleasure therefore was and content with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
that his Oration imparted to the third Estate,
should bee put in print, and of his courtesie hee
vouchsafed to addresse vnto mee a copy of the
same. Which after I had perused, I forthwith
well perceiued, what and how great discrepance
there is betweene one man that perorateth
from the ingenuous and sincere disposition of a
sound heart, and an other that flaunteth in flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
speech with inward checkes of his owne
conscience. For euery where he contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and seemes to bee afraid least men should
picke out his right meaning.</p>
   <p>First,<note place="margin">In 12. seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall passages the L. Card. seemeth to speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> he graunts this Question is not hitherto
decided by the holy Scriptures, or by the Decrees
of the auncient Church, or by the analogie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ecclesiasticall proceedings: and neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
he confidently doth affirme, that whosoeuer
maintaine this doctrine to be wicked and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<note place="margin">Pag. 85.</note> that Popes haue no power to put Kings by
their supreame Thrones, they teach men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
<pb facs="8"/>
there hath not beene any Church for many
ages past, and that indeede the Church is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Synagogue of Antechrist.</p>
   <p>Secondly, hee exhorts his hearers to hold this
doctrine at least for problematicall, and not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie:
and yet herein he calls them to all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
submission vnto the iudgement of the Pope
and Clergie, by whome the cause hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
put out of all question, as out of all hunger
and cold.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, he doth auerre, in case this Article
be authorized, it makes the Pope in good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to bee the Antechrist:<note place="margin">Pag. 99.</note> and yet he graunts
that many of the French are tolerated by the
Pope to dissent in this point from his Holinesse;
prouided, their doctrine be not proposed as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and materiall to faith. As if the Pope in any
sort gaue toleration to hold any doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to his owne, and most of all that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which by consequence inferres himselfe to
be the Antechrist.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, he protesteth forwardnesse to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
the flames of Martyrdome, rather then to
signe this doctrine, which teacheth Kings Crowns
to sit faster on their heads, then to be stirred by
<pb facs="8"/>
any Papal power whatsoeuer: and yet saith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
the Pope winketh at the French, by his tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to hold this dogmatical point for problema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall.
And by this meanes, the Martyrdome that
he affecteth in this cause, will prooue but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematicall
Martyrdome, whereof question might
growe very well, whether it were to be mustered
with grieuous crimes, or with phreneticall pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the braine, or with deserued punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
   <p>Fiftly, hee denounceth Anathema, dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
maledictions like haile-shot, against parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides
of Kings: and yet elsewhere he layes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
open to speake of Kings onely so long as they
stand Kings. But who doth not know that a King
deposed is no longer King? And so that limme
of Satan, which murthered Henrie III. then
vn-king'd by the Pope, did not stabbe a King to
death.</p>
   <p>Sixtly, he doth not allowe a King to be made
away by murder: and yet hee thinkes it not
much out of the way, to take away all meanes
whereby hee might be able to stand in defence of
his life.</p>
   <p>Seuenthly,<note place="margin">Pag. 95. 97.</note> he abhorreth killing of Kings by
<pb facs="9"/>
apposted throat-cutting, for feare least bodie and
soule should perish in the same instant: and yet he
doth not mislike their killing in a pitcht field, and
to haue them slaughtered in a set battaile. For
he presupposeth, no doubt out of his charitable
mind, that by this meanes the soule of a poore
King so dispatched out of the way shall instantly
flie vp to heauen.</p>
   <p>Eightly, hee saith a King deposed retaineth
still a certaine internall habitude and politike
impression, by vertue and efficacie whereof hee
may, being once reformed and become a new man,
be restored to the lawfull vse and practise of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality.
Whereby hee would beare vs in hand,
that when a forraine Prince hath inuaded and
rauenously seised the Kingdome into his hands,
he will not onely take pitty of his predecessor to
saue his life, but will also prooue so kind-hearted,
vpon sight of his repentance, to restore his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
without fraude or guile.</p>
   <p>Ninthly, he saith euery where in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
that he dealeth not in the cause, otherwise
then as a problematicall discourser, and without
any resolution one way or other: and yet with
might and maine he contends for the opinion,
<pb facs="9"/>
that leaues the States and Crownes of Kings
controulable by the Pope: refutes obiections, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
the authoritie of Popes and Councils, by
name the Lateran Councill vnder Innocent III.
as also the consent of the Church. And to crosse
the Churches iudgment, is, in his opinion to bring
in schisme, and to leaue the world without a
Church for many hundred yeares together: which
(to my vnderstanding) is to speake with resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and without all hesitation.</p>
   <p>Tenthly, he acknowledgeth none other cause of
sufficient validitie for the deposing of a King,
besides heresie, apostasie, and infidelitie: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles
that Popes haue power to displace Kings
for heresie and apostasie, he prooueth by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Kings whom the Pope hath curbed with
deposition, not for heresie, but for matrimoniall
causes, for ciuill pretences, and for lacke of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie.</p>
   <p>Eleuenthly, he alledgeth euerie where pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
as well of holy Scripture as of the Fathers
and moderne histories; but so impertinent, and
with so little truth, as hereafter we shall cause
to appeare, that for a man of his deepe learning
and knowledge, it seemeth not possible so to
<pb facs="10"/>
speake out of his iudgement.</p>
   <p>Lastly, whereas all this hath beene hudled and
heaped together into one masse, to currie with the
Pope: yet he suffereth diuerse points to fall from
his lips, which may well distast his Holinesse in
the highest degree. As by name, where he prefers
the authoritie of the Councill before that of the
Pope, and makes his iudgement inferiour to the
iudgement of the French; as in fit place hereafter
shall be shewed. Againe, where he representeth
to his hearers the decrees of Popes and Councils
alreadie passed concerning this noble subiect: and
yet affirmes that he doth not debate the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but as a Questionist, and without resolution.
As if a Cardinall should be afraid to be positiue,
and to speake in peremptory straines, after
Popes and Councils haue once decided the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
Or as if a man should perorate vpon
hazard, in a cause for the honour whereof he
would make no difficulty to suffer Martyrdome.
Adde hereunto, that his Lordshippe hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
taken the contrary part heretofore, and
this totall must needs arise, that before the third
Estate, his lippes looked one way, and his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
another.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="10"/>
All these points, by the discourse which is to
followe, and by the ripping vp of his Oration
(which by Gods assistance J will vndertake) ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the reproach of Kings, and the subuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Kingdomes, I confidently speake it, shall be
made manifest. Yet doe I not conceiue it can any
way make for my honour, to enter the lists against a
Cardinall. For J am not ignorant how far a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
Hat, commeth vnder the Crowne &amp; Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a King. For wel I wot vnto what sublimity
the Scripture hath exalted Kings, when it styles
them Gods: Whereas the dignitie of a Cardinall
is but a late vpstart inuention of man;<note place="margin">In the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to my Apologie.</note> as I haue
elswhere prooued. But I haue imbarqued my selfe
in this action, mooued thereunto; first by the
common interest of Kings in the cause it selfe:
Then by the L. Cardinal, who speaketh not in this
Oration as a priuate person, but as one represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the body of the Clergie and Nobilitie, by
whom the cause hath beene wonne, and the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
borne away from the third Estate. Againe,
by mine owne particular: because he is pleased to
take me vp for a sower of dissention, and a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
vnder whom the Church is hardly able to
fetch her breath; yea, for one by whome the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
<pb facs="11"/>
of my Kingdome are compelled to endure
all sorts of punishment: and withall he tearmes
this Article of the third Estate, a monster with a
fishes tayle that came swimming out of England.
Last of all, by the present state of France; because
Fraunce beeing nowe reduced to so miserable
tearmes, that it is nowe become a crime for a
Frenchman to stand for his King; it is a necessary
duty of her neighbours to speake in her cause, and
to make triall whether they can put life into the
truth now dying, and readie to bee buried by the
power of violence, that it may resound and ring
againe from remote regions.</p>
   <p>I haue no purpose once to touch many prettie
toyes which the ridges of his whole booke are sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
withall. Such are his allegations of Pericles,
Agesilaus, Aristotle, Minos, the Druides, the
French Ladies, Hannibal, Pindarus, and Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
fables. All resembling the red and blew flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that pester the corne when it standeth in the
fields, where they are more noysome to the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
croppe, then beautifull to the beholding eye.
Such pettie matters, nothing at all beseemed the
dignity of the Assembly, and of the maine subiect,
or of the Orator himselfe. For it was no <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
      <pb facs="11"/>
to enter the Stage with a Pericles in his
mouth, but with the sacred Name of God: nor
should he haue marshalled the passage of a Royal
Poet, after the example of an heathen Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</p>
   <p>Neither will I giue any touch to his conceit of
the Romane conquests,<note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> which the L. Cardinall
bestoweth in the list of Gods graces and temporall
blessings, as a recompence of their zeale to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
and worship of Idols. As if God were a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compencer
of wickednes, or as if the forcible eie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of tenants out of their frames and other
possessions, might bee reckoned among the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of God.</p>
   <p>Nor to that of the Milesian Æ²irgins,<note place="margin">Pag. 7. &amp; 8</note> dragged
starre-naked after they were dead; which the L.
Cardinall drawes into his discourse for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the eternall torments denounced by the
Lawes Ecclesiasticall, to be inflicted after this
life.</p>
   <p>Nor to his exposition of the word <hi>Proble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> where he giueth to vnderstand that by
Problematicall, he meaneth such things as are of
no necessitie to matter of faith; and in case men
shall beleeue the contradictorie of the said points,
<pb facs="12"/>
they are not bound for such beleefe, to vndergoe
the solemne curse of the Church, and the losse of
communion.<note place="margin">Arist. 1. top. cap 4. <gap reason="foreign">

      </note> Whereas Aristotle, of whom all
Schooles haue borrowed their tearmes, hath
taught vs that euery proposition is called a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme,
when it is propounded in a formall doubt,
though in it proper nature it containes a necessary
truth, concerning the matter thereof. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
to say in forme of question, <hi>Whether is
there but one God?</hi> or, <hi>Whether is man a
creature indued with reason?</hi> By which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
it is plaine, that propositions in problema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
forme, doe not forgoe the necessitie of their
nature; and that many times the contradictorie
binds the beleeuers therof to Anathema and losse
of communion. There is a confused heape or bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of otherlike toyes, which my purpose is to passe
ouer in silence, that I may now come to cast anchor,
as it were in the very bottome and substance of
the cause.</p>
