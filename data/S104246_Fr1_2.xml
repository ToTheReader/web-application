      <hi>breath of his mouth, and the brighnesse of his comming he will reveale the Man of Sin, and Sonne of Perdition:</hi> Yet thus witnesseth the Spirit, that when it shall so come to passe, <hi>that the Viall of Gods wrath shall be</hi>

      <hi>powred upon the Throne of the Beast,</hi> to the darkening of his Kingdome, and discovering of those strong Delusions, whereby he hath long deluded the world, that then the men of that throne <hi>shall gnaw their tongues for sorrow, and shall blaspheme the God of heaven.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>All which to me appeares to be fulfilled and made good concerning this following Treatise: <hi>1. that when as the Lord by his Word the breath of his mouth hath blown out some smoake of the bottomlesse pit, which I conceive to be</hi> Humane-Learning, <hi>which is so much magnified, as being a helpe, whereby to understand the mind of</hi> God.</p>
   <p>This matter hath so vexed and tormented the men of that Throne, that even He himselfe, at whose request I was moved to open this portion of Scripture, <hi>2 Pet. 3.16.</hi> hath (as I am credibly informed) reported about this City, that I made a Calfe (meaning a false and unsound exposition) and when I had done danced about it; herein exposing not onely me, but the very Truth it selfe, which I in this point
<pb facs="3"/>delivered, to the derision, and contempt, and Table-talke, of such, as bad rather be deceived and beleeve their Learned Teachers (as men call them) on their bare word (having the Faith of our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ</hi> the Lord of Glory with respect of Persons) then to receive and justifie the Truth of <hi>God,</hi> if the Messenger be weake and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and his message in power, much plainesse, and demonstration of the spirit. And not beautified with the excellency of speech, and swelling words of mans wisdome, which is <hi>enmity to God.</hi> It crosseth and opposeth the simplicity of his way in the <hi>dispensation of the Glorious My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Gospell.</hi> And therfore <hi>God</hi> hath said of it, as <hi>Symon Peter</hi> said to <hi>Symon Magus,</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Act.</hi> 8, 21 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19.</note>
      <hi>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But yet (me thinks) <hi>such men,</hi>
      <note n="‡" place="margin">
         <hi>Ephes</hi> 5.4.</note> as would carry the <hi>shew of Godlinesse,</hi> should remember the Councel of the Apostle, <hi>that such Carriages are things not seemly;</hi> though for my owne part, I blesse the <hi>Lord</hi> for it, being to me a more strong confirmation, that I have the Truth on my side: For thus was<note n="‡" place="margin">
         <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.14.</note>
      <hi>Jesus Christ our Lord</hi> served by the Wise and Learned <hi>Pharisees,</hi> when as he taught them such a Doctrine as pleased them not: And thus was <hi>Paul</hi> the Preacher of Righteousnesse dealt by of the leareed<note n="§" place="margin">
         <hi>Act.</hi> 17.18.</note>
      <hi>Athenians,</hi> even for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jesus,</hi> and the Resurrection. Likewise I read <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n <hi>Heb. 11.</hi> that this in former times was part of the tryall, that the <hi>Lord</hi> exercised his Witnesses withall, even <hi>mockings, vers. 36.</hi> And therfore as our Saviour teacheth me, I have in this case great cause to be <hi>glad</hi> and <hi>rejoyce,</hi> for they having so served <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> my <hi>Lord,</hi> and his faithfull followers; then what am I, that I should be one of that number, that have so large<note n="†" place="margin">
         <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12.</note>
      <hi>incouragement</hi> and <hi>reward promised:</hi> I shall therfore quietly passe by all such things, and onely<note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Iob.</hi> 21.3</note> with <hi>Job</hi> in his distressed condition, crave that he and all you that have done this thing will <hi>suffer me to speake, and when I have spoken mock on;</hi> seeing as the<note n="‡" place="margin">
         <hi>Iob.</hi> 12.2.</note> Servant of <hi>God</hi> said, <hi>Indeed, because ye are the people onely, Wisdome must dye with you;</hi> so will I make bold to say to you also: Yet for all his <hi>understanding</hi> and such others as heard me, they fayled of their <hi>zeale</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>glory,</hi> in that they sought not to suppresse and throw down that Calfe of <hi>dishonour,</hi> which must needs (being an Idol) be a very high provocation in the eyes of his Glory; which he that put me upon this Exercise having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted against it, when it was finisht, and with much passion manifested his great dislike thereof before many witnesses, ought especially, and was obliged to have done, being then lovingly requested by a friend that was there present, for the satisfaction of all that Assembly to Instance (if not in all) yet at least in some particular Scripture wherein I had
<pb facs="3"/>perverted it, seeing he had openly cast an Aspertion on all that I had said; but neither he, nor any of his Profession, though many were then present, did undertake this taske, nor yet to this day, hath He, or any of them endeavoured it. So it may appeare my Errour was not so great, or none at all, that they could prove; or else their <hi>zeale</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and his Truth, and their <hi>Charity</hi> to Me and othes very small. And if there were a Calfe, It was their <hi>Humane-Learning</hi> and <hi>wisdome</hi> which the men of this <hi>Throne</hi> set up, and themselves danced about it, whilest I to their great <hi>griefe</hi> and <hi>discontent</hi> was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring with all the power and might that <hi>God</hi> assisted me with, utterly to cast down, grind it to powder, and to blow it away with the <hi>word of God, with the breath of his mouth:</hi> Whether it be thus, or no, I commend now to the judgement of all such as love and know the <hi>truth;</hi> not doubting but there will be some found, that out of love will reprove what is amisse, and so <hi>turne the sinner out of the errour of his way,</hi> though some others, as<note n="*" place="margin">Iob. 13.4.</note>
      <hi>Job</hi> saith, <hi>forge lyes</hi> (as I could name divers) <hi>who are Physitians of no value.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For <hi>God who knows the hearts of all men,</hi> knows that it was not my intent at all at that time to have medled in this Argument, nor with this Scripture, not till the night before I spake of it, and all because I knew if I did, it would be offensive, as it hath proved; and and what I did herein it was by the advice of Friends. But now I see that <hi>Gods</hi> hand was in it, and I doubt not but for good: though it is, and may be my portion deeply to suffer for it: and for men to be offended at the <hi>truth,</hi> and such as declare it, is no new thing, even for the<note n="‡" place="margin">Psa. 118.22. Act. 4.11. Isay. 8.14.15.</note>
      <hi>builders</hi> themselves to stumble at the stumbling stone: <hi>But leaving all such to stand or fall to their own Lord.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Somthing remaines to be spoken concerning the matter following, for the preventing of such things as may further be objected against it.</p>
   <list>
      <item>
         <hi>1.</hi> Though the matter be the same in substance that it was at the first delivery, yet somwhat may be wanting, and is, which was then said; and more is added in other respects then at that time was spoken, which I thought fit to give notice of.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>2.</hi> Another exception and that of great moment, is, that I have bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>sphemed against <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> in saying, that He was without <hi>Humane-Learning.</hi>
      </item>
   </list>
   <p>Now besides what is answered hereunto in the first Objection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the first Doctrine; if any yet remain unsatisfied, and will affirme the contrary, <hi>Let them declare,</hi> (as the<note n="‡" place="margin">Rom. 11.34.35.</note> Apostle saith) <hi>who was his Councellour, and who taught him, and he shall be recompenced:</hi> The Scripture tells us, <hi>that He grew in Wisdome and Stature,</hi> and so couples them alike together: Now none will affirme
<pb facs="4"/>that He Learned his <hi>Stature:</hi> then from the like will I affirme, that He Learned not His <hi>Wisdome,</hi> no more then He did His <hi>Stature;</hi> and so if none taught him, then must it needs follow that He was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Humane-Learning,</hi> for we in common speech call them <hi>unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> which were never taught, as did the<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 7.15. Acts 4.13.</note>
      <hi>Jewes;</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> presupposeth one to Teach, so that me thinks) it is but requisite, if any do so affirme, that they should declare his Teacher, which if they cannot doe, why then should they affirme Him to have <hi>Humane-Learning.</hi> And me thinks, the matter being rightly considered, it will be found <hi>blasphemy</hi> for any to affirme that He had <hi>Humane-Learning,</hi> seeing that in so doing, they call in question the perfection of His <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> as if there were others that could adde unto Him, seeing all grant that the Master is above the Scholler: and the Scripture witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth for me, <hi>that at</hi>
      <note n="‡" place="margin">Luke 2.46, 47.</note>
      <hi>12 yeares old,</hi> such was His <hi>Wisdome</hi> observed amonst <hi>the Doctors,</hi> as that they were <hi>astonished at his understanding and answers;</hi> and doubtlesse this was a part of their great <hi>wonder,</hi> seeing that He never Learned, as it was the <hi>Councels wonder also concerning</hi>
      <note n="‡" place="margin">Acts 4.13.</note>
      <hi>Peter and John.</hi> Therfore for any to affirme Him to be by men taught, is to take that glory from Him which He had of His own, and so they are most like to be them that <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="3">
      <hi>3.</hi> It is also very likely that <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>vain-glory</hi> wilbe imputed to me, as it hath been already, that I being as I am, should undertake to maintaine that which all godly and learned men are contrary to me in.</p>
   <p>
      <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answere. </seg>
      </label> I Answere, that it is no strange thing for the Servants of <hi>God</hi> to meet with such hard measure, even for declaring of the <hi>truth;</hi> for <hi>so was Joseph</hi>
      <note n="§" place="margin">Gen. 37.8.10, 11.</note> dealt by even of his <hi>Father and Brethren:</hi> and so was<note n="†" place="margin">1 Sam. 17.28.</note>
      <hi>David</hi> used for speaking <hi>for the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> you shall find was<note n="‡̶" place="margin">Act. 17, 18.</note>
      <hi>scoffed at by the learned Athenians:</hi> And seeing that it hath alwayes bin so with <hi>Gods</hi> Servants, why should not I affirme with the<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.3.</note> Apostle, <hi>not to passe to be judged of men,</hi> whatsoever they be, though godly, wise, learned; seeing that as the Apostle saith, <hi>it makes no matter to me, God is no</hi>
      <note n="‡̶" place="margin">Gal. 2.6.</note>
      <hi>accepter of persons:</hi> And therfore I hold it a defence sufficient with <hi>David</hi> to say,<note n="‡" place="margin">1 Sam. 17.29.</note>
      <hi>Is there not a Cause? seeing that there is none that I know of that will stand up for the Lord, against those that defie the host of Israel, because that they be not Goliah-like, Men of stature, having Boots of brasse, and such like furniture, as that the fleshly hearts of men dare not looke such in the face; and all because that they bee so strongly furnished with Mans strength:</hi> Though that the Souldiers of the <hi>Lord of hosts,</hi> may
<pb facs="4"/>with one blast of a <hi>Rammes horne,</hi> through the might of <hi>God,</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">Josh. 6.20.</note> blow down the strong Wall of this spirituall <hi>Jericho:</hi> seeing that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath said, <hi>that by the</hi>

      <hi>mouth of babes and sucklings he will perfit his praise,</hi> and this if Babes should neglect to doe, <hi>the stones would cry,</hi> whence is to be observed our Saviour descends from Babes to Stones, and not from Babes to Learned men, for he hath Chosen such to bring forth His <hi>Righteousnesse as the light;</hi> for He himselfe doth not <hi>despise the day of</hi>

         </gap> 1.15.</note>
      <hi>Pharisees</hi> disdaine at what the <hi>Lord</hi> will doe; but lay their hands upon their mouthes and say nothing because He<note place="margin">Psal. 39.</note>
      <hi>doth it;</hi> And seeing it is <hi>the Lords</hi>
      <note n="‡̶" place="margin">Psal. 118.23.</note>
      <hi>doing, why should it not be Merveylous in our eyes:</hi> Though I doubt not but the <hi>Lord</hi> will in his good time bring forth one <hi>learned Moses,</hi> and another as excellent that wayes as was <hi>Paul,</hi> and cause them disclayming that Humane excellencie to magnifie the foolishnesse of <hi>God,</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.25.</note> to be wiser then the wisdome of men, and so every way convince men of their folly this way to his prayse.</p>
   <p>And in the meane while let them that can receive this for Truth, receive it, and let none be so conceited of Learned-men, <hi>as if the word of God came onely to them, and from them, as</hi> Paul said to<note n="‡" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.36, 37.</note> some that were puffed up. But let such as are spirituall know that the <hi>Lord</hi> reveales his Mysteries to whom he pleaseth, and where he will; and therfore <hi>the eye of none should be evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is good,</hi> but we should learne, as the Wiseman saith, <hi>that</hi>
      <note n="‡" place="margin">Eccles. 9.11</note>
      <hi>the race is not alway to the swift, nor the battell to the strong:</hi> but it may so prove▪ that little <hi>David</hi> without <hi>Sauls</hi> Armour onely with a Sling and a Stone through the Name of the <hi>Lord,</hi> may so wound great <hi>Goliah</hi> of <hi>Gath,</hi> the enemy of <hi>God</hi> and his people, as that he may receive his deadly wound, and ly groveling on the ground, to the dismayment of all the Host of the <hi>Phylistims,</hi> and great rejoycing of the <hi>Israel</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and this the Stone that is hewen out of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine without hands, is onely able to doe. Therfore let all that feare the <hi>Lord</hi> take heed that they leane not to their own Wisdome, but so much the more that any of us have Wisdome, and Vnderstanding, Memory, and such like naturall parts, above other, so much the more let us be watchfull and carefull over our selves, as knowing that the<note n="§" place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note>
      <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the flesh is enmity against God,</hi> and is ready to but against the Spirit: and now to draw to a Conclusion of all in the words of the Prophet,<note n="†" place="margin">Isay 44.25.</note>
      <hi>The Lord frustrateth the tokens of the lyars, and maketh the Diviners madde, turneth wise-men backward, and maketh their Knowledge foolishnesse.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>If any shall except against the matter, for the rudenesse of it, as that it is without forme, or Learning, all such are to know that it is but sutable to the whole argument, and that if it should be otherwise, I should condemn that in practise which I justifie in words, and so make my selfe a trespasser. Thus I commit this my labour, with all those that out of love to the Truth shall seek information in this matter, to the blessing of the most High, and remaine an unfeigned welwiller of all them that love the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> in <hi>sincerity.</hi> The <hi>25</hi> day of the First Moneth, <hi>1639.</hi>
