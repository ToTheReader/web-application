      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the custome of a certayne Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher (righte gentle and curteous Readers) when hee perceyued the people to waxe wearie by his long and tedious orations, &amp; to drop out of doores ere he had done, to take his harpe in hande, which he so finely fingered, that the sweet and pleasaunt sound thereof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the people to come running in faster then before they went forth, whose dulled spirits beeing reuiued with that pleasant melody, and their minds before cloyed with ouer many circumstances of grauitie, beeing by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes marueilously delighted, did the better and with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ease continue the time of his conclusion: whose excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pollicie in this poynt, hath attayned so great cōmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that it is set foorth for an example to all posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. If then you find your selues ouerladen, eyther by the meanes of worldly cares, or with the intollerable burden of ouer great studies (if the deeds of this Philosoper were to bee followed) I would wishe you no greater or better pleasure then he shewed to his people: considering that Myrth and Melodye cutteth off care, vnburdeneth the mind of sorrow, healeth the greeued heart, &amp; filleth both soule and body with inestimable comfort. And therefore manye mightye and excellent Princes, whose heades are troubled with diuers and sundry enormities, doe for this cause entertaine and accept of suche persons, whose plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant nature and disposition may moue them to delight. Sith then moderate pleasure is not onely conuenient, but also profitable and necessary for vs, I haue presumed here
<pb facs="3"/>
vpon your curtesie, for the recreation of your mindes, to sent vnto your sight this simpel &amp; rude worke, the grace and beautie whereof beeing strypped from his Countrey guise, &amp; now newly wrapped in this strang attyre, is not onely blemished by meanes of the translators vnskillful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but as it were spoyled both of fauour and fashion. Yet if it please you to pardon his imperfection, and to accept his good will, he shall not onely be incouraged to mend his amisse, but also hereafter present you with such as may better counteruaile your courtesie, and saue his owne credit. Thus loth to be ouer tedious, in so meane a manner, I commend you to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the celestial powers, and this to your freendly consideration.</p>
