   <head>To the most Noble Prince <hi>Henrie</hi> by the grace of God, Prince of Great <hi>Britaine.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Oscius</hi> the Romane Tragedian (most noble Prince) contending with <hi>Cicero</hi> the Orator, which of them both should perswade most people, either <hi>Roscius</hi> with his motions, and gestures of his body; or <hi>Cicero</hi> with varietie, and copy of his tongue. This hath been in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise in Greece much vsed; and now in Rome more: but of such motions and gestures of men, that can speake with their hands, with their eies, with their shoulders, and with their feet, <hi>Salomon</hi> bids vs to take heed, that will speake like <hi>Aristippus</hi> to <hi>Dionisius</hi> heeles.</p>
   <p>Such were they that held their heads on the left side, like King <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon, while <hi>Philip</hi> liued: such were they after <hi>Philip,</hi> that like <hi>Alexander</hi> his Sonne with their bushes and standing haires, would be called <hi>Opistho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comae,</hi> because <hi>Alexander</hi> was so, &amp; now too many such, like the Courtiers of <hi>Meroe</hi> in Ethiope, where if their King halt, they will also halt, in such sort, that <hi>Cirses</hi> and <hi>Calipso</hi> could not make such a Metamorphosis of <hi>Vlisses</hi> men, as men make of themselues.</p>
   <p>There was then in Rome but one bird that was taught to say, <hi>Aue Caesar Imperator:</hi> one bird in <hi>Carthage</hi> to say, <hi>Deus est hanno:</hi> and one bird in all Greece, that was taught to say, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: but not onely these flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fowles fledde from Rome, from Carthage, and from Greece, to Great Britane; of whom we may now say, as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> said then of the like, <hi>Quibus credamus, nescimus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>But also of late such Rauens and Vultures, that salute vs with their tongues, and say, <hi>Aue;</hi> and with their hearts, <hi>Caue,</hi> which if their bodies were opened, as the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did <hi>Aristomenes,</hi> or as the Lacedemonians did <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenes,</hi> their hearts should bee found, as their hearts were, <hi>pilosa &amp; hispida,</hi> full of haires and thornes.</p>
   <p>In the time of <hi>Torquine</hi> the proud, there was in <hi>Rome</hi> but one Serpent that could bark like a dogge, and one dogge that could speake like a man, but now so many barking Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents in Rome, &amp; so many speaking dogs out of Rome, that, <hi>Quos fugiamus, ignoramus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But such are the fruits of some religion, that as then in Egypt, they had their Sphinxes in their temples, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound their darke and obscure Diuinitie full of Oracles: so now they haue in Rome, not onely Egyptian Sphinxes in their temples, but also Corinthian Sphinxes in their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, such as <hi>Cicero</hi> charged <hi>Hortensius</hi> to haue in his house to plead his causes.</p>
   <p>But as then many Philosophers went from Greece to India, and to Ethiope, to see <hi>Sacerdotes solis,</hi> and the most famous table of the Son, <hi>in Sabulo,</hi> and to heare <hi>Hiarchas</hi> lectures of the nature and motions of the starres, and of <hi>Tantalus</hi> well. So also many now goe from Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane to <hi>Rome,</hi> not as <hi>Appollonius</hi> the Philosopher went from Greece to India, to heare the Gymnosophists: but as <hi>Saul</hi> went from Hierusalem to Damasco, for commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and authoritie to kill and murther Christians, and to persecute Kingdomes, and Countreys.</p>
