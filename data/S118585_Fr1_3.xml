                 <title>A true and admirable historie, of a mayden of Confolens, in the prouince of Poictiers : that for the space of three yeeres and more hath liued, and yet doth, vvithout receiuing either meate or drinke. Of whom, his Maiestie in person hath had the view, and, (by his commaund) his best and chiefest phisitians, haue tryed all meanes, to find, whether this fast &amp; abstinence be by deceit or no. In this historie is also discoursed, whether a man may liue many dayes, moneths or yeeres, without receiuing any sustenance. Published by the Kings especiall priuiledge</title>

   <p>FRiendly Reader, hauing seriously read ouer (&amp; with no meane admiration) this present Historie: I made s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ealth of some priuate houres, from my more weightie imployments, to let thee haue the same in thine owne familiare language. Wherein (I hope) thou wilt thankfully accept, if not my paines, yet (at least) the kinde affection I beare thee, in acquainting thee with one of the rarest meruailes, which can be found among the histories of elder ages, or those more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and of later times. And because I would preuent thee, in all occasions of sinister suspition, ouer and beside, that it is a matter most publique and generall in <hi>Poictiers,</hi> as also thorowe the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of <hi>Poictu:</hi> thou hast heere the restemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie likewise, of many worthie, graue and credible persons, such, whose truth can no way bee excepted against; who haue all s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

      </gap> the Maiden now in question, &amp; (by
<pb facs="4"/>
his Maiesties commaundement, they bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his best and cheefest Phisitians) they haue made triall to their verie vttermost, to finde out the least scruple of deceite heerein to be imagined. They haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her from her Parents, to diuers Noble and woorthie persons, some of which haue kept her close lockt vp, some foure, fiue, or sixe weekes, some for as many &amp; more monethes together, where not so much as the sent of any foode was to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> felt: and notwithstanding, they found her in the verie same estate, as when they shut her vp vpon this proofe. All which (me thinks) in reason might suffise to content any selfe-willed conceite what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer: if not, as the Maide yet liueth, and long is like to doo, let the doubtfull (if please them) but bestowe their paines, and (by the best meanes they can deuise) free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie make triall, and satisfie themselues, for such is the desire of the pore Maiden her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Farewell.</p>
