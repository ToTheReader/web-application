   <head>To his beloued, and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Auditors, and all other in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Bristoll, which desire the true knowledge of God. <hi>W. Burton</hi> wisheth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of all true godlinesse in this life, and eternall felicitie in the life to come.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you doe well consider (beloued Christians) that the ignorance of God, (the mother of Popish deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all impietie, and the authour of eternall confusion. Then I hope you will easily confesse, that the publishing of these fewe questions and answeres, concerning the knowledge of God, is no needles thing. By the ignorance of God, I meane either not to know that there is a God at all, or els not to know what is the nature of this God whom we ought to serue. Most men will confesse that there is a God, but what maner of God he is, they cannot tell. And
<pb facs="6"/>
therefore while they frame vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues a God after their owne blinde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: they make an idoll of the true God, &amp; according to that conceipt which they haue of him, they lead al their whole life. That the ignorance of God and his nature; is the principall cause of all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlinesse in this life, and of euerlasting condemnation after this life: it doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly appeare, not onely by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the holie scriptures, but also by the light of nature it selfe.</p>
   <p>The scriptures are plaine in this case. First,<note place="margin">Psal. <hi>10.4.</hi>
      </note> the Prophet Dauid, painting out a notorious wicked man, saith this of him. The wicked is so proude that hee seeketh not for God: he thinketh alwaies, there is no God: now marke his life, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth verse. <hi>His mouth is full of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, deceipt and fraud, vnder his tongue is mischiefe and iniquitie. 8. He lieth in the villages: in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret places doth he murther the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent: his eies are bent against the
<pb facs="6"/>
poore, &amp;c.</hi> Read the <hi>11.12.13.</hi> and <hi>14.</hi> verses to shew the fruites of such as think there is no God. Again in the <hi>50.</hi> Psalm, from the <hi>16.</hi> verse to the ende of the <hi>20.</hi> noting the hipocrisie, the obstinacie, the impudencie, the theftes, the whoredoms, the filthie mouthes, and vnnaturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the wicked, in the <hi>21.</hi> verse he sets down the cause of al, to be this. Thou thoughtest (saith God) that I was like thy selfe: to let vs see, the fruites of such as know not the nature of God, but make an idoll of him, and thinke him to be as a man and a good fellow like vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. When the Prophet Esai wold shew the cause of the Iewes idolatrie,<note place="margin">Esai. <hi>40.18.19.20, 21.22.</hi>
      </note> he saith, that the ignorance of God is the cause therof: and therfore labouring to draw them from their idolatrie, he doth it by describing vnto them the true God. Read from the <hi>18.</hi> verse to the ende of the chapter. When the lord shewed Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel the abhominations of the auncients of Israel, he vsed these words: <hi>Sonne of
<pb facs="7"/>
man, hast thou seene what the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes of the house of Israel do in the darke, euerie one in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his imagerie,</hi> for they say, <hi>The The Lord seeth vs not, The Lord hath forsaken the earth:</hi> to shew that the cause of their iniquitie, was their false perswasion, and ignorance of God, for although they knew that there was a God, yet they tooke him to bee but as a man, that could not see them in the dark, and that he was in heauen idly not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the things vpon earth. Thus you heare how the Prophets with one consent do crie out and tel vs if the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God is the cause of all impietie, and vngodlinesse. And that it bringeth eternall damnation in the end, is plainly testified by the Apostle S. Paul: who saith in <hi>2.</hi> Thes. <hi>1.7.8.</hi> That the Lorde Iesus shall shew himselfe from heauen with his mightie Angels, in flaming fire, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring vengeance vnto them that do not know God, and obey not the gospell of our
<pb facs="7"/>
Lord Iesus Christ. Where the Apostle sheweth that disobedience to the gospell, floweth from the ignorance of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot obey him whom we know not, and the reward of both is the iust vengeance of God.</p>
   <p>As this is plainly proued by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, so it is no lesse euident by the light of naturall reason. For when such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt shal once come into our minds, that God is as man, and hath no more power then a man, no more wisedome then a man, no more iustice, no more mercie, no more truth, no more goodnesse then a man hath, we are far inough of from the true feare and seruice of God. For then we feare him as a man, &amp; wee serue him as a man, then the which nothing can be more blasphemous, nor intollerable. For as an idle scholler lookes on his booke on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when his maisters eye is vpon him, so the wicked onelye feare God (and that with a slauishe feare) when they perceiue sensibly by some plague that gods hand
<pb facs="8"/>
is vpon them. Whereas the godlie (who know what manner of God they serue) they feare to offend him at all times, and in all places, because they know him to be euerlasting and euery where▪ &amp;c.</p>
   <p>The Papists haue thought &amp; do think God to be like a man, and so they picture him, and so they serue him, so they feare him, and so they loue him. And therfore in their temples they prouide for his eyes goodly sights, and glorious shewes of guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and painting. &amp;c. To delight his eares withall they haue curious piping and singing: for his smelling, they haue their censings and perfumes, and so is al their whole seruice of God in outward shewes onelye, as if god were a man in deede: which filthy doctrine of theirs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth of their grosse vnderstanding of the Scriptures, and word of God.</p>
   <p>Then by this time (beloued Christians) I hope you see how needfull it was for me, and how necessarie it shalbe for you, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that wee maye bee instructed and
<pb facs="8"/>
builded vp in the true knowldge of God, that so we may be the better able to make straight steppes vnto Godlines. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if we be not instructed in the waies of God, when we shalbe exhorted to serue him, we wilbe ready to answere with the wicked, of whom <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh, <hi>Iob. 21.15. Who is the almightie that we should serue him? and what profite should we haue, if we should pray vnto him?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Throughout my booke for the most part, I haue onelye quoted the places of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I haue added for the profe of euery point, and not expressed the words of the places themselues: partely for the auoiding of tediousnes, but speciallye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would haue you take occasion by searching for them, to be better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the scriptures, then you haue bene hetherto.</p>
   <p>And seeing as for your benefite (beloued bretheren in the Lord Iesus) and at the request of some of you which heard me,
<pb facs="9"/>
I haue aduētured to make these my poore labours publique to the viewe of all, and subiect to the censures of all: I beseeche you, that as at the first hearing of them, you were generally desirous of them, so now you would vouchsafe the reading of them, to your further profit and encrease in the true sauing knowledge of god. The lord almighty make our loue aboūd in all knowledge and iudgement, and the same God sanctifie our knowledge, and make our affections holye, that we may discerne things that differ, and that we may be sincere and without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vnto the comming of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,<note place="margin">Phil. <hi>1.9.10.</hi>
      </note> that we may be filled with the fruites of righteousnes, which are by Iesus Christ, vnto the praise and glorye of GOD. Amen.</p>
