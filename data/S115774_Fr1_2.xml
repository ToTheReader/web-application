      <hi>Apelles</hi> the disciple of <hi>Marcion</hi> had certaine priuate, but extraordinarie Lectures, or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
<pb facs="3"/>or prophesies of his owne, which they called <hi>Phaneroseis,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations or demonstrations of a certaine maide, named <hi>Philumena,</hi> whome he followed as a Prophetesse. <hi>Habet praetereà suos libros quos inscripsit Syllogismorum,</hi> Besides this, he hath his bookes, to which he giueth this title of Syllogismes, wherein he vndertakes to proue, That whatsoeuer <hi>Moses</hi> hath writtē is not true, but false. Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably this scholler of <hi>T. C.</hi> besides all their prophesyings, conferences, priuate sermonings, parlour exercising, libellings, hath brought vnto light this booke of demonstratiue Syllogismes, an incredible and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good method, and most seruiceable to their owne times: which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod if either your Ecclesiasticall discipliners, <hi>A. B. C. D.</hi> or <hi>T.C.</hi> or any other of your Alphabet, had heretofore embraced and bound them selues fast vnto, we should not haue needed to pursue after your extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagant and stragling conceipts, lying so scattered in your worthie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, whereby you doe nothing else then blurre paper, as alwaies saying one &amp; the same thing: nor your selues should be so farre off from ioyning a right issue to determine &amp; trie the cause. For by this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratiue dealing, all waste wordes had bene pared away as excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and superfluous to the body and state of the question, and your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifull demeanors against the proceedings &amp; superioritie of Church-gouernors altogether spared. Which stratageme, as in the sight of God and his Angels detestable and damnable, it hath rather with silence then with censure bene answered, and your wits exceedingly misliked therefore: so this sophisme or manner of paralogisme, if it were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more mannerly, as dealing with materiall pointes, and letting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone personall, might deserue lesse reprehension or mislike, whereunto I haue framed this briefe answere with Remonstrance, shewing the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie of your reasons, fallacie of your syllogismes, indemonstrable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, compiled by other in their bookes, combined vp in this booke of yours, worthied by you of this title, to be named a <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and to be surnamed a <hi>Demonstration</hi> of the holy discipline of the Church, not the discipline of the holy Church, because the Church is not so holy, but must be hallowed by the discipline. Whiles I am thus conuersant in answering, I list not make of ten apparent digression from the propositions which I answere, by instance to the contrarie, distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or deniall, and by returning or retorting all vpon your selues as I might, neither make a roadeouer to inuade other mens persons with selaunder, as the <hi>Demonstrator</hi> doth particularly, by producing at his
<pb facs="3"/>pleasure euery one into the <hi>Theatre</hi> of enuious diffamation: but I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaue a blanke or cyphre in Algorisme, or an <hi>Abecedarie</hi> name. And doe farther pray, that all protestations of your zeale and godlines laied aside, this Academicall lawe of disputing schoolelike, being once enacted by your selues, may not be repealed: That whether your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrator hath more to say, he may still syllogize, or if he haue ought to gaine-say, it may please him to distinguish, flatly denie, or giue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to an affirmatiue point. But if he haue no more to say, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to fortifie his part, nor is able in this forme to dispose of his sayings; Let the wiser sort of your sectaries suspend their iudgement, from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crediting or admiring those pitifull demonstrations. All that I haue said, is no more in substance, then that which hath bene afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said. The solutions of your arguments are included in the answeres to the Admonition, in the defense of that answere, in the answere to the Abstract, in the defense of the discipline of the Church of England, and such other learned workes, excepting some forced allegations annexed to the Demonstration, and the coyned syllogismes. All which, by this method of Remonstrance is reanswered, for it is but one answere. <hi>Omne verum, vero consentaneum,</hi> Euery truth is but agreeeble to a trueth. <hi>Veritas est simplex, mendacium est multiplex,</hi> there is but one trueth. And although you multiply and vrge your falshood, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide or subdiuide or part into infinite fractions, yet it is but one and the same obiection, one <hi>Proteus</hi> putting on diuerse mishapes, the argument sometime clowded vnder an equinoction, or coloured with ambiguitie of termes, or vailed with inconsequencie or disorderly disposition of moode and figure, or transposition of partes of the figure, or borrowing <hi>Ignorationem elenchi,</hi> Ignorance or vncunning, whether the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion holde, <hi>Ad idem, secundum idem, &amp;c.</hi> respectiuely to this, and not to that, or by begging <hi>Petitionem principij,</hi> to conclude one and the same by the selfe same: Or to be beholding to the fallacte <hi>à non causa,</hi> by arguing from insufficient cause vntrue effect, and such other sophistications to plaister vp your assertions with vntrueth: <hi>videlicet,</hi> as these and such like: As when you argue from your Puritane <hi>Idaea</hi> of gouernment, out of the <hi>14. Rom.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>All lawfull things are of faith: all lawfull things of faith are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the worde, <hi>Ergo,</hi> all lawfull things are warranted by the worde, and consequently euery lawfull action in gouernment of the Church: Where the conclusion is vniuersall in the third figure, and
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Medius terminus,</hi> videlicet, (lawfull things) is in the conclusion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to all rule of reasoning, and yet the Demonstrator misseth of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> wordes which are, <hi>Quicquid non ex fide peccatum est.</hi> All that is not of faith is sinne. Or where as you argue <hi>Hypotheticallie</hi> out of the <hi>4. Ephes.</hi> If all needfull gifts be appropriate to other ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, then is the Archbishops ministerie vnlawfull, but they are, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Archbishops vnlawfull.</p>
   <p>And <hi>T. C.</hi> before you argueth <hi>Categorically</hi> after this sort:</p>
   <p>Those functions onely are sufficient for the Church which haue gifts needfull: but all those <hi>Ephes. 4.</hi> and <hi>Cor. 1.12.</hi> haue gifts needfull, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> they are onely sufficient.</p>
   <p>Which is as good a conclusion as if one of you did argue thus:</p>
   <p>Those things onely are sufficient to saluation which are contained in the Scripture.</p>
   <p>But all those things in the <hi>Aue Marie</hi> are contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Ergo,</hi> those things onely in the <hi>Aue Marie</hi> are sufficient to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Or as cunningly after this sort.</p>
   <p>Those onely are men which are endued with reason.</p>
   <p>But all the Costerdmongers in London are endued with reason, <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> the Costerdmongers in London are the onely men.</p>
   <p>Or where you goe about to prooue that none is ordinable to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, vnlesse he haue a benefice.</p>
   <p>As was the <hi>12.</hi> place for <hi>Mathias,</hi> so is a certaine place for euery church officer.</p>
   <p>But <hi>Mathias</hi> was not ordained till <hi>Iudas</hi> had made it voyd by han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himselfe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> none is to be ordained before the place be voyd.</p>
   <p>Adde vnto this, by such maner of Resignation as hanging of himself: Or when another Apostleship falleth voide: Or when euery <hi>12.</hi> place is voyd: Or when <hi>Mathias</hi> commeth againe to be chosen into <hi>Iudas</hi> place.</p>
   <p>The Argument leapeth from one <hi>predicament</hi> to another, from the <hi>predicament Agere</hi> to <hi>Vbi:</hi> They ordained him to an office, <hi>Ergo,</hi> to a place, and a certaine place, as if the Apostles were not to preach <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, in all the world.</p>
   <p>Or when you will euince indefatigable residence of the Minister on the place out of the <hi>1. Samuel 9.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Elie</hi> the priest sate vpon a stoole by one of the postes of the Temple, <hi>Ergo,</hi> a Minister must be resident, and belike must also as he did sit
<pb facs="4"/>downe vpon a stoole. Or this: A Shepeheard must feede: a Minister is a Shepeheard, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he must corporally and continually reside, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out naturall or legall dispensation for his absence.</p>
   <p>As if you had sayd a Minister to be a Shepeheard, otherwise then <hi>Metaphoricallie:</hi> for a king also is a shepeheard, but in a Metaphor, who may law fully depute others to gouerne and to feede.</p>
   <p>Or against <hi>non Residence</hi> out of the <hi>1. Thes. 1.17. v.</hi> Satan hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered mee: Satan is the cause of <hi>non Residence, Ergo,</hi> vnlawfull: where the Demonstrator maketh S. <hi>Paul</hi> to write good diuinitie. Satan hindred me, that is, after the Demonstrators skill, Satan caused me to doe an vngodly and vnlawfull thing, whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> his meaning is, Satan raised persecution against me.</p>
   <p>Or as fitly and perfectly after this sort for your popular elections and choise of ministers from the <hi>8. Num. 9. v.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The children of <hi>Israel</hi> put their handes vpon the heads of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The <hi>Leuites</hi> put their hands vpon the heads of bullocks: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the people must lay their hands on the heads of the Ministers.</p>
   <p>Then adde vnto this: The Ministers must lay their hands on the heads of bullocks. <hi>T. C.</hi> taught you to reason thus from the ceremonie to the Gospell: <hi>Et vitulo tu dignus, &amp; hic.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Or when it pleaseth you to establish the presbyterie, you interprete roundly, <hi>Dic ecclesiae,</hi> tell the Church, that is, the Eldership or Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship of the Church: yea and goe farther for the authoritie of this venerable Eldership, out of the <hi>49. Esay,</hi> Kings and Queenes shall worship thee with their face towards the earth, and shall licke vp the dust of thy feete, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> great homage and honour shall be done to the Eldership.</p>
   <p>Or in that place where you ouerthrow all standing superioritie of Ministers ouer Ministers, you demonstrate after this fashion.</p>
   <p>A bishop is called <hi>Episcopus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>An ordinarie Minister is called <hi>Episcopus: Ergo,</hi> all one.</p>
   <p>Or a Bishop and an ordinarie Minister must haue one qualitie: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> a parish Bishop and a diocoesan Bishop are all one thing. Or, all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are equall in commission of the Ministerie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> equal in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer commission of authoritie. Or, In the beginning for a while a Bishop and a priest or Minister were all one: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they must continue all one.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>For in the Apostles time was the change, and that same, <hi>I am of Paul, I am of Cephas,</hi> was the occasion of the change: and finally the decree of all the world (at least as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> thinketh) was the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the change. This were strange reasoning: In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Kings and priests were all one, <hi>ergo,</hi> they must continne all one. In the beginning such was the simplicitie, &amp;c. Great lords sonnes, as <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp;c. kept their fathers sheepe: <hi>ergo,</hi> noble mens children mus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> keepe their fathers sheepe. In the beginning they baptized in Riuers, <hi>ergo,</hi> men must carie their children downe to be christened in Riuers. Or in another, where you demonstrate agaynst the superioritie of Archbishops.</p>
   <p>If the Pope be odious, the Archbishop is odious also, as who would say: If the vnmeasurable and illimitable power be vnlawfull, <hi>Ergo,</hi> a modest and limited superioritie by law is vnlawfull also. <hi>Finiti ad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum nulla est proportio.</hi> Or,</p>
   <p>The Archbishops office and name is vnknowen to vs Puritanes, <hi>Ergo,</hi> vnknowen and vnheard of in the Church.</p>
   <p>You shall well know that both the name and equitie of the name and thing is knowen and allowed of in Gods Church. Or, where it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth you to say.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Caluin</hi> saieth there were gouernours of order, not of superioritie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> this is true: as if it were truly sayd, all gouernment of superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is gouernment of disorder, and that these were opposite. Or in the demonstration: To prooue Doctor and Pastor to be distinguished, you dispute cunningly thus.</p>
   <p>Male and female are distinct in sexe or kind, <hi>Gal. 3. Ergo</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Pastor must be distinct: why not then in sex or kind? with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other like <hi>Paralogismes,</hi> as in your seuerall Chapters shal be vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the whole Demonstration being nothing els but a bundle of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities. Howbeit, the booke thereof is a thing so preciously esteemed by the author himself, so magnified by his folowers, as worthy to be set vpon the highest pinacle of this Church new reformed: for which cause hee giueth himselfe such applause for writing of it, &amp; glorifieth himselfe as if he were riding vpon the <hi>Cherubins</hi> with Luciferian pride, or as if he were to draw downe as the Dragons taile all the starres in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, consent of scriptures, Councils, Fathers old and new, onely to giue light to the cause in handling.</p>
   <p>And concerning other mens bookes that haue oppugned the cause,
<pb facs="5"/>he speaketh scornefully and disdainfully, as of the lord Archbishop and Deane of <hi>Sarum</hi> their bookes, whose learned trauailes, neither <hi>T. C. W. T. I. V.</hi> nor any ecclesiasticall discipliner of them all, are able to confute, vnlesse to raile in all their writings, and snatch at one word in <hi>40.</hi> leaues, bee to answere a booke: whose vertue notwithstanding shall shine, when your canckred malice shall bee dead. Touching that most reuerend Prelate, you and your complices may in this licentious and outragious world speake pleasurablie: Neuer yet good man spake but honour of him, whom her Maiestie hath graciously vouchsafed vnder her to exercise Christian iurisdiction and authoritie: whose Primacie is humilitie, who is for his vertue no lesse honoured then loued, whose learning angreth you, vnto whom if you will make answere, you must studie for more learning. I am verily perswaded, that as God in all ages raised excellent men, instruments of his glorie to confute and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish out of the Church heresie, as <hi>Athanasius</hi> against the <hi>Arrians, Augustine</hi> against the <hi>Donatists, Augustine</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> against the <hi>Pelagians</hi> in former times: In our latter times bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the false Catholikes and <hi>Semipelagians:</hi> so God hath stirred vp this learned man against the false brethren and <hi>Aerians</hi> of our time, to hammer and beate downe the schisme and singularitie of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes. And therefore I doe humbly thanke God, that it hath pleased his glorious maiestie in heauen, and her excellent maiestie here on earth, to reserue him to these times. I speake it in the feare of God, had not her Maiesties principall spirite of wisedome illumined with Gods trueth, together with the Heroicall prudent spirites of certaine hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable personages and industrious learned men, affecting a prouident care of the posteritie of the Church, patronized this Church-disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, your priuate spirites of new-fangled discipline happily had more preuailed against these godly and religious proceedings in the Church, nay, to the vtter remoouing of the Gospell by such confusion and <hi>Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.</hi> Imagine that the externall face of that Church where you might see so many thousand Superintendents, so many Elderships aduanced in or aboue the Church, to make orders and to censure at pleasure, where the people giue voices, the Laitie lay on handes, the maiestie of the Prince excluded from all swaie in the presbyterie: all antiquitie forlorne, all Councils vtterly repealed, doctrine deuided from exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Laie-men Deacons of the Church, parish bishops, parrot prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, the Vniuersities disgraced of the priuiledge of granting degrees,
<pb facs="6"/>Cathedrall Churches by greedie wolues spoiled, all courtes of Iustice ouerthrowen or impaired by the Consistoriall court of Elders, and as it were all the trees of the garden of <hi>Eden</hi> plucked vp, to implant <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucus</hi> the faire goodly Elders or Elder tree. Or els what may be the fantasie or imaginarie forme of this reformation in matters of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall gouernment? They themselues skill not: or when you haue supplanted or ouerturned, or turned out those Ecclesiasticall Senators and gouernours which we haue, whence shall the supplie bee of able go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours? from beyond the seas? that is impossibilitie. From your selues? that is matter of difficultie. From vs againe? that were egregious and ridiculous follie. Might it not fare with vs as it sometimes did with the Commons of the Citie of <hi>Capua?</hi> the Commons bare a deadly hate to the magistrates and gouernours of the Citie. Vpon a time the councell of the Citie being in consultation of their affaires, one <hi>Pacunius</hi> (as <hi>Liuie</hi> writeth) <hi>Homo vsus malis artibus,</hi> he was not the best man, maketh an insurrection with the Commons, and suddenly shutteth all the Magistrates into one place, and with sufficient garrison keepeth the place, and held them all as prisoners within, giueth farther this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell to the Commons to draw them foorth one by one, and to put euery one to death, and to put others in their places, to create new and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gouernours of the Citie. This aduise pleased them well. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth in order the first to be drawen foorth to execution, as a man woorthie of death: euery base and tumultuarie varlet crieth out, he is woorthie of an hundred deaths, let him bee shortened by the shoulders. The noble <hi>Senator</hi> whiles he is to lay downe his necke vpon the blocke, <hi>Pacuuius</hi> (as chiefe speaker) pawseth on the matter: Sirs, before wee put this man to death, it were good we did nominate another to occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie his place: this noble Citie may not stand without a Senate. That counsell also seemeth pleasing vnto them, they streight proceed on to the nomination and election of a <hi>Senatour,</hi> One man nameth one, that man nameth another, each man as he best fansieth, maketh a seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nomination: no sooner any man is named, but a <hi>1000.</hi> exceptions are taken to the partie, the person named is thought vnwoorthy ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for basenesse of his parentage, or vilenesse of his trade, or meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his fortunes, or lacke of this, or lacke of that: the sedition thereupon is dissolued of it selfe, the election of a new set of officers is interrupted, euery one plainly seeth his owne follie and temeritie. Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blablie if like power were giuen, as in the Preface of your Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="6"/>you pray for, (which God forbid) to shut vp into a corner our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Fathers and Ecclesiasticall magistracie, and you readie vpon the change to transforme our Bishops into your <hi>Surueillants,</hi> or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchers, our Conuocations and Chapters, into your maruelous Classi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conferences and Synodes, all the whole <hi>Hierarchie</hi> of the Church into your <hi>Tetrarchie</hi> of Doctor, Pastor, Elder and Deacon (for if you did affect <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> to haue no superioritie, then were you farre worse then the <hi>Capuans</hi>) If I say your mortall or immortall hatred against the state ecclesiasticall caried you to extinguish this order established in the Church alreadie: blessed God, how would you proceed to the choice of a new Senate Ecclesiasticall and their inuestiture? whiles a man might heare you say of the new Doctor or Pastor, Elder or Deacon, This man hath zeale but no learning, that man learning but no zeale, the other neither zeale nor learning, such a man is factious and full of deadly poison, he a base crafts-man or artisan, another is auarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and would carie away our bag, <hi>T. C.</hi> will ouertoppe all, or loueth the preheminences as <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> each man taking exception vnto other. Doe ye not foresee, or rather doe you not see as in a glasse, the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or bodily shape of the imagined state which you so impetuouslie striue for, and we striue against, and striue will in a good cause vnto the death? Or what need we striue? the strife will be with and within your selues, when you shall see the monstruousnesse of your misbegotten, conceiued foule <hi>Embryon,</hi> deformed and mishaped birth, borne into the world of Christianitie, which you are so enamoured vpon, and so fond ouer, that euery one must kisse &amp; embrace it in his armes, &amp; blush not to make shew &amp; demonstration of triumph of the birth &amp; natiuitie of the same. How soeuer your fancie deludeth you with ioie, this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster may not be suffered to liue vpon the face of the earth.<note place="margin">1.

      </gap>: <hi>I haue fought with beasts vnder the shape of men at Ephesus,</hi> that is, with beastly and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous men and their opinions. So I now say or will assaie to encounter the Demonstrator and his demonstrations, to quell this monster a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men. Of the same mind are many moe of our excellent &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men. Men are now awakened and will no longer endure these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signious abuses offered to the Church, to the Vniuersities, to the Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of learned men. No, no <hi>T.C.</hi> &amp; you the whole busie sect of Puritans, do not thinke any longer to pester the Church of England. You lacke the most of you (for any thing I see) sound Logike, and other learnings di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb facs="7"/>and humane. Perchance you, or some of the most ignominious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, may deuise an infamous Libell or letter against D. <hi>Bridges,</hi> or D. <hi>Bancroft</hi> for his Sermon preached at Paules crosse (a Sermon worthie to be read and printed in the heart of the hearer in deed) or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the writer of this Remonstrance to solace your selues withall for the meane time, as all heretikes and schismatikes are woont to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance their cause.

To second your irrefragable, vndoubted, and thrise learned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, the next newes I looke to heare from you, will be no refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this my booke, but a little booke or Libel full fraught with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnious slander: neuerthelesse, <hi>per bonam famam &amp; per infami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> by good report and bad report we must proceed on to the iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a good cause. And if like dastards and recreants you will not deale with handie-strokes of Syllogisme: let it be an euident signe that you are readie to runne away, and for euer after relinquish your so disputable and demonstrable a cause. {inverted ⁂}</p>
