   <head type="sub">The Argument.</head>
   <p>GOing about to speak of the knowledge of God, because in the creation of man the same chiefly doth appeare, for that cause also doeth he treate of man in this Booke: and so the speciall places which he handleth herein, are onely two: the first whereof is the knowledge of God, the 2. the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of man. In the first Chapter he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of them both: and after particularly of either: yet so that in the meane tyme hee toucheth certaine other small thinges, all which notwithstanding may be referred to either of these: he treateth also of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of Images, to the knowledge of God: the other three of the making of the world, of Angels, and Deuils, to the knowledge of man. The last of all, of the meanes whereby God gouerneth the worlde, perteineth to both. As touching the knowledge of God, he sheweth first what knowledge it is that he requireth. Cap. 2. Secondly where it is to be sought for, from the 3. to the 9. truely not in man, because (although naturally it be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in mans mynde, yet partly of ignorance, partly of malice, it is choked, the 3. &amp; the 4.
<pb facs="5"/> nor in the making of the world, because, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therein most clearely it appeare, yet we are so blockish, that such testimonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neuer so cleare, doe alwayes flote away frō vs without profit. 5. but in the scripture, 6. and so being caried to the Scriptures, hee prosecuteth his treatise. 7. 8. 9. thirdly, what God is. 10. fourthly, how wicked it is to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to God a visible fourme: where also he speaketh of Images, of the adoration of them and their beginnings. 11. fiftly, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoureth to proue that it is meet that God only be wholly worshipped. 12. Last of all, he speaketh of the vnitie of God, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of persons. Cap. 13. As concerning the other, that is, the knowledge of man: first he speaketh of the creatiō of the world, of Angels, of Deuils, that all these were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for mans sake. 14. then cōming to man him self, he examineth his nature &amp; strength 15. but that both, that is to say, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and of our selues, may better appeare, he descendeth against fortune and desteny, to the gouernment of all humane actions: and of the whole worlde. 16. 18.</p>
