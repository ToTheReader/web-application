In like sort hauing according to my to take measure, and in much infirmity of the flesh, Preached by voyce, this silly Sermon at an Assises, where your Honours were present and President: The frequent motions, and vehement perswasions of many, both of my brethren in the worke of the Ministery, and of the houshold of faith, are to me a sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, yea a diuine Calling, to Preach it againe by Writing, and thereby to helpe forward the building of the Body of Christ.

   <p>Since then I haue resolued, not to let it perish in the Aire, and Houre, wherein it was vttered, but to giue it a little longer life by the Presse, and to thrust it abroad naked and vnfeathered, as it is, into the world; it being imboldened in the generall, by the vndoubted soundnesse in Religion, feruent zeale to the truth, resolute detestation of Popery, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous respect both of the causes and persons of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in this vnhappy age, wherein the Tribe of <hi>Leui</hi> is so little respected: and in speciall, by your diligent attention when it was spoken, and fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable approbation afterwards, presumeth to presse once againe into your presence, and become a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner <hi>in formâ pauperis,</hi> for your honourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.
