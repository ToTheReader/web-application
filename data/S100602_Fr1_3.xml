      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T maye be (gentle Reader) that when thou shalt in this booke reade many monstrous &amp; horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble histories rather to be suppressed thē put in print, thou wilt not thincke well of my trauayle. I graūt that here are manye thinges vttered odious to be heard: but yet if any thing offend thy chas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e eares, blame not me gentle Reader but y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> importunitye of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Papistes, who hath forced me thus to displaye their treachery. For wher as their doctrine is so on all sides wounded and foyled by the force of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that they haue no shift to vphold their treachery as men euidēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye conuinced and condemned by lawe and iustice, now are they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to practise some pollicy, seing they are spoyled both of the word and the sword. And for want of better practise their onelye shifte is by spreading open other mens infirmities to couer their owne, by lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp the leude liues of the Protestants to the vewe of all men, to shadow the horrours of their Church, in somuch that their outcryes are growne so great, that these spitefull speaches are often and dayly heard vpon euerye occasion: Lo these are oure Protestants: Such are oure Gospellers: to such miserye and wickednes is the worlde growne since this new doctrine came among vs: ye maye see by their fruite what their Religion is. So outragious are the outcryes y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they make against vs to discredite not vs but our Gospel, as though the defacing of vs by our sinnefull liues, were a confutacion of oure doctrine, and an approuing of their innocencye, and a confirmation of theyr vnclenlye dregs to be pure and good. So vehement are their speaches, and y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> with such confidence on their partes, as if both theyr doctrine were on all sides true, and that the spirit of God had cleane forsakē this age, as if the like wickednes had neuer tainted any kind of men so haynously as it doth the professours of the Gospell, and as though sinne were but newe borne among men and latelye sprong vp wyth the Gospell: and as thoughe that the tree whereon their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is grafted (the Church of Rome I meane) had neuer yelded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rotten fruite, had neuer any catterpillers breeding in it, neuer any cankar corrupting it, but had euer bin greene, fresh and flourishing, pure and perfite in euerye leafe, braunche and twig. Therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning vs and concerning them I will speake of both.</p>
   <p>And first as concerning our selues (God be merciful vnto vs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
<pb facs="8"/>
sinners) we haue al runne astray, If we say we haue no sinne we deceyue our selues and the truth is not in vs: There is not one y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> doth good no not one. And if any Papist, Turke or infidel charge vs to be sinnefull men although we professe a pure Gospell, we will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, and neuer like the worse of them for so sayinge, nor the better of our owne infirmityes. Nowe concerning the Papistes, if they speake of our sinnes for that they hate sinne in vs, they do vs no wronge, we accept it and thancke them for it: But if they laye the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke of our sinnes vpon y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> glorious Gospel of Christ which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, &amp; if they meane by defacing vs to discredite it (as I haue sayde before) then do they offer great iniurye to the Maiesty of God, when as they say that by our deedes it appeareth, as by the fruite y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the tree is not good, that the Gospell which we professe is not perfite. Wee cannot and may not suffer it that the perfitnes of the Lawe should be tryed and condemned by the offence of the giltye: that the truth of Christe should depend vpon the workes of sinners, that eternall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen should be valued by fading earth, that the most perfite iustice and equitye of the most glorious God, should be measured &amp; esteemed by the frailtye of corruptible flesh &amp; bloud. And therfore as we do not and dare not presume to confirme the certainty of our doctrine by our good deedes be they neuer so perfite, but rather confirme oure good deedes to be good by our doctrine: so should oure aduersaryes deale vprightly with vs, not to condemne our doctrine by our euil deedes, but rather condemne our euill deedes by our doctrine, which beinge pure and perfite shal condemne both our wickednes and theyrs, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with theyr wicked and detestable doctrine.</p>
   <p>God forbid that the tryall of true religion should lye eyther vpon oure vprighte conuersation or theirs, least if it laye in mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection both the Iewe and the Turke mighte eyther of them soner boast of it thē eyther of vs. The wysedome of God hath not so buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Church vpon sande. If it were founded vpon the workes of man, then should his Church neuer stand neyther by them nor by vs. We are but feeble and windshaken pillers vnable to vnderprop and beare such a waight, &amp; therfore how so euer they build theyr Church, we build not ours on our selues, but we build both it and our selues vpon that vnmoueable rocke Iesus Christe, and therefore how soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the winde and weather do shake vs and ouerthrowe vs throughe our owne weakenes, yet our foundation abydeth sure, and doth ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall nor flyt awaye but abydeth so for euer, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we may be still ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and set vp on the same againe. Deceitfull therefore is theyr dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb facs="8"/>
who to withdraw men from our Church, do vniustlye saye that when we fall, our foundation falleth also: but most iustlye maye wee ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>re men that theyr Babilonicall building must needes come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caye, being founded on the sande of Tiber banckes, which is daylye washed and eaten awaye. How can that foundation stand which is made of earth and claye, dust and ashes, of fleshe, bloud and bones: of Popes miters, Cardinals hats, Monkes hoodes, Fryers cooles, Nonnes veales, shauen crownes, paxes, beades, tapers and crosses, annoyntings and greazings, blessings, kisshings, images of mettall, woode, glasse and stone, holye oyle, holye creame, albes, vestments, palls, coapes, rotchets, surplices, tippets, coyfes, chrismes, mantel &amp; the ringe, sensinges, pilgrimages, offrings, creeping to crosses, We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefreds nedle, the bloud of Hailes, fasting dayes, holye dayes, imber dayes, crogiers, polaxes, dirges, exorsims, coniurings, masses, tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, holye water, Purgatorye saints relicks, S. Fraūcis breeches, <hi>Limbo patrū,</hi> s. Iohn shorns bootes, the roode of Chester, our Lady of Walsingam, rotten boones, shrines, and a thousande such apishe toyes, which daylye (as they themselues perceiue) do putrifye rotte and consume to nothing. Seing therefore this foundation wyll not last to vphold their Babilonicall buildinges against the assaultes of the Gospell, therefore now they will haue the tryall of doctrine to lye vpon the honesty of men, and herein they make the world beleeue that they haue a great aduauntage ouer vs.</p>
   <p>Seing they will needes driue vs to this plonge and seeke hereby to foyle vs and vtterlye to ouerthrow our foundation, we wil be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente herein also to ioyne issue with them, not as hauinge affiaunce in oure owne iustice (the Lorde amende that which is amisse in vs, and blessed be his name for those sparkes of his mercye that haue preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs from beinge worse then we are) but because we haue such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of their treacherye, and that we know none shalbe compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Antichriste in iniquitye. To set aside therefore all excusing of our selues in such matters as they do slaunder vs, and graūt that we be as euill as they make vs, yet I dare bouldlye auouche that there hath not hetherto nor euer shall (I trust) proceede from vs such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable aboundance of corrupt fruite, as hath done from those y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> are the best, the most pure and perfits on theyr side, euen in those who they saye cannot erre, that are the most holye vicars of Christe vpon earth, namelye the holye fathers Popes &amp; bishops of Rome. Whose notorious villanyes from time to time swelled to the full and perfite measure of iniquitye, and so farre runne beyond our haynous sinnes,
<pb facs="9"/>
that supposing they dyed as they liued, I may bouldly warrant them this preferment, that if an hundreth of the rankest helhounds that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer raigned vpon the earth might be mustred out of hell, fourescore and nineteene of them should be Popes, perhaps for the last &amp; hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred place, eyther <hi>VVolsey</hi> or some other Cardinall would scuffle in among them.</p>
   <p>Whereof that thou mayest the better iudge (gentle Reader) I do here giue thee in this booke a little taste of theyr vnsauorye liues, I haue set them all forth here in one Pageante in such order as they played theyr Papall partes both Tragicall and Comicall for these Thousand yeares vpon this worldly stage: wherein I haue chosen rather to translate them as they were gathered in Latin by maister <hi>Bale</hi> most faithfullye, then to follow the parcial and flattering storye of <hi>Platina.</hi> In some places also I haue added diuers thinges out of sondrye authors, not as thoughe I desired to make perfite in all pointes that which maister <hi>Bale</hi> omitted: but because in conferringe his alleaging of storyes, I found manye thinges that without anye combraunce might be added and were worth the mentioning, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sixt booke of this historye out of one <hi>Theodoricus</hi> of <hi>Nyem</hi> Secretarye to Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the sixt, and wrote that which he sawe of that myserable and longe sciesme that set all the world together by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cares the space of xxxix. yeares, betweene <hi>Vrban</hi> the sixte, <hi>Clement</hi> the seuenth, <hi>Boniface</hi> the ix, <hi>Benedict</hi> the xiii. otherwyse called <hi>Iohn Moone,</hi> and other: which booke I am sure maister <hi>Bale</hi> neuer saw, for he would neuer haue omitted such notable and straunge matters as are contayned in it, and are here partlye touched by mee.</p>
   <p>Also for so much as these prelates do falsely colour al their prācks vnder the authoritye of S. Peters name, therfore I haue somwhat at large in the beginning shewed, how that thoughe they would haue him to play the first part in this Pageant, yet he is none of their cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. But because of the sodaine finishing of this worke in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hande, I am forced in this Preface to leaue out many matters which I thought to haue vttered, which I could neuer finde conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niente leasure to be setled in one certaine place, in suche wyse as I might apply my selfe to write that which I purposed since this was finished and came to the hande of the Printer. At this time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this onelye I haue to request of thee (gentle Reader) till God shal giue me better oportunitye to finishe that order which I purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in publishing this booke, to marke as thou readest how the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of these Prelates do agree to the description of Antichrist in the
<pb facs="9"/>
Reuelation, as I once purposed to haue noted vnto thee. Marke whether we that at this daye do professe the Gospel, and are so much noted of their freinds to transgresse haynouslye in our conuersation, are to be compared with these holye Popes in anye kinde of enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye. For what villanye is it whereof thou shalt not finde such mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous examples among them, as the earth neuer els bread the like. It were tedious for mee here to drawe into tables the examples of their vnsaciable couetousnes, their bribery, polling &amp; pilfringe, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and ryfling, vntollerable pride, equal with the ambition of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer, their vaine and vnspeakable pompe, theyr whoredome and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uishinge of diuers, their incest with their owne sisters &amp; doughters, their Sodomityes, treasōs practised against all Princes on y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> earth, the rebellions, seditions, bloudshed, warres, conspiracyes, murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, factions, sciesmes, braules, contentions amonge them selues, poysoninge Princes, &amp; themselues one another, euen in mynistring the Sacramentes, theyr sorcerye, charmes, coniurings, familiaritye with deuils, and honouring of euill spirites: their abusing of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces most slauishlye, theyr geuing, transporting, selling, setting vp and deposinge of all estates Empyres and kingdomes, theyr licensing of all villanye, as murthering, incest, Sodomitrye, periurye, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye, and an hundred such like moste detestable enormityes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou shalt haue plenty euē to the loathing of thy stomacke. Which when thou seest, then iudge betweene oure fruites and theirs, then learne to discerne who is that whore of Babilon,<note place="margin">

Note what Citye is like to be that Babilō built on seuen hilles, &amp; bearing rule ouer the Nations of the earth, What Citye is like to be that Babilon that is become the habitacion of deuils, the hole of all foule spirites, and a cage of all vncleane and hatefull byrdes. Note wyth whom the kinges of the earth haue cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fornication, and with the aboundance of whose pleasures the marchauntes of the earth are become riche. Note who it is that hath bin dronken wyth the bloude of saintes, if by these thou finde y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> these tokens of Antichrist be in these bishops of Rome, then surelye saye, thoughe wee wretched sinners be as euill as they make vs in deede (which they speake so much of) yet their holy fathers are farre worse, which the Papist wyll not confesse.
