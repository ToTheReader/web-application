   <p>To your pious and sacred Majestie therefore, I here present this absolute Tractate upon <hi>Genesis,</hi> such as hath not beene yet (in respect of the order, matter, and manner) set forth vpon this booke: wherein whatsoever questions of weight are discussed, and other necessarie matters added, as the short preface following sheweth. This my third work to your highnesse, I here in all humility exhibite and offer, as an unfained pledge of our hearty joy, for the joyfull entrance of this third yeare of your Majesties happy reigne.</p>
   <p>This divine booke of <hi>Genesis</hi> (as <hi>Ambrose</hi> advised <hi>Augustine,</hi>

      </note> as starres among the rest, <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaack, Iacob, Ioseph</hi>: from all these your Majestie may receive somewhat: with <hi>Adam,</hi> who in <hi>Enos</hi> time, when religion decayed, taught his sonnes apart from the wicked, to call upon the name of God, your princely care must bee, that you and your people, as separated from the superstition of the world, should worship the Lord more purely: with <hi>Noah</hi> God hath raised you up to bring rest and comfort to his Church: as another <hi>Abram,</hi>

   <p>Much bound unto God, is this Church and Common-wealth, for your Highnesse peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and religious government: that whereas we for our sins had deserved with Israel, neither to have King nor Church:<note place="margin">Hosh. <hi>10.3.8.</hi>
