   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving of late, for mine owne exercise at vacant houres, consummated the translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this little Booke, I now boldly adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to commit it to the Presse, being the rather induced thereunto by the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of certaine of mine acquaintance: not that I seeke hereby to winne praise, or publish this for any devotion in print, since I am verily perswaded, it deserves not the least title of commendation: and I hold it as a maxime with <hi>Lylie,</hi> that he which commeth in print, because he would be known, is like the foole that goeth into the market, because he would be seene. Onely I hope, that this my simple labour will be a spurre to the riper wits of our time, that the golden workes of this &amp; other famous Poets, may not still lye hidden, as under a vaile or my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, from the weake capacitie of meaner judgements. Concerning my translation, as I cannot altogether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it: for <hi>quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus:</hi> so neither will I wholly discommend it; in the one I might seeme arrogant; in the other be accounted foolish: and therfore <hi>puto rectius esse, ut sint mediocria omnia.</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
If one write never so well, he shall not please all; if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so ill, he shall please some: a dog will barke, though he lacke his teeth; and a dolt will censure, though hee want judgement. I know to some curious heads it will be thought amisse, that every verse answers not their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, because J have not word for word concurd with the Author in my translation: yet if they will but looke a little into the difficulty of this thing, considering the kinde of verse which J have used, I hope they will rest satisfied. I onely will answer them out of <hi>Hor. Non verbum verbo curabis reddere, fidus interpres.</hi> And furthermore (besides the diversitie betweene a constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and a translation) they may know, that there are many mysteries in this writer, which uttered in English, would shew little pleasure, and in mine opinion, are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be untouched, then to diminish the grace of the rest with tediousnesse and obscuritie: J have therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the counsell of the aforesaid <hi>Horace,</hi> teaching the duty of a good Jnterpreter, <hi>qui, quae desperat tractata nitescere posse, relinquit.</hi> By which occasion, some few sentences I have in places omitted, somewhat added, somewhat altered, and somewhat expounded: that which J have added, you shall finde noted with this marke * The significations of the names (being indeed no names, but onely words correspondent to the nature of <hi>Frogs</hi> and <hi>Mice) ne quis in ijs haereat,</hi> lest any should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with be troubled, I have englished and inserted them in the verse, that the inferiour Readers should not bee
<pb facs="5"/>
wearied with looking in the margent: as for the learned, they need not be instructed. I meane not to be a prejudice to any that can doe finer; onely J would desire them to be are with this my simple labour, and to accept it as a thing roughly begun, rather then polished. And if any with this will not be contented, let him take in hand, and doe it anew himselfe, and I doubt not, but he shall finde it an easier thing to controll a line or two, then to amend the whole of this interpretation. Farewell.</p>
