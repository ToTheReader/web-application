      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vt of a long Sleepe, which for almost seuen yeares together, seized al my sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, drowning them in a deep Lethe of forgetfulnesse, and burying mee to the World, in the lowest graue of Obliuion: Meeting in that drowzy voyage with nothing but fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Apparitions, by reason (as now I guesse) of the place in which I lay, beeing a Caue strongly shut vp by most Diuellish &amp; dreadfull Enchantments; I did at last fall into a Dreame, which presented to my waking Soule, infinite Pleasures, commix'd with In-vtterable Horrors. More did I behold thus Sleeping, then euer I could before, when my eies were wide open. I climbed to the tops of all the trees in Paradise, and eate sweeter Apples then <hi>Adam</hi> euer tasted. I went into the Star-Chamber of Heauen, where Kings and Princes were set to the Barre, and vvhen the Court arose, I fed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Manna,</hi> at a table vvith Angels. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> vvas the Pallace I liued in, and Mount <hi>Sion</hi> the hil, from vvhose top, I vvas dazled vvith glories brighter
<pb facs="5"/>
than Sun-beames. This vvas my Banquet: The Course-meate vvas able to kill mee. For I vvas throvvne (after all this Happinesse) into a sea In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall, and forced to svvim through Torrents of vnquenchable fire. All the Iayles of Hell vvere set open. And albeit the Arraignements vvere hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, yet the Executions vvere ten-times more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. Ioyes tooke me by the hand in the first dance, but feares &amp; sorrovves vvhipt me forward in the second. I must not novv tell, vvhat I savv, neither can I now see so much as I haue told. What Musicke led both these measures, do but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen my song-Booke, and the Lessons are there set downe.</p>
   <p>If the Notes please thee, my paines are well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed. If to thine care they sound vntuneable, much are they not to be blamed, in regard they are the Aires of a Sleeping Man.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Farewell.</hi>
