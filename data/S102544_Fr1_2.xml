   <p>THis Author, Sir <hi>Iohn Fortescue,</hi> was Chiefe Iustice to <hi>Hen: VI,</hi> as the Records of the later halfe of his Raigne, euery where shew; and that hee might <hi>Statum suum decenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ùs manutenere,</hi> in <hi>Part. 1. Rot. Pat.</hi> 20. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>membran.</hi> 10. an annuity of <hi>CLxxx</hi> markes is giuen him out of the Hamper, with Cxvj.s.xj.d. <abbr>q</abbr>. <hi>Percipiendum singulis annis ad Festum natalis Domini pro vna roba &amp; furrura pro eadem, erga idem fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum,</hi> and Lxvj.s.vj.d. <hi>singulis annis ad festum Pentecostes pro vna roba &amp; linura pro eadem, erga idem festum.</hi> Hee is call'd his Chancellor also. In this booke, his title, giuen by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, is <hi>Cancellarius Angliae,</hi> and in
<pb facs="3"/>
his <hi>Declaration,</hi> or rather <hi>Retractation,</hi> of that he had writen against the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the house of <hi>York,</hi> himself puts in the mouth of a friend of his expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulating with him, these words, <hi>Considering that yee were the Chief Chancellor to the said late King.</hi> It seemes, being with <hi>Henry</hi> VI. driuen into <hi>Scotland,</hi> hee was made his Chancellor, the memorie whereof (as it could hardly bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise) wants in the Patent Rolls. His bookes which I haue seene are three. This now newly publisht, his <hi>Difference</hi> between <hi>Dominium Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale</hi> and <hi>Dominium Politicum</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale,</hi> and that <hi>Declaration</hi> touching the title of the Crowne. Neither of the two last were euer publisht, but they remaine Mss. in diuers hands. As touching his discent; by good testimonie, hee is made sonne to
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Henrie Fortescue</hi> sonne of Sir <hi>Iohn Fortescue</hi> knight (Captain of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux</hi> and Gouernor of <hi>Brie</hi> in <hi>France</hi> vnder <hi>Hen</hi>: V.) who was second sonne of <hi>William Fortescue</hi> of <hi>Wime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> in <hi>Deuonshire</hi> Esquire. Because hee was Englisht by him that first publisht him, this, part of the title, and the Notes on him are in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish. what hee hath of the <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Law of England,</hi> must not bee expected to be so copious, as if all, that might thereof haue been said, had been hunted for by him to bee here congested. Hee shewes that hee instructed the yong Prince, and onely in some such few occurences of our trialls and positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as might bee, without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, apprehended by a minde so tender and strange to the Courts of iudiciall contention. Neither giues
<pb facs="4"/>
hee enough to satisfie or the malice, or the ignorance of some foule mouth'd declaimers against it, who for the most part (if they discend to particulars and make a case to finde fault withall) either ridiculously compact things incompatible, iust like the Sycophant in that Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie of his in <hi>Trinummus,</hi>
      <q>Omnium primum in Pontum aduecti ad Arabiam terramsumus</q>
and thence
<q>Ad Caput amnis quod de coelo exoritur sub solio Iouis,</q>
or els, measuring an establisht and vniuersall proceeding or position on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their own damage, neuer comming neer apprehension of the true reason, raile at it, with like
<pb facs="4"/>
iudgement, as the Parasit, in a lost Comedie of <hi>Plautus,</hi> doth at the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain course of sunne Dialls, being thence only moued, because the shadow went not so fast as his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which when hee was a Child was the only Diall, and that
<q>
         <l>—iste monebat esse, nisi quùm nihil erat.</l>
         <l>Nunc etiam quod est non est, nisi SOLI lubet</l>
      </q>
But no place is here for more of this, and <hi>nos hac à scabie tenemus vngues.</hi> To this edition, are added the <hi>Sūmes</hi> of Sir <hi>Ralph de Hengham</hi> Chief Iustice to <hi>Edward</hi> I. neuer till now printed; in whom although most of the learning bee touching <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soines, Defalts,</hi> and course of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in such actions which are in seldome vse at this day, yet diuers
<pb facs="5"/>
things occurre both specially obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable in what hee hath touching those proceedings (which a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of the Law cannot but wish to know) as also hee often otherwise giues light to the Customes or Law of his time, whence, as through an ancestor of the right line, wee must deduct that of the present. Of him in the preface to the Reader, before him, enough is said, and of his <hi>Summes.</hi> Of his language, which with the rest of our Comon Law Latin is accused of Barbarism, somewhat is there brought in excuse. That preface was thought fit to speake Latin, the autor of the booke himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publisht only in that tongue. But the Notes are English. For what other readers then English are to bee expected? Many an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb facs="5"/>
had been deterred by pure Latin, and to haue vsed Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism in them would haue turn'd the stomach of a polite Reader. Though diuers Copies of <hi>Hengham</hi> were examin'd in preparing this, yet could not a perfect one bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from them all. As one helpt another, choise was so made that this might bee the best; which yet is not without many faulty passages. So faithfully it is publisht from the Mss. that euen the false language, which by consent of old Copies appeard not to bee the transcribers, but proceeded from the ages either negligence or ignorance, is religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retain'd▪ so should the lost mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of ancient writers bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the publique; so should wee abstaine from wronging their <hi>Manes.</hi> Some places, that the erring hands
<pb facs="6"/>
of such as anciently Copied him cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, are by way (mongst other obseruations collected in the heat of the presse) noted, and either by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture restored, explaned, or, marked with asteriskes, left to better Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The varying of letter, in the print, is only to lead the Readers eie the sooner to what hee may looke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Farewell from the Inner Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, September XXIV.M.DC.XVI.</p>
