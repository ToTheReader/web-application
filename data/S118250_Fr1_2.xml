      <l>YOu that the gentle craft profess, list to my words both more &amp; lesse</l>
      <l>And I shall tel you many things, of worthy and renowned Kings▪</l>
      <l>And diuers Lords and knights also that were shoomakers long agoe,</l>
      <l>Some of them in their distresse, delighted in this businesse.</l>
      <l>And some, for whō great wait was laid, did saue their liues by this same trade,</l>
      <l>Other some, in sport and game, delighted much to learne the same,</l>
      <l>No other Trade in all the Land they thought so fit vnto their hand;</l>
      <l>For euermore they stil did find, that shoomakers bore a gallant mind,</l>
      <l>Men they were of high conceit, the which wrought many a merry feat</l>
      <l>Stout of courage were they still, and in their weapons had great skil,</l>
      <l>Trauellers by sea and land, each country guise to vnderstand.</l>
      <l>Wrong they wrought not any man, with reason al things did they sca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</l>
      <l>Good houses kept they euermore, releeuing both the sicke and poore.</l>
      <l>In law no mony would they spēd, their quarels friendly wold they end</l>
      <l>No malice did they beare to any, but shew'd great fauour vnto many;</l>
      <l>Offences soone they would forgiue, they would not in contention liue</l>
      <l>Thus in ioy they spent their daies, with pleasant songs and roundelaies</l>
      <l>And God did blesse them with content; sufficient for them he sent,</l>
      <l>And neuer yet did any know, a shoomaker a begging goe:</l>
      <l>Kind are they one to another, vsing each stranger as his brother.</l>
      <l>Thus liu'd shoomakers of old, as ancient writers haue it told:</l>
      <l>And thus shoomakers still would be, so fame from them shall neuer flee▪</l>
