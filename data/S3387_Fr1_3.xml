   <head>IOHN GARRETS GHOST.</head>
   <l>THE doores and windowes of the Heauens were barr'd,</l>
   <l>And Nights blacke Curtaine, like an Ebon Robe,</l>
   <l>From Earth did all Celestiall light discard,</l>
   <l>And in sad darknesse clad the ample Globe;</l>
   <l>Dead midnight came, the Cats'gan catterwaule,</l>
   <l>The time when Ghosts and Goblins walke about;</l>
   <l>Bats flye, Owles shrick, &amp; dismall Dogs do bawle,</l>
   <l>Whiles conscience cleare securely sleepes it out.</l>
   <l>At such a time I sleeping in my bed,</l>
   <l>A vision strange appear'd vnto my sight,</l>
   <l>Amazement all my senses ouer spread,</l>
   <l>And fill'd me full with terrour and afright.</l>
   <l>A merry graue aspect me thought he had,</l>
   <l>And one he seem'd that I had often seene:</l>
   <l>Yet was he in such vncouth shape y clad,</l>
   <l>That what he was I could not wistly weene.</l>
   <l>His cloake was Sack, but not the Sacke of <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Canara, Mallago, or sprightfull Shery,</l>
   <l>But made of Sack-cloth, such as beares the graine,</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="5"/>Good salt, &amp; coles, which makes the Potters weary</l>
   <l>Lac'd round about with platted wheaten straw,</l>
   <l>For which he nothing to the Silkeman owed:</l>
   <l>A wearing neuer mention'd in the Law,</l>
   <l>And yet far off, like good gold lace it show'd.</l>
   <l>Lin'd was his mantle with good Essex plush,</l>
   <l>Pyde Calues skins, or Veale sattin, which you wil:</l>
   <l>It neuer was worne threedbare with a brush,</l>
   <l>I (naturally) sau'd the labour still.</l>
   <l>A hat like <hi>Grantham</hi> steeple, for the crowne</l>
   <l>Or Piramide was large in altitude:</l>
   <l>With frugall brim, whereby he still was knowne</l>
   <l>From other men amongst a multitude,</l>
   <l>A Princes shooe, he for a iewel wore,</l>
   <l>Two ribbonds, and a feather in his beauer,</l>
   <l>Which shape me thought I oft had seene before,</l>
   <l>Yet out of knowledge where, as't had bin neuer.</l>
   <l>He in his hand a flaming torch did hold,</l>
   <l>(And as hee neerer did approach to me)</l>
   <l>My hayre 'gan stand on end, feare struck me cold,</l>
   <l>Feare not, I am <hi>Iohn Garrets</hi> ghost, quoth he.</l>
   <l>I come to rowze thy dull and lazy Muse</l>
   <l>From idlenesse, from Lethe's hatefull lake:</l>
   <l>And therefore stand vpon no vaine excuse,</l>
   <l>But rise, and to thy tooles thy selfe betake.</l>
   <l>Remember me, althongh my carkasse rot,</l>
   <l>Write of me, to me, call me Foole or Iester,</l>
   <l>But yet I pray thee <hi>(Taylor)</hi> ranke me not,</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="5"/>Among those knaues that doe the world bepester,</l>
   <l>Thou wrot'st of Great <hi>Otoole</hi> and <hi>Coriat,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Of braue <hi>Sir Thomas Parsons,</hi> Knight o'th Sun,</l>
   <l>And <hi>Archy</hi> hath thy verse to glory at,</l>
   <l>And yet for me thou nought hast euer done.</l>
   <l>Write that in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I in <hi>Mars</hi> his trayne,</l>
   <l>Long time did vnder noble <hi>Norris</hi> serue:</l>
   <l>Where (as I could) I stood gainst Pope and <hi>Spain,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Whilst some were slain, &amp; some w<seg rend="sup">th</seg> want did starue</l>
   <l>Where shot, &amp; wounds, &amp; knocks, I gaue and took</l>
   <l>Vntill at last halfe maimed as I was,</l>
   <l>A man decrepit, I those warres forsooke</l>
   <l>And (with my <hi>Passe)</hi> did to my Country passe.</l>
   <l>Where getting health, I then shooke hands with death,</l>
   <l>And to the Court I often made resort.</l>
   <l>Where <hi>Englands</hi> mighty Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Allow'd me entertainment for disport.</l>
   <l>Then by the foretop did I take old time:</l>
   <l>Then were not halfe so many fooles as now,</l>
   <l>Then was my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, and my onely prime,</l>
   <l>My purse receiuing what my wit did plow.</l>
   <l>Then in such compasse I my iests would hold,</l>
   <l>That though I gaue a man a gird or twaine:</l>
   <l>All his reuenge would be to giue me gold,</l>
   <l>With commendations of my nimble braine.</l>
   <l>Thus liu'd I till that gracious Queene deceast,</l>
   <l>Who was succeeded by a famous King:</l>
   <l>In whose blest Sons reigne (I with yeares opprest)</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="6"/>Me to my graue, sicknesse and death did bring.</l>
   <l>And now (kind <hi>Iacke)</hi> thou seest my ayrie forme</l>
   <l>Hath shaken off her Iayle of flesh and bone,</l>
   <l>Whilst they remaine the feast of many a worme.</l>
   <l>My better part doth visit thee alone.</l>
   <l>And as betweene vs still, our good requests,</l>
   <l>Thou neuer me. I neuer thee denyd:</l>
   <l>So for my sake collect some merry Iests,</l>
   <l>Whereby sad time may be with mirth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>.</l>
   <l>And when tis written find some good man forth,</l>
   <l>One (as thou thinkst) was when I liu'd my friend:</l>
   <l>And though thy lines may be but little worth,</l>
   <l>Yet vnto him my duty recommend,</l>
   <l>So farewell <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>,</hi> dame <hi>Luna</hi> 'gins to rise,</l>
   <l>The twinkling stars begin to borrow light:</l>
   <l>Remember this my suit I thee aduise,</l>
   <l>And so once more good honest <hi>Iacke</hi> goodnight.</l>
   <l>With that more swifter then a shaft from bow,</l>
   <l>He cut and curried through the empty ayre,</l>
   <l>Whilst I amaz'd with feare, as cold as snow,</l>
   <l>Straight felt my spirits quickly to repayre.</l>
   <l>And though I found it but a dreame indeed,</l>
   <l>Yet for his sake of whom I dreamed then,</l>
   <l>I left my bed, and cloath'd my selfe with speed,</l>
   <l>And presently betooke me to my pen:</l>
   <l>Cleare was the morne, and Phoebus lent me light,</l>
   <l>And (as it followeth) I began to write.</l>
