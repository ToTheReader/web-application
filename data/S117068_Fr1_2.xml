                 <title>The introduction to the true understanding of the whole arte of expedition in teaching to write : Intermixed with rare discourses of other matters, to shew the possibilitie of skill in teaching, and probabilitie of successe in learning, to write in 6. hours. Which tending all to one end, doe serve for two uses. 1. If authors doe excell others in their owne artes, why may not this author excell others in his arte. 2. For removing a vulgare opinion against his native countrey of Scotland, he sheweth that it hath moe excellent prerogatives than any other Kingdome. Whereby it will rather follow, that a Scotishman is so much the more able to prosecute whatsoever hee undertaketh, and therefore so much the more to bee respected, by how so much he is more ingenuous than one of another nation</title>

   <p>In regard that some have a sinister opinion of me in my profession, not only becaus of the pretended impossibility of the succes therof, but far more of that worthie nation, where all your Highnesse most royall Progenitors had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and whereof I also have the honour to be a native, and lest any either of their writings or speaches should come to your Highnesse sight or hearing, now in your ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeares, I have laboured heere to preuent them, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending both my Countrie and profession.</p>
   <p>Where as these things are propounded heere in the superlative degree, I suppose it is according to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of worthy men in former times, when their persons, professions, countries, or causes have beene any wayes traduced, they have not only defended the same to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of their power, but even stretched all and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so-ever their properties priviledges, or liberties to the furthest extent, that their adversaries might bee either convinced or silenced.</p>
   <p>Whensoever it shall please God your Highnesse shall have occasion to use that antient nation, yea or any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof (such as my self) in any service, I hope your Highnesse shall find us as faithfull, able and willing now, as our predecessors have beene to your Highnesse royall progenitours informer times.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p> Now in token of my goodwill and affection, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly present your Highnesse with these my meane labours, that they may goe abroad under your Highnesse protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that it would please God to grant your Highnesse such gratious education, as you may bee an happie instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his glorie in his owne good time, it shall be the fervent suite of</p>
