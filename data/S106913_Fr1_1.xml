   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I first deliuered that small Treatise by word of mouth, it was the farthest part of my thought, euer to aduenture the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall of it to the view of any, as considering mine owne <hi>weaknes</hi> and the <hi>worlds peeuish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> But it fared with this <hi>Sermon</hi> as with a <hi>Meteor,</hi> which being gently drawne vp by
<pb facs="2"/>the kindly heate of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> resides for a time in the <hi>Ayre,</hi> and hath there indeed a <hi>bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but <hi>shineth</hi> not, till <hi>kindled</hi> by the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peristasis</hi> and circumstant <hi>cold</hi> of the ayre: So this my Labour receiuing some warmth and beeing, by the gentle breath, and vndeserued ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of some, was not yet seene of the world, vntill it tooke fire by some, who being (at the deliuery of it) <hi>circumstant,</hi> did in their causlesse and vndeserued humours, giue such cold entertainment vnto both it and me, that I was by the vulgar reported to bee taken by the great <hi>Fleet,</hi> or at the least shrewdly encountred. Whereupon I thought it fit (for mine owne defence, and satisfaction of others) that the things before <hi>demisla per au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi> should be now, <hi>oculis subiect a fidelibus,</hi> that what was before in the <hi>aire</hi> and in the <hi>eare,</hi> should now be in the <hi>eye,</hi> that the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Reader</hi> may iudge whether it deserued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe or censure, yea, or no: and whether herein I haue <hi>laboured to keepe a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science toward God and men,</hi> I appeale to the iudgements of them, who being cleare of any
<pb facs="2"/>thing against which I might seeme to inueigh, are fittest and the onely <hi>competent Iudges</hi> in this kind. Your Worships can (I trust) beare me witnesse, that I neuer amongst you for these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, haue shewed my selfe any way to be of a <hi>factious</hi> and a <hi>turbulent</hi> spirit, but haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies laboured and prayed for the <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and hope to prosper the better because I <hi>loue her.</hi> Now when these forenamed pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages had caused me <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>willing, nilling,</hi> for my owne safeguard to adiudge this poore booke to <hi>be prest</hi> (although I might haue seemed wise in choice of some greater <hi>patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,)</hi> I thought fittest to <hi>appropriate</hi> some part of my labours to this place, where I was <hi>borne, brought</hi> vp, and haue spent my dayes euer since I was called first to the <hi>Ministery,</hi> and so much the rather in regard of your vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued loues, which I can neyther <hi>deny</hi> nor <hi>conceale</hi> lest I should be iniurious, and also your godly and religious dispositions (wherein this <hi>City</hi> doth equall (without flattery be it spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,) the most ciuilly gouerned, or most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently religious places of this <hi>Kingdome.</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>Such as it is it pleades in my name, and I in the name of Truth, that it may finde <hi>acceptance</hi> with your <hi>Worships</hi> and as many as loue the <hi>truth,</hi> and if in any thing I shall be blamed, I will not bee so presumptuous as with <hi>Pilate,</hi> to say, <hi>What I haue written, I haue written;</hi> but as the Ecclesiasticall Historian, <hi>If I haue done well, it is that which I desired, but if slenderly and meanly, it is that which I could attaine vnto.</hi> If hereby any (taking paines to reade is) shall reape any benefit, it shall be a full satisfaction for my labour and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of my heart. Now the God of <hi>loue</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> multiply his blessings vpon this City, that it may be happy in <hi>gouernment, holy</hi> in <hi>profession,</hi> the true <hi>member</hi> of the mysticall <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> partaking the promises of <hi>godlinesse,</hi> euen those of this life and of the life to come: Euen so be it Lord Iesus. Amen, Amen.</p>
