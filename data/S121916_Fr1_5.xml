   <p>It is impossible to prevent all: for▪ some out of meere malice practise the disparagement of every labour whereby the glory of God may seeme to bee advanced; and if on the <hi>Worke</hi> they cannot fasten their <hi>Detractio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Against my <hi>MOTTO,</hi> though (as I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>orespake) it redounded to their owne shame, so raged my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, that not content with my personal troubles, they sought the disparagement of that Booke, by a libellous answer the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>eunto: wherein, I was used as most writer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> of <hi>Controversies,</hi> in these dayes, use each other: To wit, they objected what I never thought,
<pb facs="15"/>
and then made replies to their owne devices▪ which being finished, was imprinted with an inscription fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, it proved a ridiculous <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> and became more losse and disgrace unto the divulgers thereof, then I desired; and, non<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Hereby, therefore, I seeke not so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">

      </gap> p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> the like injury to my person, as to remove those occasions of prejudice, which scandalous censures may raise in some other, who might else, perhaps, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eive the more profit from this <hi>REMEMBRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CER:</hi> And what I will say to that purpose shall bee very briefe.</p>
   <p>First (in regard my ayme in this <hi>Poeme,</hi> is chiefly God's glory, and the welfare of this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth</hi>) I desire I may no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>e traduced, though I have here and there inserted some lighter expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, then seeme at first view to become the gravity of the <hi>Subject:</hi> For, (considering the common va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and how tedious matters of most consequence are unto some eares) it is necessary, and by good authority warrantable, to make use of all indifferent meanes, to worke on humane infirmities, for our hearers profit.</p>
   <p>Secondly, I request that wherein I differ from the vulgar Tene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s, I may not rashly bee rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oved; but that my affirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tions, may with all their due cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, be first wei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hed: For, otherwhile the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e is just occasion to hyperbolize. And, as he that rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
<pb facs="15"/>
a crooked staffe, bends it somewhat on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>er side: so, in many cases, we are constrained to urge that which appeares over much on the right hand, before those who are too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ar on the left hand, will beleeve they are ought awry. Thus did the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> when they had to doe with some <hi>Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>tikes,</hi> and have beene thereby mis understood▪ and mis-censured by heedlesse Readers. In the same manner have my writings beene abused; yea, my hearers have beene so hasty, that had I not explained my selfe to be of their opinion, within some few lines after, doubtlesse they would have robbed me of my owne meaning. But, they who well heed what I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme or deny, will finde (I hope) that I keepe a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling path betwixt extreames.</p>
   <p>If any conceive (as I heare they doe) th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> I did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wisely to remaine in <hi>London</hi> during the great <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> I had for so doing. I think it will satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them; for, so well it satisfied me, that (whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver others may imagine) I know it had beene better I should háve perished in that <hi>sicknesse,</hi> then to have had a heart disobedie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> of mine. Those <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Iudgements</hi> of God's which I memorize, are such as this <hi>Kingdome</hi> is generally witnesse of. The <hi>Sins</hi> I reprove, are none but those which were, and are notoriously commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: I have reprehended them ìn such manner, as God's holy <hi>Word,</hi> and the universall law of <hi>Nature</hi> hath warranted in all ages. I have foretold what shall come upon such Transgressors, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the <hi>Prophets.</hi> I have assured, upon <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> those ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p>If any dislike my personating God (as in the first <hi>Canto)</hi> let them search, and they shall finde it usuall not onely in Christian <hi>Poems,</hi> but also in the holy <hi>Text.</hi> And if we introduce him according to his <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
