      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was my fortune (Sir) not long since, to trauaile between <hi>Pancredge Church</hi> &amp; <hi>Pye-corner,</hi> beeing somewhat late in the Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, about an houre after the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Sunne: and casting vp mine eyes towardes the skyes, to beholde the twinckling starres that had then but newly discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselues, I might see how the Man of the Moone was beating of his dogge. Thys fearefull aspect did wonderfullie daunt mee, with doubt of some angry accident that might shortly betide me; And I had not paced many steppes, but directly in the path before me, there appeared a most grislie ghost wrapt vp in a sheete, his face onely discouered, with a penne vnder his eare, and holding a scrowle of written paper in his hande. I crosled the way of purpose to shunne him, but crosse as I could he was euer-more before mee, that passe I might not, vnlesse I should runne ouer him; I remembred my selfe how old Fathers were wont to say, that Spirits in such cases, had no power to speake to any man, vntill they were first spoken vnto, and therefore taking vnto me a constrained courage, I asked him what he was, &amp; what was his meaning
<pb facs="3"/>
to trouble mee in my passage? who aunswered thus. I am (saide he) a Spirite, yet feare thou nothing, for my comming is not to doe thee any manner of harme, but to request a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at thy handes which thou maist not denay me, for thou must vnderstand, I am the spirite of <hi>Robert Greene,</hi> not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne vnto thee (I am sure) by my name, when my wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings lately priuiledged on euery post, hath giuen notice of my name vnto infinite numbers of people that neuer knewe me by the view of my person.</p>
   <p>The matter that I would request thee to performe, is the committing of these papers to the Presse, wherein, because I haue there manifested the very drift of mine owne deuise, I may therefore be the more sparing vnto thee, in relating the circumstances: thys may suffise, nor faile not thou to doe as I haue willed thee.</p>
   <p>Heere-withall, popping the papers into my hand, I can not tell what account I should make of his departure, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I might say he flew into the ayre, or sunck into the earth, he was so suddainly vanisht out of my sight, but I was gladde I was ridde of his companie, and home-wards I went hastilie to my lodging: where calling for a light, I began by my selfe to peruse ouer these lynes, wherein I founde such a messe of altogether, that I knew not what I should make of the med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
   <p>Spyced it was heere and there with <hi>Mystlin,</hi> a kinde of graine that is made of Knaue and Rye, mixed both together, pleasurable it was in many places to be read, and therefore fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test for melancholie humors. And bethinking mee of my freendes to whom I might commend it, in the end I resolued of your owne good selfe: and the rather finding it to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull and pleasant, I thought it a fit restoratiue to recall you from that melancholie conceite, that hath so long pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>el you a tale (Maister <hi>Gregory</hi>) of an Asse, who leauing the place where he was first soald, fortuned to stray into a strange Forrest, and finding the beastes of that Desart to be but simple, and had neuer seene the maiestie of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou, neyther had they felt the cruelty of the Tygar, nor had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manner of wayes beene wronged by the oppressions of the Leopard, the Beare, the Panther, or any other deuouring or rauening beastes.</p>
   <p>Thys paltry Asse, seeing their simple plainnesse, founde meanes to wrap himselfe in a Lyons skinne, and then with proude lookes and loftie countenaunce, raunging among the Heardes, he would stretch ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> his filthy throate, bellowing and braying (as nature had taught him) with so hideous and horrible a noyse, that the poore beastes that were within hys hearing beganne already to tremble &amp; shake for feare. Then he began to tyrannise, commaunding what himselfe pleased amongst them, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> contenting himselfe with that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, which had beene fit for an honorable beast, and more then was due to an Asse, would many times take vppon him some duties proper to the person of the Lyon himselfe: and in the end became a notable sheepe-byter, worrying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>ng whole flockes of poore sheepe, that happened with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his precincte or iurisdiction.</p>
   <p>The Wolfe that had layne all this while close amongst the Mountaines, and hauing gotten vnderstanding of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and disposition of this Asse, thought him a fit compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his consortshyppe, and combyned with him in such a freendly league, that betweene them the one taking opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to filtch and steale in the night, the other vsing his tyrany to rauen and deuoure in the day, the poore harmelesse Cattle that liued within their reach, were stil oppressed, &amp; neuer free frō perril. The Asse grew to that greatnes that he was surna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>

   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>Peraduenture (Ma. <hi>Gregory</hi>) you expected a wiser con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, but what would you looke to come from a man that hath beene lately so skarred with sprites, that he hath not yet recouered the right vse of his sences: it may be true that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils are afraid to passe by a crosse, but I am sure knaues are not afraide to shroude themselues behinde a Condite. You may perceiue (Syr) my wits are sette a wandering, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your discretion enough to conceiue my meaning, I will trouble you no further, but with this abrupt conclusion will bid you hartily farewell.</p>
