   <head>¶<hi>To my right hartie freend,</hi> maister <hi>T. M.</hi> Thomas Beacon, wisheth grace and peace from God in Christ Iesu.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F howe great efficacie, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, strength &amp; power christen praier is, both the sentences, and histories, of the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture do aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly declare. For where at any time haue the faithful desired of god by hartie prayer, wherin he hath suffered a repulse? Praier geueth victory ouer enemies, deliuereth out of prison, preserueth in dangers,
<pb facs="3"/> kepeth safe in fyre, mitigateth the wrath of God, obtaineth remission of sinnes, getteth euerlasting lyfe, and purchaseth for vs of God all good thinges, whether we respect the bodie or the mind. Euery true Christian therfore can none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than highly delight in such and so great a treasure, wherof spring so many both necessary and profitable comodities to the vser therof. And albeit there are already many godly praiers set forth in our English toung worthy to be frequented at al times of the faithfull Christians, yet whan I had perused these prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers &amp; diligently considered the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of them, I thought it vnseming to defraud my countreymen of so precious a Iewell. For in them they shall not onely learne to pray truely and according to the will of
<pb facs="3"/> God: but also by the exercise of them they shall learne and commend to memory the whole summe of S. Paules Epistle to the Romaines, which Epistle in my iudgement is the principall parte of all the diuine scripture, forasmuch as it containeth in a goodly order, yea &amp; that briefly, what soeuer is taught in the whole body of the sacred Bible necessary for the instruction and edifying of a Christen man: so that whosoeuer hath that Epistle &amp; vnderstandeth the same, hath obtained the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the most necessary and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall partes of Christian religion.</p>
   <p>Now to come by this thing, I meane, to get the knowledge of this so goodly and profitable Epistle, these prayers made vppon the same Epistle (which I haue caused to be imprinted for the profite of the
<pb facs="4"/> readers) shall greatly helpe: so that they which exercise them shall get double profite by them. And would God some godly learned man wold take the like labour in making and settinge forth prayers vpon other partes of the holy scripture, as this authour hath done in this behalfe. For although I discommend not the prayers made by good and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute men (so that they be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the word of God) yet those prayers which are made vppon the holy scriptures are most to be alow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed and vsed of the godly Christiās. For god can not disalow that wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of his holy spirite is the Authour.</p>
   <p>These Christen prayers &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meditations I send vnto you as a pledge and memoriall of our frend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship, nothinge doubtinge but that, according to your accustomed gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telnes,
<pb facs="4"/> you will take them in good parte. Thus with right hartie thankes for your most hartie good will toward me, I wish you well to do. From Shene the xij. day of February in the yeare of our Lord. 1550.</p>
