   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I cōsider, most gracious Quene Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terine, the greate noumbre of noble weomen in this our time and countreye of Englande, not onelye geuen to the studie of humaine sciences and of straunge tongues, but also so throughlye experte in holy scriptures, that they are hable to compare wyth the beste wryters as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in endictynge and pennynge of godlye and fruitfull treatises to the enstruccion and edifiynge of whole real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in the knowleage of god, as also in translating good bokes out of Latine or Greke into Englishe for the vse and commoditie of suche as are rude and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunte of the sayd tounges, I cannot but thynke and esteme the famous learned Antiquitee so ferre behynde these tymes, that there cannot iustelye bee made any comparison betwene them. Cornelia a noble matrone of Rome throughe longe conuersacion and continuance with her learned housebande, was in the processe of tyme so wel learned &amp; so eloquent, that hirself was the chiefe &amp; principall instructrice and brynger vp of hir two sonnes Caius Gracchus, and Tyberius Gracchus in all their learning, and made thesame at lengthe so fyne, that they yet to this daye remayne registred in the noumbre of the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and perfecte Oratours of olde tyme. We reade of one Amesia in Rome a woman so well spoken &amp; so fine of toungue, that beynge on a time indicted and arrained of a grieuous offēce, she so wittily, so piththily, and wich suche grace made answer for hirself: that all the whole benche &amp; Courte than presente, iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> mere respecte of her eloquence and witte in that present perill and ieoperdie there shewed, worthy by theyr whole cōsentes &amp; sentences, to be quit and discharged of the law for that crime. Hortensia the daughter of Quintus Hortensius, &amp; brought vp continually frō hir cradle and tendre infancye in the house and companye of suche a noble Oratour, came at lengthe so nere to the perfect eloquēce of her father, that she was hable in publique hearing to make oracions, and thesame of so piththye a sorte, that where the noble weomen of Rome were on a time sore taxed to departe with their golde, &amp; iewels toward certayne necessarie charges of that cōmon weale: Hortensia came before the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners to speake in the behalfe of the matrones, &amp; with her exquisite talke obteined a mitigacion almoste of the wholle taxe whiche the sessours had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore agreed vpon, and appointed vnto the weomen to contribute.</p>
   <p>These exaumples of eloquence in weomen, lyke as they are but verye fewe in noumbre, so are they thynges of no suche highe excellencie to be meruailed at. For what great matier of woondre is it that emong so many thousādes three or fower should be founde hable to speake before a iudge in open audience: or what straūge case is it to be reputed, if some one or two weomē haue ben foūd wittie or learned in the Latine toungue beeynge their owne natiue language which euerie carter and handicraftes man than spake, though not al thinge so
<pb facs="443"/>
finely as the learned men and Oratours dyd? what high matier of praise and commendacion is it, if a few weomen being either wines or daughters to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent fine Latine men, could in continuaunce of a greate manye yeares speake Latine well▪ yet are these weomen specialy chronicled in histories as notable, yea and syngulare exaumples worthy perpetuall fame and memorye for their wytte, learnyng, and eloquence. After these heathens, Hiereme in his Epistles writeth speciall high praises and commendacions of Eustochium the mother, Paula the daughter, and Blesilla the daughters daughter: of whiche euerye one were passyng well sene not onely in holy scryptures, but also in Latyne, Greke and Hebrewe: whiche toungues they learned exactely in a veray shorte tyme, &amp; excelled in the same. The like testymony he geueth of Marcella a veray noble woman in Rome, whome he reporteth to had in his time so well profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the knowleage of holy scriptures, that after his departure from Rome, yf there were any doubtefull question or any poynte of difficultee concernyng scripture: all folkes woulde resorte to hir as to a iudge hable and also suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to decise any matier of controuersie or ambiguitee that happened emonge them. But this knowleage extended no ferther then to the priuate edifyinge of theyr owne selues with a very fewe others, and thesame in suche places where Latine was their mother toungue and their natiue language. But nowe in this gracious and blisse full time of knoweleage, in which it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed almighty god to reuele and shewe abrode the lighte of his most holy ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: what a noumbre is there of noble weomen (especially here in this realme of Englande,) yea and howe many in the yeares of tender virginitie, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aswell sene and as familiarlye traded in the Latine and Greke tongues, as in their owne mother language: but also bothe in all kyndes of prophane lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, and liberall artes, exactly studyed and exercised, and in the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Theologie so ripe, that they are able aptely, cunnyngly, and with muche grace eyther to endicte or translate into the vulgare toungue for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique instrucciō and edifying of the vnlearned multitude. Neyther is it nowe any straunge thing to heare ientle weomen in stede of moste vaine communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion aboute the moone shynyng in the water, to vse graue and substanciall talke in Greke or Latine with their housebandes of godly matiers. It is now no newes in Englande to see young damysels in nobles houses and in the Courtes of princes, in stede of cardes and other instrumentes of idle trifleing, to haue continually in theyr handes eyther Psalmes, Omelies, and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute meditacions, or els Paules epistles, or some booke of holy Scripture matiers, and as familiarlye both to reade or reason therof in Greke, Latine, Frenche, or Italian, as in Englishe. It is nowe a common thing to see young virgins so nouzeled and trained in the studie of letters, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they willingly set all other vayne pastimes at naught for learninges sake. It is nowe no newes at all to see Quenes and Ladies of moste highe estate and progenie, in stede of Courtly daliaunce, to enbrace vertuous exercises of readyng and wrytyng, &amp; with moste earneste studie both erely and late to applye themselues to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of knowlage, aswell in all other liberall artes and disciplines, as also moste specially of God and his moste holy worde, wherunto all christen fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, (of what estate or degree so euer they be,) ought to the vttermoste of their possible powers, moste principally and moste earnestly themselues to geue &amp; dedicate. But what a great cause of publique reioycyng (o lorde) maye it be, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in this time of Christes harneste, euerie good bodye moste busily applyinge the

worke of his vocaciō towardes the inning of the lordes corne, some by instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng the youth, some by teachyng scholes, some by preachyng to their simple flockes, some by godly inducing of their families, some by wrytyng good and godly treatises for the edifying of suche as are willing to reade, and some by translating good bokes out of straunge toūgues into our vulgare language for the helpe of the vnlearned: the most noble weomen of bloude and estate royall, are no lesse diligent trauaillours then the best, (in any of the aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med offices mete for their sexe,) ne take any manier skorne or disdeigne in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of drawing this haruest home, to bee ioyned as y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Howe happie art thou, o England, for whose behoufe and edifying in Christe, Quenes and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses spare not ne ceasse with all earnest endeuour and sedulitee to spende their tyme, their wittes, their substaunce, and also their bodyes? And in this behalfe lyke as to your highnesse, moste noble Quene Katerine, aswel for composyng and setting foorth many goodly psalmes and diuerse other contemplatiue me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditacions, as also for causyng these paraphrases of the moste famous clerke and moste godly writer Erasmus of Roterodom to bee translated into oure vulgare language, Englande can neuer bee able to render thankes sufficiente: so may it neuer bee able (as her desertes require) enough to praise &amp; magnifye the moste noble, the moste vertuous, the moste wittye, and the mooste stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Ladye Maries Grace, daughter of the late moste puissaunte and moste victorious Kyng Henry the eyght of moste famous memorie, and moste derely beloued systur to the king our soueraigne lorde that now is, it maye neuer bee able (I saye) enough to prayse and magnifie hir Grace for takyng suche great studie, peine and trauaill, in translatyng this paraphrase of the said Erasmus vpon the gospel of Iohn at your hyghnesse speciall contemplacion, as a noum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre of right well learned men woulde bothe haue made courtesie at, and also would haue brought to wurse frame in the doyng. O how greatly maie we all glory in suche a pierlesse floure of virginitee as her Grace is? who in the middes of Courtly delices, and emiddes the enticementes of worldly vanities, hathe by her owne choice and eleccion so vertuously, and so fruictefully passed her tendre youth, that to the publique comforte and gladfull reioycing whiche at her byrth she brought to all Englande: she doeth nowe also conferre vnto thesame the vnestimable benefite of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

O vnestimable and precious fruite of maydenly studies. O noble successe of princely spending the tyme, especially in a womā. O zele of prouokyng Gods glory worthy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitee of fame and renoume. For what coulde be a more manifeste argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of myndyng the publique benefite of her countrey, what coulde bee a more euident profe of her will and desyre to dooe good to her fathers moste dere beloued subiectes, what could be a more plaine declaraciō of her most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunt purpose to promote Goddes worde, and the free grace of his gospell? then so effectually to prosecute the weorke of translatyng whiche she had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goonne, that whan she had with ouer peynfull studie and labour of wryting, cast her weake body in a grieuous and long syckenesse, yet to the intent the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Englishe people shoulde not bee defrauded of the benefite entended and ment vnto them: she committed the same weorke to Maister Frauncisce

But in the meane tyme, to what learned man maye not the sedulitee of suche a noble princesse bee a spurre and prouocacion to employe the talente of his learnyng and knowlage to the publique vse and commoditee of his countrey? To whō maye not this moste notable exaumple of so vertuous a Lady, be an occasion to shake of all sluggishenesse, and to yeld vnto the common weale of Englande some condigne fruicte of his studie and learning? To what idle loiterer maye not this moost excellent acte of a kynges daughter and the same a kynges sistur bee a shame, and reproche of negligence? To what persones (be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so ignoraunt or vnlearned) maie not this moost earnest zele of a princesse of suche highe estate, bee an effectuall prouocacion and encouragyng to haue good mynde and wyll to reade, heare, and enbrace this deuout and catholyke Paraphrase so plainly and sensibly translated, and so graciously by her offred, and (as ye would saie) put in all folkes handes to be made familiar vnto them? Besechyng therfore almighty god that it maie in the hartes of all good En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe people take no lesse place, ne weorke any other effect of godly knowleage and innocent liuing, then your highnesse in procuryng these trāslacions, and the said Ladie Maries grace on her partie also haue ment it: I shall sembleablye be a continuall peticioner to his diuine Maiestee, longe yeres to preserue bothe your estates: you, to the procuring of many such good translacions for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of simple people in Christes discipline, and her to the doing of many lyke actes for the publique vtilitee of vs al, wherby ye maye bothe of you atteygne in this worlde condigne fame and renoume with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall memorie emong men, and after this lyfe a croune of immortal glorye and blisse in heauen eternally there to raigne with Christ and his holy Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles.
