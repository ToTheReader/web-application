                 <title>The badges of Christianity. Or, A treatise of the sacraments fully declared out of the word of God : Wherein the truth it selfe is proued, the doctrine of the reformed churches maintained, and the errors of the church of Rome are euidently conuinced: by pervsing wherof the discreet reader may easily perceiue, the weak and vnstable grounds of the Roman religion, and the iust causes of our lawfull separation. Diuided into three bookes: 1. Of the sacraments in generall. 2. Of Baptisme. 3. Of the Lords Supper. Hereunto is annexed a corollarie or necessary aduertisement, shewing the intention of this present worke, opening the differences among vs about the question of the supper, discouering the idolatry and diuisions of the popish cleargy, ...

   <l>THough feare of shame false-harted men do curbe with bit of sinnes:</l>
   <l>From pressing to the Printers presse, where fame or shame begins:</l>
   <l>Yet let not vndeserued shame an harmelesse Writer fright</l>
   <l>From hardest stamp that Man can make, to bring the truth to light.</l>
   <l>The Sonne of God, which once, on earth for mans saluation dyed,</l>
   <l>Imprinted had, with Iron printes, his hands, his feete, his side.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="7"/>
Looke how he, looking on the Crowne of glorie, from the skies,</l>
   <l>Endur'd the Crosse, despised the shame, with constant setled eies:</l>
   <l>So looke to looke for io yes to come, for present paines and spites,</l>
   <l>If his example followed be on earth by earthly wightes,</l>
   <l>Both bloody Iewes and Gentels to, this bloody booke of life</l>
   <l>Did looke vpon, with scornefull lookes, as people full of strife.</l>
   <l>But glad was Thomas, when he had this holy booke in hand:</l>
   <l>And saw, and felt the print thereof, though red and rough, as sand.</l>
   <l>There might he reade his name in print when opened was the booke:</l>
   <l>Therefore he cryed, My Lord, my God, when he on it did looke.</l>
   <l>Did not the booke which <hi>Moses</hi> wrote, and sprinkled all with blood,</l>
   <l>Betoken this most worthy booke, containing all our good?</l>
   <l>Did not the prophet meane this booke, when in our Maisters name</l>
   <l>He spake of grauing in his hands the people of the same?</l>
   <l>If this be thus; If any then A commentary write</l>
   <l>Of all this Booke, from point, to point, as truth doth it indite:</l>
   <l>Who will backbite (but dogged <hi>Iewes</hi>) The writer, with their chaps?</l>
   <l>Who, (but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> woluish brood) will giue him any snaps?</l>
   <l>If any do, no more ado, but call him by his name</l>
   <l>A Dog, a Wolfe, or some such be ast: as he deserueth blame.</l>
   <l>Wherefore, my Friend, which hast describd this Book of life and truth,</l>
   <l>With treatise on the sacraments, Fit for both age and youth:</l>
   <l>Direct it to the Trinity, as three and yet but one:</l>
   <l>Thus much thou maist with reuerence, though he compare with none.</l>
   <l>Past all <hi>Compar</hi> his nature is, his worke is, and his worde:</l>
   <l>Yet doth his scripture, with himselfe comparison affoord.</l>
   <l>The Sacraments in generall, Do like wise giue vs light,</l>
   <l>The euerlasting light to see, Deuoide of any night.</l>
   <l>But specially the special two, of water, and of blood,</l>
   <l>The gospels sacramental twinnes, and our celestial food.</l>
   <l>As for the fiue, which many make, and match with these amisse,</l>
   <l>They want some parts substantial: as wel declared is.</l>
   <l>He that with euen hand and hart wil vndertake the view</l>
   <l>Of seuen sacraments shal find, that onely two are true.</l>
   <l>These three books are, like three topt ship, ful fraught with truth, great store:</l>
   <l>The Catechisme, like boat doth serue, to bring the load to shore.</l>
   <l>Let searcher search thy Marchandize, let Printer print, and sel,</l>
   <l>Let al men make the best of al: and so, in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> Farewell.</l>
