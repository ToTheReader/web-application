   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE</hi> occasion of this Relation tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane crueltie of <hi>Enoch</hi> ap <hi>Evan,</hi> ariseth not from any inclination in my owne disposition, to be pragmatical and busie in matters of writing; but from the serious apprehension of disloyalty, which some eminent persons in our State have made, touching the contempt of our Lawes, testified by the stealing
<pb facs="3"/>away of his putrified corpes; who by sentence of righteous and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Iudgement, was deemed to hang forth in the aire to the open view of all men for exemplary punishment of his bloudy facts: <hi>Till the consumption</hi> of his flesh, his nerves, and ligaments, had dissolved the composition and structure of his bones, parted them asunder, made them fall to the earth, and by <hi>Vltimate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi> returne <hi>ad materiam primam,</hi> their <hi>first matter whereof they were framed.</hi> And moreover, the false and dishonest reports touching this Malefactour, scattered abroad by many, whose profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious purity, should have yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded better fruits, have pressed mee on to this suddennesse of writing.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>And for the matter it selfe here delivered, I doe assure thee in the word of a Minister, thou hast a relation of such substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Truth, as I will maintaine against any person living upon the face of the earth. I have not delivered one word in this ensuing Treatise, which may justly offend any good Christian or honest minded man: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any shall be displeased to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mee, it is from an offence taken by himselfe, not given by mee, for <hi>GOD</hi> the searcher of my heart is my witnesse, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the integritie of mine owne conscience, that I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to my selfe herein, as the object and levell of all my aymes, <hi>The glory of his most sacred Name, the Honour of our King in the vindication of his
<pb facs="4"/>innocent Lawes, and the desire of our Churches tranquillitie and peace, now torne into pieces by wilfull Schisme, Proud Faction, and Perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Disobedience to Prudent and Peaceable government.</hi> I deliver onely in this Tract, my owne observations in matters of fact, and the dangers I conceive which may accrew to our Church and State, unlesse some whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and speedie course of wise and religious policie shall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely applied for the cure, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of such insolent persons as trouble the peace of our <hi>Sion</hi> And for the event hereof, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it, as becomes me in dutie, to the Royall wisdome of sacred Majestie in our King, and the vigilant care of those prudent, Governours, to whose godly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
<pb facs="4"/>these matters are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <hi>Ne quid Ecclesia Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti capiat,</hi> That our Church sustaine no eclipse of her glory, but gratiously display the beames of peace and splendour. For oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie and traducement, wherein I know before-hand I shall have a large share from the maligne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Schismaticall persons: let mee anticipate and prevent them, by telling them, that as <hi>Angry Curres</hi> will barke and snarle at peaceable passengers, so men of factious disposition, will speake evill, when they are not thereto provoked. And for my owne part I am resolved, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
