   <p>eache liuing thing created on earth, aswell the brutish beasts, as also fethered soules, yeldes tribute to man. The Oxe yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des his necke to the yoke, his skinne to make shooes, and his fleshe to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. The Sheepe, his carcase for the reliefe of man, his fleese to make cloth to couer our limmes, whereby we are defended from stormie Winter. The Goose giues her fethers to make shafies for defence of our countrie, her quilles to make pennes, which write lawes and statutes: whereby our Common weale is mainteined and vpholden. If this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position be found in things meere voide of reason and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, much more ought man to yeld accompt of his talent, sith God hath created him after his owne simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and likenesse, indued him with wisedome, and giuen him such preeminence, that all things on earth are vnder his subiection. The consideration whereof (my welbeloued Cousin) hath moued me at this present to penne this sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple volume, as a testimonie of the good will which I beare you: whose abilitie, had it beene answerable to good will, would haue then assuredly presented you with a iewell of farre greater value, the which, if you accept in good part, my labour hath his hire, and you shall not onely incourage mee to imploy my studie to a matter of deeper iudgement, but towardes you alwayes, during life, binde me firme and faithfull.</p>
