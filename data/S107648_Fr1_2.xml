      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T eyther is, or should be the dutie of euery man to inuent, publish, and act some thing that might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit his countrey: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which, I present to your noble, approued, and discreet iudgements, a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind, in setting forth that, which I assure my selfe (if the conclusions heerein be carefully practised) will proue most profitable to you and your posteritie for euer. The good that I doe heere intend to speake of, is an increase of wood in generall: which vpon my employment in the late Surueyes and Sales of diuers his Maiesties Copies and Woods, wherein I found la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable scarcitie, and exceeding abuses (which I feare to be vniuersally as wel ouer the Realme, as in the said particular places) I then began (as dutie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>bound me) seriously to consider of such notes which I had obserued in those seruices, as well for redresse of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors
<pb facs="3"/> as also for planting of wood, and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of spring-wood and timber for increase of timber and fuell, which I saw in most places too apparantly decay. And hauing digested these collections into some forme, I then conceiued that the publishing of them might be very beneficiall to the Realme. And the rather was I incouraged hereunto, because I perceiued such prudent care in the right noble Lord Priuy Seale the Earle of Northampton, who most freely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured himselfe to haue the seruice carefully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as well for the carriage of those whome hee employed in that affaire: as also to be respectiue of such who were any manner of waies to bee interessed in that seruice concerning those Surueyes and Sales, and also for maintenance and increase of Wood: which when I had diligently noted in that Honorable and worthy person, I then resolued to diuu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ge them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. And were it not pitie▪ nay more than time, that this worke of preseruing or surueying his Maiesties woods, being with that graue consent of such worthy Peeres so aduisedly begun, should now by inferiour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers be reiected, or not carefully cōtinued, the present necessitie being so great and markable? For if Coale should faile (as it is too apparant it beginneth to grow deere and scarce, and in many places there is none to be had) how then should we doe for this materiall of fuell? for doe we thinke that wood alone can beare the brunt to satisfie euery mans chimney? assuredly no, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were more plentifull. Then must there needs be some speedy means vsed for preuentiō of felling whole woods of timber, and grubbing vp of Copies at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb facs="3"/> to conuert them into pasture, arrable, or meadow grounds, else in short time, this waste and scarcitie will grow to a consummation of the whole: which preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must be as well the execution of the law, prouided for such abuses, committed to honest and discreet offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, by punishing or complaining of such who wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offend in this kind, as also willing minds to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and aduance this most needfull thrift of planting young trees, and sowing of their seeds (where scarce of wood is) for increase of Timber and Fuell: both which combined together, will in short time make a plentifull haruest. I write not these instructions to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any, but as well to please all, desirous that all should reape benefit hereby: as also to incourage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to take paines hereafter to collect and publish some more ample instructions concerning this subiect; wherein if I haue omitted any thing that might fully aduance this <hi>Old thrift:</hi> I craue pardon, and doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to your honorable, fauorable, and husbandlie censures, and willing minds to practise. Alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in my seruice, friendship, and true loue, as it will please you to account of him.</p>
