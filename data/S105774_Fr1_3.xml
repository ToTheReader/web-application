At what time heretofore was there euer any English manne that did the like. as well for hys Nauigation and long trauell, and GOD bee praysed for hys good successe, to the greate terror and feare of the enemie, he beeing a man of meane calling, to deale with so mightie a Monarke.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>But nowe may the enemie see what woulde come to passe, if our gracious Queene woulde bende her whole force against them, therfore great cause haue we to be thankfull to God for so gracious a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, and so prosperous and flourishing a common welth as this is, wherein we enioy, peace, welth, and tranquillitie, more aboundantly then any other Nation vnder the Sunne at this day. The Lorde long continue it for his names sake, and thus I ende, by dding thee farewell in the Lorde.</p>
