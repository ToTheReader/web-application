   <head>TO THE RIGHT <hi>Worshipfull M.

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Besech your worshippe not to mislike with me for omitting any parte of your accustomed title in this my letter, sithēs I doe it not of any contempt, but onely of conscience grounded vppon Gods worde: as who am persuaded the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giō presently authorized in the realm, and consequently your ministery ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to be so far of from Christes true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiō, as it is far from Christ, to haue his
<pb facs="3"/> Church (which after the publication of the Gospell ought,<note place="margin">Genes. 22.26.28. Psal. 2.44 75.88.144 Philip. 2.</note> according to the prophecies, to be openly spread through out the world, and her Citizēs ought to shyne in the middest of the peruerse nation,<note place="margin">Isai. 54.60 Math. 28.</note> of infideles, like starres, and to remayn gloriouse for euer in many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiōs togeather) now first (after nine hū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeres oppression as your own bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern doe confesse) to shewe it selfe abrode, and openly to be professed.</p>
   <p>So that although it could be shewed that your faith had bene alwaies in the world (as it was not) yet in that (if at all it were) it lay hydden,<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> it could not be the faith of Christes true Church, which neuer ceased to be a <hi>City built vpon a hil which can not be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. And he did sette his candel vpon a candelstick,</hi> not only to geue light for a few hundred yeres: but <hi>to geue light to all,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luc. 8.</note> that either should <hi>come into his house</hi> or, <hi>tarie in his house.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>And seing at al momentes men in diuerse countries came into Gods house by faith and baptisme,<note place="margin">Isai. 2. &amp; 62. Math. 28.</note> and seing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he is <hi>with his disciples al daies vntil the end of the world,</hi> and not only liueth, but reigneth for euer,<note place="margin">Luc. 1. regnabit.</note> that is to say, abideth gloriously and roially <hi>in the house of Iacob,</hi> which is the Church, doutlesse his Church is for euer built vpon a hil, and therefore it can not be hidden any one moment, and his light neuer can cease to shyne, to thend it may euer be true which Malachias the Prophet saied:<note place="margin">Malac. 1.</note>
      <hi>From the rising of the sonne to his going downe, my name is great among the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And yet seing Christes name is not great by them who beleue falselie, (for they must nedes also haue naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty woorkes, and so the name of God,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. Isai. 52. Rom. 2.</note> as Saint Paule saith, is rather blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med amonge the Gentiles, then glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by euil men) it remaineth, that
<pb facs="4"/> Christes name must be <hi>great among the Gentills</hi> throughe a good faith, openly geuing light by the good works of true Christians, who may thereby <hi>cause Gods name to be glorified,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> and by their <hi>good conuersation</hi> may cause the Infidels to be conuerted vnto Christ.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 2. Pet. 3.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Now for asmuch as your faith was not openly alwaies professed in many nations together, but was altogether hidden before these fifty yeres, and so hidden,<note place="margin">A Church vnder a bushel.</note> that no history or Chronicle doth make mention of any congregatiō at all professing your faith from tyme to tyme in any Cities, Townes, Villages, or priuate houses of diuerse prouinces and countries at once: nothing can be iustly said or alleaged, why you should not renounce this obscure religion of yours, which is so slaunderouse to Gods gloriouse name, and returne again to that our Churche,<note place="margin">A Church vpō a hil.</note> which stode for euer vpon the hil, and whose light was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="4"/> so dimmed, or darkened, but that the very Iewes, Turks, Saracēs, Moores, and Tartariās, knewe where we dwelt, and what we professed.</p>
   <p>I chose at this tyme to intreat with al sober Protestants the rather by your person (M. D. Parker) because I haue heard of so much good nature in your worshippe, that it was not vnlike, but he woulde voutesafe to heare what so euer should be reasonably said, specially touching Gods worde, and the practise of the primatiue Churche, of which pointes my chiefe talke shalbe at this tyme.</p>
   <p>Many men haue laboured to geue diuerse Signes and Markes of the true Church, to thintēt it being ones knowē, al other controuersies may geue place to <hi>the pillor and sure stay of truth.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> But that it may appear to them, who do not willingly stop their eares against the truth, what notable aduantage the Catholiks haue ouer and aboue the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
<pb facs="5"/> in this behalf: I wil shew the truth of our Churche to be so safe and clere, that hitherto it was not possible for the Protestants themselues to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise any such marke or signe of a true Churche, the which doth not much rather make for vs, then for them.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Gods vvord is not a suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficient mark of the true Church.</note>They teach <hi>Gods word</hi> to be the chiefe mark, whereby the true Church may be knowen, which yet can not wel be so, because the marke whereby an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing is knowen, ought it selfe to be most exactly knowen, whereas we are not agreed, what Gods woorde is. For some call onely <hi>the writen letter and the meaning thereof,</hi> Gods woorde: others thinck many things to be Gods woorde, which are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly writen, but are <hi>reuealed from God to the Church by the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apostles,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2 Heb. 8. &amp; 10. 2. Cor. 3.</note> and by the holy ghost, who hath writen <hi>Gods lawes in our harts, and there hath imprī<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>Also we are not agreed vppon the writen woorde of God, because the Protestantes doe not admitte so many bookes of the olde Testament, as the Catholikes doe. Thirdly the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of those bookes which we are agreed vppon, is altogether in question betwen vs. How then can that be a mark sufficient to shew an other thing to vs, which it self is not sufficientlie knowen of vs? All which reasons notwithstanding, the confidence of our cause is such, that I may graunt the woorde of God (what soeuer it be) to be a sufficient marke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Gods Churche may be knowen. And then I say, that euerie way Gods word standeth more on our syde, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs.</p>
   <p>For yf you meane by <hi>God worde,</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
      <note place="margin">Gods vvoorde first vvith vs.</note> the writen letter of the olde and of the newe Testament, we are before you in that behalfe: because you haue no assured Copies thereof, which were
<pb facs="6"/> not preserued by the former Christiās, whome yee call Papists, of thē you toke as your baptism so your Bible. By them not only the old and the new testamēt, but also the works of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were copied out, printed, and layed vp in libraries, ād in other places whence they came to your hands.</p>
   <p>If then the hauing of Gods woorde proue a true Churche, that is the more true Church, which had it first, special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seing we came not by it priuily, or violently, but receaued it euē at the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles hāds. For after that day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in S. Peter and S. Paule deliuered Gods word to the faithfull Romans, the Church of Rome hath alwaies kept it safe without either leesing, or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Again we beleue and acknowlege more of the Bible then you doe,<note place="margin">More of Gods vvoorde vvith vs.</note> by the bookes of <hi>Toby,</hi> of <hi>Iudith,</hi> of <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> and of the <hi>Machabees.</hi> All which we accompt
<pb facs="6"/> for Gods own word, according to the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of many auucient<note n="†" place="margin">Aug. de doct.

      </note> Fathers and councels: whereas you call them <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha,</hi> and so make them vnable to decide any controuersie about religion.</p>
   <p>Thirdly we doe not only graunt the Hebrew text of the old testament (such as may appeare vncorrupted) and the Greek text of the new testament, to be Gods word but we also acknowlege with the aūciēt Fathers, <hi>the</hi>
      <note n="†" place="margin">Iustin. in Apol. <hi>2.</hi> Ireneus li. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>25.</hi> Euseb. de praeparat. Euang. li. <hi>8.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi> Aug. ep. <hi>.8</hi>

We then haue Gods woorde in moe authentik tungs and copies, then you haue.</p>
   <p>Fourthly we preach, expound, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
      <pb facs="7"/> and translate Gods word in all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of tungs,<note place="margin">Better vse of Gods vvord.</note> better then you, because we doe these things, not only by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but also by such external vocation and commission, as may be shewed to haue sprung from the Apostles, by the lineal and ordinary succession of our bishops and priests. Whereas you can fetch no higher commission, then from the common weale, which neuer recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued authority of Christ to make priests, or to send preachers: ād yet <hi>how shal they preache,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note>
      <hi>if they be not sent?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Concerning that you reade Gods word to the people at you Church ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice tyme in the vulgar tungs,<note place="margin">Of Gods vvord in vulgare tungs.</note> it is no perfection at all on your syde. For yee lack thereby the vse of the better tungs, as of the Greek and Latin: which were sanctified on Christes crosse,<note place="margin">Luc. 23.

      <pb facs="7"/> him, as to our dreadful Lord, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing father. And who douteth, but that a lerned, a holy, and a common tung, is more honorable, then a barbarouse, a prophane, and a priuate tung?</p>
   <p>In so much, that in respect of the whole body of the Catholike Church (wherewith we specially communicate in our seruice and praiers) the vulgare tungs are much more to be accompted strange or vnknowen (which strange tungs onely S. Paule doth least regard) then the common tungs,<note place="margin">1.

   <p>Moreouer, those Countries (some of which neuer knew any better then

Thus touching the writen woorde and the vse thereof, there are many causes, why we should be in better case then the Protestants, but none at all, why we should be in worse.</p>

<pb facs="19"/> as you are now, said then, as you do now, that the Catholikes did persecute thē, and therefore that they were the true Church.</p>
   <p>And surely if you can shew, that we through pride departed frō the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which we once had oughed to you, then in dede we might be saied to persecute you.

   <p>But they were only called Catholiks, who kepte the vniuersall faith, which the Apostles had first taught,<note place="margin">Catholike</note> and which was continued alwaies in the whole Churche.

   <p>For the change thereof is of such importance, that God would his owne Son to take flesh for the working of such a weighty matter, to thēd al mē should vnderstand, that God reserueth to his owne self the appointment of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion wherwith he wilbe serued.

      <hi>Christ</hi> therefore <hi>being a priest after the order of Melchisedech,</hi> when he had proued his commission frō God the Father by diuerse notable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,<note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> in his last supper toke bread and

   </p>
   <p>This then is the publike and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sacrifice of the new testament,<note place="margin">Ireneus li. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>32.</hi> August. in Psal. <hi>33.</hi> Con. <hi>1.</hi> De ciuit.

      </note>
      <hi>the which Sacrifice</hi> (saith S. Augustine) <hi>is now spread in the whole circuit of the earth,</hi> and, <hi>it is come in place</hi> (saith he) <hi>of al the sacrifices of the old testament,</hi> and <hi>is the Sacrifice of the Churche.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And all the world doth know, that both the Greek and Latin Church hath euer vsed this blessed mystery, as the Sacrifice prophecied of by Malachy and belonging peculiarly to the Christian peple gathered out of all nations.<note place="margin">Malac. 1.</note>
   </p>
   <pb facs="30"/>
   <p>Now to thinck, that <hi>Luter and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> haue power to alter and abrogate this publike sacrifice (called now the Masse) it is to thinck, that Luther and Caluin are the same toward Christe, which Christ was toward Moyses. For that is it which Christ meaneth saying:<note place="margin">False Christes. Math. 24</note>
      <hi>False Prophets, and false Christes shal arise.</hi> Verily, because some shall come, who wil arrogate that to them selues, which no creature cā do besyde Christ the Son of God, whose proper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and honour it is, to be of power to change the state and order of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like priesthood and sacrifice in Gods Church.<note place="margin">Idolatries.</note> They then are Idolatours, who supposing <hi>Luther and Caluin</hi> to be able to abrogate the former sacrifice and maner of seruice, and to sette vp a new foorm of publike prayer, do therein make them to be fellowes with Christ himselfe. But certainly they are false brethern and false Christes.</p>
   <p>And whereas the Protestants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,

         </gap>aluin</hi> do all things according to Gods Worde (to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit now, that the one of them techeth cleane contrarie doctrine to the other) they are so much the more to be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for as Christe in verie truthe in chaunging the Law fulfilled the old fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and the old prophecies euē so they (taking Christes power vpō them) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend falsly by changing Religiō,<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> to haue their doings figured and prophecied of in the Gospell.</p>
   <p>But if there can be but one Christ, and he can be but once borne, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but once: be ye assured, these men haue no power to abrogate the Masse, or to take away the keye of our auncient Religion.</p>
   <p>If any man say that our Masse is not that in deede, which we saie it is: I answere, that as we neuer reade the Iewish Priestes to haue erred, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the substaunce of theire pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique Sacrifice (because all the people<note place="margin">Exod. 23.</note>
      <pb facs="31"/> were bound to frequent it by Gods own commandement) so it is much lesse pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that the vniuersall Churche of Christ should erre in that publike act, wherein <hi>Christ himself</hi> (saith S.

   <p>This being so, reason would that all nouelties layed a syde, men should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the old faith, and Church again.
