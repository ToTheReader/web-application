      </gap> of Sathan, that deadly and mortall foe of mankind, to tempt and assault, to bring to desperation, &amp; deuoure sinners at all times, &amp; in all places; but especially in the dayes of affliction, troubles, plagues, pestilences, and sicknesses; yea, and most of all at the hower of death, when man is at the weakest, and most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and vnable to withstand him; when mans memorie fayleth him, and his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces waxe dull, his body is tormented and feebled, his heart faynteth, his wittes decay, and euery part of his body ceasseth to performe and fulfill his due office: then, euen then I say, most vigilant, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and busie is that foule feende to vexe, trouble, disquiet, to turmoyle men, and to worke blasphemie and desperation in their heartes by laying before the eyes of their consciences al their former sinfull maner of lyuing, and vngodly conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the breach of Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and his greeuous wrath against offenders; the vnsupportable paynes, and

The consideration of these thinges, and the great negligence, carelesnesse, and contempt of prouiding remedies and phisicke in due time, against this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous disease of Desperation, hath moued mee at this present, to employ my Penne, according to that one poore talent which the Lord God hath committed vnto mee to the setting foorth of this Treatise fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, therby to arme and furnish poore ignorant Christians with some necessarie counsaile, comfort, and spirituall phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, whereby they may become the more able and readie in time of neede, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende themselues; yea, and to propell and driue backe their common enemie: the Diuell tempting and entising to the most deadly sinne of Desperation.</p>
