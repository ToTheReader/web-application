      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE GOD of peace that brought againe from the dead our Lord Iesus,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.20, 21.</note> the great Shepherd of the sheepe, through the bloud of the euerlasting Couenant, make you all perfect in all good workes, to doe his will, working in you that which is pleasant in his sight, through Iesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Though I cannot say with</hi> Paul <hi>to the Galathians,</hi> I beare you record, that if it had beene possible,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.15.</note> yee would haue plucked out your owne eyes, and haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them me: <hi>Yet, out of a taste of the singular loue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect which yee haue had vnto me for my</hi> workes sake,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5.13.</note>
      <hi>I can with good conscience greet you as the same Apostle doth the Philippians;</hi> My brethren, beloued and lon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ed for, my ioy,<note place="margin">Phil 4.1.</note> and my crowne; <hi>and</hi> doe beseech you to continue in the Lord yee beloued. <hi>Yee see that in publishing these Sermons, I doe offer my selfe vnto publike censures. In so good a cause I only</hi> desire to be found faithful,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.2, 3.</note> and then I care little to be iudged by mans iudgement: <hi>I know that some of the things which I write of, are commonly knowne:</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.12, 13, 14, 15.</note>
      <hi>yet I will not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull to put you in remembrance of what yee haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and of that truth wherein yee are alreadie established. And though I cannot say that the time is at hand, that I must lay downe this my Tabernacle, yet I thinke it meet, so long as am in it, to stirre you vp, yea and to endeuour that you may haue
<pb facs="10"/> in remembrance the secret of the Gospell euen after my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note>
      <hi>For I haue not followed deceiueable fables, but</hi> the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of godlinesse, <hi>which may helpe you with, or hold you out, a right hand of fellowship to keepe out sinne and Antichrist. I haue</hi> no dominion ouer your faith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.24.</note>
      <hi>yet am I vnder God</hi> a helper of your ioy:<note place="margin">Gal. 3.7.</note>
      <hi>In which respect</hi> yee haue runne well, <hi>and yee doe well, in that (in my weake, but, by Gods fauour, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Ministery) yee haue and doe take heed vnto the most sure word of the Prophets,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note>
      <hi>as vnto a light that shineth in a darke place,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iames 1.21.</note>
      <hi>and as to that good word of God,</hi> which is able to saue your soules.<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1.11, 12</note>
      <hi>And I desire to</hi> pray alwaies for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodnesse, and the worke of faith with power: That the name of our Lord Iesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God.<note place="margin">1 Thess. 2.19, 20</note> For what is my hope, or ioy, or crowne of reioycing? Are not euen ye in the presence of our Lord Iesus at his comming? Yea, yee are my glory and ioy. <hi>And therefore (because one desire of mine is to keepe out sinne) I will pray againe for you,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ephes. 3.14. Vers. 16.</note>
      <hi>and</hi> bow my knees vnto the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, That he would grant you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the riches of his glory, that yee may be strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his Spirit in the inner man:<note place="margin">Vers. 17.</note> That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith. <hi>Oh how vnwillingly should I say of you with the Apostle,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gal. 4.11. 1 Cor. 6.15.19.</note> I am in feare of you, lest I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on you labour in vaine. Know yee not that your bodies are the temples of the holy Ghost in you, and the members of Christ?<note place="margin">Phil. 2.1, 2.</note> If therefore there be any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of loue, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any compassion and mercie, fulfill my ioy, <hi>In thinking vpon and doing</hi> whatsoeuer things are true,<note place="margin">Philip. 4.8.</note> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer things are honest, whatsoeuer things are iust, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer things are pure, whatsoeuer things pertaine to loue,
<pb facs="10"/> whatsoeuer things are of good report, or if there be any other vertue. <hi>I know that</hi> in times past yee were foolish,<note place="margin">Titus 3.3.</note> disobedient, deceiued, seruing the lusts and diuers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, liuing in maliciousnesse and enuy, hatefull and hating one another. But it is sufficient, <hi>yea too too much for you,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.3.</note> that ye haue spent the time past of your liues after the lusts of the Gentiles, walking in wantonnesse, lusts, drunkennesse, in gluttony, drinkings, and in abominable securitie. <hi>Now therefore</hi> dearely beloued,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.11, 12.</note> abstaine from fleshly lusts which fight against the soule, and haue your conuersations honest amongst the wicked, both that they who speake euill of you, as of euill doers, may glorifie God in the day of their visitations; <hi>and also that you may assure your selues that you are</hi> in Christ by being new creatures.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17. 2 Thess. 2.7.</note>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Dearely beloued, Antichrist also and his</hi> mystery of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>hath alreadie wrought euen from the Apostles times, and is so farre growne past his height, that his raging time is come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his time is but short. Therefore,</hi> Beware of dogs,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.2.</note> beware of euill workers: <hi>For there are</hi> false teachers, which priuily,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1. Marke 8.15.</note>
      <hi>with many false glosses,</hi> bring in damnable heresies. <hi>But</hi> take heed and beware of the leauen of the Pharisies:<note place="margin">Matth. 7.16.</note> By their fruits ye shall know them.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.1.3.</note> They forbid mariage and meats by the doctrine of deuils, and serue not the Lord Iesus,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.18.</note> but their owne bellies, and with faire speech and flattering de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the hearts of the simple. <hi>They</hi> despise gouernment,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.10.</note> and feare not to speake euill of them that are in dignitie. They haue hearts exercised with couetousnesse,<note place="margin">Vers. 14. Vers. 16.</note> eyes full of adultery: tongues that speake swelling words, and boast of high matters. They are brute beasts, lead with sensualitie,<note place="margin">Vers. 12.</note> and made to be taken at the last and destroyed.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.17, 18.</note>
      <hi>But</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware lest yee be plucked away with the errour of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and fall from your owne stedfastnesse; but grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
<pb facs="11"/> brethren,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.11.</note> fare yee well, be of one minde, and liue in peace.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.15.</note> If ye bite and deuoure one another, take heed lest ye be deuoured one of another. <hi>All which that it may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be effected,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gal. 4.19.</note> (my little children of whom I haue trauelled in birth,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note>
      <hi>&amp; for whose growth I shal trauell) I beseech you</hi> obey <hi>me still, who</hi> haue the ouersight of you, <hi>in the Lord,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your selues, for <hi>I desire to</hi> watch for your soules, as <hi>one</hi> that must giue accounts, that I may doe it with ioy, and not with griefe, <hi>for that</hi> will be vnprofitable for you. <hi>Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi> my hearts desire is,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.1.</note>
      <hi>that you may</hi> be saued; <hi>and that to this end I may still pray for you, and shew you the good way; therefore</hi> I humbly pray the very God of peace to sanctifie you throughout,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12.23. 1 Thess. 5.23.</note>
      <hi>and</hi> that your whole spirits, and soules, and bodies, may be kept blamelesse vnto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ. <hi>So prayeth he, who desireth that his ministerie amongst you may be a sauour of life vnto life, euen your euer-louing Shepherd and Watch-man,</hi>
