   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Eare Christian Reader, understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this Sermon hath done good to many, that either heard it, or read some notes of it; and that if it were published, with some Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix added, proving our Ceremonies to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the reasons and testimonies of other learned, reverend and pious men, it would do much good to many more: I have taken the pains to adde such an Appendix: Wherein I might have alledged reasons out of many other worthy Authours (Archbish. <hi>Whitgifts <hi>books against</hi> M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Cartwright, D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Bridges, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Richard Hooker, D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Covel, D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Spark, D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Gardiner, D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Powell, D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Collins, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Francis Mason, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Ambrose Fisher,</hi> and others:) But because I write specially to such younger and poorer mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as either are not able or willing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase many costly books of this subject, or not at leisure to reade them; I have thought best to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre such Readers (if they be not satisfied with my short Abstract) specially to three of the last (who have read and weighed all which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Authours have written, with the replies and answers) to wit, our Reverend Bishop <hi>Mortons</hi>
      <pb facs="42"/>Defence, printed <hi>anno 1618. D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Burges</hi> his answer to the replie of a namelesse Authour (who laboured to confute, or elude <hi>B. Mortons</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) printed <hi>anno 1631.</hi> and <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. John Sprint</hi> his <hi>Cassander Anglicus,</hi> printed <hi>anno 1618.</hi> These (and, I hope, the least, shortest, or lowest prized of these) will satisfie any reasonable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if he turn in them to the larger handling of the points, by my allegations. Their reasons are occasionally dispersed through their whole books: but I have here collected and referred them to certain heads (or chapters) for the Readers better ease in finding them, and judgement in weighing them; often contracting their larger discourses in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fewer words, where they may be abbreviated; and onely using their words at length where they are more necessary and urgent, then shorter could be.</p>
   <p>These few short chapters (I hope) will passe, and be read, where greater volumes will not. And this I have done simply and plainly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect of gaining any credit or applause of learning to my self, but onely of their love, and out of an earnest desire to draw them with a good Conscience, willingly and cheerfully to do that, which otherwise of necessitie they must do.</p>
