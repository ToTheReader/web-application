   <head type="sub">¶The ryght &amp; iust administracyon of the lawes that God gaue vnto Moses and vnto Iosua: the testimonye of faythfulnes that God gaue of Dauid: the plenteous abundaunce of wysdome that God gaue vnto Salomon: the lucky and prosperous age with the multiplicacyon of sede whiche God gaue vnto Abraham and Sara his wyfe, be geuē vnto you most gracyous Prynce, with your dearest iust wyfe, and most vertuous Pryncesse, Quene Anne, Amen.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Aiphas beynge bysshope of that yeare, lyke a blynde prophete (not vnderstandyng what he sayd) prophecied, that it was better to put Christ vnto death, then that all the people shulde perysshe:<note place="margin">Io. 11. c</note> he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, that Christ was an heretike, a deceauer of the people, &amp; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer of the lawe, and that it was better therfore to put Christ vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to death, thā to suffre hym for to lyue, and to deceaue the people. &amp;c. where in very dede Christ was the true prophete, the true Messias, and the onely true Sauiour of the worlde, sent of his heauenly father to suffre the moste cruell, most shamefull, and most necessary death for our redempcyon: accordyng to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge of the prophecie truely vnderstonde.</p>
   <p>Euen after the same maner y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> blynde bysshoppe of Rome, (that blynde Baalam I saye) not vnderstondynge what he dyd, gaue vnto your grace this tytle: <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the fayth,</hi> onely bycause your hyghnes suffred your bysshoppes to burne Gods worde the rote of fayth, and to persecute the louers and mynisters of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same. where in very dede the blynde bysshoppe (though he knewe not what he dyd) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied, that by the ryghteous admynistracyon and contynuall diligence of youre grace, the fayth shulde so be defended, that Gods worde the mother of Fayth with the frutes therof, shulde haue his fre course thorowe out all Christendome, but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyally in your realme.</p>
   <p>Yf your hyghnesse now of your pryncely benignite wyll pardon me to compare these two bysshoppes (I meane bysshoppe Caiphas and the bysshoppe of Rome) &amp; theyr prophecies together, I doute not but we shal fynde them agree lyke brethren, though the one be a Iewe and the other a counterfayre Christian. Fyrst, Caiphas prophecied that it was better to put Christ vnto death, then that the people shulde perysshe. The bysshoppe of Rome also, not knowynge what he prophecied, gaue youre grace this tytle: <hi>Defendour of the fayth.</hi> The trueth of both these prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is of the holy goost (as was Baalams prophecie) though they that spake thē, knewe not what they sayd. The trueth of Caiphas prophecie is, that it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for mans saluacyon, that Christ by his death shulde ouercome death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme vs. And the trueth of oure Baalams prophecie is,<note place="margin">Nume. 24. c.</note> y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> your grace in very dede shulde defende the Fayth, Yee euen the true fayth of Christ, no dreames, no fables, no heresie, no papisticall inuencions, but the vncorrupte fayth of Gods most holy worde, which to set forth (praysed be the goodnes of God, and increace youre gracy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous purpose) your hyghnes with youre most honorable councell, applyeth all his studye and endeuoure.</p>
   <p>These two blynde bysshopes now agree in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vnderstādyng of theyr prophecies: for Caiphas taketh Christ for an heretike, Oure Balaā taketh the worde of Christ for heresie. Caiphas iudgeth it to be a good dede to put Christ vnto death, that he
<pb facs="3"/>
shulde not deceaue the people. Oure Balaam calleth defendynge of the fayth, the suppressyng, kepyng secrete, and burnyng of the worde of fayth: lest the lyght there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of shulde vtter his darknes: lest his owne Decretales &amp; Decrees, his owne lawes and constitucions, his owne statutes and inuencions shulde come to none effecte: lest his intollerable exactions and vsurpacions shulde lose theyr strengthe: lest it shulde be knowen what a thefe and murtherer he is in the cause of Christ, and how haynous a traytoure to God and man in defraudynge all Christen kynges &amp; pryn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces of theyr due obedience: lest we youre graces subiectes shulde haue eyes in the worde of God, at the last to spye out his crafty conueyaūce and iuglynges: and lest men shulde se, how sore he and his false Apostles haue deceaued all Christendome, specyally youre noble realme of Englonde.</p>
   <p>Thus your grace seyth how brotherly the Iewysh bysshoppe and oure Balaam agree together, not onely in myter and outwarde appearaunce: but as the one per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>secuted the Lorde Iesus in his owne persone, so doth the other persecute his worde and resysteth his holy ordynaunce in the auctorite of his anoynted kynges. For so moche nowe as the worde of God is the onely trueth that dryueth awaye all lyes, and discloseth all iuglyng and disceate, therfore is oure Balaam of Rome so lothe that the scripture shulde be knowē in the mother tonge: lest yf kynges and prynces (specially aboue all other) were exercysed therin, they shulde reclame and chalenge agayne theyr due auctorite, which he falsely hath vsurped so many yeres, and so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">

Therfore were it more to the mayntenaunce of Antichristes kyngdome, that the worlde were styll in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce and blyndnes, and that the scripture shulde neuer come to lyghte.
