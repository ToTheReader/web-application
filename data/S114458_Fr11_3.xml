   <head>THE AVTHOR TO THE Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>BY a <hi>Reformed Catholike,</hi> I vnderstand any one that holdes the same necessarie beads of religion with the Romane Church: yet so, as he pares off and reiects all errours in doctrine whereby the said religion is corrupted. Howe this may be done, I haue begun to make some little declaration in this small Treatise: the intent whereof is to shewe how neere wee may come to the present Church of Rome in sundrie points of religion: and wherein we must for euer dissent.</p>
   <p>My purpose in penning this small discourse is threefolde. The first is, to confute all such Politikes as hold and maintaine, that our religion, and that of the Romane Church differ not in substance, and consequently that they may be reconciled: yet my meaning is not here to condemne any Pacification that tends to perswade the Romane Church to our religion. The second is, that the Papists which thinke so basely of our religion, may be wonne to a better liking of it: when they shall see howe neere we come vnto them in sundrie points. The third, that the common protestant might in some part see and conceiue the point of difference betweene vs and the Church of Rome: and know in what manner and how farre forth, we condemne the opinions of the said Church.</p>
   <p>I craue pardon for the order which I vse, in handling the seuerall points. For I haue set them downe one by one, as they came to mind, not respecting the lawes of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. If any Papist shall say that I haue not alleadged their opinions aright, I answer, that their bookes be at hand, and I can iustifie what I haue saide.</p>
   <p>Thus crauing thine acceptation of this my paines, and wishing vnto thee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of knowledge and loue of pure and sound religion, I take my leaue and make an ende.</p>
