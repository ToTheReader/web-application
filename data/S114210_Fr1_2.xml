      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ALOMON that</hi> pereles prince of prudēce (right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppfull) amonge his pithye Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles perswading to the searchīg forth of wisdom &amp; her fruits, sayeth: The path of the Righteous shineth as the light, that is euer brighter &amp; brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vnto the perfect daye: But the waye of the vngodlye is as the darcknesse, they knowe not where they fall. Doubtlesse as euery Age hath eyther had his integritie or imperfection, wherein aswel the felicitie, as indempnitie of humane estate hath appeared, more or lesse, to be praysed for the worthynesse, or pitied for the wretchednesse: So is it a true testimonye of the inestimable loue of Godlent towardes those which beinge duely directed in the path of perfection doe nothinge digresse there from, but persist constant vnto the ende, rather encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe then empairing their felicitie: And on the other part, where suche as eyther reiecte their calling, or withstande the wisedome of God, doe walcke in bywayes, and wander in wilful darcknesse. Who hath not seene that the indignation of God hath bene euidentlye poured vppon them, scattringe them, &amp; ouerthrowing theym euen in their own wickednes? the profe whereof approcheth euen vntill these present dayes, in suche sorte among Christians, that if <hi>Heraclitus</hi> the heathen phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher were now agayne liuing, and should but once step out at his dores, to view the state and condicion of the tyme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent (wheras in his dayes he wept but hy fittes, to see the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie of that age) I verely suppose he would now continually
<pb facs="3"/>
shede teares abundantly without stinting, to see the ruinous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Christianitie in this later age: and I doubt also, if De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus were again liuing, &amp; did behold the doinges of bothe sortes of people in the world, whether he wold laughe for ioye in contemplating of the prosperous estate of the best christiās, or deride the froward fortune of the most wicked &amp; vngodly at this day. Albeit throughout Christendom now, what king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, coūtrie or cōmon weale appeareth altogether so peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and prosperous, which hath not bene lately, or is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently encōbred with obscuritie and absurditie of lyfe, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? as some walking in the righteous path, haue their lighte emblemished by others of the house of Iniquitie: some faine would walke the true path, and with ciuil dissention are sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated frō their godly purposes. But the greater part no doubt, refusing light for dirknesse, do so nuzzle thēselues in wicked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse, that they laboure with malignitie, to worcke a confused Chaos of christianitie in general. In the midst of whom, behold (right Worshipful) greately to thadmiration of the rest, about vs▪ but more to our priuate consolacion, and most of all to the glory of thimmortal God, the vnspeakeable loue and eternall good grace of his blessing, appeareth in most bright beames of his blisful bountie, ouershadowing this our natiue countrie of England, with far more superabundant felicities, then many other naciōs: namely by so lōg, peaceable &amp; prosperous course of Christes Gospell, that infallible lampe of light, directed and protected by so pereles &amp; precious a prīcesse, so godly &amp; grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a gouernesse, our most christian &amp; dearest soueraigne La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Quene Elizabeth, assisted with so many christal starres of stately light vnder her, garnishing and sauegarding the good gouernment of this her maiesties Realme &amp; dominions of the same, with most holsome, godly, &amp; politique lawes, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutiōs, for the cōtinual cōseruatiō of the publique weale ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vniuersally, free frō all priuate preiudice and publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation.

Verely when I the meanest member of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes, reuolue this benefite in my mynde, and see how far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the expectation and desertes of man, the prouidence of God dealeth with vs, thus stil preseruing vs, &amp; sufferig others to quayle in their froward fortunes &amp; calamities: beinge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly lightened with a certayn secret consolation in the one respect, &amp; outwardly with painful pen pitying &amp; deploring the state of the other: As duty chiefly byndeth me, I haue at this presēt enforced my studye (thoughe as a <hi>Pigmeian</hi> in simple power) to practise somewhat with <hi>Hercules,</hi> or as otherwise desirous to trauel with <hi>Vlisses,</hi> to win (albeit with wearines) somwhat if it were possible by any good meanes, to benefit this bulwarke of beatitude (this my natiue coūtry I mean) which with such multitude of worthy practisioners notwithstanding, is alreadye made famous, yet ceassed I not with <hi>Sysiphus</hi> to roule the stone, but in such penury of power as, <hi>Architas</hi> the Philosopher attributinge to be the appropriate discommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to dexteritie of witte, which I denie to be remaynīg in me, I haue hazarded my pore hap in such simple hādiworke (as I could, though not so wel as I would) in translating out of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine into English, nine Bookes of the Godly, reuerend and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>FRANCIS PATRICIVS</hi> Bishoppe of <hi>Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> in Italie: whose workes in the worthines thereof reuiuinge the aucthor, deade three score yeares agoe and vpwardes, were in the Latine tongue by him left &amp; intituled by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Commentaries of the institution, state, and gouernmēt of a commō Weale.

Whiche when I had obtayned, euen then bethinkinge mee on whō I might best bestow the benefite of this my simple trauel: beyonde the desertes of all others, consideringe with my selfe the manifeste benefites whiche I haue receyued from tyme to tyme these twelue yeares at your worshippes bountiful hands: I deemed my selfe a debter euen in dutie to dedicate the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me vnto you, as a testimonie of my thanckefull, seruisable, &amp; well wishinge hart towardes you, as a pledge of the faythefull zeale that I beare to this famous Cittye of London, whereof you are an auncient Magistrate, and I your poore seruaunt a simple member of the same: and consequentlye, as an earneste token of my vnfayned good will and true meaninge towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des this my natiue country.
