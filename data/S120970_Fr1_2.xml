   <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
EDWARD, Lord Denny,
Baron of Waltham.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas (right noble Lord) I haue
beene much, and am daily called
vpon for the performance of my
promise in my <hi>Grammar-schoole,</hi>
concerning the Grāmaticall tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating
of our lower schoole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and that by those who
haue made due triall, and found by good experience
the benefit of such like translations; I haue presumed,
to send forth vnto them this <hi>Essay,</hi> vnder your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
patronage, not onely for your Lordships most
honourable affection to some vnto whom God hath
very neerly linked mee, and your vndeserued fauour
vnto my selfe, but more specially for your singular
curtesie, and desire of the aduancement of all good
learning, which beeing conioyned doe so-much grace
true Nobility. The rather also haue I done this, for
that full assurance which God hath giuen mee, of a
rich blessing to accompany the right vse of these tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations
<pb facs="3"/>
for the generall good of schooles. And first,
for all the ruder places of the Land, wherein there is
not any thing vsually to be found, which may afford
the least content or comfort to parents, children, or
any other. Chiefly, for the poore ignorant countries
of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Wales;</hi> of the good whereof wee ought
to be carefull aswell as of our owne: vnto which I
haue principally bent my thoughts in all my Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical-translations
of our inferiour classicall schoole-authors.
For that as in all such places, so especially in
those barbarous countries, the hope of the Church of
God is to comp rimarily out of the grammar-schools,
by reducing them first vnto ciuility thorough the
meanes of schooles of good learning planted amongst
them in euery quarter;<note place="marg2">Adde, quod ingenuas di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicisse fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter artes, Emollit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, nec sinit esse feros. <hi>Ouid.</hi>
      </note> wherby their sauage and wilde
conditions may be changed into more humanity; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the right iudgement of our <hi>Pöet,</hi> which
the experience of all ages hath confirmed.</p>
   <p>To which purpose, what can be imagined to bee
more effectual, then if together with the Latine tongue
they shall attaine withall vnto our owne Language,
and both get and keepe the Latine farre more easily
and surely in each respect, by the meanes of these tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations,
without any inconuenience. Yet haue I not
so writtten them for our ruder places alone, but that
euen our head Grammar-schooles may sundry waies
receiue their benefit by them, and make their profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vse of them for their great furtherance for Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
true sense and meaning of the Authors, propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
purity of stile, and variety of phrase, both in our
owne and the Latine tongue, &amp; in many other things;
especially, when the Lord shall bee pleased that they
<pb facs="3"/>
may be brought to that perfection, which we hope &amp;
pray for, daily labouring and striuing thereunto. As
for euills and inconueniences of such Grammaticall
translations surmised by some who neuer saw any true
triall of them, nor euer considered of them aright,
what can they be? when the schollars that vse them
are caused to seeke out according to their rules, and to
render a reason euen of euery word why it must be so,
&amp; not otherwise. But for all imagined euils by such like
translations, I haue fully answered in my <hi>Ludus lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius,</hi>
in the eight chapter, and in my other translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and haue moreouer there giuen directions for the
right vse of them; as I shall heere also more fully in
the <hi>Preface to the Reader,</hi> and for the benefit hereof.
Concerning the matter of this booke, I need not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it vnto your Lordship, or vnto any other: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
as I can neuer sufficiently admire the diuine wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
(that I may so speake) of <hi>Tully</hi> in his <hi>Offices,</hi> in
prescribing most morall duties amongst men, as if he
had been directed by the sacred Scriptures; so nor here
the rare vnderstanding of this our <hi>Poet,</hi> in setting forth
vnto vs the creation in that wonderfull manner, and so
alluding to the Flood, as if he had seen and read that
part of holy story in <hi>Genesis.</hi> Also for the Latine and
stile vsed in it, who knoweth not, that as in all <hi>Ouids</hi>
works, so chiefly in his <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> his singular wit
and eloquence doe appeare: that wee may truely say,
that neuer heathen <hi>Poet</hi> wrote more sweetly in such
an easie and flowing veine, than hee in this.</p>
   <p>Thus desiring through the assistance of our blessed
God to creep forward by little and little in accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="4"/>
my promised seruice to our Grammar-schooles,
which I haue so much longed for, &amp; wherein he hath
beene hitherto shewing his power in my weakenesse,
and is still with me graciously, humbly crauing pardon
I commend your Lordshippe with your honourable
and worthy Lady vnto his heauenly Maiesty, who
looketh not as man, but accepteth the vpright hart,
and the labour according vnto the same, and rest</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your Honours in all
Christian affection
and seruice,
I. B.</signed>
