      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Obilitie is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious gift, whiche so glittereth in the eyes of al men: that there is no one corporall thyng in this worlde, wherof we make a greater accompt. For so is it esteemed of all, desired of all, and reuerenced of al. Vertue, saith <hi>TVLLY,</hi> and before him <hi>PLATO,</hi> if it might be seene
<pb facs="3"/>
with our bodely eyes: doubtlesse it woulde procure merueilous loue, and good likynge vnto it self, the shew therof would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare so faier, and amiable.</p>
   <p>The vniting of which two most noble graces, with al other fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of Nature, &amp; Fortune with in your person, right hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and my very good Lord, hath so bent my iudgement, and brought me into such likyng, &amp; admiration therof that I haue rested no smale time, not only not satisfied in being one of the admiratours: but also desierus to be one of the participatours of those your honours most lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dispositions, wherunto I do
<pb facs="3"/>
now hūbly submit my selfe. And in token of my dutiful meaning herein: am so hardi, as to presēt your honour with this simple traueyle, which I so terme, in respect of my paines in transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng the same. Howbeit I am perswaded, that it cost M. Lhuyd, who first, and not longe since wroate the same in Latin, no smale labour, and industry in the gatheryng, and pennyng.</p>
   <p>Regarding your honour to be amongst therest: a very fit pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone for it, in consideration, that beynge, as yet, but in your flower, and tender age, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally hoped, and accompted of in time, to become the chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

stay of this your common welth, and country: you woulde receaue into your salf tuition, the writen name, and descriptiō of that Britayne, whiche, as it is in part your natiue soyle: so your duty biddeth you to defend and mantayne it. Here on, when your hono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>r shalbe at lea sure to looke, bestowynge suche regard as you are accustomed to doo on bookes of Geographie, Histories, and other good ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge, wherin I am priuy your honour taketh singular delight: I doubt not, but you shall haue cause, to iudge your time very well applied. And so much the rather, for that in the studie of
<pb facs="4"/>
Geographie, it is expediēt first to know exactly the situation of our owne home, where wee a bide, before that wee shalbe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to iudge how other countries doo lie vnto vs, which are farre distant from vs, besides that it were a foule shame to be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue of the state of forreyne landes, and to be ignorant of our owne. As your honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge already perfectly instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: is not now to learne at my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="5"/>
same: shall neuer cease to pray to God, that he would alwayes direct you in the commendable race of vertue, and learnynge which you haue begun, augment your honour with many degrees and in the end: reward you with immortall felicitie.</p>
