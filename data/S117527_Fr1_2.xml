   <head>TO THE HONORA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE LORDES OF HER MAIESTIES PREEVIE COVNCELL.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>INDINGE this epistle of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of Englande, divulged in diuers foraine languages, Right honorable: I vvas moued bothe to translate it to my countrye men, vvhome properlye it concernethe: &amp; to directe it to your Lordships, to vvhome principallye it appertaineth. My entent herein vvas simple and plaine: First to procure good mens prayers, by disclosinge our necessities, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, to moue your honours at lenght, (if it might bee,) to some fauorable &amp; mercifull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of our calamities: vvhiche perhaps in some parte are more particulerlye declared in this discourse, then euerie one of your honours hathe ether knovvē or cōsidered of heretofore.</p>
   <p>For albeit vve are not ignorant, that our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and persecutions do passe vppon vs, bothe in name &amp; authoritie as from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships: yet knovv vve also, that you are not alvva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes precuie to euerye our particuler agreeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and hard vsage, nor if you vvere, (beinge vvyse and honorable) vvoulde allovve of the same.</p>
   <p>VVherefore seinge the treatise follovvinge
<pb facs="3"/>
ys vvriten by a man, bo the of greate modestie, as appeareth, by his style, and also of good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in Englishe matters past, as it maye seme by the particulers by him alleaged: I doe most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye beseeche your honours, to lend the labour of readinge ouer the same, and to consider in your ovvne cōsciences, before the dreadfull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of our lord and Sauyour, to vvhose iustice bothe you and vve remaine accountable for our doinges in this lyfe, vvhether the sufferinges of Catholiques heere recited, deserue complaint of our syde and of your honours parte, considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or no. It is a lavvfull and allovvable refuge deliuered vs by nature her selfe, to mourne and bevvayle in time of affliction, and to barre vs of this, ether by offence or punishement, vvere as harde as to prohibite the sicke man to grone, or the childe to pule vvhiche is greevouslye bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. If vve grone vvithout greefe, or complayne vvithout cause: vve are vvnvvorthye of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and deserue no redresse: but if our case be suche, as it moueth admiration to as manie as heare it, and no small horror to them vvhiche consider it: vve hope your Lordships, beinge our borne peeres and Nobles of our nation, vvil not alvvayes beare your selues more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionles tovvards our miseries, then straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers vvho haue lesse cause in nature to affecte vs.</p>
   <p>Enter in (my good Lordes) I beseche you on my knees even for his sake of vvhome you also muste one daye craue mercye, enter in (I say) but to some small cogitation, vvhat you do: to vvhome: for vvhat cause to vvhat ende.</p>
   <p>You persecute heauylye, and that in suche
<pb facs="3"/>
measure as the lyke hathe scarse ben mentioned in Christianitie before, albeit in some pointes <note place="margin">Vvhat per secutiō Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholiques suffer.</note> more couertlye then some other did. And as for the disciplyne of the Catholique Churche, vvhiche is commonlye accustomed to be laied againste vs, vvhereby she punishethe nevv fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled deuisers, and obstinate bringers in of nevv religion, it hathe no comparison at all vvithe this of yours: for first, that disciplyne is olde and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and allovved by your ovvne practice of burninge other sectaries then of the parte of Cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uine. VVhereby it follovvethe, that our Churche hauinge condemned as orderlie Iohn Calvine and his follovvers, in her late generall and most learned Councell, as she hathe donne other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries executed by your selues: yf she punishe also Calvinistes amonge other sectaries: she is no more to be blamed for the same in indifferē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of reason, then your parte for burninge A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptistes familians or the lyke.</p>
   <p>Secondlye if vve compare the procedinges of Catholiques to protestantes generallie, or of Englishe Catholiques, tovvardes them of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins parte in Queene Maries tyme, (for that is <note place="margin">The cōpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of this perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution to that in Queene Maryes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</note> most of all brought and vrged against vs:) vve shall finde that in all respectes, this far to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounte and to ouer reache that, and to be bothe greater, and incomparablye more greuouse.</p>
   <p>For first ether fevv or none vvere tovvched then, but suche as vvere ether obstinate, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouse, or vvilfull to intrude them selues: and hovve infinite manie vvere tollerated, and vvin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cked at, although they vvere knovven, some of your honours (I thinke) vvill not denie to geue
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
particuler testimonye. Secondlie they vvhiche vvere complained of, and attached, vvere ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye dealt vvithall, disputed vvithe at large bothe publiquelye and priuatelye, made to see their vveaknes, though not to cōfesse the same: and if sentence passed against them for obstinacie, yet vvas their execution, vvithe all fauorable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, vvhiche the lavve did permit, and mitiga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of their paines vvithe shorte dispathe: the contrarie of all vvhiche is vsed tovvards vs. And as for tormentinge and rackinge and prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge their frinds from sustaininge them, vvithe terrour to all those vvhiche shoulde bodilye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue their pouertie: I thinke our aduersaries vvill not once charge vs vvithe it. It is not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized amongest vs, vppon the greatest hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques that euer vvere: God for bid that it shoulde, it is to to cruell for Christian natures. VVe are <note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note> commaunded by our religion, to feede the hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>grie, <note place="margin">Esa. 58.</note> as Christ him selfe, and muche more, not to barr them that vvoulde geue releefe, vvhen vve vvill not. Finallye, if vve confer numbers to numbers, men to men, prisons to prisons, vsage to vsage, there is no comparison. <note place="margin">Differēces betvvixt the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed prote<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stantes and Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</note>
   </p>
   <p>And yet (good Lorde) vvhat kyn or liknes is there in the matter? they vvere punished by an auncient generall lavve, for brynginge in of nevv opinions, neuer hard of in England befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and condemned by the highe Consistorie and parlament of Christiandome, gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the same purpose. Vve are persecuted by nevv nationall Statutes, for holdinge the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient faithe of Christianitie, and onelie religion of our forefathers in England, vvithout either
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>
tryall or publique disputation in our doctrine. They dissented not onlie from vs, but also from the first beginners of their ovvne side, and vvere <note place="margin">By Luther: ar. 28. cont. Louā. to. 2. Vvitten. fo. 503. also by the Edict of the prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces of mās<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filde anno 1560. and by others.</note> solemlye condemned for heretiques by the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. but no suche matter can be saied of vs. They agreed not amongest them selues vppon the pointes of anie one relygion, but eche man as he had receaued of some particuler teacher. So be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge asked (for Example sake) of the number of Sacramentes: <note n="a" place="margin">He holde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>th three in apolog. confes. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. cap. de sacra. And fovver in editione vl. loco. cō.</note> some helde tvvo, vvithe Caluini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, some three or fovver vvithe Melancthō.

If they vvere asked of holy orders: one vvoulde deny it to be a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament vvith Luther and Melancthon in one place, and an other vvoulde holde it a trevv sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament vvithe Melancthon in an <note n="e" place="margin">in edi: vl: locorū cō.</note> other place. Some other vvoulde holde it an vnordinarie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament vvithe <note n="f" place="margin">li: 4: c: 14:</note> Caluine, and thus as sheepe brought ovvt of their folde, and left amazed in the brode filde, not knovvinge vvhat vvaye or pathe to take, they stood giddie in their ovvne opinions, and yet vvith obstinacye euerie man to dye in the same: but vve stand all in one fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the consonant to it selfe in euerie point, not deuised by our selues, but left vnto vs by the generall consent of all antiquitie in Christian dome, and yet are vve more afflicted for the
<pb facs="5"/>
same, then if vve vvere heretiques or deuisers of anie nevv religion.</p>
   <p>The persons punished by your honours are <note place="margin">The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</note> of your ovvne bloud, and nation, borne subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes of the lande, and commonlye of suche lyfe and conuersation, as are not vvorst lyked in the places vvhere they dvvell: of quiet and ciuill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauyour most readie bothe vvithe lyfe &amp; goods to serue their Princesse, and your honours, vvith all devvtifull and faithfull good vvill. They nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deale nor practise agaynst the state abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, nor offer iniuries to their neighbours at home. But are most readye and vvillinge to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>curre vvithe your Lordships, for the preseruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge theyr Countrye in peace and quiet, eche man <note place="margin">The cause of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> accordinge to his povver &amp; callinge. The onlie cause of their molestation, is their conscience in religion, vvhiche beinge setled vppon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible grounds, as it semethe to them, is not in their povver to alter at their pleasure, neither is any persecution in the vvorde, able to change the same, but rather confirmethe it more &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, bringinge alvvaies an argument vvithe it, of lacke of truthe in the persecutor, vvhiche see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kethe to supply by externall terror the thynge he is not able to proue by argument.</p>
   <p>The ende therfore vvhiche your Lordships <note place="margin">The ende of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</note> pretende by this rigourouse course of austeritie to vvitt, to bringe men to conformitie in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion, can neuer doubtles take effect by this meanes, but must nedes make greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, for the reasons by me declared befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. And if your honoure shoulde vppon terrour bringe any fraile man to conforme him selfe
<pb facs="5"/>
against his conscience, in suche externall actes, as you require: yet your vvisdomes can not but consider, that he is neuer the nearer gotten for this, but rather in his harte muche farther of then before, hauinge vvounded his sovvle and conscience vppon compulsion, vvhiche lyinge greuouse and festeringe vvith in his breast, must needes often put him in mynde of the iniurye receaued, and so more detest the thynge done, then before. VVherfore seinge there is nothinge gotten to your Lordships entent, by this mans dissimulation, but muche lost often tymes vnto him selfe, euen as muche as the price of his soule for doinge against his conscience and iudgemēt, vvherby he must be tried at the latter daye: the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is no cause ether in respect of pollicie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, vvhich maie persvvade vs, that your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours vvill alvvayes holde this heauie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame rase tvvardes vs.</p>
   <p>And because I fall into the mention here of polycie, vvherunto I knovve your honours, (as <note place="margin">Polycie.</note> very vvise,) to haue a speciall eye and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler regarde, albeit I presume not to pretende a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of that profounde iudgement, vvhiche your honorable vvisedomes by nature and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge practise haue attained in the same: yet to say that, vvhich common reason layethe oppen to euerye meane vnderstandinge: it appearethe no vvaie to impeache polycie (if respect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science vvere laide a side) to proceede some vvhat mylder vvithe the Catholique parte in Englande.</p>
   <p>I vvill not talke of intrinsecall and speciall <note place="margin">by M: I: hovvlet: &amp; M: D: Allen</note> pointes, mentioned heretofore by some other,
<pb n="10" facs="6"/>
&amp; easie to be considered of by your Lordships, as the counterpesinge of other sectes, and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous factions, grovvinge and confirminge by the quiet they enioye through our onlie mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations. I vvill speake onlie of the nature of our Catholique religion, vvhiche as it vvas first plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ovvt by the most highe vvisedome of God him selfe, that is, by his Sonne our Sauiour, and founded by them vvhiche immediatlye recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their spirite from him, that is, by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and disciples: so standeth it substantiallie, vvith all right vvisedome and polycie,) beinge giftes of God and litle sparkles of his infinite vvisedome) and establisheth the kingdomes vvherein it is receaued and executed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, in all honour, peace, tranquilitie and vveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, as may appeare by the longe continuance of other Realmes Catholique abrode, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie by our ovvne, vvhiche hathe continued from the beginninge of her conuersion, for the space of more then a Thovvsande yeres, in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te prosperitie, riches, and renovvne by the same. Vvhereas in the meane space, diuers greate kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gdomes, states, and principalities, haue ben ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throvven by the occasion of heresie and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe this religion, as Asia, Greece, Egypt, Affrica, Hungarie, and the like: and vvhat vvill finallie become of diuers other countryes neere vnto vs and as yet lyinge vnder the tryall of Gods han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, though alreadie greately rased, spoyled, and impouerished, vve can not tell.</p>
   <p>And the reason of these different effectes <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rēt effectes of heresie and Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lique reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to vv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge the vveale pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique.</note> in heresye and in the Catholique religion, besy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the particuler prouidence of God, stande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
<pb n="11" facs="6"/>
principallie in this one pointe, that vve ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue a certayne and sure meane to kepe vnitie and consent thorovvgh ovvt the vvhole, by vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge scriptures accordinge to the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our forefathers from tyme to tyme, and by obeyinge the determination of one Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me pastor, vvith the generall Councells of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian prelates, in all matter of stryfe that may fall ovvt. VVheras the heretique in the cōtrarye parte, obevinge no pastor, but at his pleasure, nor receauinge anie mans exposition of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture but his ovvne, must nedes rayse and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne much contrarietie of opinions, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlye muche deuision of people by the same: and then hauinge no place to rest, nor vvaye to end (for generall Councell or pastor he vvil not heare), also makinge the temporall prince hed of all, vvhiche often tymes is a childe, and may easelie be impelled to varietie of humours: must needes make greate innouations, vvhiche alvva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies are greate hazardes to kingedomes and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. And this in generall is betvvixt our religion and others tovvchinge the matter of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvealthe.</p>
   <p>But novv, if vve looke into certayne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer <note place="margin">Particuler differences bettvvixt Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant reli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gion, for maintenan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce &amp; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the cōmon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vvealthe.</note> commodities and helpes vvhich our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion bringeth vnto a common vvealthe, and vvhiche the religiō of our aduersaries impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethe and ouerthrovveth: vve shall easelie, see that permission of the Catholique, can not any vvay preiudicate the vvealepublique of any state. And for examples sake, vve vvill make our comparison in Englande it selfe, vvhere the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise and effect of bothe religiōs haue byn novv
<pb facs="7"/>
experienced, and dyuers men yet alyue, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue seene and proued the consequence of bothe, and can the easyer geeue iudgement of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.</p>
   <p>First therfore, our religion teachethe actuall restitution of all goods vvhat so euer, ether <note place="margin">1. Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> vvrōgfullye or deceatfullye gotten, or taken by might or iniurye. And it teachethe this restitutiō in suche seuere manner, as no priest may absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue anie man from his sinnes duringe his lyfe, nor admitt him to any Sacrament, no nor at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame pointe of deathe it selfe, (vvhere not vvithstandinge all other matters are released) except he be content to make actuall restitution (accordinge to his abilitie) to the partie iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed: nether can anye mortall povver, or prelate of the Churche, dispense in this point, vvhere the vvill of restitution is not, but that suche a one dyinge, is accounted a reprobate and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned person, and not to be praied for by our Churche, of vvhiche thinge doe ensevv tvvo greate commodities to the common vvealth. <note place="margin">Tvvo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
   </p>
   <p>First that men knovvinge they must make this restitution againe, if euer they be able, are muche staied from extortion, thefte, bryberye, vserye, Simonie and the like offences, vvhiche temporall lavves of them selues can neuer tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovvghlie bridle. Secondlie that manie restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiōs are made dailye to parties vvronged in our Churche, at leste vvise vvhen mē come to dye: &amp; of this I could heere alleage bothe rare &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous examples.</p>
   <p>But for the protestant, he troubleth hym selfe litle aboute this matter, nether hathe he
<pb facs="7"/>
any meanes in deed to do the same (confession beinge taken avvaie) and the practise is so stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge amongest them, as you shall reade in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye folovvinge, a good man punished fovver ye res in the Tovver of London, for restoringe of tvventie povvndes for an other man after his deathe.</p>
   <p>Secondlie our religion teacheth the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiō <note place="margin">2. Obserua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of vovves.</note> of vovves, that is, that vvhoe so euer hathe made a vovv to God, of a thinge, honest, lavvfull and possible: is bounde to keepe it, accordinge as the scripture biddeth vs: <hi>Vouete &amp; reddite do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino:</hi>

   <p>Besides this, if vve consider the necessitie of temporall prouisiō, cast vppon clergye men, by their mariage, as to prouide first for the present needes, and then for the tyme to come: as ioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, dovvrye, or some portion for the vvife, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges for the children, and the like: vve shall finde that they can nether keepe that hospitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for the poore, vvhiche vvas vvont, nor spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the leases, copieholdes, and other offalles of Ecclesiasticall lyuinges, to helpe other men, as in times past vvas accustomed: and muche lesse builde Colledges, Churches, and other suche monumentes of pietie, vvhiche their predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours haue donne.

that our good forefathers in tymes past, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciallie <note place="margin">In the bulle de caena do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mini, solem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye recited by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe euerye yere on mā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy thursda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ye, in the ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle, de peda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giis nou is non impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendis: 7 Deuorce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes.

   <p>Seuenthlye our religion holdeth tovvchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge the state of mariage, that vvho so euer is on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce lavvfullye contracted in vvedlocke to an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other, albeit they maie be vppon cause deuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from compaininge one vvithe an other: yet can the bāde of mariage neuer be so broken, as either partye maie marye againe, duringe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers naturall lyfe. And therfore they must ether reconcyle them selues together againe, or els lyue chast. VVhiche is a brydell to manye mischeefes that must nedes ensevv vppon our aduersaries contrarie doctrine and practise in this matter, vvho allovve the diuorced to marye againe, the other partie yet lyuinge. VVhiche li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie layed open to maryed people, geuethe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of easie mislyke and diuorce betvvixt them, vppō hope to marye agayne vvhere they like better, to the greate disturbance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vvealthes in processe of tyme.</p>
   <p>Eightlie, our religion teachethe a pointe <note place="margin">8 Of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to magistrates</note> abovvt magistrates, vvhich greatlie concerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the the common vvealthe, and the contrarye doctrine of our aduersaries, is very muche hurt full and daungeruose vnto the same. The point is this. That vve teache all lavves of magistrates (be the magistrate good or euill) vvhiche are of thinges ether good, or indifferent, or not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
<pb n="19" facs="10"/>
against Gods commandement, doe bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the subiectes consciences to obedience, that <note place="margin">Ro: 13.</note> is, the subiectes are bovvnde in conscience, to obey them not onlie externallye, but also in priuate and secrete, and to accounte it as a syn before God, if they vvillinglye breake the same, for that the magistrate vvhat soeuer, is Gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister. VVerof it folovveth that the lavves of the cōmon vvealthe are obeyed trevvlie, &amp; syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerelye, as vvell in secret as in open shevve, vvithe loue also, and vvithout grudge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to the magistrate.</p>
   <p>But the protestant theachethe that no lavv <note place="margin">Caluin: l. 4. insti. c. 10. num. 5.</note> of man byndeth the subiectes conscience to obedience, vvherof it muste needes follovv, that seinge the subiect obeyethe not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science but onelye for policie and in respect of externall punishement: vvhen so euer he is not in feare of that punishment, he vvithout scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se vvhye the prince is so infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely at this day decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome of matchādise by all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes report.</note> vvill contemne and breake that commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of his magistrate, as for example, he vvil eate fleshe in the lent, in suche places and companyes, vvhiche he is sure, vvill not accuse him, albeit the magistrates commaundement and proclamation be to the contrarie: and so in the lyke. VVhiche thinge is verye hurtfull &amp; daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous (as I haue saied) to the vveale publique. For besides the common breakinge of publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que lavves in priuate, and secrete places, vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the magistrate grovvethe into contempt, &amp; the state hurted: if at anie tyme the subiectes or any faction of them, shalbe so stronge and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, <note place="margin">a Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous sequel</note> as not to feare the magistrates punishement, vvhat shall cause them anye longer to obey▪
<pb n="20" facs="11"/>
Feare of punishment there is none: In conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce (by this doctrine) they are not bounde: vvhy then maie not they as vvell prescribe lavves to the magistrate, as he to them? In this pointe ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, Catholique religion more vpholdethe the vvealepublique, then that of our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
   <p>Ninthlye it is of no small importance vnto a Christian common vvealthe, (vvhose end is <note place="margin">Of synne &amp; concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence.</note> to keepe men vvithin the limites of vertue and honestie) that vvhiche our religion teachethe of the difference of synnes, and of the nature of concupiscence. For tovv chinge the first, as vve holde, that as some synnes are greeuons and mortall: so some are lighter, called veniall, that is, suche as of their nature and by rigour of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, deserue not eternall damnatiō, and expell <note place="margin">Iaco. 1. 15.</note> not alvvaye grace, but may stande vvithe the same. Mortall vve call (for exāples sake) as to be droncke: veniall, to drincke a litle more then a man shoulde. Mortall, to geeue consentin a mans harte to an euill cogitation: veniall, to be negligent in expellinge the same, though he cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent not.</p>
   <p>Our aduersaries holde that all synnes, be they neuer so litle, are mortall of their ovvne <note place="margin">Caluin. in antid. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Tri.</note> natures, and of them selues do deserue damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondlye tovv chinge concupiscence, vve holde, that in the regenerate, that is, in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians after baptisme, the naturall inclination of lustinge, lefte in man, <hi>ad agonem,</hi> as the auncient fathers doe terme it, that is, to stryue vvithall, is <note place="margin">Augu. li. 2. cont. Iuliā. &amp; li. 1. de peccat. me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. c. vlt.</note> not synne of it selfe, except vve geeue consent to the motion. Our aduersaries holde that the
<pb n="21" facs="11"/>
verye motion it selffe though no consent be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto it, is syn.</p>
   <p>Of this diuersitie of doctrine flovvethe greate diuersitie of effectes into the common vvealthe. For ovvt of our doctrine ensuethe this, that seinge the naturall motion of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence in me to euill, is not syn, except I yealde vnto it: I vvill striue against it, and not yelde consent, for sauinge of my soule. Againe, seinge there is a difference of synne, yf I should be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried avvaye a litle further then I ought: yet vvill I at least, striue to refrayne mortall syn vvithe all diligence, consideringe that this synne, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth damnation.</p>
   <p>But out of our aduersaries contrarie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctryne, ensevveth in contraryvvise, that seinge concupiscence mouethe one vvhether he vvill or no, to matters vnlavvfull, as to adulterie, theft, murther, and the like: and seinge vvhether he consent or no, he hathe alredye synned by the verye naturall motion: againe, seinge all sinnes are mortall and none veniall: vvhat shall let him to consent to the motion, and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishe the same, at least in desire, seinge he can but syn mortallie, if he doe it, and so hathe he don alredye by the verie motion it selfe, vvhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is not in his povver to staye. And by this meanes, seinge he must needes syn mortally vvhether he consent or not consent to the syn: vvho vvill not rather consent to the lust, vvithe pleasure, then stryue against the same vvithe greate payne, and yet to sinne neuer the lesse. And so this openethe an infinite gapp to syn &amp; all levvd lyfe: for that no mā vvill stryue aboute
<pb n="22" facs="12"/>
that vvhiche he can not auoide, that is, abovve the resistance of mortall synne.</p>
   <p>Tenthlie tovvchinge the revvarde of euill <note place="margin">10. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard of good, and euill and paynes for synne in this lyfe.</note> and good lyfe in the next vvorlde, and tovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge expiation of syn in this lyfe, our religion teacheth, that a mortall syn, beinge once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after baptisme, is not so soone dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched agayne, but besides faithe, there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red first, hartie sorovv vvithe full purpose neuer to commit the same againe. Then humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession <note place="margin">Contritiō.</note> of the same to the priest. Thirdlye, after the guylie of the synne remitted by the vertue <note place="margin">Confession</note> of Christes passion in the Sacrament of absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is required some temporall punissh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Satisfactiō.</note> and penance, for satisfaction of gods iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: the vvhiche if a man fulfill not in this lyfe, he must paye it in the next vvith muche more payne.</p>
   <p>After this, vvhen he commethe to heauen, <note place="margin">Purgatorie</note> vve holde, that he shall receaue his degree of glorye accordinge to his perfection of life in this vvorlde, as also accordinge to his demerite and measure of vvickednes, he shall receaue the quantitie of his tormentes in hell, if he go thither. VVherof follovvethe bothe feare to commit syn, seinge a man must take suche paynes for the release of the same in this vvorlde: as also diligence in all the three vvorkes satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, to vvitt, prayers, almes, and affliction of our ovvne bodies, for preuentinge the paynes of purgatorie. Also zeale of perfection in good men, seinge their degree in glorye shalbe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to their life heere. And finallye, some staye from ovvtrage in vvicked men, consideringe
<pb n="23" facs="12"/>
that their tormentes in hell shalbe but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the measure of their vvickednes.</p>
   <p>But our aduersaries teachinge first, that there is no more payne to be taken for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of synne committed after baptisme, but onlie to beleeue, vvhich is a verie easie poynte, especiallie to euerie man that vvill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvade him selfe that he beleeuethe vvell: also teachinge that there is no place of purgation in the next lyfe, and that no vvorkes of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are heere needfull on our behalfe: thirdly teachinge, that all glorye is equall to all that are there, and all paine in hell as muche to the least offender as to the greatest: must needes open a gapp to an infinite sea of vvickednes, and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousenes in the common vvealthe. For euerye man persvvadinge him selfe, that hovv euill so euer he liue, yet if he holde a faithe in Christ, and beleeue he shall most certainelie be faued: that he, vvithout all paines ether in this life or in the life to come, shall presentlye goe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and there be in as greate glorye as Peter &amp; Paule and other Sainctes, vvhiche led the strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test lyfe in this vvorlde. vvho vvill not let stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the painefull life of vertue, and take his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, vvhiche naturall concupiscence inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teh hym vnto, consideringe that he maie be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as vvell vvithe them as vvithout? Againe vvhoe vvil spare (beinge once ouer the shoes) to runne in to any extremitie vvhat soeuer of vvickednes, vvhen he thinkethe that if he be damned, he must haue equall punishment vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the the vvoorst?</p>
   <p>Eleuenthlie as thes opinions of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,
<pb n="24" facs="13"/>
are greate fovvntaines in deede to all kinde of libertie and loose behauiour, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe <note place="margin">11: VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvill. &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>destination</note> the mightie inclination of our corrupted fleshe to the same: so their doctrine abovvt vvorkes ad predestination, pluckethe vp by the verye rootes all foundation of good lyfe, beatethe dovvne the vvhole hedge of feare, and laiethe all open to most daungerous dissolution. For vvheras vve teache that albeit, all sainctes of God be predestinate before the vvoorldes vvere layed: yet that extinguishethe not the libertie of mans freevvill, but that he maie (beinge preuented and assisted by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce <note place="margin">Eccl. 15:</note> of god) doe anie good vvoorkes or refuse <note place="margin">Luc: 13.</note> them at his pleasure. VVhiche good vvoorkes <note place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> beinge don for the loue of god, by a man that is in the state of grace, haue their revvarde and merit, euen to the least cuppe of vvater that a man can geeue, vvhiche is a greate pricke to <note place="margin">Math. 5. &amp; 10. &amp; 12.</note> incite men to the same, vsed by the holye Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures them selues. <note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note>
   </p>
   <p>But our aduersaries teachinge first that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hathe no free vvill to thes thinges, and secondlie that if he doe them he shall haue no revvarde for them in heauen: mustes needes vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie discourage all men from the doinge of good vvoorckes. For vvhoe vvill studie aboute a thinge that is nether in his povver, nor yet necessarie or profitable vnto him: especiallye vvhen the thinge is bothe harde of it selfe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant, and muche repugninge to our sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie? vvho vvill geeue his goodes to the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re? his landes from his ovvne kinred, to builde hospitals and colledges for straungers? vvhoe
<pb n="25" facs="13"/>
vvill afflict his bodie vvithe fastinge and praier, vvhen he knovveth that he shall recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue no revvarde therfore in heauen? and that vvithout doinge the same he maye be saued by onlye faithe?</p>
   <p>Tvvelfthlie and lastlie (for I vvill tovvche no more,) our Catholique religion teacheth <note place="margin">12. Priuate confession.</note> priuate cōfessiō of our sinnes vnto the pryest vvhich thinge is the verie hedge and vvall of all vertuous life, and the cheefest brydle of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnes in a common vvealthe. For by this, infinite enormities are redressed, vvhiche by publique lavves can not be remedied. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession <note place="margin">Vtilities of confession:</note> manye seruantes are made trustie to their masters, vviche before vvere false, and they are caused to make priuie restitution of manie thinges, vvhē their masters thynke not of it. Manye greate breaches betvvixt frindes, as vvife and husbande, father and sonne, and the like, are salued. Manye greate mischifes inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ether against the magistrate, priuate persōs, or the common vvealthe, are staied.

verelye, and no reason to the contrary.</p>
   <p>VVherfore seinge a man may not alvvayes depende safelye of the seculer magistrate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor make repose of his sovvle, vppon the fovvndation of a temporall lavv: vve are in iustice to craue pardon of your honours, for not conforminge our opinions to yours in this matter: vve can not doe it vvithout dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation and most greeuouse remorse of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusinge conscience.

   <p>Our desyre vve haue to be rightlye infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, may appeare, not only by our often and earnest petitions of lavvfull tryall in poyntes of controuersie: but also by this, that vve require not anye longe or tediouse satisfaction in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but onlye a demōstration of one necessarye pointe, vvherof our resolution in other thinges vvoolde soone ensevve.</p>
   <p>And this pointe is, that seinge the religion of Christ and his Apostles, vvas (by all partyes confession) the verie trevv religion for vvhich vve stryue, and vvherby vve must be saued, and
<pb n="32" facs="17"/>
so for a hundred or tvvo hundred yeres after, vvithout contradiction of either partie, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion vvas pure vvhich vvas deliuered by the Christian churche ouer all the vvolde: lett de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration be made, vvhich of our religions beganne sence that tyme (for that must needes be false, hauinge not his beginninge from Christ and his Apostles,) and this maie be don (as it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to vs) bothe easely, apparentlye, and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye in this manner.</p>
   <p>VVhen anie religion is once publiquelye planted and receaued, as the trevv religion vvas by our aduersaries confession, in the first tvvo <note place="margin">An easye, short, and euidēt vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie offered of tryall:</note> or three hundred yeres after Christ: it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to bringe in a nevv religion contrary to that, or any articles of faithe repugnant to these before, vvithout some cōtradiction or resistāce of them that then lyued, possessed in the former religion. This is a proposition euident bothe by experience and reason. For first, reason teacheth vs to be impossible, for one man or manye, to <note place="margin">Reason.</note> bringe in a nevv religion, contrarie to all, and to make it to be receaued generallie of all, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out resistance of some, especiallie the thinge beinge a manifest falshoode to vvchinge matter of saluation, as they saye our opinions are. This (I saye) is impossible in common reason. For if one citie vvould receaue it, yet an other vvould not: if one countrye or kyngdome vvould allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vve it, yet an other vvoulde make resistance, at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>least vvise for a tyme. And if no Citie nor coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trye nor kyngdome had controlled it, yet some good man or other vvould haue donne it in the vvorlde abrode. Secondlye the same appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethe <note place="margin">experience</note>
      <pb n="33" facs="17"/>
by experience, for that there vvas neuer yet heresie or error that rose against any one clause or iote of the truethe before receaued, but it vvas controlled presently and resisted by voices and vvritinges of infinite men. And in Englande beinge but a litle corner in respect of the vvhole vvorlde there coulde neuer yet appeare anye one opinion contrary to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine before receaued, but it vvas straight vvaie noted and rebuked: as the religion of Cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uine, by the Catholiques before in possession: after that, the fansie of the puritane by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant: after that, the deuise of the familie of loue, by bothe protestant and puritane: and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally there vvas neuer yet heresye offered to the church, or to any peece of the same, but that it vvas straight vvaie knovven, vvhoe vvere the beginners therof, at vvhat tyme, vvhat multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de first left the former religion and followed the same, vvhoe resisted, vvhoe spake and vvro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te against it, and the like: and this is a trevvth more cleare than the Sonne it selfe.</p>
   <p>This then beinge so, the issevv vvhiche vve <note place="margin">A verye reasonable issue offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> desyre to ioyne, is euident and plaine: to vvitt that of these articles vvherin vve dissent from them and vvhiche they call heresyes, as inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by vs sence the Apostles tyme: as the reall presence, the sacrifice of the masse, purgatorye, prayer for the dead, intercession of sayntes, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt of good vvoorckes, grace inherent, fyue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes denyed by them, and the like: let thē shevve by anie one father, historiographer, or other autēticall testimonie, vvhen any of these pointes vvere brought first into the churche
<pb n="34" facs="18"/>
and resisted by them that then lyued, (as they must needes be if they vvere contrary to the vniuersall doctrine then receaued in christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) and vve remayne satisfied vvithout any furder particuler tryall.</p>
   <p>This is a most reasonable demaunde, so one aunsvvered if the trevvth be vvith our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. For vve take vppon vs to shevv all thes particulers before recited in euery pointe of doctrine vvherin they dissent from vs: that is, vvhen it began to be first knovvē in the church by vvhat man, vvho first controlled it, and the like: but let them doe the same by vs, and the matter is ended.</p>
   <p>But if they can finde no one booke extant in the vvorlde against anie article of our differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce from them, at the first commynge of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me into the church, nor can finde recorde of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye man that ether reprehended or controlled it vvhen it vvas first inuented (as they saye) by our forefathers, but that it vvas receaued vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the silence and approbation, not onlye in one countrye, but thoroughovvt the vvorlde, not in one pointe, but in many, and they most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant: as for example, the fayninge of fyue sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes together, (although vve holde in our doctrine that none but Christ can institute a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, no not the vvhole churche together, nor all the Apostles vvhen they vvere alyue), if (I saie) they can finde no recorde at all, that any man resisted or controlled thes horrible &amp; blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous poyntes at their first entringe into the churche, (if it be trevv that they entred in since the Apostles tyme) then must thei thincke that
<pb n="35" facs="18"/>
men vvere senseles and madd at that time, that vvoolde suffer so manye, so grosse, &amp; so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant heresies, to passe vnchecked, and neuer to open their mouthes against them, vvheras at the verye same tyme, (that is, vvithin the first fyue hundred yeres after Christ, vvherin our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries graunte thes heresies to haue bene crept in to the churche) the fathers and doctors that then lyued, vvrote most diligentlye against eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie other litle error that appeared. But novv vvhether it be reasonable to thinke so of those holye learned and vigilant men or els to thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke our aduersaries some vvhat shameles, in char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginge them vvithe suche absurdities, I leaue to the indifferent reader to consider.</p>
   <p>And thus muche haue I bene bolde to laye dovvne to your vvisedomes, right honorable, both for the innocencie of our cause, the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our demaunde, the reason of our offer, and the easie meanes of our satisfaction, if our aduersaries vvoolde agree to the same. VVhich all tendeth onlye to this end (as your honours right vvell can discerne) to mitigate the greate offence conceaued against vs, and consequentlie some parte of that extreame rigour vsed tovvar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des vs and our cause of later dayes, vvhich bein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge such, as in verie deed is intollerable: vve are constrained to make recourse to your honours to vvhome of devv our protection appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and to doe, as a certaine afflicted man did vvith an Emperour in times past, that is, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from your selues vnto your selues: from your selues, as offended by the instigation of our aduersaries: vnto your selues, mollified

vvith our iust defence and innocencie in cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes obiected.</p>
   <p>If by the rackinges, stretchinges, vvrestin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and dreadfull tortures, vsed so often and to so many of our innocent afflicted brethren, and that in so rigourous &amp; mercilesse manner, there hath bene any one thinge vvrounge out from them, of treason, conspiracie, or practises against the state, vvhervvith our aduersaries, vvithout conscience, do vse dailye to accuse vs in their bookes and sermons, therby to sturre her maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie and your honours against vs: lett the partie guyltie be punished openly, vvith infamie also to our vvhole cause, albeit in this later, vve offer more than reason. But if after all this adoe, after all this fierse halinge, and pitifull pullinge of mē in peeces, nothinge hath bene founde at all, no one act, no vvorde, no cogitation of suche matters, but onlye innocencie and Zeale of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the tormented: then is our case muche more hard at home, in our ovvne countrye, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ovvne Soueraigne, than it could be any vvhere els vnder the extremest aduersaries of our religion in the vvorlde.</p>
   <p>For I knovv your honours can not but consider, that the greatest enimyes of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie this daie liuinge, as those of the secte of Mahomet, and many gētles besydes, ar so far of, from tormentynge Catholiques, as they permit vnto them the libertie and exercise of their cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in respect of the antiquitie and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance therof. For vvhich cause also, the most of Christian princes, do tollerate vvithe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie levves: and suche as possesse the Indes and
<pb n="37" facs="19"/>
other places, vvhere gentiles inhabite, neuer vse to moleste, and muche lesse to torment them for their consciences, vvherī they vvere borne and bredd vp: for that, faithe beinge the guifte of God, and comminge by hearinge (as the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <note place="margin">Rom. 12:</note> saiethe) is not to be put in by tormentes &amp; persecution. <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Pitifull then and compassionable is our case (right honorable): if, of all other men, vve fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de lesse rest and most extremitie, and that also there, and from those, vvhere, and from vvho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, manie greate considerations shoulde yealde vs hope of fauoure and mercie. No protestant prince of any other countrie did euer vse the like: and it is quyte contrarie both to the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinges and protestations of all those of that re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion in other places, as also of our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Englande, before they came to beare rule them selues.</p>
   <p>Alas (my Lordes) vvhat impelleth your vvis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes (for of nature I can not thinckc you so<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fiers &amp; pityles) to exercise suche extremitie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon poore people for that cause, vvherof your ovvne fathers vvere as guyltie as vve are, that is, for our conscience in the auncient religion? If you meane to vvīne mē therby to your opiniō, it is the cleane contrarie course, as I haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vved.

I am sure it dothe greatlie increase it.</p>
   <p>Your honours haue procured libertie of conscience for those of your religion in some other countries, vvhich must proceede (as vve interpret from a mercifull disposition tovvar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the afflicted, and that mens consciences are not to be constrained.</p>
   <p>VVe beseeche your Lordships then, that vve your poore afflicted subiectes, maye tast some parte of that your honorable disposition, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rof straungers doe receaue so greate releefe and comforte.</p>
   <p>Consider (my good lordes.) in most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner I desire and requeste it, vvhat the end of all thes straininges, and most rigourous procedinges can arriuē vnto.

   <p>Remember (right honorable), that hovv different so euer our degrees be in this vvorlde, yet must vve all be equall before the common iudge, at the later daie, and all those afflicted persons, these tormēted, these imprisoned, these

VVhat good or cōforte can the tormē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted members of your brethren, the stretched veines, the broken synovves, the dismembred iointes, the rented bovvels of your countrye mē, of your ovvne quiet subiectes, of most pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable, modest, and innocent priests yelde vnto your soules at that daye? you must your selues crye for mercye in that dreadfull hovver, to hym vvhome these men, ether in trevvth, or in opinion do serue, and vvhy than may not vve aske some mercye at your honours handes novv, at the least, from thes horrible and seruile tormentes, vvhich Christian and ciuill hartes doe detest to thinke on? VVhat good can thes outragious meanes vvorke anye vvay vnto your cause, or vvhen you be dead, vvhat honour, esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, loue, or securitie, can the eternall me morie of thes extreame dealinges, pourchasse vnto your posteritie.</p>
   <p>The cause beinge gods, as vve presume: if all
<pb n="40" facs="21"/>
the earth shoulde rise against vs, vve may not geeue ouer, nor once shrincke in the confession and profession of this faith, though all vvrath of man vnder the cope of heauen shoulde rage and vvax tempestuous. For that, hauinge but one ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe to yelde: vve knovve the vttermost that can be donne vnto vs. And if our tormenters vvoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de deferre the same, by longe, and often, and slovv tortures, to feede vppon our paines, as they seeme to doe: yet, at the last, they can affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte vs no longer, than our breath vvill holde in: and finallie, the matter must haue an end, and both they and vve be transposed to a nevv iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dgment seate, vvhere matters must be nevv tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerst agayne, and nevv sentence geeuen, &amp; nevv tortures appointed, of other qualitie and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, <note place="margin">Apoc. 21.</note> than thes former vvere. At vvhat time, if vve suffer in a good cause, (as vve persvvade our selues vve doe) all our teares shalbe vvyped avvaye by our sauiour him selfe, all our mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations appeased, all our penuries releeued, all our paines assvvaged, all our racked members resetled, all our dispersed bovveles restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <note place="margin">Apoc. 21.</note> and vve placed ovvt of all feare, sorovv, &amp; affliction, for the time to come,</p>
   <p>In respect vvherof, and especiallye in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the infinite paines and tormentes, vvhich our svveete Sauiour suffered for vs: vve are content to beare both this, and vvhat so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer further affliction, his holye hande shall please to lay vppon vs, beinge sorye that vve haue not moelyues than one, to leese in this his cause: for a thovvsande in eche man, can not be aunsvverable to his one deathe for vs, nor to
<pb n="41" facs="21"/>
his greate loue and diuyne consolation, vvhere vvith he assisteth dayely, and confortethe the hartes and spirites of our afflicted brethren, euen in the middest of their greatest tortures, penuries, and miserable calamities.</p>
   <p>VVherfore, to conclude this vvofull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> vvithout any further tediousnes vnto your honours, vve are in all humilitie and devvtifull submission, to beseeche and obtest your most honorable assemblye, euen for the loue of our Saueoure, in respect of our cause (vvhich vve protest before his diuine maiestie to be onlye our conscience in religion, and not any euill meaninge tovvardes his minister, our soueray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne): that you vvill at length take notice of our distresses, consideration of our calamities, and finallie, some mercifull inclination, tovvards our afflictions. VVhich if your honours doe, hovv so euer othervvise you thinke vs amisse, in our cause of conscience: yet, no doubt but you shall receaue the revvarde devv to mercie and clemencie, both from God &amp; the vvorlde. But if this our supplication of mercie, finde no mercye, nor place at all: yet shall not vve cease to pray stil for your honours, confortinge our selues vvith the hope onlye of Gods mercie, vvhen man forsaketh vs, and also vvith this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitatiō, that your Lordships are nether the first, nor the greatest, nor shalbe the last vvhich shall persecute this faith, &amp; churche, for vvhich vve suffer. And hovv so euer the matter doe passe for our lyues and tymes, (vvherof vve make no greate accounte): yet our posteritie shall see, (as our auncestours haue seene before) that men
<pb n="42" facs="22"/>
doē alter, passe and fade, and their cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions come to chaungeable and vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted euentes, but the trevvth of our Lorde endureth for euer. <note place="margin">Psal. 116.</note>
