   <head>Master Phaers Conclusion to his interpretation of the
<hi>Aeneidos</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi> by him conuerted into English verse.</head>
   <p>THus farfourth (good readers) aswell for defence of my coūtrey lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (which I haue heard discommended of manie, and esteemed of some to be more than barbarous) as also for honest recreation of you the nobilitie, gentlemen and Ladies that studie no <hi>Latine,</hi> I haue taken some trauaile to expresse this most excellent writer, as far as my simple abilitie extended. And if god sende me life and leisour, I purpose to set forthe the rest, vnlesse it maye lyke some other that is better armed with learning, to preuent my labours, whereof I assure you, I woulde be right glad, contenting my selfe sufficiētly with this, that by mee first this gate is set open. If nowe the yong writers wil vouchesaue to enter: they may find in this language, both large and abundant campes of varietie, where in they may gather innumerable sortes, of most beautifull floures, figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and phrases, not onely to supplie the imperfection of mee: but also to garnishe al kindes of their owne verses with a more cleane and cōpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious order of meeter, than heretofore cōmonly hath ben accustomed. And if any further help I may do to that purpose, I shal more gladly bestowe my trauaile hereafter, if I may knowe that these my beginnings be of you gently taken and embraced. Trusting that you my right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful maisters, and studentes of <hi>Vniuersities,</hi> and such as be teachers of children and readers of this auctour in
<hi>Latin,</hi> wil not be to muche offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, though euery verse answere not to your expectation. For (besides the diuersitie betweene a construction and a trāslation) you know there be many misticall secretes in this writer, which vttered in English would shewe litle pleasour, and in myne opinion are better to be vntouched, than to diminishe the grace of the rest with tediousnes and darknes. I ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue therefore folowed the coūsel of <hi>Horace,</hi> teaching the duety of a good interpretour, <hi>Qui quae desperat nitescere posse, relinquit,</hi> by which occasiō, somwhat I haue in places omitted, somwhat altered, and some thing I haue expounded, and al to the ease of inferior readers, for you that are learned need not to be instructed. I meane not to preiudice any that can do finer, only I desyre you to beare with my trauaile, and among other to pardon my first booke, wherein I found this new kinde of fingering somewhat straunge vnto me, and to say the truth I had neuer any quiet from troubles, to cōfer or peruse that booke, or any of the rest, as I most<pb facs="148"/>desyred. You may therefore accept them, as thinges roughly begunne, rather than polished, and where you vnderstād a faute, I desier you, with silence paciently passe it, and vpon knowledge geuen to mee, I shal in the next setting forth, endeuour to reforme it. And if anye with this wil not be contented, than let him take it in hand, and doe it a new him self, and I nothinge mistruste, but he shal find it an easier thing to controlle a peece or two, than to amende the whole of this enterpretation. Thus I commit you to god gentle Readers, and I praye you correct these er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours escaped in the printing.</p>
