      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Amentable are the ruines, into which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of men
<pb facs="3"/> are generally fallen by their sinnes; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares especially by the waies men take in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their soule: The most men are cleane <hi>out of the way to heauen,</hi> and walke in by-waies of their owne, which are called in Scripture, the <hi>wayes of the wicked;</hi> the <hi>wayes of their owne hearts; Peruerse wayes; Darke and slipperie wayes; The way of iniquitie:</hi> All meeting in that <hi>broad way that leadeth to destruction,</hi> being wholly ignorant of the <hi>way of life</hi> and <hi>peace;</hi> yea, the most of them <hi>speake euill of the good way
<pb facs="3"/> of God,</hi> and persecute it. Some there are, that are so farre inlightned, as not to like the common roade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the multitude; and after some inquiry haue found them out <hi>wayes that seeme good in their owne eyes;</hi> and they are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully well pleased with their course, but <hi>the issues of these wayes are death</hi> too, as well as the former: and the more is this danger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased vpon men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>way of life is</hi> but <hi>one,</hi> and it is a <hi>narrow way,</hi> and hard to finde, and may bee <hi>sought</hi> by many, and yet <hi>not found:</hi> Yet this
<pb facs="4"/> hope is left vnto forlorne men, that there is a way to heauen and happinesse: A <hi>way of righteousnesse</hi> and peace, <hi>a way of mercy and truth,</hi> of <hi>wisedome:</hi> A way that men may <hi>securely</hi> and safely walke in; a way, in which Christ will <hi>guide them,</hi> God the Father will <hi>keepe them,</hi> and the holy Ghost <hi>leade them</hi> by the hand, and direct them in all the passages thereof: Onely it concerneth vs <hi>to aske the way,</hi> with all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, of God, and to attend vnto the directions of the word of God, and apply our hearts, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb facs="4"/> our selues to bee <hi>dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed aright,</hi> that <hi>our eyes may see the saluation of God:</hi> and in particular we must look to three things: First, that if the Lord shew vs that mercy to direct vs in the way, wee must take heed that wee neglect not, or despise not the care of wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the way: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that with all diligence we auoide <hi>going about,</hi> and make <hi>straight steps to our feet:</hi> and thirdly, with all feare watch our selues, that wee <hi>fall not</hi> off with <hi>the errours of the wicked,</hi> from the good way of God, and so our latter end bee
<pb facs="5"/> worse then our beginning.</p>
   <p>I haue vndertaken by the assistance of God, and the directions of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Word, to single out the choisest things I could finde in the Scriptures, concerning the entrance into this way of God, and those first pathes which are called holy. The substance of these directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I haue digested into the Treatise following, which I dedicate vnto your Ladiships, as a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of my thankfulnesse, for the respect you haue shewed vnto my Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, both in your constant
<pb facs="5"/> resort vnto it in the weeke daies, while you liued in a neighbour Parish; and in that two of you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to come to liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, and so are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a part of my charge; as also to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to the world my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance of your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, for the good report you haue amongst the godly for the grace of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faigned loue of the truth: Beseeching your <hi>Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Perusall,</hi> and <hi>Patronage</hi> of these, I take my leaue, and commend your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships to the <hi>God of mercy</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/> and <hi>truth,</hi> who guide, comfort, deliuer, sanctifie, and preserue you all vnto the Day of Iesus Christ.</p>
