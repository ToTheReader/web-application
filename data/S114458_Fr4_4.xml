   <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>GOod Reader it is a thing to be considered, that a man may seeme both vnto himselfe and to the Church of God to be a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour of the Gospel, and yet indeede be none. All professors that be of this sort, are excellently described, Luk. 8. vers. 13. in thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> words. <hi>And they which are vpon the stony groūd are they, which when they shal heare, receiue the word with ioy: but hauing no roote, beleeue for a time, &amp; in the time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation goe away.</hi> Where are to be noted three things. First, their faith, in that they are said to beleeue for a season. Secondly the fruits of that faith, in that they are said to receiue the word preached with ioy. Thirdly, their vnsoundnesse in that they are compared to stony ground, and in the time of temptation goe away.</p>
   <p>Concerning their faith, wheras the spirit of God saith, that they doe beleeue these things are to be considered. First, that they haue the knowledge of the word of God. Secondly, that they both can and doe g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ue assent vnto the word of God, that it is most true. Thirdly, in more speciall manner they giue assent vnto the couenant of grace made in Christ, that it is most certaine and sure: and they are perswaded in a general and confused manner, that God will verifie the same couenant in the members of his Church. This is all their faith: which indeede proceedeth from the holy Ghost, but yet it is not sufficient to make them sound Professors. For albeit they doe generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue Gods promises, yet herein they deceiue themselues, that they neuer applie and appropriate the same promises to their own soules. An example of this faith we haue, Ioh. 2.24. where it is said, that when our Sauiour Christ came to Ierusalem at the feast of Easter, <hi>manie beleeued in his name, and yet hee would not commit himselfe vnto them, because he knewe them all, and what was in them.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To come to the second thing: those professors which are indued with thus much grace, as to beleeue in Christ in a confused maner, goe yet further: for this their faith, though it be not sufficient to saluation yet it sheweth it selfe by certaine fruites which it bringeth forth: for as a tree or a branch of a tree that hath no deepe rooting, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is couered with a few moules, or els lieth in the water, at the season of the yeare bringeth forth leaues and blossomes, and some fruite too, and that for one or two, or moe yeares: so one that is an hearer of the word, may receiue the word: and the worde as seed, by this generall faith may bee somewhat rooted in his heart and setled for a season, and may bring foorth some fruites in his life peraduenture very faire in his owne and other mens eies: yet indeede neither sound, nor lasting, nor substantiall. What these fruites are, it may be gathered forth of these wordes, where it is said, <hi>that they receiue the word with ioy,</hi> when they heare it: for here may be gathered. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that they doe willingly subiect themselues to the ministerie of the word. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that they are as forward as any, and as ioyfull in frequenting sermons. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that they reuerence the Ministers whome they so ioyfully heare. Lastly, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> condemne them of impietie, which will not be hearers, or be negligent hearers of the word.</p>
   <p>Now, of these and such like fru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ts, this may be added: though they are not sound, yet they are void of that grosse kind of hypocrisie. For the mindes of those Professors
<pb n="573" facs="316"/>
are in part enlightened, and their hearts are indued with such a faith,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Marke, that there is a true faith, wrought by the holy Ghost, very like sauing faith, yet not sauing faith.</hi>
      </note> as may bring forth these fruits for a time: and therefore herein they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>issemble not that faith which they haue not: but rather shew that which they haue. Adde hereunto, that a man bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this estate, may deceiue himselfe; and the most godly in the world, which haue the greatest gifts of discerning, how they and their brethren stand before the Lord: like as the figtree with greene leaues deceiued our Sauiour Christ as he was man: for when in his hunger he came vnto it to haue had some fruit he found none.</p>
   <p>If this be so, it may be then required, how these vnsound professours differ from true professours. I answer, in this they differ, that they haue not sound hearts to cleaue vnto Christ Iesus for euer. Which appeareth in that they are compared to stonie ground. Now, stonie groundes mingled with some earth are commonly hot, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue as it were some alacritie and hastinesse in them, and the corne as soone as it is cast into this ground, it sprouteth out very speedily, but yet the stones will not suffer the corne to be rooted deepely beneath, and therefore when sommer commeth the blade of the corne withereth with rootes and all. So it is with these professours: they haue in their hearts some good motions of the holy Ghost, to that which is good: they haue a kind of zeale to Gods word, they haue a liking to good things, and they are as forwards as any other for a time, and they doe beleeue. But these good motions and graces are not lasting, but like the flame and flashing of straw and stubble: neither are they sufficient to saluation.</p>
   <p>With the true professours it is farre otherwise: for they haue vpright and <hi>honest hearts before the Lord,</hi> Luk. 8. 15. <hi>And they haue faith which worketh by loue.</hi> Gal. 5.6. And that Christian man which loueth God, whatsoeuer shall befall, yea though it were a thousand deaths, yet his heart can neuer be seuered from the Lord and from his Sauiour Christ: as the spouse speaketh vnto Christ of her owne loue, Cant. 8.6. <hi>Set me as a seale on thy heart, as a signet vpon thy arme: for loue is as strong as death: iealousie is as cruell as the graue; the coales thereof are fierie coales and a vehement flame. Much water cannot quench loue, neither can the flouds drowne it: if a man should giue all the substance of his house for loue, they would greatly contemne it.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Wherefore (good Reader) seeing there is such a similitude and affinitie betweene the temporarie professor of the Gospell, and the true professor of the same: it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of euery Christian to trie and examine himselfe whether he be in the faith or not. 2. Cor. 13.5. And whereas it is an hard thing for a man to search out his own heart, we are to pray vnto God that he would giue vs his spirit to discerne betweene that which is good and euill in vs. Now when a man hath found out the estate of his heart by searching it, <hi>he is further to obserue and keepe it with all diligence.</hi> Prou. 4. 23. that when the houre of death, or the day of triall shall come, he may stand sure and not be deceiued of his hope.</p>
   <p>And for this purpose I haue described the most of these small treatises which follow, to minister vnto thee some helpe in this examining and obseruing of thine own heart. Read them and accept of them, and by the blessing of God they shall not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable vnto thee. And if they shall any whit helpe thee, helpe me also with thy prayer. 1595.</p>
