      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>One but to you (as whom of right it doth concerne) I thought good to present this Play: which though written many yeares since, ought not therefore to be slighted: I confesse we have better for Language in these our exquisite and refined Times, yet for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Subject, none of a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull and pleasant Style; for it is well knowne to you (Gentlemen

Cordwiners) that every yeare you doe celebrate the Feast of <hi>Crispine,</hi> &amp; <hi>Crispianus,</hi> not in a meane and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way, but with a great deale of Ceremony, keeping it as an Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, feasting and entertaining your friends and neighbours. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it hath bin so well approoved by you in the acting of it upon the Stage, and that with your loud alarums, (I meane your clapping of hands) that I could not chuse but commend it to you now in Print: for it is a Play that is often Acted; and when others fade and are out of date, yet this doth endure tò the Last: I know it may come short of that accuratenes both in plot and style that this witty age doth with greater curiosity acquire,

I may thus excuse; that as Plaies were then, some twenty yeares agone, it was in the fashion. Nor could it have found a fitter or more seasonable pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication than at this time; when the glory of our Nation is so much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the valour of our English so much esteemd, that it is sought for by forraigne Natives, as you may read<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
