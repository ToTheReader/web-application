   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Eedlesse vvere it for me (right honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to trouble your
learned eares vvith any friuolous dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, concerning the manifolde
vertues contained in this little Booke: because the vvork suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently 
<pb facs="3"/>declares it selfe, &amp; your iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exceedeth my simple
demō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. As for the noble man, vvho sometime made account of this
vvorthy Ievvell, and kept it (as hath beene knovvn) vvith no little care,
declaring in his ovvn hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable course of life, the perfect imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of
so singuler precepts, as he vvas generally reputed a fatherlie freend to
his Countrey, &amp; a bright shining star in his Princes Courte: Let this
christall mirrour, vvherein may be seene the liuely shapes of vertue and
vice (honourable Syr Thomas) bee patronized by you, for noble Fraunces Earle of
Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordes sake, let this his dailie and<pb facs="3"/>hourlie looking
glasse, be the more welcome to you.</p>
   <p>Manie are the copies in writing hereof, secretely deliuered
abroade among both noble and other, who for the matter it selfe, and intire
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the man while he liued, keepe them as the apple of theyr eye, and
are fearefull to loose such excellent documcnts. Long did I trauaile to
gette a copie of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous worke, yet all in vaine, tyll being sent for to
a deere freend of mine, that lay (vnder the fatherlie correction of God) vpō
his death bedde: and for he had nothing of greater esteeme to leaue his
friend (albeit he had the blessing of God<pb facs="4"/>in some measure)
gaue mee thys sweete Booke, wherof I was more glad, than had he giuen mee
vvhat terrestrial affectiō to much coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</p>
   <p>Beeing possessed of this noble Bedfordes Iewell, vvhose
name I honour vvhile I liue, for many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits receiued: I coulde not
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it to my selfe, but shewing it to diuers my freendes, who dailie
desired copies thereof, as I my self had doone, and finding my selfe
vnable to furnish the desire of so many: as well to satis-fie them, as
other (vvho I know are in like sort affected) I was perswaded to make the
same common by impression,<pb facs="4"/>and so haue doone to their no litle
contentment.</p>
   <p>And for your honours forvvard zeale to vertue, fauouring all
such as are true professors therof, as also for defence of this Booke
frō wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked detractors: I make as humble present therof to your honor, that
as you are in liuely follower of that vvoorthy Earle and Counseller in life:
so pray I, that your rewarde may be vvith him in the kingdom of Heauen.</p>
