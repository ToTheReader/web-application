of their feete was heard throughout the world. these be they which fedde with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles, and became themselues foode for wilde beastes, they spared not their liues vnto the death, they quenched the heate of fire, they turned the edge of the sworde, they stopped the mouthes of furious beastes, they confounded the tyrants, and foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledde the ennemies of the truthe. I may say of them, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaketh of the true Christians and Martyrs, <hi>occidi poterant, sed vinci non poterant.</hi> Well they might be slaine, but it was vnpossible to ouercome them. And yet when the ennemie tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth, that at lest wise he seemeth to haue brought his purpose about, we may comfort our selues with this saying: <hi>Sanguis martyrum, semen Ecclesiae,</hi> the bloude of the Martyrs is the seede of the Churche. Christ him selfe foretolde that whosoeuer woulde be his disciple, must take vppe his crosse and followe him. These Prophets and these Apostles, and these Disciples haue done no lesse. <hi>Abel</hi> was murthered by <hi>Cain.</hi> The children of Israel were oppressed vnder <hi>Pharao. Elias</hi> was persecuted by <hi>Iezabel.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ioath</hi> was threatned by <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and slaine of a Lion. <hi>Zacharie</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iehoida</hi> was stoned to death. <hi>Micheas</hi> was throwne downe, and his necke broken. <hi>Amos</hi> was smitten with a clubbe on the temples of the heade, and so brai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Esaias</hi> was sawed asunder in two partes with a wodden sawe. <hi>Ionas</hi> was in the whales bellie, yet hauing escaped that daunger, was he not without miserie. <hi>Ieremie</hi> was persecuted oftentimes, imprisoned very sore, throwne into the deepe dungeon where he stoode in mire vnto the eares, at length stoned to death in AEgypt. <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi> was slaine at Babylon by the Duke of the people. <hi>Daniel</hi> was throwne among the hungrie Lions, yet God preserued him. The three children were throwne into the firie fornace, but the fire did them no harme. <hi>Baruch</hi> was faine to flie away to saue his life from king <hi>Ioachas</hi> handes. The Prophet <hi>Vrias</hi> was slaine with the sworde by king <hi>Ioacim. Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> was beheaded of <hi>Herode</hi> the Tetrarche. <hi>Steuen</hi> was sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death. <hi>Iames</hi> was beheaded by <hi>Herode Agrippa. Peter</hi> was crucified at Rome vnder <hi>Nero,</hi> with his heade downewardes. <hi>Paule</hi> was likewise beheaded at Rome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Nero. Andrevv</hi> was crucified by <hi>AEgeas</hi> king of Edessa, at Pataras a Citie in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia. <hi>Iames Alphaeus,</hi> that was Bishop of Ierusalem, was throwne downe from an high, and brained with a fullers clubbe. <hi>Thomas</hi> was slaine at Calamina, a Citie in India: the Painims ranne him through with a dart, the which some doe call a speare or iauelin. <hi>Philip</hi> was crucified at Hierapolis in Asia. <hi>Bartolomevv</hi> was flaine aliue in India: his skinne pulled ouer his eares, and after all, beheaded. <hi>Mathevv</hi> vvas runne through vvith a naked sworde in AEthiopia. <hi>Simon</hi> was crucified. <hi>Iude</hi> vvas slaine. <hi>Iohn</hi> was scurged, and often persecuted, it is saide that <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperour caused him to be throwne into a tunne of hotte skalding oyle, yet tooke no harme. <hi>Matthias</hi> was knockt on the heade with an axe, and immediatly beheaded. <hi>Marke</hi> the Euangelist had a rope tied about his necke, and by that dravvne throughe the strete of Alexandria, that his flesh vvas rent in peces, the stones coloured with blud, and in the ende he vvas burned to ashes. <hi>Barnabas</hi> had a rope about his necke, and there vvith pulled to the stake and burned. This is to beare the crosse of our Sauiour, this is to drinke of one cuppe vvith Christ, this is it which <hi>S. Paule</hi> sayth: Whosoeuer liueth godly in Christ Iesu, shall suffer persecution. for through many tribulations vve haue to enter into the kingdome of heauen. This present treatise of <hi>Dorotheus</hi> hath moued me thus to vvryte, and the matter it selfe is so copious, that I can hardly holde my penne, yet I hope the reading of these briefe stories vvil not seeme tedious vnto any. As for the liues following, I would haue thee (gentle reader) to know that where <hi>Dorotheus</hi> seemed vnperfect, and to haue ouerskipped certen liues worthie
<pb n="520" facs="263"/>
the noting and the knowledge of the posteritie, I haue either borowed the same of some other auncient vvryter, or gathered it my selfe out of holy scripture. This is the marke to discerne the one from the other. Where anyone life is altogether of Romaine letters, the same is none of <hi>Dorotheus.</hi> If thou thinkest I haue done vvell, geue the praise to God, if in thine opinion it seeme othervvise, suspende thy sentence, and be not singuler in reprehending that, vvhich peraduenture after aduisement taken, may frendly be interpreted. Farevvell.</p>
