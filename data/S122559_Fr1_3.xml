<pb facs="3"/>
liuing I was more obliged then any other of his rancke in the Land. And although I am of least a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie in this kinde (since the most Learned Pens and skilfullest Pencils, must fall farre short of limning him to the Life, such were his excellent Parts) yet I had rather vndergoe any censure then be Ingratefull, or like an vnconscionable Debtor, refuse satisfaction when it will bee accepted for lesse then three in the hundred. It is too true, that the Zeale of the most, expires with their Friends liues or fortunes: vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Deuotion weares and waters their Tombes many yeares after: and so (Madame) shall I his, though I creepe thereto on my knees. For if euer Mortalitie clad true Honour, and Honestie of Heart, she veiled either in the Person of your Noble Lord and Husband; whose Pietie to GOD, Zeale to Religion, Loyaltie to his Soueraign, Loue to his Countrey, Courtesie and Affabilitie to all; set of with the rarest endowments of Body and Minde, (like so many Diamonds in Gold) drew all Hearts to his Loue, and Eyes to his Admiration. But hee is gone, and wee follow as fast as may bee: and as in Fruit the ripest; so with vs in the world, the rarest are soonest gathered for Heauen.</p>
