   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>XPERIENCE hath made the case cleare, in all sciences, arts, and professions, wherein hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane capacitie doth shew the soules excellencie, in apprehension, discourse, and iudgement of things past, present, or to come, by inuention, morall coniecture, and wit of man: that these fiue Rules hold out as inexpugnable Principles,<note place="margin">The Author in all these fiue Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples &amp; certainties of things, of none denyed, doth clearely conuince the Iesuits faction and all their fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of many grosse errours: which ignorant people deduct from their absurd rules, opposite to these in al things: as that their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall with his companie of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincials, cannot erre: that they cannot faile in their doctrine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structiōs, gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the like: that the foundation of their order is a state of most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. All which errours, with many other are impugned by these fiue grounds set downe, as in a Preface to the particular Quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libets here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of all, and denyed of none: to wit. First, that no ground in Diuinitie, no Axiome in Philosophie, no Maxime in the Law, no Paragraffe in positiue Discourse, no Paradoxe amongst O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, no Proposition amongst Schoolemen, no Article of our faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Apostles by sacred OEcumenicall Synode, defined, deposed, and decided to be thus and none otherwise beleeued, and taken vnder paine of damnation: but the same may be impugned by a seeming reasonable plea to the contrarie, with arguments of proofe in shew holden on a whole day by fine wits, in a schoole despicion: and the defendant so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled (if of dull and slow conceit) that he shall haue no reason to deny that to be true: (as <hi>verbi gratia:</hi> that blacke is white: that a man is a mouse: that there is no God at all, &amp;c.) which to auerre to be false, he is and will be readie to spend his life, and shed his dearest bloud. Secondly, that <hi>bonum &amp; malum,</hi> vertue and vice, religion and heresie, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in opposition one against the other, yet haue this concordance by a necessarie sequele inserted into the subiect, wherein they are inherent by proper kind: as if you build vpon proofe of either by examples, the one shall ballance and beard out the other in authoritie to the vttermost. Thirdly, that there is no new thing vnder the Sunne, nor any inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wit inuented, but anothers wit can equall it by inuenting the same. Fourthly, that there is no certaintie of any thing here on earth, but that the fall and stand, the life and death, and the very Periods of times,
<pb facs="3"/> Kingdomes, Princes, and all sorts of persons, hang vpon mutation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration and downefall, knowne to God alone. Fiftly, that <hi>Aristotles</hi> Principle, scil. <hi>Generatio vnius, est corruptio alterius,</hi> is so perfect a current of time, and plyable to all, not onely physicall or naturall, but also morall &amp; politicall cadences and vp-rests, as no excellencie so rare but hath beene abased, no complexion so perfect, but hath bene corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, no Maiestie so regall, but hath bene subiected: no power so great, but hath come to nothing: no foundation so firme, strong, and sure, but hath bene shaken, yea and hitherto quite ouerthrowne (vnlesse it were the impregnable rocke of the Church, which hangs vpon certitude of diuine pillars independent vpon humane chaunce and chaunge:) and no commonwealth, corporation, societie, or state so prudent, politicall, and perspicuous in all things to make them famous, eternized, and their condition of life, gouernment, and order permanent, but haue had their sates by succeeding turns, with a no lesse fearefull eclipse of their former fame, then a notable diminution of their wonted glorie.</p>
   <p>Thus came all the mightie Monarchs, Worthies, and Monarchies of the world (as it were by a naturall succession of birth and bloud, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoluted from the father to the sonne) to haue their rise and fall one after another.<note place="margin">He meaneth the continuance of that Monarchie, from <hi>Nimrod</hi> or <hi>Ninus,</hi> to the last of <hi>Nabuchodono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi> son, <hi>vz. Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> as the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caesar</hi> to this present, though vp and downe, as the <hi>Assyriās</hi> was.</note> The <hi>Assyrians</hi> first swayed the scepter Royall of the worlds Monarchie, and longest of all other continued with the same: and who then so famous as their <hi>Nabuchodonosor,</hi> in whose presence the whole earth kept silence: but yet subiect to corruption. Who euer had a lost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>r fall, as to be turned out of the proper feature of a man, into the gastfull purport of a beast: and in the end his Kingdome taken from his house, name and line: no face of a commonwealth remaining vnder any <hi>Assyrian</hi> title at this day. Then rose vp the <hi>Persian</hi> Prince: and where caryed fame her sayles aloft, but vnder the canapeall beauer of a <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his briefe,<note place="margin">He alludeth to the Maiestie of King <hi>Darius</hi> in his briefe summō of all the worlds Peeres, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his stately Monarchie, to come to his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne feast.</note> the renowned Monarch of the world in his dayes: and yet he also was cast off from the highest Pyramides of fortunes wheele. For although the now <hi>Persian Sophie</hi> haue recouered an Asiaticke imperiall state againe: yet by the folly of <hi>Darius,</hi> his house and line, the second Monarchie, whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> spoke, was translated from the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> to the <hi>Greekes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Then in speciall, the Macedonian <hi>Alexander,</hi> (a second Worthy of the Gentiles) was the glorie of former fame of his own, &amp; wonder of future ages, as the onely admired at Heroes of the world in his dayes. But yet such is the painefull birth of Princes, and short, sorowfull, and
<pb facs="3"/> toylesome life of Monarchs, in their generation and corruption of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and regall states, as <hi>Alexander</hi> after twelue yeares raigne yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to destinie in <hi>Babylon,</hi> there consumed to dust: his Monarchie was deuided into foure principall (besides other inferior) members or Empires. And then againe out of that Greekish corruption did rise a Latine generation of a <hi>Romane</hi> Monarchie: which in a tottering state by tract of time, is come vnto that passe, wherein we now do see it. One while the Romane <hi>Caesars,</hi> and <hi>Octauians</hi> caryed away the trophees and triumphes of the world, from all people and nations vnder heauen. After them the <hi>Albions</hi> or great <hi>Britons Constantine,</hi> merited the renowne to the famous <hi>English</hi> Isle: then the worthie <hi>French Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaine</hi> got the fame by Martiall prowes and iust deserts to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie selfe, people, and nation where he liued. After that againe, the <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi> and with them the <hi>Germaines</hi> (where the imperiall triple Crowne of <hi>Caesar</hi> yet remaines vp and downe) had the praise for many yeares together,</p>
   <p>And now hath the <hi>Portingals</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> continued &amp; kept the honours point for Martiall exploits these latter yeares: but who shall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie away the price in the cadences of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> God only knoweth.</p>
   <p>Thus came the foure Patriarkes of <hi>Hierusalem, Antioch, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by succession of honor, wealth and fame in Gods Church, to rise and fall one after another: and now all decayed, dead and gone from their auncient state, renowne and dignitie in the Church of God here militant on earth. Thus came all Monasticall, Heremiticall, and religious orders of Saint <hi>Anthony,</hi> of Saint <hi>Basill,</hi> of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> of Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> of Saint <hi>Benedict,</hi> of Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> of Saint <hi>Dominicke,</hi> of Saint <hi>Frances,</hi> of Saint <hi>Clare,</hi> of Saint <hi>Briget,</hi> and sundrie other religious orders of men and women, to haue their generation and corruption, by the freedome left of God in humane actions and mans choise, to be good or bad, vertuous or vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to rise and fall by succession, one after another, by merited fame and iust desert, of their life, manners and graces, giuen and employed by them to Gods glorie. In few, thus came the spirituall Knighthoods of the Templers, the Knights of Saint <hi>Iohns,</hi> the Knights of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and now of <hi>Malto;</hi> by a lineall succession of fame, renowne and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to haue panigericall histories set foorth of their prayses. And the like is of later orders and societies of <hi>Carmelists, Carthusians, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouchians, Theatines, Iesuits, Bonhommes, &amp;c.</hi> all which set vpon
<pb facs="4"/> the worlds Theater, represent a mournfull tragedie of mans miserie: how like to flowers, they haue now one and then another order, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie or societie, burgened, blossomed, bloomed and flourished: and yet subiect to the fates of free-will in all humane wights: their deriuatiues are strayed abroad, haue left and are gone from the obedience, deuotion, pietie, pouertie, chastitie, charitie, humilitie, patience, and religious zeale, which was in the primitiues and founders of their Orders.</p>
   <p>What shal we say more, the whole body mysticall of Christ, consisting of the three estates, Ecclesiasticall, Temporall, and Monasticall, do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre the Peripateticall Prince his principle to be true in all things (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon chance and chaunge) concerning the conuersion of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, people and nations to the Catholike faith. For was not the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or beginning of the Mosaicall law a plaine corruption, fall, and decay of the law of nature: all the Gentiles (presently vpon the Orient rise, bright shine, and flourish of the <hi>Israelites</hi> Church, and their <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Monarchie) being giuen ouer into infidelitie and Idolatrie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the law of nature, vnder which the faithfull had liued aboue two thousand yeares, without distinction of Iew or Gentile, vntill this Mosaicall law began. And when for the Iewes sinnes and offences, the period of their Monarchie, and end of their synagogues and temples, honour and religion came, did not then the primitiues of the East Church amongst the Christians carry away the auriflambe of all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous zeale? After that, when the heauie cadens of the East Church came, did not also then the Sonne of iustice, <hi>tanquam sponsus procedens de thalamo suo,</hi> spread abrode the bright beames of his spouses glorie in a transparant light, throughout these our West Ocean cloudes of heathenish darknesse, and giue to these Northren Isles the prerogatiue regall of Prime-birth to his inheritance if the <hi>Britons,</hi> and afterwards the English <hi>Saxons</hi> could haue kept it.</p>
   <p>When by succeding turnes the most part of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Affricke</hi> was corrupted and fallen away, and all Europe conuerted to the sacred A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall Romane faith: when Monasteries began in this North Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world to be built, and great multitudes of Monkes, Friers, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons regulars, Nunnes, and other sacred Saints and holy persons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort themselues together: when Emperors, Kings, Queenes, Princes, Lords and Ladies of all degrees, fled from their regall Palaces to priuat Cels, and left the triumphes of their conquests, the trophees of their loues, and pompes and pleasures of their Courts, to who so would possesse
<pb facs="4"/> them: when here an Anchoresse, there an Hermit, and in euery wood, wild and desert, some sacred virgine, valed, inuested, interred &amp; dead to the world, was to be found: when all fertile soyles, all places of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, profite and content, all earthly wealths, and reuenues of most woorth, were turned into Abbey and Church lands, liuings and liuely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods: when holy emulation was, who might giue most, all gaue of the best, and made this flourishing Isle our Ladies dower: when Kings and Queenes, Priests and Prelates, Lords and Ladies, Monkes and Friers, sacred Virgins and chast Matrons, and all sorts of persons knew their duties, first to God, to his Church, &amp; to her Priests: then to their Prince, to the Commonwealth, and to her Peeres: and lastly each one to another, how, when, and where to commaund or obey: when all things sorted to so sweet a sympatheall harmonie in English hearts, as <hi>England</hi> by a prerogatiue royall of grace diuine, merited to be called <hi>Anglia chara Deo gens:</hi> when flying fame of their rare Angelicall conuersation had fronted the coasts of furthest countries, and occupied with great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of mind the mouthes of most men in the world: when <hi>England, Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Flaunders, Italy, Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Germany, Spaine, Portugal</hi> and <hi>Hungary, Sicilie, Naples</hi> and <hi>Cyprus, Denmarke, Poland</hi> and <hi>Sweden, Scotland, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> did striue for a supremacie to carry away the garland of vertue, deuotion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion on all sides. Then <hi>inimicus homo,</hi> enuying at mans felicitie, to conforme (by permission diuine) Gods concurrence with secondarie causes, to the Philosophers prescript of generation and corruption: in tract of time, corrupting all these Northren and Westerne parts of the world, with contention, ambition, Turcisme, heresie and Pharisaisme; a new generation of Catholike truth and religion begins to labour, and bring soorth their children amongst the <hi>Indians, Antipodies,</hi> and new found world, before vnknowne vnto these Northren and Westerne parts: discouered first by <hi>Portingals</hi> and Friers, and after proceeded in by <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Iesuits. And now listen what followed.</p>
   <p>Amongst many other cadences and fals, the heauiest of all the rest hath bene iudged by many to haue bene our <hi>English</hi> calamities, begun at first by the ambitious aspires of Cardinall <hi>Wolsey,</hi> who affecting the highest Soueraigntie in causes Ecclesiasticall on earth, made a great breach by his contrarie plotting, betwixt King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memorie, and the Sea Apostolicke. And afterward, when vnder her Maiestie, Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> our Soueraigne now regnant, sundrie
<pb facs="5"/> persons of rare indowments, graces and abilities, had retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to places of studie and seruice of their Lord God beyond the seas, where they liued in diuerse Seminaries and Colledges, leading there a right Monasticall and religious life, in a most perfect state of religious profession, calling and order, (as both all other religious Orders, and Ecclesiasticall persons that conuersed with them, or knew their manner of life, and whereunto their whole studie tended, did acknowledge som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in teares) proceeding after their returne hither, <hi>in simplicitate cordis,</hi> with all humilitie, patience, and charitie, abstracted from all gaule, guile, or state affaires: as men most willing to communicate Gods blessings and graces to others, fructifying maruellously in our countrie by them, and accepting as coadiutors with them in this their haruest on Gods behalfe, all and euery religious person of any Order, that would hazard themselues as they did, had our language, and should come with like Apostolicall commission and authoritie wherewith they came: none otherwise then as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> our Apostle first entred this land. Of all the rest of religious Orders, that vndertooke with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries this speciall conflict, the fathers of the societie of <hi>Iesus</hi> were the most in number: who presently forgetting the Apostolicall worke of Seminarie Priests alreadie taken in hand, began foortwith to take a new preposterous and neuer heard of Apostolicall course for conuersion of countries: to wit, by tampering, temporizing and statizing like marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all men, or common souldiers in the field of warre, in all temporall, mundane, and stratagemicall affaires.</p>
   <p>The Seminaries innocently iudging the best of their bad meanings (as charitie, they thought, did bind them) were willing at the first to colour, hide, and conceale all: making the Iesuites cause, attempts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, practises, and proceedings, their owne in euery thing, and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them the preheminence, fame, honour and renowne in euery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction acted by them: vntill at last they were intangled by penall lawes iustly made against them equally, as against the Iesuits: (whose plots and practises, they seemed at first to defend, or at least to winke at) and withall perceiued that the Ies. religious pietie, being turned into meere secular, or rather temporall and laicall pollicie, did occasionate in them an aspire to soueraigntie: and that taking an elle vpon an inch giuen them, did tempt them with an ambitious hope of domineering ouer them, and thereby ouer the whole Cleargie and state Ecclesiasticall: hand then the said Priests for their owne indempnitie, were driuen to prouide
<pb facs="5"/> and looke to themselues. <hi>Et hinc illae lachrymae</hi> of all the euils that since haue ensued, aswell respecting the persecutions inflicted vpon vs all, for their owne peculiar and priuate practises, as also in regard of the hartburnings and contentions, that since haue bene and are at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent betwixt them and the Seminarie Priests: which heauie accident, and of all other most straunge manner of proceeding in the Iesuits, hath caused many to bath their sighes in bloud, and me to theame my speech in teares, to thinke, how that their insolencie hath past so farre beyond the bounds of charity, iustice and all humanity, as I must be forced to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to all the world, what grosse errors they do maintaine, how maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously the people are blinded, and seduced by them: and how dangerous a race they runne to their owne and all others destruction, that will be currents of that fatall course begun by them, with contempt of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and all Ecclesiasticall order, with contempt of sacred Maiestie, and all magisteriall gouernment, and with most turbulent, seditious, and trecherous innouations, supplantations, defamations, and slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of all, that rubbe not on their loftie banke, rebellions and conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies against both Pope and Prince, Church, Commonwealth, and all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states therein.</p>
   <p>And because that (as I haue shewed) there is nothing permanent or certaine here on earth, saue onely the power of Priesthood, for admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string of the Sacraments, (that sentence propheticall standing irrepea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable for euer, <hi>tu es sacerdos in aeternum secundum ordinem Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech</hi>) and that irremoueable ground of truth, graunted only and wholly to the same priestly power, to remaine without all possibilitie of errour in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chaire to the worlds end: all other foundations, assurances, priuiledges and prerogatiues fayling, saue this alone: no Monarch in the world being sure of his estate, no religious Order being certaine of their stand, nor person of most perfection being freed from chance and change, from better to worse, and to haue a hideous downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall this night before to morrow: hereupon (as in our case in hand we haue experience) there rising many thousands of absurdities, whispered into gadding heads, and itching eares by so many intricate politicall plots and deuises, as for to set them downe in a positiue discourse, Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall stile, or historicall method, were but <hi>oleum &amp; operam perdere:</hi> the ignorant multitude (to whom the matter most belongs for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instruction, especially whom the Iesuits vse most, as women gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, trumpetters of their prayses) being not possibly able to conceiue,
<pb facs="6"/> much lesse to carry away so many particular points, as are in question betwixt vs and the Iesuits: and as which (if either they acknowledge an obedience to Gods Church, to the Popes Holinesse, and to all or anie Priest, or a due loyaltie to their Prince and Soueraigne, or a dutifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the common wealth of their natiue land, or any loue or affection to their flesh, bloud, kindred, friends, and generally to all noble, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and humane <hi>English</hi> hearts: or lastly, any care of their owne soules, good name and fame before God and man:) they must heare of, conceiue of, haue beaten into their heads and hearts, and carry about with them for their better information, resolution &amp; conceit of things like Catholiks indeed, where euer they go or happen into company, <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientes auribus, &amp; à veritate auditum auertentes:</hi> which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon case amongst silly women, more deuout then discreet, as alwayes in extreames, either Saints or Diuels. I haue therefore thought vpon the easiest, readiest, briefest, plainest and exactest of any other course or methode, that (I thinke) could possibly be found out, aswell to satisfie all parties, that desire to be resolued of all or any point in question amongst vs: or that will not wilfully and malitiously (as God forbid any Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or well minded Schismaticke should) be caried away with popular applause into manifest errours: as also to deliuer the truth and state of the matter by such interrogatorie questions, Articles or Quodlibets, as shall both touch to the quicke, whatsoeuer is offered, proposed, or comes to be examined, qustioned withall, or reasoned vpon amongst the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or ignorant on any side: and yet withall allay the passions of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie affected Reader, and abate the heate of the haughtie heart in all or any that find themselues touched or grieued therewith. So as by this kind of Methode, they shall haue neither cause iustly to complaine of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie or wrong done or offered vnto them: neither any euasion or means to escape from detecting and making known, what is in their very harts, who are wronged, and who are not, what euery one is bound for his own securitie, to speake, write, beleeue and practise in these things, and how farre he may go therin. For if that by way of a Quodlibet or Thesis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, a man may without blasphemie, sinne, scandall, or any offence in the world, aske whether God or the Diuell be to be honoured: whether our Sauiour Christ could sinne or no: whether our blessed Lady were an adultresse or common woman or not, &amp;c. and withall to bring argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments sillogisticall, enthimematicall and inductiue, or exemplarie <hi>pro &amp; contra</hi> for auerring, and impugning of the same: then to put foorth
<pb facs="6"/> a question, whether a Seminarie Priest or a Iesuite ought sooner to be credited, esteemed of, and followed: whether a Iesuite be a good or a bad man: whether their doctrine be erronious, trecherous and seditious or not: whether it be lawfull to call a knaue a knaue, an hereticke an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, a traitor a traitor, a bastard a bastard, &amp;c. or not: and how, when, where and vpon what occasions such questions, doubts, and interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories may and ought to be proposed, and answer made <hi>pro &amp; contra</hi> agreeing to humane conceit, morall capacitie, and iust censure of and in such cases, cannot iustly incurre any reprehension or blame. Besides, this kind of proceeding shall (as I haue said) both driue the true conceipt of matters the better into peoples hearts, heads and eares: and yet not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate any by galling words (which positiue discourses in accusations do ordinarily occasionate, and cannot be auoyded) further then the rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp of truth in things necessarie to be knowne, must needs stirre and moue the guiltie, constrained by this meanes to hold vp his hand at barre, and to haue his wounds launced, searched and discouered to the very naked heart in open sight.</p>
   <p>This then being the summe of what I intend to write and here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to no other end, as I take my sweet Sauiour and all his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints to witnesse, then to deliuer the ignorant out of errour: to giue to the tersacred Apostolicall Romane Church, faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their due, and to make known what loyaltie, what seruice, what deare affection ought to be in euery subiect (euen by authoritie of all lawes of God or man) in defence of their Prince, countrie and state where they liue: I will hold the indifferent, dispassionate, and diligent Reader, with no longer discourse of a Preamble: but leauing all to his best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, and desiring no euill opinion, sinister construction or hard cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to passe of my well meant indeuors, I commit his sharpe wits, or her swift thoughts to the speedie encounter of this Bucke of the first head in the quest at euery Quodlibeticall relay, set in the pursuit of their game.</p>
