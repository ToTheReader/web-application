   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Little Booke (Deuout Religious in Christ Iesus) being
first written in Italian by the <pb n="4" facs="3"/>
      <hi>R. Father Achilles
Galliardi,</hi> of the Society of IESVS, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered ouer, in written papers
only, vnto an Honourable and very deuout Lady of <hi>Millan,</hi> for her
priuate instruction, and better aduancement in spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all matters, was
some yeares past gotten out of her Closet, and communicated to more, then
it was at first intended. For a little after it was carryed into France and
there transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and printed in the French tongue; but with so many
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, obscurities, and other faults, contrary to the Authors
meaning, that in many places it could hardly be drawne to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perfect
sense: the which <pb n="5" facs="3"/>some persons of great zeale, &amp;
well experienced Maisters of Spirit perceauing, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that so
excellent a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure shold be obscured &amp; clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in such darknes;
did care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully labour to correct what was amisse, by making cleere the
obscure places and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of many passages to their proper
sense, which were before corrupt and intricate: that so being published
anew, it might appeare worthy to be presented to the view of
poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
   <p>In this little Worke then, is conteyned, and set before our
eyes, Doctrine of so great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, endeauouring so to 
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>purify the intention, &amp; reduce the mind of man to
conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vnion with the Will of God, that the view of so great a
light, may perhaps dazle the eyes of such, as yet do looke throgh the clowd
of selfe-loue, and are not fully resolued to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell their inward enemyes;
&amp; in that respect it is not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or directed to any such. And
much lesse is it offered to sensuall minds, who cannot iudge, or
discerne the worth of such a pearle, but would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trāple it vnder
their feete, then tread the pathe which leades to such a treasure.</p>
   <p>But I doubt not to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>me it fitly presented to the reading <pb n="7" facs="4"/>of all
such, as haue entred, or resolued to enter the pathes of Perfection, by
imitation of Christ our Lord, in practise &amp; performance of the
Counsells Euāgelicall. For of such minds we may with reason hope, that
first God for his part, as he hath called them from the pursuite of worldly
vanities to the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his diuine loue: so he will be no lesse
bountiful vnto them in assisting their endeauours with plenty of grace,
vntill he haue perfected the work which himselfe hath begun in their
soules.</p>
   <p>And of their part, as they haue receaued from God so much light,
as to find this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, <pb n="8" facs="5"/>and so much wisdome as to
know the value therof, and so much fortitude of mind as to contemne their
former worldly estate, for the purchase of this field or state of
Religious life: so we may iustly expect at their handes, that according to
the light, wisedome, and fortitude which they haue receaued, they should be
desirous, and glad to labour in digging out the sayd treasure, and
getting it entierly into their owne possession: and therefore also
that they ought neyther to be loath to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the labour of digging, nor
yet to thinke much, if hauing gotten the gold, to seuer it from the earth and
drosse which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereth <pb n="9" facs="5"/>vnto it. And this true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of benefitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues (which is neuer wāting in any wise man that
hath foūd but an earthly Treasure) is as much as this Book requireth, in the
practise of whatsoeuer is heere prescribed.</p>
   <p>For first we be heere aduised to dig &amp; descend into our
own nothing by <hi>Anihilation:</hi> then to cast vp and throw from vs all
the earthly substance which lyeth betweene vs &amp; the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and
this by <hi>Disappropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or as it is called in the Ghospell, by
<hi>Renunciation</hi> of all thinges which we possesse. Then we be led
by the vertue of <hi>Indifferency</hi> to cleanse it also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="10" facs="6"/>found, from the dust of our priuate affections, and
self-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest. And thus the gold being gottē into our possession
it thē teacheth vs first how to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the same from the drosse of
all self-loue, by the <hi>Conformity</hi> of our will to the Will of God.
Secondly, to refine it yet more from the baser kind of mettall, which is
oftē much mixed with this diuine gold, and yet hardly by the eye to be
discerned, but the touchstone of Christ his example doth try it, &amp;
the fire of Charity doth refine it, so that it then comes to be <hi>Aurum
igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> spoken of in the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps, and one thing, as it were, with
the fire it selfe; and this <pb n="11" facs="6"/>is therefore called
<hi>Vniformity.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Then remayneth only, that this gold thus feruent and plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to
the will of him that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, receaue the stampe of the heauenly King,
that so it may be currant coyne in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Court: in which it is only a
Patient, and nothing is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of it, but that it take, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
resistance, what impression the workman is best pleased to
impose. This is the worke of Grace in the soule; the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is God
himselfe, and the stampe he imprinteth in it, is his owne Image: and so
this sixt and highest degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is called
<hi>Deiformity.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In this state the Soule hauing <pb n="12" facs="7"/>first
reiected al impediments to her well-doing, rooted out all euill habits, planted
in her selfe the habits of solid vertues, and seuered from her intention
all selfe-loue; yea hauing by the help of Gods Grace, purified euen her
most inward desires, &amp; all sensible inclinations, frō the
infection of selfe-interest, then is her will not conformed only, but
vnited vnto the will of God, and so transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same, that now it
see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to be her will that worketh, but the will of God which worketh
in her: as though she had giuen her own hart vnto Christ, and (as we read
of <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Stena</hi>) had <pb n="13" facs="7"/>receaued his in
exchange, to be in her, from that tyme for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the beginning and first
motiue of all her operations.</p>
   <p>Of which estate also we may vnderstand the wordes of the
Apostle <hi>Gal</hi> 2. when he sayd, <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Christus:</hi> And I liue now not I, but Christ liueth in me. Much like as we
see the graffe which is inserted into another stock, which liueth indeed
in it selfe, &amp; bringeth forth fruit, but not by the life it had before,
from it owne naturall roote; but by the sap &amp; life it now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth from
the new stock in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which it is graffed, in which it growes, &amp; by which
it liues.</p>
