   <head>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Sober vaine best suits Theologie: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou expectst such elegancy as takes the times, affect some subiect as will beare it.<note place="margin">Audire fabulas, est impedimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum cognitioni veritatis. Arist. 2. Metaphis.</note> Had I laboured with ouer-abundance of * fictions, or flourishes, perhaps they had exposed me, censurable, and disprized this sacred subiect: Therefore I rest more sparing in that kind.</p>
   <p>Two things I would treat of: First, the <hi>matter,</hi> secondly, the <hi>manner</hi> of this History.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for the <hi>matter,</hi> (so farre as I haue dealt) it is Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, and indighted by the holy Spirit of God, not lyable to errour, and needs no blanching.</p>
   <p>In it Theologie sits as Queene, attended by her handmaid<note place="margin">The excellence and vse of this History.</note> Philosophy; both concurring, to make the vnderstanding Reader, a good Diuine, and a wise Moralist.</p>
   <p>As for the Diuinity, it discouers the Almighty in his two great Attributes; in his Mercy, deliuering his Church; in his Iustice, confounding her enemies.</p>
   <p>As for the Morality, it offers to vs the wholy practicke part of Philosophy, dealt out into Ethicks, Politicks, and Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Ethicall part (the obiect whereof is the Manners of a priuate man) ranges through the whole booke, and empties
<pb facs="4"/>
it selfe into the Catalogue of Morall vertues, either those that<note place="margin">Heiland in Eth. Mores instituūt ad virtutem.</note> gouerne the body; as Fortitude, Chap. 9. 2. and Temperance, Chap. 1. 8. or those which direct the soule, either in outward things, as Liberality, Chap. 1. 3. Magnificence, Chap. 1. 6. Magnanimity, Chap. 2. 20. and Modesty, Chap. 6. 12. or in conuersation, as Iustice, Chap. 7. 9. Mansuetude, Chap. 5. 2, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Politicall part (the obiect whereof is Publike Society) instructs, first, in the behauiour of a Prince, to his Subiect; in punishing his vice, Chap. 7. 10. in rewarding of vertues, Chap. 8. 2, 15. Secondly, in the behauiour of the Subiect to his Prince; in obseruing his Lawes, and discouering his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Chap. 2. 22. Thirdly, the behauiour of a Subiect, to a Subiect; in mutuality of loue, Chap. 4. 7. in propagation of peace, Chap. 10. 3.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The Oeconomicall part (the obiect whereof is Priuate So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety) teacheth, first, the carriage of the Wife, to her Husband; in obeying, chap. 1. 22. of the Husband, to his Wife, in ruling, chap. 1. 22. Secondly, of a Father, to his Child, in aduising, chap. 2. 7, 10. of a Child, to his Father, in obseruing. chap. 2. 20. Thirdly, of a Master, to his Seruant, in commanding. chap. 4. 5. of a Seruant, to his Master, in effecting his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, chap. 4. 6.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, in this History, the two principall faculties of the soule are (nor in vaine) imployed.</p>
   <p>First, the Intellect, whose proper obiect is Truth. Secondly,<note place="margin">Arist. Eth 3. Obiectum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis non est nisi bonum. Arist. Eth. 10.</note> the Will, whose proper obiect is * Good, whether Philosophicall, which that great Master of Philosophy cals * Wisdome; or The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicall, which we poynt at now, hoping to enioy hereafter.</p>
   <p>Who the Pen-man of this sacred History was, or why the<note place="margin">De dubijs non definies, sed suspensam te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas sententiam; Seneca de for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mali vita.</note> name of God (as in few other parts of the Bible) is vnmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this, it is immateriall, and doubtfull. For the first, it is enough for an vncurious questioner to know, it was indited
<pb facs="4"/>
by the Spirit of God: for the second, let it suffice, that, that Spirit will'd not here to reueale his name.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As for the Manner of this History (consisting in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphrase, the adiournment of the Story, and interposition of Meditations) I hope it hath not iniured the Matter: For in this, I was not the least carefull, to vse the light of the best Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors (<hi>Authoritatis quorum sum germanus</hi>) not daring to goe vn-led, for feare of stumbling. Some say, Diuinity in Verse, is incongruous and vnpleasing: such I referre to the <hi>Psalmes of Dauid,</hi> or the Song of his sonne <hi>Salomon,</hi> to be corrected. But in these lewd times, the salt, and soule of a Verse, is obscene scurrility, without which it seemes dull, and liuelesse: And though the sacred History needs not (as humane doe) Poetry, to perpetuate the remembrance, (being by Gods owne mouth blest with Eternity) yet Verse (working so neere vpon the soule, and spirit) will oft times draw those to haue a Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in familiarity, who (perchance) before, scarce knew there was such a Booke.</p>
   <p>Reader, be more than my hasty pen stiles thee: Reade me with aduice, and thereafter iudge me, and in that iudgement censure me. If I iangle, thinke my intent thereby, is to toll bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ringers in. Farewell.</p>
