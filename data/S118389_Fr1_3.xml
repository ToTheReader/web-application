   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Christian I presume thou art that readest this booke, curteous I call thee, because I hope to find thee so: it is as much as I desire, and surely no lesse doth mine Author deserue His name is <hi>Brucioli,</hi> by birth an Italian, his countrey (as I guesse) <hi>Florence,</hi> and therfore a stranger; if a stranger, intreat him as a stranger, that is, gently &amp; kindly, and know that it is thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if it be not thy curtesie so to do: for there is a dutie which belongeth vnto strangers, commanded in the Law, and commended in the Gospell. As a stranger by birth, so good must be done vnto him in generall, but as he is not a stranger frō the faith, so we are bound to shew him special fauor: for so the Apostle S. <hi>Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> willeth vs for to do; Do good (saith he) vnto all men, but especiallie or chieflie to those which are of the houshold of faith. Of this houshold was <hi>Brucioli,</hi> and not of that other houshold of good workes, where none but merit-mongers and superarrogant or superogating Papists dwel. Reade his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie, and thou wilt confesse as much: there is often mention of faith, of iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by faith only, of faith and iustification by imputation: still faith comes in, as if our
<pb facs="7"/>
actions were as insipid and vnpleasant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, as the old sacrifices were vnsauory without salt. The Law requireth salt in all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, <hi>Brucioli</hi> requireth faith in euery acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he maketh it the subiect of his discourse, brings it in in euerie chapter, in euerie page, yea almost in euerie line, as if it were the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherunto all the lines of his commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie must of force haue bene drawne. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his booke therfore in thine hands, and entertain his doctrine into thine heart. Scorne him not because hee is not attired after the fine Italian fashion, for this were to accept of him for his good apparrell and not for his good partes, which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> noted for a fault in the Iewes. <hi>Brucioli</hi> is now in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land &amp; not in Italie, &amp; therfore must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tēt with such apparrel as our coūtry affords, he hath the best that could be gottē for him, for indeed it is all that could be gotten, either he must haue this or none, &amp; better this then none, for I hope it is good &amp; strong, though it be not very costly &amp; fine: the finest thredes be not euer the best, for thē spiders wold vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do weauers &amp; spinners, &amp; be set a work more thē they be, &amp; yet I cannot say but they work too fast many times: but alas it is in sucking soure out of sweet, &amp; drawing forth poyson from hony. These creatures I do not like, the Lyon naturally hateth the mouse, the sheepe
<pb facs="8"/>
a wolf, &amp; naturally I do abhor these men frō my very heart, &amp; therfore if any spider come vpon my book, it shall be lawful for any mā either to sweep, or els to blow him away, for he is but a light person of himselfe, and easily blowne away that spendeth his time in this sort, how heauy soeuer hee prooue to others. They say there be no spiders in Ireland, their houses are built of such a wood as breedeth none: O that England were as Ireland in this respect, and that all our houses were built of this kind of timber, then would the house of God go better forward then it doth, and we shold be fitter men to be temples of the holy Ghost thē we are: but now the world is as ful of these wicked creatures, as euer Egipt swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with frogs: there was no house, no place in Egypt but there were frogges to be found: there is no place, no house almost in Englād where there are not some of these venimous spiders to be found: a man shal find thē euery wherein citie &amp; fields, in beds and at boord, in court &amp; country. If a yong man write, they say his head is too greene: if an old man, they say his best is past: if a mā of middle age, they say at that time his body is more fit for actiō, then his mind is apt to contēplation: so that neither old, nor yong, nor middle aged wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can please thē, &amp; no maruel, for I thinke they cannot please themselues. But chiefly these spider-catching <hi>Zoilusses</hi> do shoot the
<pb facs="8"/>
venime of their tongues against painfull tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators of bookes which seeke other mens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, &amp; not their owne, reaping not the fruit of that which they haue sowne, and like candles spending thēselues to giue others light. But what saith M. <hi>Momus</hi> with his crue of carping knights, these men mar all with their translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it was neuer well with vs (that is, that are learned) since so many books were translated into english, their labor were better spared thē imployed, they corrupt bookes, misinterpret writers, are enemies vnto the cōmon wealth, &amp; enemies to all good learning. If this be all they haue to say, they say in word somewhat, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect nothing: for either they take that for a salt, which is not so indeed, or els they knowe not how to distinguish the abuse frō the thing, &amp; so speake against they know not what. Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors haue their faults &amp; abuses as well as other men, as when they translate foolish &amp; vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or wicked &amp; vngodly books, or els mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>translate &amp; misinterpret books, and then the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse proceedeth either of malice or of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rāce: if of malice their reproofe is iust; if of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, blame thē not, vnles it be affected: for the best that is may misse in a strāge language, whē no man knoweth all in his owne tongue. And thus far reacheth their complaint against the abuse of translations, which may in no wise be excused. As for the harme that cōmeth by making learning too cōmon, mē of cōmon
<pb facs="9"/>
iudgement may by vulgar examples easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them. The sunne &amp; moone, fire and water are profitable, &amp; yet common: the Philosopher saith, <hi>Bonum quò communius, eò melius</hi>: good the commoner it is, the better it is: if it bee true in philosophie, it is true in diuinity, &amp; therfore S. <hi>Paul</hi> wisheth that all men were learned as hee was, and that all men could speak with diuers tongues as he did, &amp;c. I would that these men which think they haue S. <hi>Paules</hi> learning, had S <hi>Paules</hi> zeale (so it were according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) to seeke other mens good and not their own; for now marchāts do not monopolize the goods of a citie more thē these do appropriate vnto thēselues the learning of whole vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; whē they haue it, what do they with it, but keep it vnto thēselues? Because I wold not be of this odious sect of men (most curteous &amp; Christian reader) I haue at vacant times trāsla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to that measure of knowledge which God hath giuen me, both this book and some others, as <hi>the historie of the Iesuits,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Philosophy of the Stoickes,</hi> which with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missiō of my superiors, I mean shortly to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, if God wil, and health permit me so to do. Take this booke in good part: accept of my good wil, fault pardon &amp; amend, whether they be the Printers or the translators: the preface is the Authors &amp; not mine, it escaped both me &amp; the Printer before I was aware, the rest read corrected in the latter end of the booke.</p>
