Soueraigne Lord &amp; King, in that his most ioy all Title, of King of great
Brittain, France, and Ireland, rancketh in the forefront thereof (God, and Gods
grace) by it his anoynted elected King, and our Supreme head and gouernour, in
lieu vnto God for thus anoynting him with the oyle of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, aboue all
that he hath no fellowes, and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him so high, that all the people to
him, as vnto God, shall bend, kneele, obey, and fulfill his Royall will, and
obserue his Lawes, and Statutes, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie to the whole world
professeth publickely, to honour, serue, and to set foorth the praise
of this God, who hath so honored him: he writes himselfe therefore, <hi>A
defender of the Faith, and a maintainer of his Truth.</hi> Opposing all the
Enemies of the same by sword, word, and pen, and nothing more doth his
most royall heart delight in, and with any to be conuersant, then with the
most Reuerend Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, Bishops and others thereof to dispute, and
with <hi>Dauids</hi> Blessed man day and night, to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised therein,
sollacing his soule with that sweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing greene pastures of
Scriptures, when as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were passing there time in sports in giuing
content to the flesh, yet his Maiesty to the soule,
<pb facs="3"/> witnes that most learned and godly Booke of the
Lords prayer, written by his Maiestie the last Christmas. Such a most
blessed Lord and King, I hope such attendants, that affect Gods honour
and seruice, &amp; preseruation of there country where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they liue.</p>
   <p>Amongst many of those Honorable, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull attendants
on that most sacred person of his Maiestie. I humbly attend you noble
Sir, to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize like your good Maister Truth. There hath beene many
vntruths diunlgd in the world of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, that should come this
Sessions, such as a Chaundler, that should lend money, and them to whom
he lent it, by the high way to robbe them of it againe. Likewise a speach
of an Inholder at Saint Albons which should Robbe, and kill his Guests in
London highwayes all which, your Worshippe knowes right well to be most
grosse vntruths. To giue the world satisfaction I haue hastily written
this small Pamphlet, wherein is nothing but truth, your selfe being an eye,
and eare witnes being, on the Bench a Commissioner in London: I humbly
craue pardon at your Worships hands, for what in this shall seeme
amisse to your learned Iudgement by Gods grace I hope ere long in another
nature, to your vewe shall be presented to be amended vouchsafe your kind
acceptance, and Patronage of this for this time, and I will rest.</p>
