      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Erein, against <hi>Romanistes,</hi> I alleadge
Auncientes, euen such as themselues
doe graunt woorthy to be heard in the
matter. Against <hi>Nouelistes,</hi> I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
such as themselues hold most
woorthy to be listened vnto. And to
deale otherwise, were to make the Plea, partiall.</p>
   <p>As for <hi>Rome,</hi> the Talmudistes dealt wittily, when
not onely one sayth, he saw <hi>Messiah</hi> amongst poore La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,
without <hi>Romes</hi> Gates: but also, when (by way of
parable) they teach, that what time <hi>Salomon</hi> matched
with <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter, the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> pitched a
Reed in the Sea, which grew to a Rocke (a Reedish-rocke)
whereupon <hi>Rome</hi> was built. Old Idolatry ouerturned old
<hi>Rome</hi> (howsoeuer, some Chappels may yet stand there)
and new Idolatrie (doubtlesse) will quickly ouerturne the
New. For faythfull is he, that by <hi>S. Iohn</hi> hath spoken it.</p>
   <p>As for the <hi>Nouelistes,</hi> who count euery passage to a
new faction, for grouth in the fayth (which is indeed, but
the multiplying of a scab into a scurfe) <hi>Iotham</hi> in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of the Trees, annoynting the Bramble, hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their destinie. The fire shall come out of their sides,
and consume their corporations as Stubble: For the
Plant which God hath not planted, must be pulled vp by
the Rootes.</p>
   <p>When I had an irregular Conceit of our Churches
<hi>Discipline</hi> (as for the <hi>Fayth,</hi> I held it close, and somuch
<hi>Communion</hi> with the Church, as my trauailes then
<pb facs="58"/>
could well afforde) I then did perceiue in the <hi>Nouelistes</hi>
(not onely some Absurdities of <hi>Opinion,</hi> but also) a flat
<hi>Opposition</hi> betweene their <hi>Fayth</hi> and <hi>Practise.</hi> As
for whith cause, the Archbishop <hi>Whitguift</hi> could some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
say; <hi>If I were of</hi> Cartwrights <hi>opinion, I would
be of the</hi> Brownistes <hi>Practise:</hi> so, the like caused mee in
wordes and writinges, still to be taxing of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
I found them (no lesse then the <hi>Romanist</hi>) iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
implacable. Which as it continued to the time of
that <hi>Conference,</hi> which was to be held at <hi>Hampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>
before the King; so then, after bragges of their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable
Champions, I was braued by them in the Citie
of <hi>London,</hi> as one that should haue no part in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Prey, because of yore I had not playde their prize.
<hi>Sed apagè, vah,</hi> I shame to thinke, how they there fomed
out their owne shame. But more I blush, that they should
in hugger-mugger still striue to vphold their Gyant of
Straw, hauing broken off his hands and feete so lately,
in presence of the Arke of Testimonie. He may feare
litle Birds at the first; but no doubt, they will ere long
sit vpon his pate, and picke Strawes out of his nose. In the
hope whereof, I so cease this speach.</p>
