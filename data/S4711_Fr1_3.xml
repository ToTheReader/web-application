Marie: but at baptisme, wee in our owne per sons doe as it were ratifie it: protesting that Christ shal be our husband, and that from that time we wil take our farewel of the dyuell, the world, the flesh and al our enmes.</p>
   <p>Thus being married before such witnesses, we cannot reclaime our league of chastitie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we wil haue God himselfe, and our mother the Church, and Christ himselfe with al his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye espouse, to beare witnesse of condemnation against vs, to the ioy of Satan our capital ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie.</p>
   <p>And therefore where the deuel is called a Dragon with seuen heads for his subtilty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>: and ten hornes, for his crueltie: and now is dust and ashes by nature prone to euill, and therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to withstand him: it behoueth him to take that for his weapon which may keepe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </gap> praier.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, when man is enuironed with eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when a guilty conscience warreth against him, when the world by falshood, and the flesh by her allurements is about to deceiue him then is standeth him vpon to take praier in hande, that hee maye bee able to conquer al those mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Hydras or rather deceitful whors, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

person that giueth place to the Dyuell: or that he dooth to his power make Christ a wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping widdowe, as curssed Ierusalem did: or that Satan by trapping him in his whoorish trickes did vtterlie vndoe him: it woulde not onlye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite him, but euen enforce him to praier, which is the onely meanes that is able to keepe vs true and faithfull wiues to Christ Iesus.</p>
   <p>And therefore the Lord our gratious Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our weighing with himselfe not so much mannes naughtinesse, for the which bee deserueth a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorcement: as Satans woonderous pollic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Come vnto me, saith he, al ye that are heauy and laden, and I wil refresh you. Behold, not withstanding our diuers and sundrie fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons committed with Satan: yet the Lorde our gratious husband calleth vs vnto him, as not willing to diuorse vs: and inuiteth vs to praier, that knowing and acknowledging our owne weakenes, to withstand the whoorish intisemē<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s of the Diuell, we may desire him our h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d to help and assist vs.</p>
   <p>And truelie, as for praier, we ought so much the more readilie to vse it, because by it wee
<pb facs="6"/>
pearse the heauens, because by it we come into the Groomes chamber, and flie as with winges into the lap of our louing husband Iesus. And what honest wife would not fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e to hir husband, when an harlot seeketh to abuse hir?</p>
   <p>Sith therefore Satan euen from the wombe by harlotish trippings seeketh to withdrawe vs from so louing an husband as Christ Iesus, who shead his owne pretious hart bloud to redeeme vs: then, whensoeuer he attempteth to trap vs, it shall be our best safety to leap into his wounds and to runne into his bosome by seruent &amp; faith full praier, that beeing married to him in the vertue of the couenant, we may continue chast to the end.</p>
   <p>Otherwise, if being tempted we suffer him to ouertempt vs: we shew our selues not onelie despisers of his bloud, but also prophaners of so holie a marriage, which was kept by the blessed and glorious Trinitie in the wombe of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Marie.</p>
   <p>And with what face shall wee present our selues before so louing an husband as Iesus Christ at the day of iudgement, if that we yeeld heere to the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e may continue as chast wiues, to liue with him in ioy for euer.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, where Christ our husband cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Come: if we will be counted his wiues, and no whores, let vs without lingring, alwaies repaire vnto him in faithfull praier, and let vs
<pb facs="6"/>
talke with him in his glorious chamber, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech him, as he is a louing husband, that he wil take pittie vpon vs, and bestowe vppon vs the gift of spirituall chastitie, that so wee may be defended from the whorish Pharao, whoe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about by al meanes to make him a desolate widowe.</p>
   <p>But if man be stricken downe with the lawe, and the temptation of his vnworthines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw him from presenting his praiers vnto the Maiestie of God: then must hee consider the curssed Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
