shall not repent me of my tedious trauell in these
rites and customes of Generations long since past,
which whosoeuer vndertaketh, shall finde the
way long and thornie, the path ouergrowne and
hardly discerneable, the Guides few to direct, and
those speaking in strange languages, and many apt
to disccurage him, because themselues are either
lazie and will not, or lame and cannot walke the
same way. But now (through Gods assistance)

made on the way, such as they are (and such
some are, as not obserued before) humbly craue
