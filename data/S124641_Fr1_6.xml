   <l>Who onely minds Gods glory, by his gift,</l>
   <l>And neyghbours good, without sinister drift;</l>
   <l>Famine (familiar vnto rogues that range)</l>
   <l>Shall not come neere his garner, nor his grange:</l>
   <l>His fields, with Corne, abundant crop shall couer,</l>
   <l>His vines with Grapes, his hedge with Roses ouer;</l>
   <l>His downes with sheepe, his dayery grounds with Neat;</l>
   <l>His mounts with Kids, his moors with Oxen great;</l>
   <l>His groues with droues (increasing night and day;)</l>
   <l>His hils with Heards, his smiling meads with Hay;</l>
   <l>His fens with foule, his pils, and pooles with Fish;</l>
   <l>His trees with fruits, with plenty euery dish;</l>
   <l>Content and health (the best of earthly blisse)</l>
   <l>Shall euermore remaine with him and his;<note place="margin">Phil. 4.11.12. 1 Tim. 6.6.</note>

   <l>Nor shall the voyce of mercy him salute,</l>
   <l>Who, in effect, to needy moane was mute:</l>
   <l>Millions of masses cannot him redeeme,</l>
   <l>Nor all Church-treasure euer ransome him,</l>
   <l>From all-thought-passing pangs of wretchednes;</l>
   <l>As, endlesse, caselesse, and remedylesse.</l>
