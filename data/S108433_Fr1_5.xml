   <head>TO THE <hi>TRVELY SINCERE</hi> READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a common Apologie <hi>(Iudicious and Christian Reader)</hi> that men are Ioath to write because so many write. It is true in deed that this is the first of the three main <hi>remoraes</hi> in way of writing: for there be too many bookes, either to no end, or to an evill end; the former blurreth paper, the latter blotteth the mind; the former cloyes, the latter corrupteth, like flies in hot weather. The other two letts are neglect of mens paines, &amp; storming at the trueth: yet for al these, the abuse of a good thing or evill inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>animent, must not stop the use of it. Yea,
<note place="margin">

            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause so many speake (as the Philosopher saith) <hi>I was ashamed to be silent.</hi> Manie poysons must haue many antidotes. As the Popes shop, wanteth no sort of workmen; some to mine, and some to vndermine; some to cosen, some to cut; some to poyson, some to dispute; some to fight, and some to giue the Alarum: so with these souldierly <hi>Ignatians, or men-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/>treatise doth incounter; not teaching treacheries and treasons, or an <hi>Equivocall holy warre,</hi> but the true art of the holy warre indeed. Instances of such flery and flying ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents wee haue had too many at home, as <hi>Morton</hi> for the Northerne rebellion, <hi>Saunders</hi> for Ireland; and to omit the treasons against the person of the Queene, by <hi>Parrie, Balliard, Somerfield, Watson, Lopes,</hi> and the rest. Would not <hi>Garnet</hi> at one stroke haue cut the heads from vs all? These fellowes <hi>haue more cunning then Archimedes;</hi> they would move the whole <hi>earth, if they had but England to stand on.</hi> It is to be feared that they haue got too much footing, and that wee haue more <hi>Legions of those evil Spirits</hi> amongst vs then wee <hi>are aware of. Paracelsus</hi> telleth vs, when frogges heap together <hi>one upon another, it is a signe of a plague;</hi> so wee haue cause to feare those plaguy froggs, whose doctrine and practice sound nothing but treachery and Armes:
<note place="margin">Classasicum bellisacri.</note> witnesse <hi>Shoppius</hi> in his Alarurn, &amp; manie others of that graine. They tell us indeed that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands feare of them, is like that of <hi>Alexanders</hi> espiall, who discovering <hi>Apes</hi> imitating a march from the mountaines tooke them to be souldiers indeed.

They mocke and disgrace <hi>the Lyon,</hi> whose onely cure and best securitie consisteth in their ruine. Against their Apish flatteries and overtures of peace,

      <hi>the law of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving</hi>

<note place="margin">Simia sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per erit si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.</note> He that relieth upon the faith of the faithlesse papist, may one day, with woefull experience, say as <hi>Bricidas</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> said, <hi>I was wounded, my shield betraying me.</hi> As for the matter,
<note place="margin">Prodente me clypio, vulneratus sum.</note> the generall subiect thereof hath been handled by divers; but in every particular as here, and with this Methode not by any that I read of. I haue made Gods word the ground and rule of my <hi>System.</hi> The application of the generall rules, exemplified to the particulars, is without partialitie. My freedome of speech (I hope) shall (as <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Sicil</hi> said) <hi>be unseasonable to no good man, be he never so great:</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> for I hate no mans person, no not the enemie, but his sin. Herein you may perceiue, as <hi>Basil</hi> said of Historie, the <hi>vertues</hi> of the <hi>good, and the vices of the wicked.</hi> Here from the cunning of the enemie, wee may picke some points of discipline; and from their sinnes against us, we may learn to mend our own. As for the frame of the worke; if the Art cannot commend the matter, yet let the matter commend the Art. I haue endeavoured <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with simplicitie of phrase &amp; aptnesse of dictiō</hi> (as becommeth the subiect) to expresse the truth, then to adorn with colours. As with <hi>Hierom, every mans writtings deceiveth himselfe:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Vnū quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que sua scripta fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt.</note> and as <hi>Galen, It is hard for a man not to erre;</hi> so I say with <hi>Austin</hi> (cōcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his books) <hi>what good thou shalt find, let it be thine, &amp; mine in affection: but whatsoever is amisse, let it neither be thine nor mine in protection,</hi> but rather in correction, which I shall willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beare. I know I shall not please all (neyther would I) yet I hope I shal profit some. The censure, of the malevolēt <hi>Momus,</hi> &amp; envious <hi>Zoilus</hi> without, I weigh not: for it is enough to me
<pb facs="10"/>
      <hi>to satisfie conscience if not calumnie;</hi> If within I shall meete with a <hi>Phalaris,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Hostē apud me, &amp; in meo penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li reperire. Lips. de Const.</note> I shall with <hi>Langius</hi> be content with my lot to haue a <hi>bosome enemie:</hi> but till I haue proofe I will neyther prejudge nor feare. And since my aime is neyther lucre nor applause, but the good of Gods Church; if I be not well taken, my good intent shall make good my private losse; the favourable acceptance of this, may incourage me to take paines in subiects of the like nature. If any be disposed to quirke me for making so many gates to so poore an edifice; let the necessitie of <hi>action,</hi> and the opportunite of <hi>occasion</hi> excuse me: and had it not been to shun tediousnes, I could out of this subiect haue made a large quarter to every gate. Let the largeness of the subiect, and varietie of aspect excuse my prolixitie, and leade you along to reade without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying: adventure but your patience, as I haue done my paines; and I doubt not but you shall find the <hi>last wine the best.</hi> But without further Apologie I leave it to your liking, and your liking to Gods disposing.</p>
