Amongst a number of which lawdable Artes &amp; Sciences, let vs make our consideration of Chirurgery, the maintain<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

      </gap> and restorer of our healthes: For it is a most true receiued opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst worthy writers, that Chirurgery is (indeede) an ancient part of Phisicke, as it appeareth by <hi>Iaques Guillemeau</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> ordinary Chirurgian to the now French King: who auoucheth, that before Phisick was inuented, created, or found out, Chirurgery was practized, and sufficiently knowne in al places: as it appeareth (saith he) by the testimonie of <hi>Homer,</hi> in the second booke of his <hi>Ilyades:</hi> who wrote the valiant enterprises, and trauels of <hi>Vlisses,</hi> as did <hi>T<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

      <hi>Europa:</hi> I had heere likewise thought good to haue spoken somewhat of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> but I must consesse his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine hath a more pregnant sence, then my wit or reach is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue: onely this I can say by experience, that I haue practised certaine of his inuentions Chirurgicall, the which I haue found to be singular good, &amp; worthy of great commendations. How be it, much strife I know there is betwen the <hi>Galenistes</hi> and the <hi>Paracelsians,</hi> as was in times past betweene <hi>Aiax</hi> and <hi>Vlisses,</hi> for <hi>Achilles</hi> Armour. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, for my part I will heere set vp my rest &amp; contentation, how impertinent and vnseemely so euer it make shew: That is to say, if I finde (eyther by reason or experience) any thing that may be to the good of the Patients, and better increase of my knowledge &amp; skil in the Arte of Chirurgery, be it eyther in <hi>Galen</hi> or <hi>Paracelsus;</hi> yea, <hi>Turke, Iewe,</hi> or any other Infidell: I will not refuse it, but be thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God for the same. How be it, I will in no wise meddle with their Infidelity, though I imbrace their knowledge and skill in humane verityes and inuentions, be it eyther in Phisicke or Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, or any of the other laudable Sciences. Now I will discourse no further, vntill a more fit opportunity be offered: But very briefly I meane heere to demonstrate and deliuer vnto the friendly Reader, the cure of a certaine vnnaturall tumor or abscesse, called in Latin, <hi>Struma:</hi> of the <hi>Arabians, Steophala:</hi> but generally, in English, it is called, <hi>the Kings or Queenes Euill:</hi> A disease repugnant to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: which grieuous malady is knowne to be miraculously cured &amp; healed, by the sacred hands of the Queenes most Royall Maiesty, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Diuine inspiration and wonderfull worke and power of God, aboue mans skill, Arte and expectation: Through whose Princely Clemency, a mighty number of her Maiestyes most Loyall subiects, and also many strangers borne, are dayly cured and healed, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise would most miserably haue perished. For many of them (their pouerty was such) were not able to pay but a very little or nothing at all for their cure. And so I heere conclude, that as God by his diuine giftes, doth cure this <hi>Strumous</hi> Malady: so also of his great goodnes, he doth giue Artificiall giftes, for the curing of the said Infirmity. But whereas Artificiall giftes doe many times fayle thee, doe his deuine giftes take place &amp; reuaile: as after more at large shall appeare.</p>
