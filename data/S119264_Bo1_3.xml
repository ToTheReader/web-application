   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Greeke</hi> Poets that
lived in former time,
were held in more
honour, and estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
amongst the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of learning in
that Nation, than the
<hi>Latin</hi> Poets were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Latins,</hi>
insomuch that the most exquisite wits of the
<hi>Greekes</hi> did write diverse Comments vpon
<hi>Homer,</hi> as likewise sundry Philosophers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them; and namely <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (in my
mind, the Prince, and <hi>instar omnium,</hi> of them
all) wherein our Countrimen the <hi>Latins</hi> (I
speake not of those, who lived in the age,
wherein Poetry had not yet begnn to haue
<pb n="9" facs="13"/>
any the least acceptance, (men which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had leisure to lay the plough, or the lance
out of their hands) but I meane those in these
latter ages, who haue applied themselves to
Philosophy, and the more graver studies) have
so opposed themselves amongst the gentle
<hi>Muses,</hi> as that they thought it a disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
once to touch, or come neere them: as
if but glancing vpon these milder kindes of
studies, had beene the ready way to haue
flung them headlong from that heigth of
wisdome to which they did aspire: certainly
hereby they did defraud themselves of no
meane delight vnto their wits, and a great
refreshing and rejoycing of their mindes and
spirits, in shutting wilfully their eares, against
that delectable sweete harmony of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets.
The blame hereof partly the perverse
obstinate natures of those times, and partly
the times themselves, and ill received opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
must beare. As for me, (having so war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
an Authour for so weighty a matter,
as <hi>Aristotle</hi>) I will never make nice to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixe
these so pleasing and sweete remissions,
and vnbending of the minde, with the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of my more serious studies, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vpon the merry <hi>Muses,</hi> as now of late
I haue done vpon <hi>Virgils Bucolickes,</hi> out of
<pb n="10" facs="14"/>
which I haue picked a deeper sense in many
places, than the vulgar common Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
can conceive. For, did these <hi>Aeglogues</hi>
containe in them no farther hidden matter,
than the very bare barke of the words makes
shew of, I cannot thinke that the Author had
needed to haue taken three yeares time to
haue brought them to perfection, especially
borrowing the greatest part of the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
out of <hi>Theocritus</hi> the Sicilian Poet; Adde
hereunto, that he vndertooke this taske to
present the greatest wits of <hi>Rome</hi> withall,
namely <hi>Cornelius Gallus, Asinius Pollio, Varus,
Tucca,</hi> yea the Prince himselfe <hi>Augustus;</hi> all
which (excellently learned men themselues,
and much conversant and accustomed in the
best and chiefest writers, both in Greeke and
Latin) would doubtlesse never haue beene
so taken, and infinitely delighted, with such
kindes of light matter as Pastoralls, had they
not affoorded some hidden meaning and
sense of a higher nature. Againe, when he
once set himselfe to insinuate into their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and grace by this worke, it is to be
thought that <hi>Virgil,</hi> vnder these sporting pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of pastorall verse, did finely and neatly
as it were, inlay, and couch many things
tending to their praise and commendation,
<pb n="11" facs="14"/>
and sundry other matters, befitting them to
take notice of; which being vnderstood
rightly, might affect the Readers mindes,
like the elegant and artificiall Pictures, which
lay secretly hidden vnder the statue of the
<hi>Sileni.</hi> Hereunto may likewise farther be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the matter itselfe and subject of this
worke doth plainly witnesse in sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that it is not simply, but figuratively spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
vnder a shadow: which makes me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the more at <hi>Servius Honoratus,</hi> who will
in this booke admit of no <hi>Allegories,</hi> but
onely in that passage of <hi>Virgils</hi> grounds,
which were lost: when as many other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are therein manifestly and meerely alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall
and darke: wherefore I have thought
good, to signifie to the world, that I haue
trimmed vp these Allegories for their vse, and
behoofe, who are delighted with the reading
of <hi>Virgil,</hi> (as who is it that it not?) to the end
that the finest wits might haue a certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past,
and delicate foode fitting their taste, and
might be drawne to mount higher than the
simple sense of the very bare letter. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I shall hereby restore the Poet to the true
scope and aime of his meaning, and shew,
that his purpose was not to consume so
much precious time, and exquisite verses in
<pb n="12" facs="15"/>
triviall light matters of no moment; and that
those things which <hi>Theocritus</hi> in a ruder bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
age, did sing in a Pastorall plaine sense,
<hi>Virgil</hi> here doth apply to the <hi>Romans,</hi> making
them his owne, vnder a mysticall vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
worthy the cares of the most learned:
notwithstanding I make no doubt but I
have fitted some of his verses with such an
allegory and explication, as the Authour
himselfe never dreamed of; as likewise many
other, I have as aptly applyed, according to
his scope and meaning in the writing: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
yet I know I haue done a thing, neither
vnacceptable, nor vnprofitable to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
Greeke writers haue done the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my time, in expounding of <hi>Homer;</hi> and
<hi>Donatus</hi> in our language, hath attempted and
performed as much in his comment vpon <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
and this Poet, where he vndertakes
by his Glosses, to bewray their sense
and meaning, &amp;c.</p>
