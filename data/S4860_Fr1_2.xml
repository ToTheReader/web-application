      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost Courteous younge Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, presuming vpon your great Curtesie: I haue beene so bolde as to present your estate, in token and wish of an happie new yeere, with these the first fruites of my poore Presse, finished since the cūming in of the same.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Surely, the traueill of a Gentleman whom I know not, no not so mutch as by name, much lesse by person: And concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the copie, as hee that brought it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me made reporte, that it was transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Italian, by a Gentleman, a freeinde of his, desyringe mee that it might bee printed.

      <hi>alwayes desirous to farther the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and procure the delite of all men, by publishinge bookes of semblable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: thought good to dedicate the same vnto you, iudging it in this respect a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent more meet for your most flourishing degree: for that I perceiue it to haue bin first written by a Noble and graue per sonage of Italy, and directed vnto his nephew, a younge Gentleman also of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parentage, for the better conforming of his behauiour at his entrance into the Courte, as it may appeare by his Epistle hereafter folowing. Now for that this case is cōmon vnto most of you, and aboue all other, the studie of ciuell Curtesie, most incident vnto your calling, I am the bolder to craue your Courteous counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and freindly fauour in accepting the same now in English at my handes,</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>as a testimonie of my seruiceable heart, and good meaning towardes you. And that receiuing it now from mee as your owne, you would vouche safe of your great curtesie to take both me and it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your assured protection: and to defend both the present, and him that offereth it, from the spightfull toungues of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious carpers. And in so dooinge, you shall euermore binde mee to employe what traueill and seruice I can, to the aduauncing and pleasuring of your most excellent degree.</hi>
