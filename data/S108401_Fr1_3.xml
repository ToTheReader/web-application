   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O often as I consider (Right worshipfull) our happie daies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the blessed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of a most gracious Princesse, &amp; howe we are become euen a wonder as it were &amp; an astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto many Nations, for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that we enioy by her meanes: so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten me thinke euen with melting hearts in a sweete conceite, we should cast our selues downe before the Lorde, and make a double vow vnto him. First y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we wil with perfect hearts and most willing mindes knowe and serue such a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="10"/>
God, as amidst so manie dangerous deuises of intended ouerthrowe to her person, so mightily preserued her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, and so mercifully hath at this daie set her ouer vs, dailie still dealing both with her and vs according to his olde louing kindenesse and mercie, keeping her to vs in despite of all the caytifes on the earth. Secondly that with hand and with heart, with bodie and bowels, and with estate, whatsoeuer the Lorde shall giue vs within or without vs, wee wil honor and obey, pray for, &amp; preserue to our powers amongst vs, so famous &amp; renouned, yea so woonderfull an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all comfort and good vnto vs, in respect of other Princes of the earth. But O the sinne of our soules, and the staines of our thankelesse heartes in both these duties so due ten thousande times of vs For whome we should knowe, we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to knowe, as his mercies binde vs, our mightie GOD and heauenlie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And whome we should thus obey and honour, pray for, and praise God for day and night, with verie weeping and woe, that we can be no more thankefull
<pb facs="10"/>
vnto her, and for her our nurcing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and most gracious Queene, her we disobey in holes and in corners, (to say no worse) and dead without feeling, not considering the blessing of her, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke both our God, and her graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart to displeasure with vs. What proofe this latter hath, and what vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wished matter to furnish out a larger complaynt, I spare to speake, I rewe to thinke it, there are witnesses moe, than I woulde there were, that knowe it. Those thinges which more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeme my penne and paper, I presume vnto your worshippes to folowe a litle further, and first the neglect that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth euerie where to furnishe the roomes alotted thereunto with suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent men both for giftes and goodwill to discharge the duties of true ministers. A thing euer commanded, a thing euer needefull, &amp; a thing in these daies of ours euen aboue all daies required, both in thankefulnes to the Lorde, and in care to haue her Highnesse obeyed, which ariseth with religion, and so both Gods mercie and her Maiestie still to
<pb facs="11"/>
remaine among vs. For him that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs, and thus dealeth with vs from day to day, doth not verie sense instruct vs, we must serue againe, if we will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy him? And is this to serue him, to retaine vnto ourselues the wages, that hee hath prouided for sufficient men, and to thrust into his cloth we care not whom? To furnish his haruest with i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle loiterers, and neuer to looke after, no, nor accept beeing offered, most painefull laborers? No, no, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, that must iudge it, it is not. Yea men themselues knowe it, if the Lorde would giue feeling, and strength to defie that spirite of hauing, that crieth within and saieth, reserue it to thy selfe. Yet least anie should pretende the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, where I wish them well resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of this point, may it be lawefull for mee, with your louing leaues some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to lay downe in this behalfe, that I would wishe him to consider, who is not perswaded of this dutie, if I were to speake with such an one? First then I would haue him viewe the worde of God that shall stande and iudge vs
<pb facs="11"/>
all, when heauen and earth shall perish. Than the which woorde nothing can be more contrarie to this sinne, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee respect the time of the lawe, or of the Gospell. For in them both this is euer deliuered, and euer bet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the people of God should be taught, and men chosen out in abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie such, as the people might <hi>require the lawe at their mouthes,</hi> though the measure and manner were diuerse as it pleased God to giue his giftes vnto them. Which thing euer drewe with it then, and at this day still truely doth inferre, a godly regarde, and euen a necessarie conscience, when anie place is voide, by the lawes wee liue vnder, alotted to that vse, to furnish it as suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie as wee possiblie can and may for that vse. Otherwise by vs it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe that the people are not taught. Nowe this offence groweth either by negligence, or by couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. By negligence when (not weighing or feeling the sinne of it) we are drawen by affection, or kindred, or other mens sutes, to bestowe suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb facs="12"/>
places vpon insufficient persons. By couetousnesse, when to reserue a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our selues, we doe the like. Both which are greuous offences both against God and our countrey, and in the word very plainely condemned. If the first be the cause, then craue I most heartily the consideration of these, and the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions. The Lorde threatneth to the watchman death that warneth not his people, and saith he will haue <hi>their bloud at his hande,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ezek. 3.</note> because hee did not crie. Nowe by me hath beene put in such an one verie carelesly and negligently for affection or such like, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> though he would yet for want of ability can not cry, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las how then can I want my portion in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wrath of the Lorde that is threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all such default? Secondly it is loue in the minister to his God, to <hi>feede his sheepe.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iohn. 21.15.</note> So is it assuredly in the patrone to cause them to bee fed. Contrariwise it is want of loue in the minister,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.</note> if he do not feede, &amp; is it not asmuch in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone, if by his default it come to passe? Thirdly it is a great fault we think to giue the calling to an vnworthie one, and is it
<pb facs="12"/>
no fault to giue the liuing to such an one? Thus then we see howe the word quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our consciences in this behalfe if we be not dead. And a number mo reasons might yet be brought, if I should make a treatise in a preface. Only this one mo I must needes remember which me thinke should awake anie man aliue in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sixt of Marke it is said of Christ, <hi>that going out and seeing a great multitude of people gathered together,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mark. 6.</note>
      <hi>he had compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on them, because they were like sheepe without a sheephearde, and hee went out and taught them many thinges.</hi> And in the Greeke it is more vehement, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing as it were an aking of his heart, as we call it, or a yearning of his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, to see so pitifull a sight, as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie people without a teacher. Vpon which notable place I haue vsed in my selfe to make two conclusions. First a comfort, then a feare. My comfort is this, that he which mourneth to see his people want the benefite of his worde, will giue his people his woorde if they seeke it and wish it, and where he hath vouchsafed it alreadie, there continue it,
<pb facs="13"/>
blesse it, and giue it power if we pray. For otherwise howe shoulde it paine him to see it wanting? My feare is this, that if his heart ake to see his sheepe depriued of a shephearde, hee will assuredly bee reuenged euen in great wrath of them that are the causers of it. And for Christ his sake let it bee considered. For as wee liue, wee may not alwaies looke to laugh, if we make our God to mourne. Thus then if neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence be the cause that a countrey is not furnished with some able ministers, me thinke we may awake our heartes by the worde of the Lorde, and weying it well, receiue from him some better fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in so great a matter. But if couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse be the cause, and we greatly giuen to sequester that benefit to our selues, sauing onely some portion to one to beare the name, then marke we againe the witnesse also of the same scriptures against vs euen in this. And to saue mine owne labour, my iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young, heare I beseeche you the proofes and reasons against this sinne, by a godly and graue Diuine intreating
<pb facs="13"/>
of this matter, laide downe vnto my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ands. First he alleadgeth against it y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>hem to his seruantes.</hi> Concluding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that if the king might not take the tythes to himselfe, because then they were due to the priestes by Gods owne order and commandement for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinance of his seruice: surelie no priuate man nowe may doe it, so long as by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie the same are established for the ministers mainteynance and support. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie if in the law he was accursed that <hi>remoued the merestone of the field,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Deut. 27.17.</note> because hee did wrong in succession to diuers: ten thousande times more is the remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the ministers liuing subiect to the Lords wrath, because both presently, &amp; successiuelie it is hurtfull to a number moe, and in a greater matter. Thirdlie by the Prophete <hi>Malachie</hi> the Lorde complayneth in expresse tearmes,<note place="margin">Mala. 3.8.</note> that the <hi>taking away of the tythes and offerings</hi> from that ende, that they were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto, was <hi>a robbing and spoiling of him,</hi>
      <pb facs="14"/>
yea euen such a spoyling, as he woulde <hi>visite with a great and greeuous curse.</hi> Now if it were so then, all the world must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, it is no lesse nowe, so long as autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ratifieth this means to maintaine the ministers: and therefore assuredlie will haue a sharpe reuēge. Fourthlie in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Iewes alledge it vnto Christ as an argument of loue to thē and their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Centurion, that <hi>hee had built them a synagogue,</hi>

What should I note the most exact streytnesse of these laws in making the verie minde of the patron coueting rewarde for the gift of his Church a Simonie before God which they call <hi>mentalem Simoniam?</hi> With a number such like notable rules and places. So that wee see euen these lawes also detest it, and condemne it. And nowe then to conclude this matter, if I thinke there is a God, and a day of iudgement to come for mee, and all my doings, what should my heart minister to maintaine mee in this euill, when God and man be against it? But why shoulde I bee thus tedious in this matter? Truelie that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, if God so will, how farre the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions wherein some sleepe as in no offences, differ from the lawes of God and man, and from synceritie of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

times and ages. But againe, why vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, (right worshipful) should I write so much? Truly that by your godly care, conscience, &amp; indeuor (hauing the places that you haue) this great wound of your countrey may by litle and litle be relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and better prouision dayly made for the winning of that good, that bringeth with it ten thousand blessinges promised by the Lorde. Which care and christian consideration (as places fall) I most hartily craue in the name of Iesus Christ, vnto whose seruice I am called, both for his glorie, your owne discharge, and the benefit of that place which I wish may euer be as the blessed of the Lord. I can not be thought to pleade any benefit for my selfe, because I want the tongue, and therefore I am more boulde. But nowe I cease to followe it anie further. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing that I greatly rewe our want in, is the carefull &amp; good bringing vp of children in learning and vertue whilest they are fit. Which howe it wanteth for want of schooles amongest vs, woulde God I sawe no more, than I had abilitie (without charge to anie) to redresse. But
<pb facs="20"/>
what wanteth in me, aboundeth in you, and might it please the Lorde, to giue will to your abilitie, in this also to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his glorie, &amp; to benefit thousands in your countrey, truely his heart hath mercie to accept it kindly, and his hand hath blessinges to rewarde it richly.
