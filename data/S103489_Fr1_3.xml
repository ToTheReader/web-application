      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese Sermons both in their preaching &amp; printing acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thēselves yours. For your sakes they were first made, and it is not for their owne they are now made common. I was put upon
<pb facs="3"/>two evils, either to print that which was bad, or else by transcribing suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to be made worse. I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the lesse, and God may bring good out of it. Discourses of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are few, yet great need have Sea-men of them, debarred for the most part from the sweet comforts, and many helpes which our Church at home affordeth; Hee that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the one will not condemne these Sermons for Wast: and hee that is sensible of the other will not aske to what purpose are they? Yet though others should cast dead flyes into this ointment, my hope is you
<pb facs="3"/>will approve it for <hi>bonum opus,</hi> and afford it your Patronage. And so I commit it to you, and you to the protection of him that is able to keepe you, God blessed for evermore.</p>
