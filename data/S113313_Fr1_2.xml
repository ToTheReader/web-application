The other are those, whom god hath alredy sealed in the felowship of his truth, by the testimonie of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and assured zeale to serue the Lorde in Sion, and yet want enablement to stande for the Lorde.

VVhich thing, as for many bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites receiued, I am most bounde, so I most humbly and hartilye craue at the handes of our eternall father by Christe, to whose merciful assistaunce and mightie prouidence (remayning to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme vnto you al the duties that I may) I do most humbly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte you.</p>
