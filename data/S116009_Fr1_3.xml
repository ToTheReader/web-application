And also manie very notable vertues, with their due commendations, so liuely and truely expressed, according to the holy word, that the godly reader, being of a Christian inclination, will be mightily inflamed with a loue vnto them.

   <head>A paterne of a cursed tree, and the fruite and end of the same.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>WHen the sonne of God, the redeemer of the world, Christ Iesus, was heere below vpon the earth, so truelie in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as we be now in our bodies, sauing that he was cleere and free from all corruption of sinne, and as he walked, being pinched with hunger, did espie a goodlie fig tree, which with the faire, greene,</hi>

      <hi>and flourishing leaues, did offer vnto him some hope of releefe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to it, finding it fruitlesse, and being disappointed of his hope, he</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mark. 11. 12. &amp; 13.</note>
      <hi>cursed it, and commanded that it should be cut downe, and cast into the fire. If he dealt so with trees, that did beare no fruite at all, we may warrant and assure our selues, that he will curse, cut downe, and cast into the fire that neuer shall be quenched, euery tree, that is, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man, that bringeth foorth such fruits, as this tree beareth. If the Lord his curse belongeth to a barren tree, that beareth no fruit, much more doth it belong, to those trees, which bring foorth bad fruites. If trees that are vnprofitable, bicause they beare nothing but leaues, are fitter for the fire, then to trouble the earth, then much more those trees that are so heauie loden, and so full of poyson, that a man cannot touch one twig of them, but it killeth his soule and bodie, for euer. Such a tree is euerie one that beareth such fruites in his life and manners, as this tree doth. No good Christian therefore, will delight &amp; please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the shadow of such a tree, neither build his nest in any part, or branch of it: but rather will do his greatest indeuor to pull it downe. Do thou (good Christian) thy best, and be sure the Lorde will take thy part. And howsoeuer earthlie iusticers, let slip their parts, and forget to do their duties, the Lord will neuer forget nor let slip his part. Heere thou seest Iustice hath fastened his coard to the top of the tree, and Veritie is hacking▪ at the roote, betweene them both to ouerthrowe it. Now if thou louest righteousnes, and art a friende to truth, take their parts in this busines, pull downe with Iustice, and strike with Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, lend ech of them one of thy hands, and thy hart too, and keepe neither hart nor hand to thinke or to worke any maner of euill, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thee, to haue no hand, no eie, no foote, then wicked ones. Do thy best that this tree may be destroied heere in this world, whiles it is to day, least to morrow thou be destroied, for not labouring about it. I meane not that thou shouldest rend this paper and cast it in the fire, but that thou shouldest examine, thy owne hart and thy conscience, to see
<pb facs="5"/>
whether any root, branch or twig of such a tree be there, and if thou shalt finde any, to plucke them out and to cast them into the fire. Otherwise thou hast nothing else looke for, but euen that which made the figge tree to wither, to wit, the malediction and curse of God. And although Couetousnes heere doth keepe the roote, and Selfe-loue the top of the tree, yet there is not any fruite, that this tree beareth, that is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to bring foorth, as great and as tall a tree as this is, and also to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it, and throughly to load euery twig of it, that they bend and break, with such poysonfull and cursed fruits as these be. For the sinnes of men are innumerable, as the sands vpon the shore by the sea side, and the stars of heauen. Who can tell saith the holie prophet, how often he offendeth? The sharpe edge of the axe of Gods wrath, is euer toward the roote of</hi>

      <hi>this tree, and he is dailie telling vs, that it shall haue a foule fall at the length: he in loue to our saluation, doth premonish vs, that we may be carefull, and take heed to our selues, that we be not found in, or neere this tree, in any good liking or loue to it, when the finall fall of it shall be. Take heede (saith Christ) and beware of couetousnes, though a man</hi>

      <hi>haue aboundance, yet his life standeth not in his riches. And the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth aduise the Ephesians, to banish from among them the very name of couetousnes. And he would haue the Corinthians neither to eate nor drinke with couetous men. And his reason is, bicause cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes is the roote of all euill. As if he should saie, where couetousnes is rooted, there is not onely a barrennes of all good things, but also a great groue, and thicke wood of all abhominations. I refer thee (good Reader) to the Booke it selfe, where euerie branch, and all the fruits of this tree, be opened so plainly, and the poyson of them so expresselie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that euery good christian, seeing what danger is in them, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that willingly he neuer touch nor taste the least of them: And not onely that, but also out of the tree, of a liuely faith, will bring foorth such fruite of holines, truth, and righteousnes, as may be well pleasing, and acceptable in the sight of God. Both which things the Lord grant vs.</hi>
