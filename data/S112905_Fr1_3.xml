      </gap>ce them from their Superstitions, and Scandals against the Church.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you (my brethren) or any others shall maruell, why I impute <hi>Superstition</hi> vnto you, I may thinke that either they know not you, or that you are not rightly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your selues: because, as there is a <hi>Superstition affirmatiue,</hi> by an Idolatrous <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, tasting,</hi> and <hi>handling</hi> of things that are held to be sacred; so is there likewise, which cannot be denied, a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue Superstition</hi> (condemned by the Apostle) which, in regard of things that were falsly iudged vnholy and profane, did prohibite, saying, <note n="a" place="margin">Col. 2.21.</note>
      <hi>Touch not, taste not, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not.</hi> Wherein, notwithstanding, not the act of Abstai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but (obserue I pray you) the erroneous opinion, in forbearing, and forbidding such things, was the <hi>formall cause</hi> of <hi>Superstition.</hi> Whereunto, how farre you may be thought to symbolize, by your <hi>Negatiue</hi> opinions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these your prohibitiōs, <hi>Knele not, crosse not, weare not, &amp;c.</hi> this Treatise doth fully discusse and determine.</p>
   <p>But you thinke it sufficient to haue produced M. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi> B. <hi>Iewel,</hi> M. <hi>Bucer, P. Martyr, Beza, Zanchy, Chemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Danaeus,</hi> and other the best accomplished Diuines, as Aduocates to pleade your Cause. It is wel; if you shall be as well contented, that (according as <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 25. v. 10.12.</note>
      <hi>Festus,</hi> knowing <hi>S. Paul</hi> to haue appealed vnto <hi>Caesar,</hi> did reasonably resolue, saying, <hi>Vnto Caesar shalt thou go</hi>) I, likewise vpon your al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations
<pb facs="4"/>
of such reuerend and iudicious Authors, may challenge you to stand vnto the Testimonies of your owne Witnesses: by whom you may easily vnderstand, that the most of your <hi>Negatiue Opinions</hi> are so many <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>We haue receiued from you these Opinions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> 1. <hi>No Ceremonie, without speciall warrant from the word.</hi> 2. <hi>No appropriation of any humane Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vnto Gods worship.</hi> 3. <hi>No signification mysticall in any such.</hi> 4. <hi>No vse of any such Ceremonie, which hath bene once superstitiously abused.</hi> 5. <hi>No bodily gesture, in token of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, at the receiuing of the Lords Supper, is lawfull.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Be you likewise pleased to take a view of the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of your owne Witnesses, condemning your former assertions. The first, thus:<note n="c" place="margin">Danaeus I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sag. de Tradit. cap. 29.</note>
      <hi>The Sadduces did reiect all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Traditions, which had not bene deliuered by Moses; like as do the Anabaptists, and Libertines of these dayes: who are, notwithstanding, confuted by the example of Christ, in his obseruing of the feast of Tabernacles, which was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Iudas Machabaeus. But the Papists, like the old Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, are in another extreame.</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">These other Testimonies ensuing, are cited, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in this Treatise, throughout.</note> Besides, to challenge a speciall prescription for all <hi>Ceremonies</hi> out of the word, <note n="d" place="margin">Caluin.</note>
      <hi>Is contrary to the wisedome of Christ</hi>: and <note n="e" place="margin">Zanchy.</note>
      <hi>To Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The second, of <hi>Not appropriating, &amp;c.</hi> thus: It infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth <note n="f" place="margin">Bucer, Zanc. and others.</note>
      <hi>The libertie of the Church.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The third, against <hi>Mysticall signification,</hi> thus: To denie <note n="g" place="margin">Caluin.</note>
      <hi>Symbolicall Ceremonies, is a morositie:</hi> in so much that the <note n="h" place="margin">D. Rainold.</note>
      <hi>Papists are to be reproued for their dumbe, and non-signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Ceremonies.</hi> But these, as <note n="i" place="margin">Chemnis.</note>
      <hi>Significatiue, are lawful, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not as operatiue.</hi> yea <note n="k" place="margin">B. Iewell, Zanchy, Chemnis.</note>
      <hi>Significant are profitable for admonition, and for testification of our duties.</hi> Finally, the denying of this power to the Church, is a<note n="l" place="margin">Bucer.</note>
      <hi>Depriuing her
<pb facs="5"/>
of her Christian libertie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The fourth, of <hi>Abolishing</hi> of all <hi>Ceremonious</hi> vse of things, that haue bene once <hi>superstitiously abused,</hi> thus: <note n="m" place="margin">P. Martyr, Beza.</note>
      <hi>The wickednesse of man cannot so farre pollute the good creatures of God.</hi> Why? <note n="n" place="margin">Bucer.</note>
      <hi>The abuse of such things doth not cleaue to the things themselues, but vnto the minds of them that do abuse them.</hi> What then? As it is <hi>superstition</hi>
      <note n="o" place="margin">B. Iewel.</note>
      <hi>to place holinesse, so it is to place vnholinesse in them.</hi> To conclude. This doctrine is <note n="p" place="margin">Caluin.</note>
      <hi>Contrary to the intention of Christ,</hi> and to the <note n="q" place="margin">B. Iewell, P. Martyr.</note>
      <hi>Libertie of the Church of Christ.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The last, which is of <hi>Not vsing any bodily reuerence at the holy Communion,</hi> Thus, <note n="r" place="margin">Caluin, B. Iewel, Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, Zepper. P. Martyr.</note>
      <hi>Outward reuerence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in Communicants, both for the dignifying of Christs mysteries, and for the increase of our Christian deuotion.</hi> In a word, to deny the Church power, to choose her gesture of <hi>Reuerence,</hi> is <note n="s" place="margin">Bucer, P. Martyr.</note>
      <hi>Contrary to the libertie allowed her by Christ.</hi> All these, with diuerse other authorities and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, are more expresly mentioned in the Treatise it selfe.</p>
   <p>If you desire not to take vp your ware by retaile, you may haue it in a generalitie. For, to instance but in one <hi>Ceremonie,</hi> (be it the <hi>Surplice)</hi> the Reformed Churches, although they vsed it not, yet did they so certainly iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our practise thereof, that (as it is confessed) <note n="t" place="margin">P. Martry loc. comm. pag. 1086.</note>
      <hi>If we shall condemne these indifferent things, we shall condemne infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Churches, which are honoured of vs, as most commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Or thus: <note n="u" place="margin">Bucer.</note>
      <hi>We shall condemne all Churches of impious boldnesse.</hi> Not to returne vpon you the many <hi>Parlaments,</hi> and <hi>Conuocations,</hi> which (by the generall consent of the learnedst Diuines, and the most wise and religious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours in this kingdome) haue established these Rites.</p>
   <p>Before I shut vp this Epistle, let me acquaint you with some other of your errors, which may chiefly require your <hi>second thoughts.</hi> I shal need but only to point at thē.</p>
   <gap reason="missing" extent="1+ pages">
      <desc>〈1+ pages missing〉</desc>
   </gap>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>One is, your often alleaging of <hi>Scriptures, Fathers,</hi> and other <hi>Authors</hi>; and your open mistaking of their meanings, as will euidently appeare.</p>
   <p>The next, is, the many Repugnancies vnto your selues, by such an extreme difference betweene your <hi>Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Praying</hi>; your <hi>standing,</hi> and <hi>sitting</hi>; your <hi>hands,</hi> and <hi>tongues</hi>; your <hi>heads,</hi> and your <hi>knees, &amp;c.</hi> as if there were some mile distance betweene you, and your selu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s. Not to mention your many obiection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, which make against your owne conclusions.</p>
   <p>The third is, the extreme iniurie that you do vnto the Church. But you pretend peace; because, forsooth, you preach not against <hi>Conformitie.</hi> As though there were not a Preaching as well in the <hi>eare,</hi> as <hi>on the house-top</hi>; or not as well an exemplarie, as there is an oratorie seduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: else could not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> haue said,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.14.</note> concerning onely the Exemplarie; <hi>Cogis eos Iudaizare.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And that which herein doth double your offence, is, that your opposition is grounded vpon a sinister conceit, that our Church obserueth these <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Holinesse</hi> and <hi>Necessitie</hi>: which is altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to her owne expresse protestation. Howbeit, if her meaning in this case were but ambiguous, or doubtfull, yet would wel-conditioned children take things from a Parent with their right hands: but your deprauing of her professed and plaine doctrine, what can it else argue in you, then an earnest bent to contention, against the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall custome of the Church? not vnlike vnto the <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencer,</hi> which vsually swimmeth against the streame.</p>
   <p>The last, is, your notorious <hi>Scandals</hi> giuen vnto them that are without, and them that are within the Church; to the weake, and to the strong; yea and to the Church of God it selfe, by breaking the hedge of peace, and <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="6"/>
a gap</hi> for the <hi>wilde B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>re</hi> out of the Romish <hi>Forrest</hi> to enter in, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oote out that goodly vine; which many <hi>Pauls,</hi> the industrious Bishops, and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>stors haue <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>; and many <hi>Apollo's,</hi> the faithfull Martyrs of Christ haue <hi>watered</hi> with their bloud. And yet more specially that <hi>Scandall,</hi> which you commit against your owne selues; I meane, so many of you, as acknowledge the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie</hi> of our <hi>Ceremonies</hi> fully cleared, and your owne consciences sufficiently conuinced, and do notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding resolue (I can scarce, for honor, mention so execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a resolution) to continue in opposition, only for feare of <hi>discrediting</hi> your <hi>Ministerie.</hi> which this Treatise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to be altogether <hi>false, presumptuous, partiall,</hi> and <hi>pernicious.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Diuerse other things might haue bene obserued: but to conclude. Be you exhorted (beloued brethren) if there be in you a due hatred of <hi>Superstition</hi>; any ioy in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of vnitie; any zeale of the successe of the Gospell; or any conscience of truth, embrace the peace of the Church: and the <hi>God of peace</hi> replenish your hearts with all spirituall Graces, and preserue vs to the glorie of his Sauing Grace.</p>
