<pb facs="4"/>the dayes of these moste worthy kin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges, abhominable and new fangled doctrine was openly taught, and a lyke religion receyued, and vsed. So vnthankfull they are vnto God, for hys present benefites. Neuertheles thou mayst euidētly perceyue deare brother, by readyng of these bokes of S. Aug. whych I haue faythfully translated out of laten into Englysh (wherunto I entend (yf god wyl) to adde an other entiteled of the spirit and letter) what was thold doctrine of the catholyke churche, touchynge our saluacion. For teachynge and de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fendyng wherof chiefly, accordyng to the truthe of the holy scriptures, and the same auncient doctrine of the true catholyke church, our aduer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>saries are not ashamed to saye, that we the preachers that truely prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched goddes holy worde, in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> dayes of thaffornamed moste noble kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, preached nothynge but newfan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gels, and abhominable doctrine.</p>
   <p>And therfore they thynke,<note place="margin">Ioh. <hi>16.</hi>
      </note> that they do God hye seruice, to molest &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble vs in euery place, to robbe and spoile vs of al maner of worldly ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynges, liberties and goodes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyle

These notwyth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standynge, they desyre to be coūted catholykes, not onely vnlustly vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng that name to them selues on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but also vncharitably excludyng from the same al suche as be true ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholykes in dede. They haue many yeares iugled wyth the worlde, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der the tytle of the catholike church, and notwythstandyng that by son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry meanes theyr leigerdemayne haue ben openly discouered (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the moste parte of men perceyue well enowe theyr ypocrisie) yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue they nowe agayne put vpō theyr vnshamefast, and horyshe face, the vysar of the catholyke churche: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che S. Au. in these bokes do so pluck of, that all men maye perceyue, that in deprauyng the true catholyke do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of saluacion, whyche we haue moste truely preached, they shewe themselues to be y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> great hore, that sytteth vpon many waters,<note place="margin">Apo. <hi>17</hi>

<pb facs="5"/>of the earth, rather thē y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like churche, which is the veray and only spouse of Christ Iesu our Lord Thou shalte therfore in these bokes gentle reader perceyue (as I haue sayd) the true catholyke doctrine of our saluacion, and of all matters that depēde, and are annexed to the same: as what is the veray original cause of our saluaciō, after what ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner and sorte, we are fyrst called vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to saluacion, by what and whose meanes and deseruynges we so con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinue, that we attayne the fruicion of the same in thend: why al are not so called, that they may folowe, and obey the caller: howe weake and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able mans wyll is, either to come to God, or to continue in hym vnto thende: whether we be saued, that is predestinate, called, iustifyed, &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed frely thorowe the onely gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and fauoure of God, by faythe in Christe Iesu, or by the preceptes of good lyfe: For thus S.

      </note> we conclude (sayeth he) that a man is not iustifyed by the precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of good lyfe, but by the fayth of Iesu Christe. That is not by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lawe of workes, but by the lawe of fayth:
<pb facs="5"/>not by the letter, but by the spirite: not by the merites of dedes, but by grace frely geuen.

      </note> reade diligētly (I say) these bokes of S. Aug. whervnto I haue in thende annexed the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaciō of two auncient councels, that conferme the truthe of S. Aug. doctrine. And yf any thynge perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture shall seame vnto the harde to be vnderstāde, I wolde haue the to consyder that S. Aug. do in some places here intreat of goddes secret councelles, and iugementes, which can not be perceyued either by exter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal senses,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.</note> or naturall reason, but by fayth only, that beleueth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in the true vnderstandynge of Goddes worde. The beleuyng man therfore that calleth vpon God, shal as easely vnderstande thys true ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke doctrine of saluacion,<note place="margin">Ioh. <hi>10.</hi>
      </note> as the shepe knoweth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> voyce of hys owne shepherd: altho the wyse of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world, that do peryshe, whose vnbeleuynge myndes Satan hath blynded,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> wyl esteme thys not onlye new fangled, but also folyshe and abhominable.</p>
   <p>Further yf any thynge that S. Au. here teacheth of the state of infantes
<pb facs="6"/>that dye wythout baptime shal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture offende the, I muste de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre the diligently to wey, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder, bothe the horrible deformite of that originall synne, wherin we were all borne,<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>5.</hi> Psal. <hi>51.</hi>
      </note> and also the moste iuste and secrete iugement of God, vpon the chyldren of wrathe for the same, whych S. Aug. in the .xii. chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of thys seconde boke do set forthe moste playnly.<note place="margin">Ephe. <hi>2.</hi>
      </note> And thē I doubt not but y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> shall either be persuaded, to credite also s.

That he was of thys mynde, you maye in many places of hys o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther workes, and namely in the. <hi>21.</hi> chapter of thys seconde boke many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly se. Neither haue I translated these bokes to call the from the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine and infallible truthe and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Goddes worde, to hange nowe vpon S. Aug. but that bothe thou, and all other that wyll, maye
<pb facs="7"/>perceyue by the testimonye also of S. Aug. what was and is,<note place="margin">The cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se of trā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slatynge these bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes.</note> thold, aū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and true, catholyke doctrine of the churche touchynge our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion (whych cōsysteth vpon our eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall eleccion, or predestinacion, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion, iustificacion, and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion, as S.

   <p>But thys ought not to be passed ouer wyth silence that S. Aug. both in these bokes, and in diuerse other places of hys workes do teache and afferme, that infantes can not be sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued wythout the receyuynge of the Sacramentes of Christes body and blood. Of thys iudgement was also S. Cipriane, wherby it is manyfest that in theyr dayes the Churche of Christe dyd vse to mynistre Theuca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riste to infantes.<note place="margin">The eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariste gyuen to infantes</note> Thys was an olde and auncient tradiciō of the church. And notwythstandyng that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries haue omitted the same, as they do diuerse other suche lyke, yet
<pb facs="7"/>are not we so captiouse, or so vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, eyther to condempne them for thys omission, or to enforce that they shulde receiue the same tradici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againe. Wherfore by right and equitie they ought to graūt, that the churche of Englande, accordyng to the lyberties of the same, in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> dayes of the moste noble and excellet prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Henry the .viii. and Edward the vi. by cōmon consent of al the states of the realme, and their supremest authorite in earthe vnder Christe, myght omitte or chaunge tradiciōs in religion (as it dyd) altho the same were auncient, and mencioned in olde wryters, as longe as it dyd cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, or ordeyne nothyng, against goddes wrytten worde. Wherupon I may also iustly conclude, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se our aduersaries whiche do nowe condemne the hole churche of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, that was in the dayes of tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fornamed kynges, for omittyng or alteryng of tradiciōs, that they wet false dissemblyng and pariured trai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tores, against theyr moste naturall kynges and countreye, &amp; malicious ypocrites against the true catholyke churche of Englād. For what thing
<pb facs="8"/>(as touchyng the cōmen order for religion) haue God cōmaunded by hys wrytten worde to be done, that was then omitted (except thonly vse of Christes true discipline) whyche in dede was then resisted by some, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> haue ben, and are, by the iuste iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God compelled, to submitte their neckes vnto the heuie burden, and greuous yoke, of Antechristes vicare a wretched &amp; vile shauelyng. Or els what thynge hathe goddes wrytten worde prohibite &amp; forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that was then cōmaūded to be done and practised? I meane styl of the cōmon order for religiō. Yf you can agayne saye any of these, do in some particular matter, and by god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des helpe you shalbe answered. But yf you can not truely deny, but that Goddes voice and worde was so re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerently heard,<note place="margin">whē the churche of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande was the true ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke churche of Christ</note> in reforming the cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon order of religion, that al thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were approued, and vsed (except discipline) that it cōmaūdeth: and all thinges refrayned, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it forbiddeth: then muste I also conclude, that the Church of England in the dayes of thaforenamed kinges, was the true catholyke churche of Christ. For the

      </note> And agayne he sayeth, my shepe heare my voice: but the churche of Englande in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> dayes of the sayde kynges, dyd heare the worde of God, and y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> voice of Christ Therfore the churche of Englande, was then the true catholike Church of Christe.

But paraduenture you wyll saye that in the dayes of kynge Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, we dyd not myngle water wyth the wyne in the Lordes Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. What then? Dyd Christe in the instituciō of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same gyue either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample or cōmaundement to mingle water wyth the wyne?
