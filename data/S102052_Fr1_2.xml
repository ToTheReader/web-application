   <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOVRABLE, VERTVOVS, AND LEARNED LORD <hi>HENRY,</hi> Earle of Northumberland: (*) Lorde Percie, Lucie, Brian, Fitzpaine and Poynings: Lord of the Honors of Cockermouth and Petworth &amp;c. Knight of the most honorable order of the GARTER. All true felicitie both in thys life and in the worlde to come most hartily wished.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F that saying of <hi>Plato</hi> (right noble Lorde) be true, that our Countrey challengeth an especiall interest in our very vttermost abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which any way may tend to profit &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite the same: then will it sufficiently coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce the poore receiued Talent of myne, in that being so strictly charged by so great and graue a Phylosopher, I ought not to burie in obliuion my knowledge whatsoeuer, but rather as freely bestow mine endeuour on her, as shee did franckly impart the light thereof to me.</p>
   <p>For though it be a common phrase in the mouthes of men altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant in the precious value and profite of Sciences: <hi>That the studie of Letters is a bottomlesse Gulfe, and so long and so vneasie a iourney, that they which rashly thinke to finish it, oftentimes are drowned in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and so vnder this pretence, account it better not to know much, yea, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all:</hi> Against such slothful suggesters of men in a deadly obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie while they lyue, let mee auouch that saying of <hi>Aristotle, Man</hi> (sayth he) <hi>was created to vnderstande and to doe, for knowledge begetteth iudgement, and by iudgement men execute all good and vertuous actions.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>O Science</hi> (sayth <hi>Plato) howe would men loue thee, if they did but knowe thee? for euen as health is the conseruation of the body, so is knowledge the sure and onely safe-garder of the soule.</hi> And <hi>Cicero</hi> beeing of the same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, sayth: <hi>O knowledge, the guide of our life, the onely cause of vertue, and enemie to vice: What is the life of man without thee?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If then (right learned Lord) such a maine &amp; current streame of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable reason, washeth to nothing the emptie and confused wits, of such as are enemies to the excellencie of Arte, and maketh most fertile (like the ouer-flowings of Nylus) the iudgements of thē that are gouerned thereby: (though farre from me be the thought of arrogating the very least tytle of Arte to my selfe, yet as one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
<pb facs="3"/>
to receiue the breath of life from her sacred dwelling, and holdes with the learned in all ages, that man is as a bruite beast without her:) then let me thus farre presume vnder your noble fauour, to shewe that I haue not altogether trewanted in my life time, but howe I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed those permitted howers of exercise, that more waighty affaires in the world affoorded me, both to declare my reuerende zeale to so high a misterie, and vnfeyned affection. I beare to your honor.</p>
   <p>The worke was first written in French, by an excellent Scholler, <hi>Oger Ferrier,</hi> a Physition, borne in Tolouze, &amp; dedicated to Queene <hi>Katherine</hi> of Fraunce, mother to the King that last deceassed. And bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now by me changed into an English habite, that it might receiue no indignitie by dedication, I haue stampt your noble name in the fore-head thereof, that it may bee sayde (in despight of the proudest carper or controller,) Thys is the God-chylde of a peerelesse God-father.</p>
   <p>And as I doubt not of your honourable acceptauce, so I am like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise perswaded, that what hath wanted on my behalfe in translation, or any other imperfection beside, shall be as nobly censured: in which resolution I humbly kisse your hand, and continue as forward in affection, as any to your Honours welfare.</p>
