      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing vnderstanding (right worshipfull sir)
that neither before, nor since that I published
in print Musick for three, foure &amp; fiue voices,
which is now almost twentie yeeres past, ther
hath not any one of our nation published in
print any Musick for two voices (as diuers
strangers in forrein countries haue don here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore)
And I knowing that many of our nation haue bene very
desirous to haue some published, not onely such louers of Musick
as doe dwell in and nye vnto the Citie of London, and the other
cities and townes within this Realme where conuenient compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
may sone be had to sing songs for more voices then two, but
also chiefely such as doe dwell in the countries far from any of
those cities &amp; townes, where such company can be had so soone
to sing as aforesaid. In consideration whereof I haue now publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in print these Duos or songs for two voices to pleasure them
and all others that be so affected. And now knowing that your
worship is a fauorer of Musick, &amp; hath good iudgement therein,
I am the more encouraged to present this worke of myne vnto
you, I doe confesse that the guift therof is but small and simple,
yet such as it is, it is rare in the respect of the noueltie thereof, and
therfore I doe the more willingly giue it vnto you, as a token of a
zelous affection, and dutifull loue, that I do beare vnto you. And
thus dedicating and yeelding this same to your worships Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
and protection, I doe commit you to the tuition of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie,
to whom I dayly pray to giue you, and my very good la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
your bedfellow, a long and prosperous estate, with the lyke
lyfe, and at the ende thereof, to bring and receiue you both into
his place of eternal ioy and all true blessednesse.</p>
