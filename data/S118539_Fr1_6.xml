      </gap>ely to fore see what maye followe in all chaunces, and so to iudge of them as if they were present. Nowe forasmuche as we oughte to come to the readyng of Histories, so muche the better furnyshed, as an Historye is more replenished and laden with plenteous fruite: and for as muche as it is as difficulte a matter, to geue ryght iudge mente of another mannes lyfe as of his owne and that no manne is able (be he neuer so sharpe syghted in this case) to viewe another mannes lyfe well, that can not viewe hys o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne, both are to be vnderstanded, namely that there is in this case very great difficultnesse, and also that longe tyme before we enterprise hereunto, we ought not onely to haue a little snatche of ciuile pollicy, but also, that we ought to be fully resolued and established in our selues, as concernynge the whole tenour of our lyfe: onles we will continually wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in our mindes, and be miserably led about with vayne imaginacions of this lyfe lyke vnto ghostes. For in lyke ma ner as at a greate and sumptuous feaste, that is furnyshed with al kynde of deynties and delicate viandes, it commeth to passe that one thing is set before one man, another to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, fewe taste of one thing, euery man of that he lyketh best, the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="17"/>
who so walketh aduisedly, is only to be counted to liue wel. All others, like as they did at the sumptuous feast, when al thynges prouoke them, beynge able neyther in their owne lyfe, nor yet in another mannes at any time to fynd what is best to folow, or howe to procede. But if nature haue geuen any thyng to man, the whiche he maye vse or abuse at hys pleasure, certesse he ought most circumspectely to vse this. But I pray you what man is there almost, that applyenge the rule of vertue vnto all sayenges and doynges, aswell of his owne as of other mennes, doth with more aduisement aduenture vpon them, then vpon the daintye dishes, set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him on the table: or which thynketh not hym selfe suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently learned in this behalfe? In the whiche thinge it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonder to see, howe sore men deceyue them selues, whiles they imagine that the bare hystory, is of it self able enough to enstruct the reader, whereas in dede it doth no more but minister matter to learne vpon, offeryng it selfe to all vses accordynge as the person is affectioned, in lyke case as doth the feast. For some we see haue none other delyght but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the reading, who sekyng no more but that only one de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lectation, do loose all thother goodly and pleasaunte fruites thereof. Such men gayne nothyng more by the readyng of an Historye, than they that playe vpon a harpe or a lute to driue away the time, as a man would saye, to passe ouer the troublesomnesse of the tyme present, shortlye after to enter into a greater and more troublesome conflycte wyth them selues. For it is no pleasure that hath no respect vnto ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Othersome the glyttering glosse of glory so much pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth forward, and (which in other matters is vnstableness<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of minde) to no purpose transformeth, that they thynke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge to great for theym, nor nothynge to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>arre aboue theyr reache, quyte forgettyng that those gloryous exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are not set for thē by wryters for any other intent, then that suche as reade them ensewynge vertue, maye learn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="18"/>
to condemne glory yf none be offered, or if it accompany thē not to be proud and arrogant therfore. And although that none but fooles▪ will go about to aspire to the lyke glorye without the like vertue, yet notwithstanding we see some, which for none other cause but that they haue read the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actes of others, do thinke them selues hyghe wyse men, and take muche vppon theym, lyke vnto players of Trage<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dies, whiche when they haue put of thapparell, wherein they played the partes of moste noble personage, do also counterfeyte them in countenance and behauiour. There are also, and those not a fewe, whyche delyghte onelye in strannge thinges and wonders, menne of vulgare and rude vnderstandynge, who after the maner of thunskylfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, oftentimes make more of a mannes gaye cote, than of the person him selfe, and more of the outwarde shewe than of the worke. So wonderfull a power hath an Historye, to worke in the mindes of the Readers. Nowe, whereas it is the chiefest poynt that belongeth to an Historye, to styrre vp the minde of man from slouthfulnesse, and to fence it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste all daungers: and that the strengthe of examples, (then the whych there is nothynge of greater force to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade and disswade) inespecially tendeth to that ende and purpose, it commeth to passe through the carelesse securitye of men, (beleuing that other mennes perilles perteyne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng to them selues) that such thinges as are most worthy of remembraunce, are hearde and reade with deaffe and stopped eares. Finallye there be (whiche a man woulde not beleue) that transgresse euen agaynst the very same parte, that conteineth most graue and serious matters as though thinges should be wrytten, not as they were done in dede, but as they ought to haue bene done. Therefore partely by meanes of that careles securitye, and partlye by meanes of that surfet of rashe and vnaduised readynge, it commeth to passe, that euen as it were of corrupt humours, a certayne
<pb facs="18"/>
corruptnesse of iudgemente, and peruersenesse of opinion, (which ought to be most vpright and found as concerninge the life) and an vnstedfaste and slipperye trad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> and tenor of lyuing is taken vp: and that in likewyse as to inordinate persons, their meate doth them no good, euen in lyke cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>, there commeth no profite at all to vs of our reading.</p>
   <p>I thinke you maye now perceyue, howe the maner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng Hystories, and of looking vpon a mannes lyfe, is well nye all one. And the greatest difficultie is this. I mean the peruersenesse of our owne iudgement, which causeth vs to be driuen, not that way that the examples oughte to beare greatest sway of them selues, but that way that our mynde is moste enclined and bent vnto. This is also another, and of no lesse force than thother aforesayde, that writeth do in such wise set forth things, that they not only seke to be wel liked, but also (folowing as it were the taste of their owne mouthes) lyke as they were forgers of it them selues, geue theyr iudgement and verdite vppon matters, extollynge some thynges with hygh commendacions, as though they would haue all other men to like those thinges, which they most fancied them selues. The which thing, yf so be it they dyd it without colour, it were easier to consente or dissente the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>refro. But nowe in lykewise, as Cookes haue oftenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes more regard to the belly, then to their maysters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie and profite: euen so I would God that the wryters of Hystories, for the most part, sought not so muche to please and entice the Reader. Therefore by two meanes are wee led awrye: that is to saye, by our owne iudgement, and by the forespeakyng of the writers, as by them that write not matters playnely and sincerely. For an Historiographer is but an interpretour of thinges done: with whose iudgemēt (it there be any fault therein) it standeth in like case, as whē a piece of wine, that of it selfe beinge good, pleasaunte, and beawtifull, doth eyther take an euill talent of the Caske, or els is other wyse marred, by minglyng some other thynge with yt, the whiche is eyther a shamefull and intollerable
<pb facs="19"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, or els a poynt of extreme folly and ignoraunce. It ys to be sene by this one example, what matter the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wryter maketh. A man of rawe aduisement, that attributeth the bryngyng to passe of great matters to mannes pollicie, although that by the determinacion of so many thinges, he prove him selfe a lyar, yet he casteth men into a great follye: as whose knowledge (do the beste they can) beyng scarse able to wey and consider accordinglye, the thinges that lye before theyr eyes, theyr power and strēgth not much excedyng the litle wormes, because of one prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous successe, rashely taketh vppon it the rule of the whole world. But such a man as is otherwyse enformed, teaching that thinges are in deede put in execution by the pollicye of man, but yet ruled and gouerned by the prouidence of God deliuereth men both from folly, and also from another mis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chiefe as great as that, whiche is supersticion. By the resy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, such as be good men (whose study is altogether employ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed about matters apperteynyng to God) oughte to knowe what difference there is betwene eche of theym, and what theyr dutye is. I geue this warning first of all for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that forasmuch as I am of opinion, that suche kinde of Authours are to be read, and yt were for nothynge els but for the great aboundeunce of examples that they entreate of, yong men should also thinke this, howe circumpectelye and carefully they ought to be read, consideryng how great fruytes or discommodities are in them propounded. For it happeneth in lyke case to such as ymagine that in Hystorys may be read ouer lightly, or the life to be passed ouer vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly, without thexacte obseruing and executyng of a man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes duetye: as it doth to men of the countrey, whyche in the sackyng of a citie come to the ryffling of some Apothecaries of Grocers shoppe, plenteouslye furnyshed with al thynges belongyng to the crafte, and beyng allured with the swete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the confections and spices which they chaunce first to laye their handes on, thynking all the residue to be of the same sorte, do eate suppe, deuour, cramme in, and lycke vp
<pb facs="19"/>
all that comes to hand, in such wise that some fal sicke, some runne madde, some dye out of hand, and euery one of them be maruaylou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ye distempered, so that all the armye laugh them to skorne for their labour. For euen as the life is full of commodities and discommodities, euen so is an hystorye which is the ymage and representacion of the life. And the wysedome of the life consisteth onely in the vsage of the lyfe. Farewell, &amp; enioye these thinges to thy most furtheraunce and commoditye.</p>
