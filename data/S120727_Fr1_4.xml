   <head>THE AVTHOR, TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>TVrning ouer diuers Authors, and with attention reading theyr histories, the better to informe my selfe of the parentage, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie, and life of our holy Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabetb: I haue found that her Origen is the illustrious howse of Aragon, and her alliance by mariage, with the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly howse of Portugall, which howses I haue noted to haue been very fruict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of holy persons: And not only in thees two but also in many others, as France, Castile, Bohemia, Hungarie, Poland, and Brabant I haue obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the like blessings and favours. Amongst which kingdomes and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedomes, the mutuall mariages and alliances from all antiquitie, by course even till this time haue caused an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie worthie the consideration: In
<pb facs="4"/>
so much that the Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates liuing this day, if they bee come of thees families, haue either theyr origen from the number of thees Saintes or elles are allied and of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them reigning now in glorie with Christ our saviour.</p>
   <p>Chiefly it is to bee noted how this holy Saint Elisabeth Queen of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall is Parent to the Emperour Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand, the <hi>2.</hi> and the Catholique King of Spaine Philip Dominicus victor, by right line in the tenth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. To the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, gouerness of the lowe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Burgondie, in the <hi>9.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. To the Duke of Bavaria and the Duke of Nuburg, in the <hi>11.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
   <p>The most Christian King of France, that now liveth, is to her and S. Lewes, his predecessor in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of France (who was also of the third Order of our Seraphicall father S. Francis) and to her Sister S. Elisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
<pb facs="5"/>
who was à Nunne of S. Clares Order; in the eleventh degree: he is also cozen to S. Lewes Bishop of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losa, who was à Freer of S. Francis Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and also to B. Ioanna Queen of France, Foundress of our B. Ladies order, called the Anuntiates.</p>
   <p>The King of Poland that reigneth at this day, hath in his Parentage S. Hedwigis, and her daughter. S. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude; and B. Aleyda Princess of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and B. Salomea Queen of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia, Moreover, he hath S. Casimirus, his vncle, Brother to his grandfather.</p>
   <p>The Lantsgraue of Hessen descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from S. Elisabeth Queen of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie and Bohemia (shee was of the third order of S. Francis) hee is in the <hi>10.</hi> degree from her.</p>
   <p>The kingdomes of Hungarie and Bohemia haue honored theyr kings and Princes with parentage of Saints and Beatified, Saint Elisabeth before mentioned, and S. Margarite (of the order of S. Dominick) Cunegunda
<pb facs="5"/>
and Iolenta of the order of S. Clare: all daughters of Andrew the <hi>3.</hi> and Bela the <hi>4.</hi> Kings of Hungarie: B. Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the order of S. Clare daughter to Primislaus king of Bohemia: S. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Cardinall and Martyr Bishop of Leedes (whose reliques ly in Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xelles in the church of the Discalced Carmelites, translated thither from Rhems by the Archduke of happy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie Albertus the Iust, and Isabella Clara Eugenia his beloued wife the year <hi>1612.)</hi> who was sonn, brother, and vncle to the Dukes of Brabant.</p>
   <p>But heer I desire you to marck, how the kingdome of Portugall, goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the others; for setting aside the holy Elisabeth (whose life shall heer briefly bee set downe) yee shall finde, coming out of this kingdome, the first king Alphonsus; the <hi>3.</hi> daughters of his sonne Sancius; Theresa Queen of Leon; Mafalda Queen of Castile, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Religiouse of S. Bernards order: and Sancia of the same order: The
<pb facs="6"/>
Prince Ferdinand sonne to king Ihon the first, and the Infanta Ioane daughter to king Alphonsus the fifth, all eminent for holyness of life and miracles: wher, in many thousand fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies again you shall not finde one.</p>
   <p>All thees Saintes, to the number of <hi>24.</hi> haue sprong out of thees ten Catholick families within the space of about <hi>400.</hi> yeares. And had vve looked further back to theyr first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or theyr conversion to the Christian faith, everie familie would haue yealded more: for in Hungarie vve should yet haue found S. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, and Emeric kings, and Ladis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus Prince of that Kingdome. In Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia, S. VVenceslaus Martyr. In Austria, S. Leopoldus. In Brabant, SS. Pipin, Arnulphus, Emebert, Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, Gertrude, Gudula, Pharaildis, Reynaldis, VValtrudis, Aldegund, &amp;c. and so in the rest.</p>
   <p>And to returne again to S. Elisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Queen of Portugall, Note, that of
<pb facs="6"/>
her are come, <hi>7.</hi> Emperours, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently one after another: six Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses: <hi>36.</hi> Kings: and <hi>43.</hi> Queenes.</p>
   <p>All vvhich together is to bee seen as cleer as the sunn; in à table which I haue sett forth; to the honour of the same Saint: and vvithall, that the devout reader may see therin hovv men in this vvorlde (if they vvill cooperate with Gods preventing grace) notvvithstanding maiestie, greatness, might, honour, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, may attaine to great holyness: And that also beholding and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring so manie Saints, the Christian Princes that glorie to bee of theyr race may be therby spurred and pricked on to virtue, and follovve theyr holyness▪ and choose them for Patrones, Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, and guides, in the vnknowne vvay, of this life, and after in the iust iudgement of the vpright iudge.</p>
   <p>Those that haue the carde which I set out, must note, first that it vvas not possible to giue all the Queenes
<pb facs="7"/>
place therin, or to set downe theyr names, because the piece is little, and also because many of them were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to kings, whom it was no need to bring in: and those that are set downe are without crownes, excepting the Saints, and those that were heyres to kingdomes or princedomes, who by theyr mariages transferred them to other families.</p>
   <p>Secondly, heer in is cleerly to bee seen, the right and lawfull succession of the kingdoms of Hungarie, and Bohemia, and all the Prouinces, and Dominions of the howse of Austria vnto the person of Ferdinando Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the Romanes. Also the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance and succession not only of all the kingdomes of Spaine but also of Sicilie, and Naples, of the Dukedome of Burgundie, Brabant, and the rest of the Dominions of the lowe countries, lawfully to pertein and fall vpon the person of the Catholick king Philip the <hi>4.</hi> Dominic Victor, and that not by force of armes, much less by prudence
<pb facs="7"/>
and humane industrie: but only by the disposition and prouidēce of God: who (Eccl. cap. <hi>10.)</hi> translateth kingdomes from nation to nation. VVhence may bee seen the idleness, and vanitie or manifest impietie of such as preferr the inventions of theyr owne braines, or, to speak more properly, certaine lawes of state, before the providence and care-that God hath of the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of Empires and Dominions: and for theyr better safeguard and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, sett faith and conscience à side, offend God and his holy church.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, all Potentates shall heer note, that the strongest castle, the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest fortification and defence of theyr estates is, sincere faith, and Religion not affected: for although the riches and regions bee moued together, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the earth be in vprore, and hell come in for à part: nothing of all this can shake the Monarch that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God, and loveth his church, and doth not communicate nor participate with the adversaries ther of, and is
<pb facs="8"/>
zealous of sincere and perfect iustice.</p>
   <p>Fourthly that no man may haue anie thing to say, if it seem to him that I haue done more then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the church do permit, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the description of the <hi>24.</hi> Saints. Because they bee not all in the Catalogue of the Canonised by order of the Romane church, althoug the greatest part of them bee so: yet the others shined and do as yet shine with many miracles in theyr seuerall places and prouinces▪ VVher they are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, esteemed and reuerenced, for Saints; and of some of them the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrologes of theyr orders do make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so that no doubt being made of theyr sanctitie it remayneth that we endeauour to followe them. Ther is in the table à distinction, for the Saints Canonised, or Beatified, are in ouall circles with beames of glorie about theyr heads, the other in round cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles without beames. And because the beatification of B. Ioane Queen of
<pb facs="8"/>
France, is laboured for at Rome, and the decree from day to day expected, shee is sett in an ouall circle.</p>
   <p>For the rest, what thing so ever can bee desired more in the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the carde: the markes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions therin sett downe, and chiefly the branches of it doe shewe it cleerly. Lett, this suffice, gentle Reader, for thy direction; enioy my little labour, and take it thanckfully▪</p>
