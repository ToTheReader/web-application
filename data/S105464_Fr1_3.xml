   <p>Which kind of Coosoning, or rather coniuration, is passing necessary to be discouered, and more then high time, that it had ben done ere this: as wel for the peril of the practise finally meant, as for the mischieuous meanes vsed to bring it to passe. The final practise,<note place="margin">A third fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is, to wrest the succession of the Croune from his du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Nature, Nations, and your owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey: and withal to cōfirme and establish vnto certaine base persons (vnder the Title of a third Family, vnto which them selues are lately vnited) the perpetuall Regiment of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same, the possessiō where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they haue already obteined.

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>y count both your Prince &amp; Realme, and all the rest well aduentured, if them selues thereby may wynne that, which they aspire vnto.</p>
   <p>This, do I call, the finall purpose of the practise in hand. And therein shal I for this time rest, how so euer both wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, reason and experience would, that no man should looke for an ende thereof, when it were come to that: nor expec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p>And of the many mischieuous meanes
<pb facs="4"/>
vsed to bring this purpose to passe,<note place="margin">The meanes to altre the successiō are these.</note> who can be ignorant, no man almoste being found of that Nation, that hath not tasted bitterly of them, by him selfe or his frind in more or in lesse?
