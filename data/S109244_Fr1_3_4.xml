                 <title>Orthoepia Anglicana: or, the first principall part of the English grammar : teaching the art of right speaking and pronouncing English, with certaine exact rules of orthography, and rules of spelling or combining of syllables, and directions for keeping of stops or points between sentence and sentence. A work in it selfe absolute, and never knowne to be accomplished by any before: no lesse profitable then necessary for all sorts, as well natives as forreigners, that desire to attaine the perfection of our English tongue.

   <l>WHere can one walke along the streets, but hee</l>
   <l>May Schollers, Courtiers, and good Linguists see?</l>
   <l>But all for Forreigne Tongues. Poore English now</l>
   <l>Is onely left for him that drives the plough.</l>
   <l>How many have I heard chat French as fast</l>
   <l>As Parrats! that being put to write in hast</l>
   <l>An English Letter would perhaps incline</l>
   <l>To make a<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ct to pardon for each line</l>
   <l>A solecisme! And this chiefly is,</l>
   <l>Because for practice they instructions misse.</l>
   <l>I've often heard an English Grammars name,</l>
   <l>That Forreign Countries might no more defame</l>
   <l>Our Tongue for being irregular; but till now</l>
   <l>Could never come to see one part: which thou</l>
   <l>Hast happily perform'd. <hi>Ben Johnson</hi> rail'd</l>
   <l>On <hi>Vulcans</hi> fury that had his entail'd:</l>
   <l>But thine, in spight of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> shall ensue</l>
   <l>To after Ages. 'Tis both <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>True.</hi>
