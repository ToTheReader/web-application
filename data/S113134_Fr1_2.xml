   <opener>
      <salute>SIR,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not carefull
to annexe your
other <hi>Titles:</hi> for
they are not so
much honour to you, as they
<pb facs="3"/>
are honoured by you; and
your bare <hi>Name</hi> sounds
more honorably in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then that which the
breath of others can adde
unto it.</p>
   <p>I have made bold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(though without your
knowledge) to send abroad
with your <hi>Name</hi> prefixed,
this ancient Greek <hi>Father,</hi>
newly taught to speak En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish;
that hee may receive
your <hi>approbation</hi> where
hee well expresseth his
meaning, and your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
hereafter where
hee proves defective; For,
I presumed you might by
this meanes be provoked
to the perusall thereof, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
your many
studies.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
Your <hi>Candor,</hi> and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<hi>humanity,</hi> make mee
confident in this attempt;
For though my <hi>Author</hi> be
a stranger to most <hi>moderne
Students,</hi> you (from whom
no such <hi>Worthie</hi> is obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
are his familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;
and in whose
Name could I have more
properly brought this <hi>Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
among my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(to be entertained
with respect) then in yours,
who are the truest lover
of <hi>Antiquities;</hi> and <hi>hee,</hi>
who hath best shewed the
right use of them to this
Age?</p>
   <p>I think not you to be any
whit honoured by this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication;</hi>
but, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hat I have
rather magnified my selfe
<pb facs="4"/>
in making it an occasion to
signifie that I have so noble
a <hi>Friend.</hi> Yet without all
such respects, I have done
this, meerely to content my
self, in that which I thought
could not justly discontent
you; and, to say truth, having
a long time loved your <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
and honoured your
<hi>worth,</hi> it is now an
ease, and a delight to mee,
to expresse it by this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
   <p>And, you have not been
pretious to mee without
cause: For, I being one of
those, who preposterously, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to <hi>write</hi> before they
<hi>learne,</hi> you might justly
enough have reputed mee
worthy of contempt onely,
when I was first presented to
<pb facs="4"/>
your acquaintance. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
(perceiving, it may
be that the affections of my
<hi>heart</hi> were sound, though
the fruits of my <hi>braine</hi> were
defective) you vouchsafed
mee a friendly, and a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
familiarity: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I got opportunities both
to rectifiemy <hi>Judgement,</hi>
and encrease my <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi>
in many
things.</p>
   <p>Were the same humble <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability
in those,</hi> (whom a
lesse degree of knowledge
hath vainly puffed up, to the
corrupting of them into
that, which is worse then
<hi>Ignorance)</hi> they might
have beene more beloved;
and perhaps, more wise men
<pb facs="5"/>
then they are. To amend
them &amp; to encourage others
to the like <hi>Vertue,</hi> I have
testified this of you, and
in that, shall perchance,
adde somewhat to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
   <p>I have lately confined my
selfe to my <hi>rustick habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
in that part of this
Kingdome, which is famous
for the best of those <hi>meats,</hi>
wherewith the Poet <hi>Martial</hi>
invited his friend: <hi>Pallens
Faba, cum rubenti Lardo:</hi>
yet it hath not made mee so
meer a <hi>Corydon,</hi> but that I
relish the <hi>delicates</hi> of the
MVSES; and retaine
some ambition to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in your esteem. And, SIR,
wheresoever I am, you shall
<pb facs="5"/>
ever be remembred, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your unfained friend,
and true Honourer,
