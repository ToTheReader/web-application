   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>AT the conclusion and vpshot of this
Booke, let mee a little aduertise
thee (gentle Reader) of a Booke
lately Printed in huggermugger, intituled
<hi>The Odcombian banquet.</hi> And I am the
rather induced to make mention of it, because
it doth not a litle concerne my credit to cleere
my selfe of two very scandalous imputation
laide vpon me by that virulent and ranco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
pessant, some base lurking pedanticall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebricous
<hi>Lucifuga</hi> that set forth the booke.
Wherof the first is the Motto in the first leafe
of the booke. <hi>A sinus portans mysteria.</hi> The
other in the end of the booke, euen in his <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerint
vniuersi,</hi> viz. That one that inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to epitomize it, affirmed hee could not
<pb facs="41"/>
melt out of the whole lumpe of my Volume so
much matter worthy the reading as would fil
foure pages. For the first I will tell thee the
originall wherehence it sprang. It hapned
that after I had presented my Booke at Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston
to the King, and returned backe to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for Bookes to present to Noblemen of
the Court, I did determine for conceite sake,
and to minister occasion of merriment to the
King, to get me an Asse to carie my Bookes,
with this Latine inscription in faire Capitall
Romane Letters vpon that which should
haue contained them, <hi>Asinus portans my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steria;</hi>
being indeede taken out of Alciats
Emblemes, and spoken of an Asse that cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Image of the goddesse <hi>Isis.</hi> But heere
the diuulger of the foresaid <hi>Odcombian
Banquet</hi> most sinisterly and malignantly
applied it (as all the Readers doe interprete
it) to my selfe, and thereby very peruersly
wrested it from that allusion which I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
As for the second imputation contained
in his <hi>Nouerint vniuersi,</hi> it farre exceeded
<pb facs="41"/>
the first in spite full bitternesse. For whereas
he writeth that hee could not melt out of the
whole lumpe of my Booke so much matter
worthy the reading as would fill foure pages,
I will boldly affirme for the better iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my Obseruations, and by way of opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against the malicious censure of that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percriticall
Momus, that of the sixe hundred
fiftie and foure pages (for indeede so many
are in the booke) he shall find at the least fiue
hundred worthy the reading, especially in my
descriptions of these Cities, Paris, Lyons,
Milan, Padua, Venice, Verona, Brixia,
Bergomo, Zurich, both the `Badens, Basil,
Strasbourg, Heidelberg, Spira, Wormes,
Mentz, Franckeford, Colen, &amp;c. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
I will further say for the confirmation of
the sufficiencie of my historicall notes, (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are so seuerely chastised by the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious
rod of this maleuolent traducer, that
biteth my worke with his Theonine teeth)
and yet without any vaine glorious ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
that let him or any other whatsoeuer in
<pb facs="42"/>
our whole Kingdome of Great Brittaine,
shew both larger Annotations for quantitie,
and better for qualitie <hi>(absic dicto inuidia)</hi>
gathered in fiue moneths Trauels by any
English man since the incarnation of Christ, I
will be rather contented to consecrate all the
Bookes that remaine now in my hands ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to god <hi>Vulcan</hi> or goddesse <hi>Thetis,</hi> then
to present one more to any Gentleman that
fauours wit and learning. Therefore let
this <hi>Coryatomastix Zoilus</hi> barke at mee
as long as he list, swell with enuie as bigge as
the AEsopical Toade, and shoote all his darts
of malignitie against me; I oppose this double
thield stronger then the seuen fold Target
of Aiax in Ouid, for my securitie and defence
against him, first that it hath pleased the best
of the Kingdome euen from the Kings owne
person with all those sacred members of the
Royall family, and many Noble persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the best note of our land, as well as the
Lords of the Priuie Counsell, as other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
spirits of great eminencie, not onely to
<pb facs="42"/>
affoord gracious entertainment to my booke,
but also with their courteous approbation and
candid censure to thinke well of my labours.
Secondly, that my vnparalled friend, that
voluble linguist &amp; sound Scholler M. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
Whitaker,</hi> who (I thinke) doth as
farre excell in learning my antagonist the
Author of the <hi>Nouerinti vniuersi,</hi> as a
rose doth a nettle in sweetnesse, or a Pearle
a Pebble-stone in price, hath vouchsafed to
confirme the authoritie of my booke (hauing
yeelded me that fauourable and patient at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to heare me reade ouer the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it came to the Presse) with his no lesse
learning then elegant Elogie that preceedeth
my owne Obseruations. But to conclude this
matter of my malicious enemie, against the
violent stroake of whose base wrongs my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie
and integritie will like a brasen wal
defend me, I wish the same of them that an
ancient Poet did of the bitter Poet Archi
lochus;
<q>
         <l>Vtque repertori nocuit pugnacis Iambi,</l>
         <l>Sic sit in exitium lingua proterua tuum.</l>
