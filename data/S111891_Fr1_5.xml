         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AN is a <hi>Spheare,</hi> his Soule th' <hi>Intelligence;</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Grace is the <hi>Sun</hi> that sends his light from hence:</l>
      <l>Vertues the <hi>Starres,</hi> that glistring deck this frame</l>
      <l>And with their rayes giue lustre to the same;</l>
      <l>Whose Lights still fixt, which like th' immortall sourse</l>
      <l>Maintaine a constant gyre, a settled course.</l>
      <l>The Worlds Contempt, <hi>Canopus</hi> like, doth keepe</l>
      <l>The highest point, most seuered from the deepe</l>
      <l>And earthly Center: T'is the Starre that brought</l>
      <l>The Easterne Sages to the Light they sought;</l>
      <l>Which through the Heau'ns as it his course did run,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Aurora-</hi>like forshewd the following <hi>Sunne.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>T'is that, which did th' <hi>Isaacian</hi> squadrons garde,</l>
      <l>And to the promis'd <hi>Land</hi> their way prepar'd;</l>
      <l>And while we floate vpon these daungerous waues,</l>
      <l>The <hi>Cynosura</hi> that vs wandring saues.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <l>Within the Land, which that mysterious floud</l>
      <l>Fattens with his blacke slime, and fruitfull mud,</l>
      <l>The <hi>Crocodile (Niles</hi> Pirate) euer striues</l>
      <l>Of their delicious combes to spoile the hiues:</l>
      <l>This to effect, he takes a thousand guiles,</l>
      <l>And summons all his slights, and all his wiles.</l>
      <l>But vse is made of that Antipathie</l>
      <l>That is betweene the Saffron-floure, and hee;</l>
      <l>Which planted round doth giue assur'd redresse,</l>
      <l>And counter-mands his lust, and greedinesse.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>This <hi>Crocodile,</hi> is mans inueterate Foe,</l>
      <l>Th' Apostate Prince of darknesse, that doth goe</l>
      <l>Euer about to spoile th'increase of Grace,</l>
      <l>And in our souls Gods Image to deface.</l>
      <l>Sensuall Delights, Pleasures, Desires to be</l>
      <l>Great in the World, the Philters are that he</l>
      <l>Doth vse in this designe. The Worlds Disdaine</l>
      <l>The Moly is, that saues our soules from baine;</l>
      <l>The Saffron-floure, that driues his force away,</l>
      <l>And guards vs safe, that els might be his pray.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>For if the Eye, cleare and vnblemished,</l>
      <l>Void of all preiudice, accustomed</l>
      <l>In their owne colours obiects to descry,</l>
      <l>To know Appearance from pure Verity,</l>
      <l>Would take a right suruey of what's below,</l>
      <l>The <hi>Spheare</hi> and <hi>Center</hi> of true Blisse to know;</l>
      <l>And not (as those Astronomers, who take</l>
      <l>Great heights by Instruments vnequall) make</l>
      <l>Vnpardonable errors: So the Sense</l>
      <l>Fore-taken, blinding the Intelligence</l>
      <l>(Void of proportion) should presume to raigne</l>
      <l>A Handmaid o're the Mistresse; or to gaine</l>
      <l>So great preheminence, as Iudge to be</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="7"/>
Of perfect Blisse, or true Felicitie:</l>
      <l>Then as in Landskipp's, where we thinke appeare</l>
      <l>Disioyned farre parts that indeed are neare,</l>
      <l>Little things great: Or as that hellish art</l>
      <l>By altering the <hi>Medium,</hi> doth impart</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Chimera's</hi> to the Senses, and doth make</l>
      <l>Th'astonisht Powers for Truth Impostures take:</l>
      <l>We should discerne the glossed Alchimy</l>
      <l>Of our allurements, and the vanity</l>
      <l>Of worldly pleasures; and vndoubting know</l>
      <l>Our ioyes are dreames, how euer faire in show.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Wee are but In-mates heere, and entertain'd</l>
      <l>As if no Denizens, or rather chayn'd</l>
      <l>In golden fetters; When first Life began,</l>
      <l>A darkesome prison clos'd vp wretched man:</l>
      <l>Whence if we rightly come, we fall vpon</l>
      <l>An ominous precipitation.</l>
      <l>So witty's ruine, so importunate</l>
      <l>Vpon mankind; so seemeth angry Fate</l>
      <l>To enuy vs the least conceipt of ioy,</l>
      <l>As all things doe conspire to our annoy.</l>
      <l>The Elements, that so much disagree,</l>
      <l>Band against vs, their common Enemie:</l>
      <l>Yea, that which, void of substance, Essence takes</l>
      <l>From that first motion which all motions makes,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Time,</hi> measure of our ioyes, is tedious growne,</l>
      <l>And not by pleasures, but afflictions knowne;</l>
      <l>Whome Tyrant-like we would deceiue, and bend</l>
      <l>(Only to shun, what least we wish) to end:</l>
      <l>Yet, as if Sorrowes we might not enioy,</l>
      <l>Or as the Fates did enuy our annoy,</l>
      <l>So as they would not grant vs Time for woe,</l>
      <l>Our Time's contracted, as Tymes larger grow;</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="8"/>
And their increase doth hasten to their waine,</l>
      <l>Hopelesse to bring them to their spring againe.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>For in the worlds first infancy, when man</l>
      <l>Aequall wellnigh vnto the <hi>Spheares,</hi> began</l>
      <l>His being, then was absolute, and he</l>
      <l>Enfranchized to Immortality:</l>
      <l>But forfaiting this state, though Death could claime</l>
      <l>And challenge part in him; yet the strong fraime,</l>
      <l>And firme connexion of his parts, did cause</l>
      <l>A lasting vnion, and a during pause.</l>
      <l>Th'immortall <hi>Starres,</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> then seemd to striue,</l>
      <l>Ioint-tennants to the world, who should suruiue.</l>
      <l>Now <hi>Time,</hi> hath Time abridg'd, our Life's a breath</l>
      <l>Which scarcely drawne, is stopped straight by death.</l>
      <l>The world's in a Consumption, not as then</l>
      <l>We seeme mankind, nor the same sonnes of men;</l>
      <l>And seiz'd as with an <hi>Hecticke,</hi> seemes to dance</l>
      <l>His sickly motions, led with discordance.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Behold how those, which as they moue, do giue</l>
      <l>By sympathie, to moue, to breath, to liue:</l>
      <l>The golden <hi>Spheares</hi> are in their motions chang'd,</l>
      <l>And from their former courses seeme estrang'd.</l>
      <l>The liuely Spring, the Summer we behold</l>
      <l>Like those weake children, who are borne of old</l>
      <l>And sap-lesse Parents, quite degenerate,</l>
      <l>Void of their ancient strength, their vigorous state.</l>
      <l>In vaine we seeke the stations of the Sun,</l>
      <l>And falsely thinke the wandring Planets run</l>
      <l>Their wonted courses: <hi>Southward</hi> still they flye</l>
      <l>And leaue our Clime stain'd with Impietie.</l>
      <l>So when our Proto-martyrs Holy gore,</l>
      <l>Guiltlesse it self, made guiltie <hi>Verlam's</hi> shore,</l>
      <l>The siluer <hi>Thames</hi> recall'd his ancient floud,</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <l>And left the soile distain'd with sacred bloud.</l>
      <l>Distracted Nature, seemeth to haue lost</l>
      <l>Coherence, with a thousand Monsters crost,</l>
      <l>A thousand Prodigies; Proportion's gone,</l>
      <l>Strength is decay'd, lost is Connexion.</l>
      <l>Sometimes strang <hi>Starres</hi> affright th'amazed skie,</l>
      <l>The ayre oft thunders, it not knowing why.</l>
      <l>More strange Coniunctions do the Heau'ns infest,</l>
      <l>And bloudy <hi>Comets</hi> rayse a worser crest.</l>
      <l>Winter yields Flowers, the lusty <hi>Ramme</hi> that bore,</l>
      <l>Through the salt-waues, young <hi>Phryxus</hi> to the shore</l>
      <l>The barren Earth oft ceaseth to supply,</l>
      <l>And leaues to yield his wonted fragrancie.</l>
      <l>Summer is bare: The <hi>Dogge</hi> whome heat did vex,</l>
      <l>With moisture oftner doth the world perplexe.</l>
      <l>The furious Winds are fiercer growne; and more,</l>
      <l>The thundring billowes rend the conquered shore:</l>
      <l>As when our Ile, from <hi>Belgia's</hi> fore-land rent,</l>
      <l>Did yield her selfe to that proud Element.</l>
      <l>So when the Chariot of the golden Sun</l>
      <l>By the first cradle of the world did run;</l>
      <l>In wandring from its path, did often stray,</l>
      <l>And ignorant did leaue th'vntracked way:</l>
      <l>Or with its proper weight deprest, did take</l>
      <l>A doubtfull course, and different times did make</l>
      <l>Confusedly the same; when Heate did cloy</l>
      <l>The <hi>Thracian</hi> shafts, and Cold the Dogge annoy.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Strange signes are these, yet more then these, doth rage</l>
      <l>Feare in our Harts that nothing can asswage;</l>
      <l>Mis-giuing minds foretell our ills, and show</l>
      <l>Th'vnsure condition of the world below,</l>
      <l>Whose Loue is sourse of all these feares. Then kill</l>
      <l>And sacrifice the Cause of all this ill;</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="9"/>
This offring shall thee expiate, and giue</l>
      <l>By death deseru'd, deserued power to liue.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>O would our Soules vpon themselues reflect,</l>
      <l>And search from whence Content they might expect;</l>
      <l>Which mindfull of their birth, do scorne to flye</l>
      <l>At other marke then faire Eternity!</l>
      <l>Then should wee see, how like the Towring Fyre</l>
      <l>They would to Heau'n their home, their <hi>Spheare,</hi> aspire</l>
      <l>Which only is their Center. Heere below</l>
      <l>Hope sailes with Feare, and Ioyes with Sorrowes flow;</l>
      <l>No true content is had. A tottring sand</l>
      <l>That fleeting yields, and leaues not where to stand</l>
      <l>Is our short life. Our pleasures, like the gold</l>
      <l>The <hi>Alchymist</hi> produceth, to behold</l>
      <l>Beauteous inough, but by the powerfull flame</l>
      <l>Straight turn'd to smoke, or matter whence it came.</l>
      <l>Our Ioyes are dy'de with Oaker, euery showre</l>
      <l>Defaceth their false Lustre. <hi>Honours, Power,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Are only vapours, which the growing day</l>
      <l>Or hoater Sun dissolues, and driues away.</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Beauty's</hi> vnperfect, like that plenteous fry</l>
      <l>Halfe flesh, halfe mud, that on <hi>Niles</hi> bancks doth lye.</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Riches</hi> a crazed Ship, vnsure defence</l>
      <l>In need to those that there put confidence.</l>
      <l>Our <hi>Knowledge</hi> skilfull Ignorance; and Art</l>
      <l>The plague <hi>Prometheus</hi> did to man impart</l>
      <l>By his stolne fire, that makes ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap> soules to fry</l>
      <l>With feauers of fond Curiositie.</l>
      <l>All vnder Heau'n is vaine: <hi>Wealth, Dignitie,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Beauty, Principalitie,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Are distant from the <hi>Spheare</hi> where <hi>Ioy</hi> doth moue;</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Rest</hi> d wells below them, <hi>Happinesse</hi> aboue.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Then giue a little time, and see how heere</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="9"/>
These <hi>Heròes</hi> scorning what the world holds deere,</l>
      <l>Did make a way to <hi>Immortality,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>And by Contempt attain'd <hi>Felicity.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Heere shall you see no sumptuous Houses fraught</l>
      <l>With Banquets, or with Viands dearely bought;</l>
      <l>No costly Beds shining with <hi>Tyrian</hi> dye,</l>
      <l>No Iewell faing'd for glistering brauerye,</l>
      <l>No roomes replete with Musickes charming sound,</l>
      <l>No Followers with eyes fixt on the ground:</l>
      <l>But Woods and naked Rocks, and thereupon</l>
      <l>Horrour express't. Heere base Refection;</l>
      <l>Small time to sleep allotted; Bodyes clad</l>
      <l>In basest rayment; Men in penance glad,</l>
      <l>Delighted in their paynes, whome Life did tyre,</l>
      <l>Whose Hope was Heau'n, and Death their cheif Desire.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But yet no cruell <hi>Furies</hi> do perplexe</l>
      <l>Their quiet rest; no pining Cares do vexe</l>
      <l>Or trouble their Content; nor Enuy clad</l>
      <l>In faire appearance, euer made them sad.</l>
      <l>True Rest, great Ioyes in their small Cells reside,</l>
      <l>And perfect smiles from spotlesse hearts do glide;</l>
      <l>Whose soules remembring whence they came, contayne</l>
      <l>Themselues and Heau'n, and striue it to regayne.</l>
      <l>Then loose thy selfe with these, with these to winne</l>
      <l>That Heritage, which thou hast lost by Sinne.</l>
