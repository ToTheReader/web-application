   <lg>
      <l>WEll Minion you'le be gadding forth then? goe,</l>
      <l>Goe, hast vnto thy speedy ouerthrow:</l>
      <l>And since thou wilt not take my warning: Hence,</l>
      <l>Learne thy owne ruine by experience.</l>
      <l>Alas poore Maid (if so I her may call</l>
      <l>Who itches to be prostitute to all</l>
      <l>Adulterate censures) were it not for thee</l>
      <l>Better, to liue in sweet securitie</l>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <l>In my small cell, than flying rashly out,</l>
      <l>Be whoop't, and hiss't, and gaz'd at all about</l>
      <l>Like a day-owle: Faith Mistris you'le be put</l>
      <l>One of these daies to serue some driveling slut,</l>
      <l>To wrap her sope in, or at least be droven</l>
      <l>To keepe a Pie from scorching in the Oven;</l>
      <l>Or else expos'd a laughing stock to sots,</l>
      <l>To cloke Tobacco, or stop Mustard pots,</l>
      <l>Thou wilt be grac't if so thou canst but win</l>
      <l>To infold Frankincense or Mackrills in,</l>
      <l>You deem't forsooth a matter of high worth</l>
      <l>To haue a fame among'em: <hi>New come forth;</hi>
      </l>
      <l>And thinke your chiefe felicity is marr'd</l>
      <l>If you be not perch't vp in <hi>Paules</hi> Church-yard</l>
      <l>Where men a farre may know you in a trice,</l>
      <l>By some new-fangled, brasse-cut Frontispice.</l>
      <l>Such book's indeed as now-dayes can passe</l>
      <l>Had need to haue their faces made of brasse.</l>
      <l>Is it not then sufficient for you</l>
      <l>To stay at home among the residue</l>
      <l>Of better sisters: where my dearest <hi>Will,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>And other friends would praise and loue thee still:</l>
      <l>Him and my other harts-halfes I account</l>
      <l>Intire assemblies, and thinke they surmount</l>
      <l>A Globe of addle Gallants: I averre,</l>
      <l>One iudging <hi>Plato</hi> worth a Theater.</l>
      <l>But you me thinks of all the rest should feare</l>
      <l>The searching rayes of censure, least you bleare</l>
      <l>You tender fame: who can choose but disdaine</l>
      <l>The first <hi>Minerua</hi> of an idle braine.</l>
      <l>Pen'd ere I well was past a boy, or downe</l>
      <l>With silken mosse, my maiden chin did crowne.</l>
      <l>Blacke <hi>Lycophron</hi> redeem'd of late by mee</l>
      <l>From the darke graue of deepe obscuritie,</l>
      <l>And taught to stalke in English measures, dreads</l>
      <l>The censure of the Beast with hundred Heads,</l>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <l>And keeps close home: like one from deepe of night</l>
      <l>That cannot quickly brooke the dazling light.</l>
      <l>My labour'd <hi>Merlin,</hi> Brittish <hi>Lycophron,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Still sitteth in his dreary delue alone,</l>
      <l>And as yet wary Prophecies, that who</l>
      <l>Leape into'th world too soone, themselues vndoe.</l>
      <l>My devout Holy-dayes yet secret lurke,</l>
      <l>And dare not frame themselues vnto a worke.</l>
      <l>My merry Paradoxes, still laughing sit,</l>
      <l>And dare not mocke the world, in Publicke yet:</l>
      <l>Yea my deare Syren-twins, keepe still at home</l>
      <l>Though almost fledg'd and ready now to rome</l>
      <l>About the world: with hundred crotchets more,</l>
      <l>My Patromonie, Portion, wealth and store,</l>
      <l>Yea and these riches so contentfull, I</l>
      <l>Would not forgoe for all the Treasury</l>
      <l>Th' Exchequer holds) wilt thou then of them all</l>
      <l>Dare in these times distracted clutches fall?</l>
      <l>Oh, tis a way that spoiles things haply good</l>
      <l>When itching youngsters crop themselues i'th bud,</l>
      <l>And so proue rotten before ripe, to win't,</l>
      <l>That they may have their names but seene in print.</l>
      <l>But seeke not thou about the world to gad</l>
      <l>Before thou hast an Eagles triall had;</l>
      <l>Then dare to Impe thy full fledg'd wings and flie</l>
      <l>Neerer than other Muses to the skie.</l>
      <l>Out-face the Sun, and sing such notes as may</l>
      <l>Approue that thou art worthy of the day.</l>
      <l>Great glory sure they get and solide fame,</l>
      <l>Who to obtaine a Month-enduring Name</l>
      <l>Make monstrous bookes, which did they fill the stalls,</l>
      <l>Yea were they pil'd vp to the top of <hi>Paules</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Would quickly vent, when for a month or two</l>
      <l>One shall not passe but he shall heare adoe</l>
      <l>And fresh enquiries for the booke; anon</l>
      <l>Ye shall heare faintly, This, a yeare agon</l>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <l>Was a braue booke, this was a booke indeed.</l>
      <l>Ah haples he who now is put to read</l>
      <l>The jade-tir'd lines. Thus both such bookes &amp; makers</l>
      <l>Are both of same fame, and same fate partakers.</l>
      <l>Liue for a day, and flourish, but at night,</l>
      <l>Like the short Roses, vanish with the light.</l>
      <l>But care not thou whether vaine fame doe giue</l>
      <l>That thou dost now, or maist heerafter liue.</l>
      <l>And know that Poem's truely fram'd, relie</l>
      <l>Not on the present but posterity.</l>
      <l>And learned Poets think't sufficient gaine</l>
      <l>If that they after death may but obtaine</l>
      <l>Their <hi>Postume</hi> glories: nor thinke that these times</l>
      <l>Can rightly iudge of well deseruing rimes,</l>
      <l>We must expect another age, for this</l>
      <l>Scarce knoweth whether prose or Poem ti's.</l>
      <l>For Poem's now admir'd, are onely those</l>
      <l>Change but the words a little they are prose</l>
      <l>As plaine as <hi>Holinshed,</hi> each feeble line,</l>
      <l>As foot-pac't as this poore <hi>L'envoy</hi> of mine.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But tell me when thou into'th world art come</l>
      <l>How wilt thou please the multitude, when some</l>
      <l>Vnlesse thou canst outbaudy <hi>Martial,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Or loose-pen'd <hi>Arbiter,</hi> will stiffly call</l>
      <l>Thee slight and witlesse: did but this clew lead thee,</l>
      <l>The greatest Ladies then would daine to read thee</l>
      <l>And in their perfum'd bosomes would infold</l>
      <l>Thee willinger, than Chaines of Pearle and Gold,</l>
      <l>Or <hi>Aristotles</hi> Problems: great men would make thee</l>
      <l>Their nere companion, and to Church would take thee.</l>
      <l>Instead of Psalmes (if so to Church they goe,</l>
      <l>God knowes aboue whether they do or no.)</l>
      <l>Others there are whose addle empty braines</l>
      <l>Vnlesse thou fill with loue-sicke-puling straines</l>
      <l>Will proue starke made against thee: All in all</l>
      <l>Would haue this garbe: the Prentice at his stall</l>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <l>Itching would buzze vpon thee: and each maid</l>
      <l>That faine would yet dare not professe the trade</l>
      <l>Because sh' ha's been well brought vp: Infinite</l>
      <l>The number is will call thee Parasite</l>
      <l>Because thou medlest not with any things</l>
      <l>Touching the State, Embassadors or Kings,</l>
      <l>O such an one, say they: To these replie</l>
      <l>So deare I will not my repentance buy,</l>
      <l>Nor will I tread in such vnequall measure,</l>
      <l>As at my danger to procure you pleasure.</l>
      <l>But what I can, will striue to blazon forth</l>
      <l>My Countries honour and my Kings: the worth</l>
      <l>Of any person who shall merit prayse</l>
      <l>For such I watch and bite the frantick bayes</l>
      <l>But the most part are such as those who vow</l>
      <l>That Muse is dull and drie whose crabed brow</l>
      <l>Skoul's not forth Satires: the Meere title seene</l>
      <l>But of a scourge excell's the Faery Queene.</l>
      <l>To these say thus: would you haue me, a Muse</l>
      <l>So rude and vnexperienc't to abuse</l>
      <l>Her harmles quill? write satyres? That's the worke</l>
      <l>of brazen pens, with danger that dare ierke</l>
      <l>And sweare their Inke from blushing: which expert</l>
      <l>In the bad world dare venter to insert</l>
      <l>Particulars which makes the world to sweare</l>
      <l>They needs a part in wickednesse must beare</l>
      <l>They open it so naked: such their spirit</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Caesar</hi> with them is <hi>Casar</hi> if he merit:</l>
      <l>For me to satyrize from blow-point age</l>
      <l>Cloister'd in circuit of a college cage</l>
      <l>where my experience of Ill nere flew</l>
      <l>Beyond the lurching of a dish or two,</l>
      <l>Where sophismes miss't were held crimes out of reason</l>
      <l>And the not capping fellow's chiefest treason,</l>
      <l>The greatest Libells there they hold of take</l>
      <l>Some cowl-slaffe shew or witty Almanaka.</l>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <l>And such faults as are punisht by the Deanes</l>
      <l>I know not what a states corruption meanes,</l>
      <l>What bribery is; or what it is to wracke</l>
      <l>The vulgar neckes, or breake the commons back</l>
      <l>but satyrists sterne quill must rip vp faults</l>
      <l>From womb of night whose acting makes the vaults</l>
      <l>Of Heauen blush, which in a fearefull brood</l>
      <l>Are hatch't by sin and nourtred by blood</l>
      <l>Headlong reuenge, Extortion, Orphans crie</l>
      <l>Are fitt for them, and fearefull Leachery</l>
      <l>But I a Muse that drinke a milder Chalice</l>
      <l>Shall I poore snake creepe in and sting the malice</l>
      <l>Of crimes more fit for <hi>Iuvenall,</hi> or him</l>
      <l>That wrap't his lashes in obscure and dim</l>
      <l>Clouds of reuenge, asham'd to tell the crimes</l>
      <l>Openly which were acted in those times.</l>
      <l>To liue in Court I nere so high could rise</l>
      <l>How should I then begin to satyrize.</l>
      <l>Nor am I yet so wicked as to bee</l>
      <l>Experienc't in all iniquity</l>
      <l>Which satyrists must scourge: I shall in time</l>
      <l>May be vnto the gall of satyres climbe</l>
      <l>If this cannot content their quenit enquiry</l>
      <l>Tell'em thou hast a brazen pen, with fiery</l>
      <l>Full fled'gd, heart-goring wings, a stubborne pen</l>
      <l>Not to be spent on paper but on men</l>
      <l>With inke steep't full of bitter gall. Now flie</l>
      <l>Vpon the wings of humble modestie</l>
      <l>And thy selfe happy herein vnderstand,</l>
      <l>That thou must come to such a <hi>Heroes</hi> hand</l>
      <l>Whose onely name can free thee from the hate</l>
      <l>Of vulgar preiudice, and vindicate</l>
      <l>Thee from the Lethe of obliuion. Thus</l>
      <l>Wishing to thee some lucky Genius</l>
      <l>Farewell my Muse: and think't a shame to rush</l>
      <l>Into the world and seene there once, to blush.</l>
