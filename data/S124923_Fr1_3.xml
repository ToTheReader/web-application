   <head>TO THE SAME Right Honourable and happie Societie of all true Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers militant in England: A Friend to you, and the Author, wisheth fulnesse of grace, peace, and heavenly comfort, certaine assurance; sealed evidence, and seasonable entrance into, and possession of the celestiall, promised, incorruptible, undefiled and never fading in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloved Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, both you and I, are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb facs="10"/>beholden to our everliving Father, who hath made his will and given all us his children great wealth, rich portions, and large Legacies. Now, in present pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, Graces, and comforts, in unsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken expectation and assured reversion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and eternall glory. Wee are greatly beholding to <hi>Iehova,</hi> for his will damnato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb facs="10"/>directorie, horta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, correctorie, but most of all for his will consolatorie, in which, he salves all our sores, physicks all our sicknesses, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines al our maladies,<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 103.4.</note> heales all our disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and crownes us with loving kindnes and tender mercies? And surely wee are all of us much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the holy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this sweet
<pb facs="11"/>(though little) booke, who hath so piously, painefully, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably perused the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will of our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, and wisely sought and found out and put into our handes, the spirituall portion, and soule-le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies, given and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed unto us by our best friend, many of which, most of us scarce knew of, few sought and sued for
<pb facs="11"/>them, and very few comfortably enjoyed and wisely and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently used, to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours glory and their owne good. Carelesse children, come often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be beholding unto their more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full brethren and thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving friends, who save all they have, sue for all that is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and seeke for all they heare of: so is it here, we careless, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
<pb facs="12"/>poore and ill thriven Christians, must bee beholding to this carefull, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, rich and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriven author, who obeyes <hi>Pauls</hi> counsell<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 12 31.</note>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 31. Couets earnestly the best gifts and will not suffer the heavenly Father, to purse and keep a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that is due, to with-hold grace or comfort (which hee hath promised) in
<pb facs="12"/>whole, or degree, but he shall heare of his promise, and if hee do not presently ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill according to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, a petition is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily drawne, to bee preferred in the court of heaven, and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate prepared lesus Christ the righteous.<note n="c" place="margin">1 Ioh. 2.1</note>1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.1. Suite (by prayer) begun, and in an eager pursuite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till the thing promised bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
   <pb facs="13"/>
   <p> This little booke, &amp; private practice of the author (who hath sued for all these Legacies, and in some good measure hath attained the same, and thereby is become spiritually rich) will sufficiently proove what I have spoken. VVee are much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, for letting us see our portion and lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb facs="13"/>in our fathers wil and setting us a work both by penne and practise to sue for the same.</p>
   <p>The volume is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but the vertue contained in the same is great. The booke is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for application and practise. The scope and drift of it is, to furnish beleevers with abundance of
<pb facs="14"/>good; to free them from all sins inward, outward, secret, and open; To fill them with all graces in life, power, and exercise; To bring them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in, and seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deliverance from, all their troubles; To draw downe upon their soules &amp; bodies abundance of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of all sorts and natures: to give them full assurance of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="14"/>and seasonable entrance into glory, and to give them fast hold of heaven.</p>
   <p>There are many, I know, that will little regard it: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane person wil not like it, for it is full of holinesse: the carnall protestant will not discerne of it, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish it, for it is spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: the dissembling hypocrite wil not wel approve of it, for it
<pb facs="15"/>will rob him of his <hi>Rimmon</hi> slay his M<seg rend="sup">rs.</seg>, his <hi>Delilah,</hi> his <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> his daling sinne, it will tell him, if he applyes promises, hee must keepe the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, obey praecept, and put every iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie though never so pleasurable or profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble far way from his Tabernacles. But the honest hearted and sinceere beleever will approve of it, prize it,
<pb facs="15"/>use it, and profit by it.</p>
   <p>And not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, as one desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to make it more vendible and sailable (for neither I, nor its author (God is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) ayme at any such thing, but at the spiritual good of their soules unto whom it shall come) this little booke, like a well fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led little Apothecaries

Wantest thou Grace, comfort, deliverance, blessing, or any good thing? Behold here thou mayest have them, to the great joy of theine heart, and content of thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
   <p>Set faith a worke
<pb facs="21"/>to draw out what thou wantest, &amp; thou shalt have it. Sucke these sweet and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly breasts of God by the mouth of thy faith; open these pipes and veines of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, which run so full of mercy, grace, truth, comfort, joy &amp; peace, for every beele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by faith; and thou shalt be satiate with every good thing.</p>
   <p>Lest I shold make
<pb facs="21"/>too great a porch for this little house, and too great gates for this little citie, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, with an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to all my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved brethren and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, which are belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to perfect their faith by application of the promises, both of these in this sweet little booke, and of all others, contained in the Old and New Testament.</p>
   <pb facs="22"/>
   <p> Suffer not GODS promises (as I may so say) to milke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, doe you draw them, let not good rest with God, which you may have, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving and begging, to your great comfort and inriching, but take Gods commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities off his hand, trade with that weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Merchant in the farre Countrey, the Lord Iesus in heaven,
<pb facs="22"/>for his rich commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of graces and comforts, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hopes untill you be rich and wealthy, and for this purpose cause those two good factours, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> founded upon and quickned &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promises, alway to trade for you in heaven, untill you come thither your selves. I would desire
<pb facs="23"/>all beleevers to make this their pocket book that it may sollicite and wooe them to prayer, make solid &amp; firme their faith, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their graces, cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and heavenly hopes, prepare them for induring the stormes of trouble &amp; tempests of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and may incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them in holy weldoing and chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian perseverance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

         <hi>Heh.</hi> 6.12</note> Now bretheren; my hearts desire is, that yee bee not slothfull, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of them, who through faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience inherit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
   <p>That you may bee inheritours of them, it shalbe my daily prayer unto the Lord my God, to bestow upon your heartes to use all good meanes, for the attaining of
<pb facs="24"/>the good, in these &amp; other promises of God unto his people. That he would teach and enable you to meditate upon them diligently day and night, to beleeve thē firmly, to apply thē severally, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, personally, to sue for them earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by prayer constant and fervent, to wait for their promised ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
