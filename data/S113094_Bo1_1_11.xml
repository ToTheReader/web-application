   <p>FRiendly and Christian Reader, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto haue ye perceiued in plaine &amp;
<pb n="60" facs="61"/> simple manner, howe sicke persons are to be comforted, I haue also shortly she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed you, first of Repentaunce, then of Faith, and afterward of Good workes, which I haue not done only for the sick, and for such as be ready to dye, but also for them that be in health: to the intent that they that be whole, in the time of their prosperitie and good health, maye learne how to vse and behaue them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and learne in time to dye. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more certeine then death, and nothing more vncerteine then to come vnto the right knowledge to dye. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought euery man before to prepare himselfe, and to make ready to take this iourney in hand, and go forward, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may be carefull for that that will necessarily followe. But specially ought we to remember these thinges before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and cōtinually exercise our selues in the crosse of warre, specially nowe in the sore daungerous warre against the cruell enimie of Christendome y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      <hi>Turke,</hi> which if he haue the victorie, spareth no man, but without all mercy, heweth
<pb facs="62"/> downe the miserable Christians, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them, and shooteth them through, where many times y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wounded bodies a long time lye in the gréene medowes, before they be brought into the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter house, in great daunger of despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he were not before well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and exercised in Gods worde. So that this souldier must fight with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy against the <hi>Turke,</hi> and with his soule against the Diuell him selfe. Howbeit, this shall be their comforte, out of the Prophet Daniel, the 7.<note place="margin">

         </gap>aniel. 7.</note> Chapter: That these murtherers of christians &amp; bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houndes, doe onely by this meanes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Christian soules, and doe further them to euerlasting life. For he setteth him selfe with all his might, in greate force against the Saintes of God, and chiefly warreth against them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without all question, when so euer a Christian man is slaine and ouercom by the <hi>Turke,</hi> yet dyeth he with a safe cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in that that he is a Christian: for he séeth, that this warre is against the Saintes of GOD, without cause.
<pb n="61" facs="62"/> For the <hi>Turke</hi> hath no lawfull occasion to fight against the Christians, and so miserably to spill Christian bloud. Thus therfore dye they so much the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller, séeing they go foorth in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their superiours: and do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defend their owne countrie and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but also with their owne bloud, help to preserue Christian religion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good Christian, learne in time to dye, for thou knowest neither time nor houre, neither place nor manner, when, howe, either what maner of death thou shalt haue, specially in this last and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous time. Therefore deferre not till the last pushe, least that you tarrie too long. Learne, learn this cunning while thou hast time, memorie, and oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie therevnto. Then shall you go the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest way, séeing the daye must néedes come, yeald thy selfe in time, with desire and will therevnto, for it can not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded. Wherevnto our Lorde GOD giue vs grace, that we may well and happily depart. Amen.</p>
   <p>Howbeit, no man is to be tied and
<pb facs="63"/> bound to vse euery matter, as it is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conteined, but if any other can or haue better, much good do it them: for I haue here remembred certeine tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherein I my selfe like a poore, simple, plaine man, haue bene tempted and assaulted with, and haue experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, (if I may boast my self of my weak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse:) for I haue thrise béene at that point, that euery man gaue me ouer, and despaired of my life in this worlde, yet at the last, our Lorde GOD by his great power reuiued me: wherefore I giue vnto him euerlasting prayse and thankes in Christ our Lorde. I will not say, that in my days I haue gone to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Christian people, I haue comforted them, and haue bene at their end, whose names be written in the booke of life: where I haue experienced diuers and many temptations. GOD graunt both thée &amp; me his godly grace, that we may also blessedly sléepe at the last in Christe our Lorde, and through Gods power at the last day, may be raised vp to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life. Amen.</p>
