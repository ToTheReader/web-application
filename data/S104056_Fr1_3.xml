   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
this
short Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate,
(which may
bee rather styl'd a
<pb facs="3"/>
superficiall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
then an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
expression of the
of the passages of
Queene <hi>Elizabeth's</hi>
Life in her minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:)
I could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend vnto whom
the Patronage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
might more iustly

Lord <hi>Hunsdon,</hi> after
Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> to
her Maiestie (her
neere and deare Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:)
was the most
<pb facs="3"/>
constant Friend and
faithfull Assistant in
all her troubles and
dangers, who not
onely imploy'd his
whole industry, and
made vse of his best
Friends: but liberally
expended his means,
&amp; hazarded his owne
person as an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser
betwixt her
safety, and the malice
of her potent aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
which makes
me somthing to wō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that so great and
remarkeable a zeale
<pb facs="4"/>
exprest in a time of
such ineuitable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
when all Her
friends were held the
Queene her Sisters e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies;
and her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
the Queenes
friends; when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
sentences of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of Death were
thundred against her;
that her (I say) whom
neither promises of
fauor could disswade
from her Loue, nor
threatnings of death,
<pb facs="4"/>
deterre from her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
should not bee
so much as once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
of Her Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
Be this therefore
(Right Honourable)
a lasting Testimony
of his unchanged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to her and her
Innocence from the
beginning, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
a long-liu'd
Monument▪ of her
Royall gratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

confidence shee had

at the Campe of
<hi>Tilbury</hi> in the yeare
1588. where hee
solely cōmanded the
Guard for her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
owne Person,
which consisted of
Lances, Light-Horse,

It hath pleased your
Lordship to censure
fauourably of some
of my weak Labours
not long since pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb facs="5"/>
before you,
which the rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
mee, to
make a free tender
of this small peece of

my boldnesse should
beget the least distast
from you, I must flye
for refuge, to that
