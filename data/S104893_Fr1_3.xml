   <head>To all true English heartes: <hi>faith, peace, thankefulnes, and</hi> all godlinesse is wished <hi>in the Lord our</hi> Sauiour.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE greater your bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites are, which ye haue receiued from the Lord (deere brethren) the more shoulde bee your thankfulnes vnto him: and hauing much forgeuen you, ye should with Mary also loue much, ye haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed a most blessed &amp; long time of peace and prosperitie, vnder our most gratious, godlie and soueraigne Lady Queene Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, whom GOD long preserue: and through her Christian gouerment, such excellent blessings, both for the bodie and the Soule, as the like no nation vnder Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at this day doeth enioy, for which the Lord expecteth your thankful heartes and faithfull loue towards him. But alas, your long peace &amp; prosperitie hath brought too
<pb facs="4"/> many men into such a carelesse security &amp; contempt of the true Religiō so long vsed amongst you, that thereby the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of so blessed a time is iustlie occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to lament, and to wishe rather an ende of her course, than that her continuance should yeeld long Libertie to such men, so to abuse the Lord &amp; his creatures, by their horrible sinnes and iniquities. As the old Israelites recompenced their long peace with al kinde of vngodlines: so haue Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe men rewarded the Lorde euill for good, to the great griefe of his Soule, the sorow of the true Englishe heartes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of his blessings. The benefit of their time also they either doe not knowe, or haue forgotten it: for they endeuour not to vse her, but euery way to abuse her, and wast out the time in their worldlie vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which being once let gon, is neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called againe. Neyther may you thinke, that only the Lorde is greued, your selues are sory, and Time lamenteth: but that also all the Creatures of GOD (as Paule testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) <note place="margin">Ro. 8.</note>
      <pb facs="5"/> which senie for mans vse, feeling how monstruously they are abused by thē which shoulde in godlines vse them with thankfulnes, doe altogether in one harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny &amp; consent grone &amp; sigh for speedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, not willing, as it were, to serue any longer to the benefite of ingratefull men. And that, were it not, for your sakes which trust in your Lorde (as in Iosua his house vnder so gratious a princesse) which praie heartely to the Lorde euen in the night when others sleep, which performe true fidelitie and obedience to GOD and your Soueraigne: it coulde not otherwise bee, but that the treacheries conspired, and horrible plagues threatned against vs would take effect: which yet the vngodly consider not, and therefore they endeuour neither repentance nor holines of life, nor vse time, nor to take time therunto. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I beseech you, for the tender mercies of Christ, that you hold on, as ye haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne in faithfulnes and true obedience to GOD and your Queene, to liue in vnitie
<pb facs="5"/> and loue within your selues, and to fight against your enemies with that Spirituall Armor which Saint Paule hath appointed you. Then shal ye be stronger than your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, <note place="margin">Eph. 6.</note> be they neuer so manie, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to beate downe the verie hammer of the earth to his shame &amp; confusion. Then shall Goliath fall downe before Dauid, &amp; Senacherib before Hezekias yea Sisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra shall perish before Deborah, Haman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Hester, and proud Holofernes shalbe slaine by a womans hand. The Lord giue vs his grace, to redeeme the time because the dayes are euill, to know the time of our visitation, and what belongeth to our peace, to seeke the Lord, whiles he may be found, and praie vnto him now whiles he is neare: that wee may thereby enioy the benefite of our happie time, that the true hearted may reioyce in spirite, that the Creatures may be willing to serue for our comfort; and that the Lorde may bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thereby the sooner to lead vs to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting peace through Christ Iesus our Lord Amen.</p>
