      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onsidering (christian
Reader) that in euerye
place, all those who
haue found any sound
comfort in the Gospel,
are desirous to expresse the same in
their conuersations, by walking in
thankfulnesse as it becommeth the
seruants of Christ, to adorne their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and yet notwithstanding the
greatest part do much fayle herein:
I haue thought it my bounden duety
to afford vnto thē such helpe as God
hath vouchsafed mee in this behalfe.
For alasse it it too manifest, that too
many euen of them, do omit sundry
and those of most necessary dueties, as
by looking perhaps to some of the
dutyes of the first Table, neglect the
second, or to the second onely omit
the first, which is called the great
commaundement: or looking onely
to the law, are too short for the gospel:



<pb facs="5"/>
or boasting of faith regard not works.
Others lie in fearefull sinnes thorough
ignorance hereof. And very many are
obserued dayly to fal into grieuous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
to the dishonour of Christ, and
discredit of their profession, yea to the
griefe of the godly, offending the
weake, hardning the vngodly eye, to
open the mouthes of the Papists, and
Atheists, with all the profane, to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
that glorious name whereby
we are called. And not onely so, but
more also to the wounding of their
owne consciences, and giuing aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to Sathan, to accuse them before
the Lord. Nay sundrye of most vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
hearts, and who haue made good
proceedings in godlinesse, are yet
known to lie languishing vnder the
burthen of their sinnes, and feare of
Gods displeasure, thorough want of
knowledge howe to finde out their
speciall offences, whereby their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
are disquieted, &amp; Gods hand
doth lie so heauily vpon them: Many



<pb facs="5"/>
liuing in continuall doubt whether
they bee in the fauour of God or no:
great multitudes in all places ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
thrusting themselues vnreuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the presence of the Lord, to
the word, sacraments, and all other
exercises of the seruice of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any examination, or preparation
of their hearts before, to the prouok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the grieuous wrath of the Lord
thereby. Now for these (I say) and for
al other, whose desire is to walke with
God, and be pleasing vnto him, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the true felicity that is in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
I haue thought my selfe bounde
by the Communion of Saints, to offer
this my poore labour, which first was
vndertaken for my selfe and some few
of my christian friends: the better to
preuent all the former euills, and for
the more easye obtayning the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
following such a carefull watch.
Herein I haue vsed the helpe of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
learned and godly diuines, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
chiefely the direction of these



<pb facs="6"/>
two holy men of GOD, Maister
<hi>Greenham</hi> and Maister <hi>Perkins;</hi> whose
writings were the first occasions of
thinking hereof:<note place="margin">M. Greenhā in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of an afflicted conscience pag. 130.</note> the one requiring
this examination necessarily vnto true
and sound repentance,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Perkins.</hi> of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. cap. 7.</note> the other for
the thorough curing of the wounded
conscience. And hence also I haue bin
more incouraged, to make this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
not vpon any vaine or by respect,
but by some gracious experience of
the profit hereof in both accordingly:
especially in restoring some of no
meane note, from much trouble, and
horrour of conscience, to exceeding
ioy, and strong assurance, when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
means haue fayled. Neither can
this seeme strange to any considering
it aright; for what is it that brings that
peace and ioy of conscience passing
all vnderstanding to a Christian soule
but an assured testimony of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that we doe not lie in any
one sinne, so farre as by wise searching
wee are able to finde it out, but hate



<pb facs="6"/>
and abhorre euen the very least? and
contrarily, that we haue begun, and so
striue on forward to walke in euery
commandement of God without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe:
and that of true loue to our
Lord and Sauiour: for to such a soule
onely all the promises doe appertaine,
as they are applyed thorough the
whole Booke of GOD. In a word,
I haue beene more imboldened, by
obseruing dayly, how on the one side
the godly preachers, vpon euery oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
calling men to repentance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
all earnestly with the Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi>
to examine and try their wayes,<note place="margin">Lā. 39. 40.</note>
&amp; turne againe vnto the Lord, if euer
they will find mercy with him: which
worke of examinatiō hardly one of a
thousād knoweth how to performe in
any good measure, as may bring true
cōfort vnto their soules. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, how many of our simple se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
brethrē, haue bin drawn to a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of our religiō &amp; a liking of popery,
by this especially, because ours, (as they



<pb facs="7"/>
say) is a religion of carnall libertye,
theirs of holinesse, ours full of diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and vncertainty, theirs of perfect
vnity, that they also may see hereby,
that ours is indeede a religion of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
holinesse and vnity prescribed by
the Lord himselfe, whereunto so many
of vs as are truely called to the sound
profession of it, do striue instantly to
attaine day and night: so worshipping
the God of our fathers, in spirit and
trneth: walking in the selfe same nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
way of eternall life. And that all
their imagined holinesse is nothing for
the most part, but meere superstitiō, in
outward shewes, of mens inuentions,
concerning which, GOD will aske
them one day,<note place="margin">Esa. 1. 12.</note> who hath required thē
at their hands,<note place="margin">Deu. 4. 2. &amp; 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>. 32.</note> altogether neglecting
most of the duetyes of true piety, as
those of the first table: that so they
perceiuing how they haue beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deluded,<note place="margin">Act. 13. 48</note>
(may at least some of them
whom God hath ordayned vnto life)
come out off the snare of the deuill,<note place="margin">2. Tim. <add>2.</add> 25. 26.</note>
      <pb facs="7"/>
and ioyne themselues to vs againe:<note place="margin">Ap. 14. 9. 10. 11.</note> so
to escape that torment which all that
receiue the marke of the beast, by any
such submission to that Romane An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
must eudure for euermore.
Pardon mee therefor, that I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to offer this vnto thee, seeing
that how plaine so euer it is, yet it may
proue profitable (as I hope) to manye
thousand poore soules, who want lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
or ability to search greater vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes,
being so briefe and easie for all:
and also that it may be to mee as the
widowes mite, throwne into the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Lord, If thou be one who
by reason of thy ripenesse and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,
despisest it, as hauing no neede of
any such a helpe, yet haue compassion
of thy brethren: neither knowest thou
what a day may bring forth: or if thou
seest the good that may come to very
many by such a course, helpe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that which is here thus begun, or
at least, if God shall perswade thee, of
the benefit which thy selfe may reape



<pb facs="8"/>
hereby spend one houre with mee
constantly euery weeke, in trying thy
wayes, and turning thy feeete vnto the
testimonies of the Lord. And then, as
I cannot doubt of thy prayers for me,
so I assure my selfe that the chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and blessing shal turne into thine
owne bosome; thy Lord and Sauiour
shall bee glorified by thee, the godly
edified by thy holy ensample, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
conuerted, or at the least
haue their mouthes stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and be left more
without excuse.</p>
