   <head>An afterwritte to the gentle Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y purpose was (right gentle Reader) in this short discourse before going, by strong and sounde proues to make this point of doctrine appeare most clearely, the which of the moste hath neuer bin so much as once thought vpon, and whereof a greate number, very sensible men otherwise, haue hitherto bin of this perswasion, that the word of God, speaketh not at all, namely of this duty of the parentes in making choise for theyr childrens mariage, or of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the which the sonnes and daughters in this respect do owe, vnto the godly choise of their fathers and mothers in this so holy an action.</p>
   <p>How I haue performed the same, I leaue vnto the iudgement of the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, vpon the considerations of the reasons and authorities by me alleaged, in the which my chiefe end and drift was, to satisfie the godly and wel disposed Christians, the which will make some care of conscience to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that hereafter, the which hitherto of ignorance and want of instruction, they haue
<pb n="96" facs="53"/>neglected and omitted. For when as parents shall hencefoorth plainelie see,<note place="margin">Parentes.</note> that God himselfe layeth vpon them this necessarie duetie of bestowing their children honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and godlie in wedlocke: and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren euidentlie nowe perceiue that they ought to stand vnto the godlie choise of their parentes, those in whose heartes the feare of God is not vtterlie quenched, will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward indeuour themselues to yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto their superiours in this most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie and waightie dutie,<note place="margin">Children.</note> with all willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse being contented to bee ruled, and not to seeke rule, nor to intrude and thrust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into the right and libertie of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, vpon whom the Lord in his wisdome hath laide his charge, so that without their priuitie and consent, they will not intangle themselues in mariage, nor seeke vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues matches, such as may bee griefes and eie-fores vnto their louing Parentes, vnto whome in the Lorde they worthelie owe all obedience and dutifull subiection. I speake here of the godlie and better sort both of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes and also children, who beeing of the people and Church of God, will be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and ruled by the lawes and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the which hee himselfe hath set downe for the direction and gouernment of the same in all other their waies and actions. As for the wicked and vngodlie, which rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouslie thinke in their hearts and sometimes
<pb n="97" facs="54"/>blasphemouslie vtter with their mouthes: <hi>Let vs breake his bandes and cast his cordes from vs.</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Psal. 2.4.</note> will not suffer God to raign ouer them after such manner as he hath appointed in his word, I make small account or reckoning of their either liking or disliking of this my sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple labour, but refer them ouer vnto him that dwelleth in heauen, &amp; laugheth at them and shall haue them in derision. But vnto all you that either be in trueth Christians, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise would so be taken and accounted, know you that this custome of the parentes placing and bestowing their children in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, is as hath bene shewed, most ancient, and commēdable, yea and approoued by our Lord and Sauiour Christ himselfe also in the xx of Luke,<note place="margin">Luk, 20.11.</note> where, going about to confute the errour of the Saduces, the which, if there were a resurrection (which they denie) did suppose that there must be also mariage, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth it to haue bene the ordinarie pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the men of those times to giue their children to be maried: saieng, <hi>The children of this world mary wiues, and are giuen or bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in mariage,</hi>

      </gap>, which in that place hee vseth, most properlie in the iudgment of the learned sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie. And by the men of this world, as well the wicked as the godly, least that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise wee might thinke that mariage dooth not appertaine vnto the children of God if we should here take children of this world
<pb n="98" facs="54"/>as opposite and sette against the children of light, or of God, as I confesse it must some times bee taken, which in this place cannot be leaste it might seeme to giue some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce vnto the error before recited. So that hereby clearely appeareth, that in the dayes of Christ 1589, yeares sithens and more, this was an order generally obserued, for the parentes in mariage to place and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe their children, the which also Beza,<note place="margin">Beza saith that this place most strongly proueth the power &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing their children in mariage.</note> and Feguernekinus, who hath profitably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged Marlorat his common places, doth note vpon this place. Let not Christians therfore dislike of that, which Christ himselfe, after whom they are named, seemeth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. But let them rather, knowing what God looketh for at their handes, in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son prouide wiues for their sonnes, and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes for their daughters, least by forslow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time too long, they bee either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by their childrens to rash contracting themselues, or otherwise to their greater sorrowe, see them runne into more greater folly, as it often commeth to passe, when as the sonnes and daughters, think that their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers haue no care of them in this behalfe, yea in this busines let them carrie so gentle an hand towarde their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they themselues feeling best their owne estate, when as they be come vnto years and discretion conuenient, may, if their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly modesty will suffer them deale with their
<pb n="99" facs="55"/>parentes concerning this matter in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and reuerend manner by themselues, or otherwise by the godly intercession of their friendes, who at their motion may put their parentes in minde, in time conuenient to haue care of these cases, by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, many inconueniences and disorders shal bee met with ill before hand, the which for want of this Christiā foresight on both sides, do too vsually fall out, to the dishonour of God, and offence of his Church The end of all is, that both the parentes and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, vnderstanding what God looketh for on both their partes in this busines, set aside all caueling and cunning gloses to shake of this dutie. For I will not trouble my selfe wyth aunswering these many and vaine obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on this behalfe, vsuall to bee alleaged on both sides, but refer them ouer vnto the thorow shifting of their seuerall conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in these actions, according vnto that, the which by this treatise, they shall learne to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto their seuerall duties, that they may in sincerity and truth effect the same, being desirous, as purposedly to offend none, so gladly in this point to satiffie al, the which if it be not alreādy performed accordingly, so far as the question taken in hand, to proue requireth, I will endeuour, as I shall heareaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by any the godly be aduertised, and labour (God willing) more fully and largely (so far as in me lieth) to set downe, to the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
<pb n="100" facs="55"/>of all such as are not purposedlye resolued and determined, in this cause to cauill, thwartle, and dissemble, hoping that the godly shall profite, to the perfourming of a necessary dutie, yet of a great parte left vnperfourmed, and the wicked bee made vnexcuseles, when the accounts must be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, before that iudge, which sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore in this duty, or any other, the which the warrant of God his word may iustifie, howsoeuer the same in any respect may seeme strange vnto vs, let it bee our continuall and most earnest praier, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire God to subdue our corrupt and carnall affections vnto his most holie will, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie pleasure, so far foorth as we shall haue his word the infallible lode-stone to direct and guide vs vnto the same, for Christ his sake.
