      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>OVRTEOVS and friendly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I haue laid heere before thine eie at one view (as it were) the steps of that most deepe counsell and wisedome diuine, as farre as it hath reuealed it selfe touching the eternall estate of all men. Wonderfull is the wisdome of of God in all his waies and workes,
<pb facs="3"/> which hee hath purposed in great wisdome, made in great wisedome, and in great wisdome disposeth of euen to most excellent ends, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the weak eie of our poore and dimme vnderstanding cannot reach them. But as man is one of his noblest creatures, in framing <note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>. 139. 6. 7. Psal. 8. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.</note> and ordering of whom his name is become excellent and wonderful: so most maruellous is that wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which was expressed in the counsell of God, concerning the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ending conditiom of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Truth it is, when high matters are once laid open to vs, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a little to see into them; then as it fareth in a riddle, when it it is vnfolded, wee despise it, and wonder at our selues that wee were
<pb facs="3"/> so blockish as we could not perceiue it without an interpretor. And as the glorious sunne, which wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly look vpon, growes despiseable and meane by little and little, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row often looking vpon it: So di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine mysteries being familiarly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and made easie to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, they are of fooles lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced and esteemed then before. But the godly which know the worth of the knowledge of that truth which is according to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, after it is once cleerely known &amp; wel considered, they do the more admire it; &amp; are stirred vp to praise God the more heartily for their light giuen them that way, by whomsoeuer it be, and how little soeuer it be which is added to their
<pb facs="4"/> former vnderstanding. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the vse of any thing, when it is both good and manifold, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no small estimation to the thing it selfe; I haue thought good to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise thee of the vse and benefit which is to bee made of this short draught of the degrees of Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose touching mankind, and of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
      <note place="margin">It also helps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the late error of some, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the tvvo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of corruptiō and grace, vvould haue men iustified in order of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they beleeue, vvhiles they be in the old mā: which crosseth Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, as vvill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by looking vpon the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> execution of that part of it which concerneth the elect, for it is no meere speculatiue thing, but tendeth to practice.</p>
   <p>It helpeth thee against that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour which laieth the purpose of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or condemning vpon foreseene good or euill: whereas the doing of good or euill is rather a consequent of Gods purpose then any prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cause or motiue thereof,
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
   <p>Secondly, hauing heere before thine eie the two certaine vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ends, that al men must come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, eternall life, or eternall death: and the meanes by which it is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed they shall bee brought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; thou maiest iudge of thy selfe by the purposed meanes, to which of the purposed ends thou art sure to come to.</p>
   <p>When thou seest in thy selfe or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> others any of these purposes effected or considerest of the execution of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the purpose of God; then call to mind the constancy of Gods purpose, and collect, that as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly shall those other parts of his counsell, which yet are not, bee in their time accomplished: as when
<pb facs="5"/> thou thinkest of the purpose of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or of mans fall, or of calling by the Gospell performed, bee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that the purpose of resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, of generall iudgement shall holde firme. And when thou findest the purpose of effectuall calling, of faith, of sanctification, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance now already done in thy selfe; thou maiest be perswaded that the purpose touching this perseuerance to the end, and of thy blessednesse in the end shall stand as a mountaine of brasse vnmoueable.</p>
   <p>This short Summe will much help <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> thee in the vnderstanding of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and of good bookes; thou shalt see (being one whose eies God hath opened) vnto what heads all is to be referred, which is spoken, or which
<pb facs="5"/> thou readest touching the worke of mans saluation. It will serue also as a touchstone to try teaching and teachers, both for matter and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, in handling it.</p>
   <p>Also, perceiuing that the whole course of thy saluation and euery particular in it, doth depend vpon Gods purpose as the soueraigne cause, yea that the very mediation and merit of Christ, was no motiue to leade God to choose thee to life, but that the purpose of a Sauiour was subordinate to the purpose of <note place="margin">God so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the world that he gaue his sonne. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.</note> election, thou maiest bee stirred vp to thanke God and to praise his free grace euen for Christ himselfe, as well as for all other things which thou enioiest that be good. <hi>Colos. 112. Giuing thanks vnto, &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="6"/>
   <p>It will humble thee much, and make thee awefull of God to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well, that thou holdest thy selfe, and whatsoeuer else is in thee, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thee, without any respect at all of ought in thy selfe to mooue God to do so &amp; so to thee, all being from his free purpose. <hi>Phil. 1. Worke out your saluation in feare and trembling: for it is God that worketh both will and deed, and that according to his good pleasure.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It may prouoke thee greatly to admire Gods loue towards thee, and to loue him so much the more, to thinke that a thousand others being no worse then thou by fall, and as good as thy selfe by creation, yet God passed by them, and had a
<pb facs="6"/> purpose to saue thee, <hi>1. Thess 1. 3. 4.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In all things which fall out in the Church strangely for the ruine and decay of any particular Church in doctrine and religion, or for the remouing the word from them, or for the fall of any member in the Crurch, it will stay thee in patience a while to ponder that Gods wise and iust counsell determined it; thou hast done it Lord, euen so, because it so was thy will and purpose. And so in all things else that happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wontedly, it will moue all men with silence to thinke of it, or with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and reuerence to Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell to speake of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>Acts. 11.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Seeing the time of effecting Gods purpose toward the elect for their calling to Christ and to saluation
<pb facs="7"/> by him it is vncertaine, sometime deferred euen till the end of a mans life; therefore if any reade this short Summe who doth not finde himselfe by any worke of Gods sauing grace within the compasse of the purpose of election, let him not cast away his hope, but hauing an outward calling according to Gods counsell offorded, let him make account that the purpose of election hath offered and afforded it to him; and casting off security &amp; presumption, let him waite vpon Gods mercy for that which remaineth in the diligent &amp; cōstant vse of al good means priuate &amp; puplik, and careful practise of al good duties, and abstinence from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill works, as farre as lies in him.</p>
   <p>Now suffer mee to giue thee
<pb facs="7"/> a few aduertisments concerning the subiect matter of this short Summe and draught of Gods decree.</p>
   <p>Though Gods purpose were of euery thing that is, or happeneth; &amp; is not nor shall euer happen: yet I meddle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> with his purpose so far as cōcerneth onely as concerneth men, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in so far only their eternall estate.</p>
   <p>Secondly, my meaning was to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> lead thee into Gods Counsell-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, no further then leaue and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence by his word is giuen vs. For <note place="margin">Thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to vs and our children. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. <hi>vers. last.</hi>
      </note> those things which I set downe are reuealed and doe therefore belong to vs. For the things are not to be held secret which God hath once manifested either by his word, or by euents.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, I deale no further here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
      <pb facs="8"/> then as may and doth stand with rules of the word, and serue for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, aiming after nothing but thy profit, not to satisfie any mans curiosity, nor to minister matter of debate and dispute.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, vnderstand that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
      <note place="margin">He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinats in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 4. 5 Because it so pleased thee ô fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 3 Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, that hee doth, in heauen &amp; in earth.</note> Gods purpose hath no other cause, but Gods wil, and that therefore as it is eternall &amp; vnchangeable euen as God is: so it is most free, most holy, most wise, most good, without all exception, howsoeuer it seemeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to corrupt men.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, I haue exprest the execution of Gods purpose so farre as it concerneth the Elect onely. Noting summarily, all such works of grace as they are brought tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row according to Gods counsell, and
<pb facs="8"/> doe omit to doe the like touching the reprobate: because my meaning was to giue light to the godly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their owne estate and the wonderous mercifull dealing of God with them, and yet in laying out the proceeding of Gods purpose to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward such as be not chosen (there is so much discouered (if it be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) as will let a man see how neere vnto, or farre off hee is from that heauy lot and condition.</p>
   <p>In all counsel humane &amp; diuine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
      <note place="margin">The end is first in the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, last in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the end is thought on before the meanes, and of the meanes one is afore an other in order of causes, and for execution of them in order of time too.</p>
   <p>Seeing God worketh all things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
      <note place="margin">Nothing done of God in</note> after the counsell of his will, <hi>Ephe.</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/> 1. 11. it followeth necessarily that what is wrought by his hand in time, was purposed in his counsell before all time.</p>
   <p>Finally, if either I haue omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ignorance or forgetfulnesse, any degree or steppe of Gods purpose or haue not giuen them their due place (wherein yet I trust I haue not failed, I am sure my care was not to faile) pardon such ouersight, and helpe thy selfe with the benefit of that knowledge which thou hast: and take occasion by this rude draught, to performe something this way more absolutely, if thou be able so to doe: for it is easie to adde to things already deuised; more easie to espie the blemishes of a worke, then to frame the like worke:
<pb facs="9"/> most easie of all to finde fault with that which is otherwise then well done. Conferre and vse thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to correct and not to carpe, not to detract, but to amend.</p>
