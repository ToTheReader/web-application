   <head>TO THE NOBLE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>. Cornelius</hi> Tribune of <hi>Rome,</hi> during the Consulship of <hi>L. Aurelius Cotta,</hi> and of <hi>L. Manlius Torquatus:</hi> perceauing the <hi>Praetors</hi> to bee too partiall in iudging of the Nobles, enacted a Law that euery <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> in demitting of his office should render a publicke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt vnto the people how hee had discharged his dutie. After whose example, resoluing with my selfe to giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the <hi>Tutorship</hi> of young Nobles, to saie with our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,—. <hi>steriles{que} valete Camaenae,</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I haue penned this <hi>Institution</hi> to witnesse vnto their Parents my answerable proceeding, and to leaue it vnto my <hi>Pupils</hi> in particular, for a token of affectiō at my far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, to be an vnpartial Counceller, and a faithful Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher of them in al their offēces in my absence: perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my selfe that none of thē wil grudge that you all haue the communication of this their priuate right; seeing it is only the more knowne to be theirs, and the benefit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the lesse. Herein so farre as it is possible for me, I haue essaied espetiallie to imitate our <hi>Soveraigne</hi> and <hi>Roiall Doctor,</hi> who seeketh not after those extrauagāt formes of doctrine vsed by <hi>Plato</hi> in his Commō-wealth, by <hi>Xenophon</hi> in the <hi>Institutiō</hi> of young <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> in forming <hi>his Orator,</hi> by <hi>Horace</hi> in making his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,</hi> or by <hi>S<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Thomas Moore</hi> in describing his <hi>Vtopian,</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/> (which are all faire shaddowes in the aire) but plainlie out of his owne common practise, and vsual experience hath proposed a <hi>Princely Pupil</hi> for a perfect patterne to all your imitation; whose example I wish you rather to followe by practise, then my precepts by contemplation.</p>
   <p>As for my selfe I permit those men, amongst whome I shal liue, to point mee out to my owne rules, and vpbraid me in my aberration and straying ther-from, as respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more (with Aristotle what maie be done, then what should be done.) Yet I leaue this <hi>Institutiō</hi> vnto you young Nobles, <hi>non quòd acipenser iste paucorum sit hominū,</hi> or that I would debarre others, whom it shal please you to invite, as <hi>Pontius</hi> did <hi>Scipio</hi> in the Town of <hi>Laurentū:</hi> But permitting euerie mā to feed, where it best pleaseth him, like <hi>Lucullus</hi> his flocke, <hi>nec suam inuidens Cyprio bovi merendam,</hi> (as <hi>Ennius</hi> saith in his <hi>Sotadicke)</hi> I desire only those, who cannot make that vse and profite, which I wish, to blame rather their owne fortune, then me, and to endeauour themselues to come as neare you, as their abilitie wil giue them leaue.</p>
   <p>VVhich I adde, not that I thinke my advises so abso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lutely perfect, that they are worthy to bee obserued of all Schollers: for I protest, not after a common ceremonie of submission, but out of a true and essentiall feeling of my owne imbecilitie, that I am so farre from pleasing of my selfe, that as many times as I looke thē over, so often am I vexed at them,
<q>
         <l>—et scripsisse pudet, quia plurima cerno</l>
         <l>Me quo{que} qui feci iudice, digna lini.</l>
      </q> Neither do I propose them otherwise then those Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who in Schooles publish doubtfull, and Sophisticall
<pb facs="4"/> Questions to be disputed and canvased, not to establish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doubt, but to finde it out. As well the penning of thē was my last Lents labour, so that as <hi>Philocrates</hi> sported with <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> you may not marvaile <hi>Athenians</hi> that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> &amp; I doe differ, for he drinketh wine, and I drinke water:
<q>Non equidem hoc studeo, bullaris vt mihi nugis Pagina turgescat.</q> And that I studie not for fine Rhetoricall termes,
<q>
         <l>—veluti pueris absynthia taetra medentes</l>
         <l>Cùm dare conantur, priùs oras pocula circum</l>
         <l>Contingunt mellis dulci, flavo{que} liquore;</l>
         <l>Vt puerorum aetas improvida ludificetur.</l>
      </q> The condemnation of them (with reason) wil bee no lesse acceptable and profitable vnto me; then their approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deeming it ever absurd whatsoever I haue set down, either ignorantly, or vnadvisedly. For I acknowledge my selfe too meanely instructed, that I should take vpon mee to teach others anie lōger, either by word, or writ. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Poet <hi>Philetas</hi> being so little and light, that the winde threw him over, was wont to vnderprop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with leaden shooes; &amp; as the <hi>Sea-Vrchin</hi> armeth it selfe with little stons against a tēpest: so haue I covered my selfe (like another <hi>Teucer</hi>) vnder the buckler of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Authors to shoote my darts against Ignorance: <hi>&amp; vt</hi>
      <q>
         <l>Fertur <hi>Prometheus</hi> addere principi</l>
         <l>Limo coactus, particulam vndi{que}</l>
         <l>Desectam, &amp; insani 'leonis</l>
         <l>Vim stomacho apposuisse nostro.</l>
      </q> If I dissēble &amp; hide of tētimes their names in vsing their reasons and comparisons, knowe (younge Noble Reader)
<pb facs="5"/> that I wish you to imitate the Poet, of whom <hi>Plautus</hi> saith<q>
         <l>—Tabulas cùm cepit sibi,</l>
         <l>Quaerit quod nusquam est gentium, reperit tamen.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Also that I doe it to bridle the temeritie of those <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles</hi> and <hi>Aristarches,</hi> who cast only their basiliske eyes to carpe other mens honest endeavors, that they maie beat a <hi>Seneca,</hi> or a <hi>Plutarch</hi> vnawares, when they thinke they haue bitten me with their viperous tongue.</p>
   <p>Happie I beyonde my merit, if I get onlie this por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of publike approbation, as I maie cause honest men of sound iudgment and vnderstanding to thinke, that I would make vse and benefit of my learning, if I were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with anie! As for those <hi>Zoiles;</hi> &amp; <hi>Criticks,</hi> who by nature or custome think to honour thēselues in disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, and like Spiders suck venome, where bees ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honie; taking althings with the left hand, which are offered with the right, as <hi>Ariston</hi> said, I am prouided with counter-poison, in not regarding what they say.</p>
   <p>Therfore let them examin these my advises and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, letter by letter, measure euery syllable, waigh the words, controule the points, censure the periods, and condemne the whole booke, so much as they please, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther Apologie I request them only to serue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with the darknes of my ignorance, to shaddowe &amp; set forth the liuely colours of their good wits. So doubtles you young Nobles
<q>
         <l>—quibus arte benignâ</l>
         <l>Et meliore luto finxit praecordia Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>an,</l>
      </q> wil shew your selues thankful towards them, for their rare inuention, as in the meane time I hope you wil wel accept of my good intention, knowing
<q>—In magnis voluisse sat est.</q>
