      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, I present to thy view in this Sermon, two maine Subiects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Gospell; the one depending betwixt vs and the Papists,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16. Titus 1.2.</note> touching the Text of the Gospell, which was written by the Pen-men of the holy Ghost, and giuen them by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of God, in which there can bee no error or lye: and the Exposition and glosse thereof, by men of mediate and secondary calling, in which there may be error.<note place="margin">Baron. Tom. <hi>1.</hi> annal <hi>25.</hi>
      </note> Our aduersaries hold and mainetaine, that the Popes defining and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Scriptures, <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> is to bee beleeued as vndoubted truth, and held for the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rule and ground of faith;<note place="margin">Bozius de sig. ecclesiae pag. <hi>133</hi>
      </note> paralleling their traditions with the text of the Gospell, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that their Church cannot erre in matters of faith: this is the fountaine of many superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous errors amongst them. The other touching the dignity and necessity of preaching the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, with that maintenance which God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed in his word to his Ministers and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers thereof, which are tythes and offerings.
<pb facs="4"/> Which truth hath bin much opposed in this age, by many prophane Atheists on the one side, and schismaticall spirits on the other side; which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a colour of zeale, would, if they could, deuour Gods house and his Ministers. The Apostle saith, God hath ordained,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.14.</note> that they which preach the Gospell, should liue of the Gospell. If God hath ordained it, first, it is Gods ordinance, and not mans: Secondly, if Gods ordinance, then no other ordinance then that which hee hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Word, which is tythes and offerings, without any mention of mans pretended compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.<note place="margin">1. Cor. Ibid. Mat. 23.23. Heb. 7.8.</note> Thirdly, if Gods ordinance as a morall duty, and in the time of the Gospell, then not to be abrogated. Hath God called you to saluation by our Gospell, here in my text, and to obtaine the glory of our Lord Iesus Christ by the preaching thereof? And shall not we obtaine at your hands those temporall things which are not yours, but Gods &amp; ours, &amp; that not of almes, begging Frier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, but of right belonging vnto vs? Will Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be worse then the Pharisis in the performance of this duty? How then doth our righteousnes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the righteousnes of the Scribes &amp; Pharisies? <hi>Quomodo abundat iustitia nostra plus quàm scribarum &amp; Pharisaeorum,</hi>

         </gap>, moneo igitur vt reddatis mihi mea, er ego restituam vobis vestra.</hi> Because ye haue not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me my tythes and first fruites, ye are cursed with penury and famine: because that whilest ye with held small things from mee, yee lost the whole abundance of the fruites of your possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Know yee then, that therefore ye haue lost abundance, because ye haue defrauded me of my part. Therefore I warne you that you restore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me those things that are mine, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store those things that are yours. And these words, <hi>The tenth is mine,</hi> saith the Lord,<note place="margin">Leuit. 27.30.</note> is a morall position, not abrogated with other ceremonies of the Law, but is still in force: for as long as <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedecks,</hi> that is, Christs Priesthood, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, which is for euer, <hi>vs{que} ad huius seculi consummationem,</hi> to the end of the world so long doth the maintenance belong vnto the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>

<pb facs="5"/> both by authority of Scriptures,<note place="margin">Math. 23.24.</note> Fathers, and Councels: Wherein we may see the payment of tythes to be due to Gods Ministers, <hi>de iure,</hi> of right; although by reason of the corruption of times, they were not in some ages paid, <hi>de facto,</hi> in deede as they ought to be. And this is the very point, if there were a thousand volumes written on this subiect. What I haue said briefly hereon, I returne it to Gods glory, not seeking mine owne praise; and leaue it to the Churches good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, not doubting, but amongst a multitude of gaine-saiers, some there will bee with wisedome and a good conscience, to consider &amp; practise this truth. And let all men take heede, which goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to defraud God and his Ministers of their right: That that heauy cursse of God fall not on them and their children, which is spoken of by the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mal. 3.</note> To be curssed with a cursse for despoyling the Lord and his Ministers by this sacriledge. And on the contrary, let all such (as by fearing God yeelde this obedience vnto him) to their comforts likewise heere learne:<note place="margin">
