   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough Geometrie for the certayntie thereof haue suche a priuiledge as fewe other Sciences, béeing so fortified with Demonstration that no Precepte or Rule thereof for the veritie can be reproued, yet least some, either of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce or malice shoulde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it vnprofitable, not ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to any necessarie vse in a publike Weale, I thought good somewhat to say thereof, and firste the sentence of <hi>Plato</hi> written at the entrie into his Schole commeth to my remembraunce, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. therby excluding al such as were ignoraunt of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie as vnable or vnméete to attayn higher secrets or misteries of Philosophie. <hi>Aristotle</hi> also intreating of Morall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, in the fifth Booke of his <hi>Ethikes,</hi> with geometricall Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures most beautifully paynteth out Iustice, discerning and seuerally comparing sundrie partes thereof with Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Arithmeticall proportions. But his Interpreters, whose works are yet extante, for want of skill in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, haue so blemished, darkned and defaced his meaning, that scarcely any resemblance thereof shall to the Reader appeare.
<pb facs="4"/>
In sundrie other his works also of naturall Philosophie, as the <hi>Physikes, Meteores, de Coelo &amp; Mundo. &amp;c.</hi> ye shal finde sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> that without <hi>Geometrie</hi> may not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be vnderstanded. And to leue Philosophie, how necessarie it is to attayne exacte knowledge in <hi>Astronomie, Musike, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiue, Cosmographie</hi> and <hi>Nauigation,</hi> with many other Sciences and faculties, who so meanely trauayleth therein shall soone finde. But to omitte talking of <hi>Geometrie</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and to speake priuately of this Treatize, I thinke good first to open the order and effect thereof, and then somewhat to saye of the applyances. Like as euery body geometricall is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed with <hi>Superficies,</hi> and euery <hi>Superficies</hi> inclosed with lines, so that it consisteth of these thrée, <hi>Longitude, Latitude,</hi> and <hi>Profunditie,</hi> and without consideration of these thrée no solide may be measured: so is this Treatise also diuided into thrée Bookes. The first entreating of lines sheweth sundry meanes to measure all maner lengthes, heightes, distances, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundities. The seconde termed <hi>Planimetra</hi> settes foorth diuerse meanes and rules to measure manyfolde superficies, playne Conuex and Concaue, whether they be compounde with straighte or circulare lines, or mixte of bothe. In the thirde na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Stereometria,</hi> is sette out the exacte mensuration of sundry solides, replenished with a number of rules and preceptes, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of <hi>Euclide, Archimedes</hi> and <hi>Appolonius Pergeus</hi> his <hi>Conykes,</hi> wherein the Reader shall not a little delighte him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the finenesse and subtiltie of their inuentions, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he indeuor himselfe to search out the reason, cause and demonstration of them. And nowe somewhat to speake of the commoditie of these conclusions, as the skilfull in Architecture can applye the <hi>Stereometria</hi> to serue his turne in preordinance and forecasting both of the charges, quantities and proportion of all parcels necessarily appertayning to any kinde of buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: so <hi>Planimetra</hi> maye serue for disposing all manner grounde plattes of Cities, Townes, Fortes, Castles, Pallaces
<pb facs="5"/>
or other edifices. The Marshall of the fielde shall also moste spéedely thereby appoynt place conuenient for his Campe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing euery parte thereof according to the number of his men, horse, cariage. &amp;c. Also in suruaying, parting and diuiding of Lands and woods, it is most requisite aswell for exact as spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye dispatch therin, and therof we haue notable recorde in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories how much this science auayled the Egiptians when as by the inundation of <hi>Nylus</hi> their whole countrey was so drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that with slime of the water all their Bounds and marks were defaced: Yet certayne wise men ayded with knowledge in this science, founde out and distributed to euery man his owne. The other parte named <hi>Longimetra</hi> the ingeniouse practizioner wil apply to <hi>Topographie,</hi> fortification, conducting of mines vnder the earth, and shooting of greate ordinance. So that as there is no kinde of man, of what vocation or degrée so euer he be, but shall finde matter both to exercise his witte and diuersly to pleasure him selfe, so surely for a gentleman especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that professech the warres, aswell for discoueries made by sea, as fortification, placing of Campes, &amp; conducting of Armies on the lande, how necessarie it is to be able exactly to describe the true plattes, symetrie and porportion of Fortes, campes, townes and countryes, coastes &amp; harboroughes, I thinke there are none so vnskilfull, but will confesse these Geometricall mensurations most requisite. But if any there be so rude, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunte and vnlearned, or so much blinded with selfe liking, that can not be content to acknowledge any thing requisite in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite souldier that is wanting in them selues (for suche surely they are that moste arrogantly will maintayne this fonde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) let them but regard and marke the renoumed Captaine <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who had this knowledge in such high esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that he seldome or neuer in his manifoulde conquests wold attempt any thing, whether it wer fort, toune or coūtrey, but first he would haue the exacte <hi>Topographie</hi> therof, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<pb facs="5"/>
inuente, deuise and after execute his warlyke Polycies. On the contrarie side, for negligence of this knowledge we may reade how <hi>Aniball</hi> the most worthie and famouse Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that euer hath béen (all circumstances duely wayed) was by that paynefull, graue and right valiaunt Captayne <hi>Quintus Fabius Maximus</hi> ledde and trayned into a fielde inclosed with stepe hilles and déepe riuers, where this noble Consull had so inuironed his Hoste by fortifying of two mountaynes, that he with all his Armie were in maruaylouse ieopardie to haue pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished for famine, had not the craftie witte of <hi>Aniball</hi> inuented a present pollicie to escape suche imminente calamitie. <hi>Cyrus</hi> also that greate Kinge and mightie Monarche, was he not through ignoraunce of <hi>Topographie,</hi> euen in pursuing of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie intrapped and discomfited with al his power by the <hi>Scithian</hi> quéene <hi>Thomiris</hi> at the riuer of <hi>Oaxis?</hi> I passe ouer innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable examples of all ages, manyfestly declaring the greate aduauntage or disaduauntage a Captayne may receyue, aswell inuading as defending by the strong or weake situation of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by the foreknowledge or ignoraunce of them: neither is there any liberall or frée minde, whether he be of profession Warlike or Ciuile, that will not take great delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to sée how by Arte a man may measure the distances of places remote and farre a sunder, approching nighe none of them, and that aswell, yea and farre more exactly than if with Corde or pole he should paynfully passe them ouer. Herevpon did the Poetes fayne <hi>Atlas</hi> of suche huge and mightie perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, sustayning and vpholding the earth and mightie Masse of heauenly spheres, for that this man notwithstanding he were imprisoned in a mortall carkasse, and thereby detayned in this moste inferior and vilest portion of the vniuersall world, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest distante from that passing pleasant and beautifull frame of celestiall Orbes, yet his diuine minde ayded with this sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Geometricall mensurations, founde out the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, distances, courses, and straunge intricate miraculouse
<pb facs="6"/>
motions of these resplendent heauenly Globes of Sunne, Moone, Planets and Starres fixed, leauing the rules and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes thereof to his posteritie. <hi>Archimedes</hi> also (as some sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) with a glasse framed by reuolution of a section Parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, fired the Romane nauie in the sea comming to the siege of <hi>Syracusa.</hi> But to leaue these celestiall causes and things doone of antiquitie long ago, my father by his continual payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full practises, assisted with demonstrations <hi>Mathematicall,</hi> was able, and sundrie times hath by proportional Glasses duely situate in conuenient angles, not onely discouered things farre off, read letters, numbred péeces of money with the very coyne and superscription thereof, cast by some of his freends of purpose vppon Downes in open fieldes, but also seuen myles of declared what hath béen doon at that instante in priuate pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: He hath also sundrie times by the Sunne beames fired Powder, and dischargde Ordinaunce halfe a myle and more distante, whiche things I am the boulder to reporte, for that there are yet liuing diuerse (of these his dooings) <hi>Oculati testes,</hi> and many other matters farre more straunge and rare which I omitte as impertinente to this place. But for inuention of these conclusions, I haue hearde him say, nothing euer helped him so muche as the exquisite knowledge he had by continuall practise attained in Geometrical mensuratiōs. And for science in great Ordinance especially to shoote exactly at Randons (a qualitie not vnméete for a Gentleman) without rules Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical, and perfect skill in these mensurations, he shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer know any thing: thus haue I partely declared the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and commoditie that any well disposed minde may reape by these thrée bookes of my fathers. But somewhat to say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the last Treatize of the fiue regulare bodies and their <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> adioyned by my selfe, for that I knowe some, yea many shall there be that will not spare to say, as they haue done by others, it is a fonde toy, a meare curiouse trifle, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to no vse or commoditie: surely I meane not greatly to
<pb facs="6"/>
labour to attayne the good opinion of suche▪ hauing learned howe the disprayse of the ignoraunt and vitiouse is no lesse cōmendation than the prayse of the wise and vertuouse, béeing a precedent infallible from the beginning and alway conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing that ignoraunce enuieth knowledge, and vice vertue. Euery mā disliketh or extolleth things accordingly as they are agreable or repugnant to his appetite, and rather would I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning the company of <hi>Euclide, Archimedes, Appollonius Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geus,</hi> and other geometers writing of the like toyes &amp; curiosities be condemned, than in publishing matter agreable to suche mens phantasie and conceypt, be of them highly commended, and of the learned laught at or contemned, but howsoeuer <hi>Epicurus, Midas,</hi> or their like, giuen onely to lucre and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye pleasure liste to thinke thereof, I nothing mistruste of suche as couet the vnderstanding of matters harde and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, desiring the knowledge of things somewhat passing the reache and capacitie of the common sorte, wherein onely the nature of man surmounteth beastly kinde, or by proofe and assay in cases of like difficultie able to iudge them selues, this Treatize shall not be mislyked but thankfully receyued, and for the reste perswasions are but vayne, for as no words can adde stomacke or make the cowarde valiaunt, so surely suche two footed Moules and Todes whom destinie and nature hath ordayned to craule within the earth, and suck vpon the muck, maye not possibly by any vehement exhortation be reduced or moued to taste or sauour any whitte of vertue, science, or any suche celestiall influence, my hope is if any fault escape, as in suche long and intricate tediouse calculations of irrationall numbers maye happen to be some, the discrete and modest Reader will rather of curtesie amende it, than with enuiouse cauillation, vngratefullye requite my paynefull trauayles, whereby I shall be prouoked not onely to publishe the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of these and many moe straunge and rare <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Theoremes,</hi> hytherto hidden and not knowen to the
<pb facs="7"/>
worlde, but also to imprinte sundry other volumes of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which he long sithence compiled in the Englishe tong, desiring rather with playne and profitable conclusions to store his natiue language and benefite his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men, than by publishing in the Latin rare and curiouse demonstrations, to purchase fame among straungers.</p>
