      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this newe and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous raign of mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cifull Mary our newe and mooste lawefull Quene &amp; gouernesse, wherin we see so many good olde orders newely restored, and so many new erronious nouelties an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated and made olde, I haue had a vehement desire (dere brethren) to exhi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bite vnto you some newe gifte and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, therby to witnesse the great glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes newly engendred in my harte of so many newe occasions. And emongest all other giftes that myght commende the gyuer, and aduauntage the recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, I finde none either fitter for me to geue, or better for you to receiue, or more agreable for thys presente tyme, then if I should renewe some old trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and present you with some aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Iewel, the vse wherof might bothe increase knowledge in you to discerne
<pb facs="5"/>the worthye value of olde and aūcient Iewelles of late daies not regarded, and expell also from you blind &amp; grosse ignoraunce, to the vtter defacinge of suche newe fantasticall pelfrie &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaite trashe, as latelye haue been es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temed. I am muche deceiued, but I haue founde suche a Iewell for you, as for the findinge I myght haue prayse, and you pleasure in hauinge: for the gyuinge I might deserue commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; you receaue consolation in the vsinge of it. For what pleasure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ, what consolation canne be had without the trueth of his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye worde? There is one onely waye to Thriste, one onely meane to the trueth of his word. This way who euer hath trased, neuer missed Christe. Thys meane who euer hathe obserued was neuer seduced by falshode. This waie to Christ, this meane to trueth, is the gifte, whiche I purpose in this newe face of so newe and happye worlde to gyue you. It is a Iewell soo muche worth, as your soules health is worth. It is a treasure of so muche value and
<pb facs="5"/>efficacie, as wherwith God is pleased, and heauen wōne. It is a talet of such speciall propertie, as neither time can diminishe, nor violence deface, nor vse weare it. Thys waye to Christe, this meane to trueth, is by a generall name called, <hi>Ecclesia catholica,</hi> the catholyke Churche: whiche is our mother, &amp; we her children. Without this mother, as there is no waye to heauen where Christ is (<hi>Porta emm coeli est,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gene xxviii.</note> for she is the gate of heauen, wherby we must entre to Christe) so is there no trueth,<note place="margin">i.

<pb facs="6"/>together, so Christ, trueth, &amp; the church are inseparatly conioyned. For neither canne Christe be without trueth, nor trueth without the churche, with whom God the holy ghost doeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate al truth.

I haue ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen you this Iewell of a great zeale and affection: doe not you receaue it vnthankefully. How be it I grate not thankes for the geuinge, but onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the gifte. And howe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye it is to be accepted, howe necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to be had, you shall soner vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande by the vse therof, than I by words can expresse.

      <pb facs="8"/>ministerie of this holy <hi>Vincent</hi> shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie and cure, whilesthe shal eftsones settle you in the sure lappe of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the catholike churche, the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table leche of all infirmities, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary nourse of al weakelynges, the most surest hauen for all stormebeaten to ariue vnto. O dere brethren &amp; fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des it muche pitieth me, and I trust it nowe repeuteth you also, to consider how euyl you haue ben of late taught, howe vnnaturally you have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, synce ye lefte this good and louing mother: howe manye diseases and infirmities haue growen vpō you synce your departing frō this comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table leche: howe owgle &amp; carren leaue ye are to see, synce you chaunged this necessary nourse: with how great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous stormes you haue ben beaten, synce you first did loose frō this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hauen. Wo worth that false har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let that hathe deceaued you, I meane that malignaūt and cursed church. It is she, that by her flatteringe meanes and deceatefull allurementes hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
<pb facs="8"/>you to come from so swete &amp; ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mothers lappe, into her whorishe armes: frō church to church, I graūt, but not from like to like. Frō an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly church, to a malignaunt church, from a louinge mother to a flatteryng harlote. From the condition of grace, to the state of perdition. From the vni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of christians, to diuision of Nereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. Frō the light of pure knowledge, to the darkenes of foule ignoraunce.</p>
   <p>From the trueth of antiquitie, to the falshode of nouelties. From faythfull beleuyng, to carnall reasonyng. From sauing Christ, to deceyuing Antichrist. Thus they agree together, that in all thinges they be vtterlye vulike. The one is of God, and ledeth to Christ and trueth. Thother is of the deuyll, and leadeth to Antichrist and heresie. The one grounded in fay the subdueth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, thother ledde by reason confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth faith. The one beleueth reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye what reason can not comprehende, thother impudently alledgeth reason faith to reprehende. Betwene thē ther is no amitie, no semblaunce, no agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="9"/>no felow ship: but continual war one against another. Nowbeit for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as no vntrueth can deceaue, but by colour of trueth: no hereticall poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can beguyle, but when it is geuen in fourme of medicine, therefore thys whorish churche laboureth by al mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to resemble in vtter shewe and countenaunce thother good churche: the rather to seduce the improuident, when her falshode is cloked: the soner to catche the simple, when her hooke is couered. And this is the matter, why diuers haue been so greatlye deceaued of late, and diuers againe wilbe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if vpon this warning thei watch not, and by other menues harmes they beware not. For although this harlot, this deuillishe Syuagege, purposeth nothinge els, but to incororate you to the deuyll Antichrist, yet hath she euer more in her mouthe Christe, Christe. Though she only laboreth to tumble you headlong into hell both body and soule, yet doth the continually babble of heauen: though she teacheth nothing but heresy to ouerthrow the ghospel,
<pb facs="9"/>yet her tongue runneth stil of the ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as thoughe shee hated heresye. Thoughe she be whollye of the deuyll and nothing of Christ, yet she preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth great familiaritie to Christ oulie, as thoughe she knewe not the deuyll. Thoughe shee lacke no crafte to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert trueth, yet trueth, trueth, is euer her word, as though she lacked crafte. O malicious harlot. O deceauable feinde. O cruel stepdame. Come home come home, gentle brethren, to youre louing and tender mothers lay, whiche hath fostered you from your youthe, and leaue the armes of that cruelstep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, whiche will not leaue, if you leaue not, till she hath strangled you. Come home to this leache, that shee maye heale you of your foule leprie, wherwith this feinde hath ifected you. Come home to this swete nourse, that you maye sucke from her brestes the holsome foode of your soules healthe, and comforte: and leaue the stinkinge carren wherewith this whore feedeth you. Come home, I say, to thys calme and quiet port, where you shall finde
<pb facs="10"/>reste and tranquillitie of conscience, whiche the deuyll coutinually tosseth and tumbleth in restles paynes with the tempestuous stormes of hereticall nouelties. Who is our mother? Wher is our home? No doubt the vniuersall church is our mother, her lappe is our home. If you be not ther at home, you can not be at home with God. If you acknowledge not her to be your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you may not acknowledge God to be your father. To this mother, Mary the mother of her countrye cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you. To thys home <hi>Vincent</hi> wyll leade you euen by the hande as it were. If you be not at home with this mother, there can be no health in you, but all diseases: there can bee no knowledge in you, but al ignoraunce: there can be no hoope of lyfe lefte in you, but assurednes of deathe. Yea, ye can not be of God, but of the deuyl. <hi>Qui matrem ecclesiam relinquit,</hi>

      <hi>quomodo est in Christo, qui in membris eius nō est? Quomode est in Christo, qni in corpore Christi non est?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Ne that leaueth his mother y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church (sayeth S. Austen) howe may he be of
<pb facs="10"/>Christ, whiche is not of his membres? Nowe maye he be in Christ, whiche is not in the bodie of Christ? The bodie of Christ is the churche. If you wilbe healthfull, come home and haue it: If you couet knowledge, come home and sucke it at your mothers brestes, in forme and maner, as it shall please her and not you. If you wil haue life, come home &amp; bide at home with our louinge mother, where deathe ne hell can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uail against you. If you wilbe of god, come home and be incorporate into the bodie of God and man Iesus Christe: and then the deuil shall haue no power ouer you. Do thus and you shall be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured to inherite heauen, where that wicked harlot and her hareheades shal neuer come. you shal doubtlesse possesse the celestiall Paradise, which that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked maistres and her minstrelles can neuer entre. You shall receiue eternite, which that hereticall churche and her chyckines shall neuer haue. Their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and false beleife shal tomble them together into hel: your true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and faieth shall mounte you to
<pb facs="11"/>heauen. They as vnfaithfull rebelles shalbe destitute of all heauenlie grace, you as obedient and faithfull children shalbe supported with the maiestie of Angels. For them euerlasting tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes are appointed, for you heauenlye ioyes preparedeuer to ēdure. Thei shal perishe wicked with the wicked, you shall raigne sanctified with saintes. I feare not but you that are at home wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tarie at home, for feare of so many daū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: and I mistrust not but you that are from home wyll make hast home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, allured with so many benefites: There is no doubte, if cloked crafte begile you not, if flattering fawninge of that deceiteful auoutresse hold you not, but that you wyll make spede (as I said) to come home againe that haue straied from home so longe. But as at home with our mother there is no lacke of trueth, so that harlot our cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell stepmother lacketh no crafte to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap and entangle you, no falshood, no flatteringe to allure and intice you. Come vnto me (saith she) for here is Christ, here is health, here is saluaciō.
<pb facs="11"/>Thus the Ape can ruffle in purple: thus the Asse can strowt in the Lyons skynne, thus the iarringe Iaye canne counterfeicte the pleasaunt note of the nightingale. But beware brethren, be not deceaued. It is and euer hath been the practise of the deuill and his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters by coulor of trueth to perswade falshood, vnder the cloke of good to bringe in al euil. Our true mother the true church is but one, &amp; in all respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes but one only: one in one vniforme vse of one Baptisme &amp; sacramētes, one faith, one spirite. This mother, is not a mother of a fewe, but of many: her power is not particular, but vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall: as she is extended through all the foure partes of the earth, &amp; her glorie diffused in the whole world. For of her it is saied: <hi>Dabo tibi gentes haereditatem tuā, &amp; possessionem tuam terminos terrae.</hi> I wyll giue the nations thine inheritaunce and the extremities of the earthe shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be thy possession. This our mother the true churche hateth not light, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not to lurke in corners, where she maye not be seene: but as her power
<pb facs="12"/>hath euer more been vniuersall, so vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally she hath been at all tymes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perte, plaine, and manifest. For how can she be obscure and hidden (saith fainte Austē) <hi>Quae obtinuit omnes gentes,</hi> &amp; is that citie of whiche it is spoken: <hi>Non potest abscondi ciuitas super montem constituta.</hi> The citie cannot be hid which is set vppon a mountaine. Our lorde hath set hys tabernacle in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sōne, saith y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> propher: his tabernacle is our mother, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church saith S. Austē, which is set in the bright sonne &amp; not in the darke shade: whiche walketh openly by daye, and not preuilye by night. Whose ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie the hereticall churche, is of a contrary nature. For she neither is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall, nor at all tymes, but at some certaine time, and in some one certaine place. And againe she goeth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth preuilie, and in her doinges there is no vnitie, no certeintie at all. Her ministers are diuided, now they dreme one thinge, &amp; nowe an other: this daye they like, to morowe they mislike: one is against an other of them, euen in the highest mysteries of Christ his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Who list to cōsidre their writinges
<pb facs="12"/>shall proue true that I saie. Howe be it experience of their doinges, without readinge of their bookes, mighte per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade vs of Englande what thei were, and wherehence they be, that yeres past haue been preachers and teachers here amongest vs: that haue persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our true mother the vniuersall churche of Christ: and haue set vp their lorde Antichriste, and his hereticall churche. What orders, what forme of religion haue they set furth sins their firste raigne, that shortly after they altered not? Whiche three of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mougest them all, that agreed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their matters? No marueill, for the deuill is their chiefe head, whō they serue: and he is full of lyes, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce, diuision, and discorde. And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him their scholemaisters were, Hus, Luther, <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> Decolampa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, Bucer, Melanethon, Tindall, Frythe, whiche in their doctrine agree not one with an other. Such maisters, suche scholers come of them. And this diuision, this vncōstancie of doctrine, was a manifest token that they were
<pb facs="13"/>not the children of oure true mother the catholike churche, nor ministers of Christ, but the children of the deuill and ministers of Antichrist: yea very Autichristes. For who soeuer saith S. Austen is gone from the vnitie of the catholike churche, he is become Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. Those Antichristes haue borne a great stroke here nowe to longe time in Englande, in whom was no constā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, no staye, no stedfastues of religion and doctrine. Howebeit thei al agreed wel in some thinges. They all woulde be as proude, as headdy, as false and suttle, as the deuill their father, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence they came. They al would haue wyues, longe berdes, and finally no olde trueth, or fashions: but all newe knackes and fansies, as their schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maisters lyked, Bucer. &amp;c. of whō they were taught. Yet woulde they bere vs in haud y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> they wer catholike christiās. But howe can ye be catholike christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus (saith sainte Austen in his treatise vpon sainte Iohn his Epistle) that do not communicate and agre to the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of doctrine and faith, whiche is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb facs="13"/>and vsed through all christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? They woulde be counted true prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Gospell, Prophetes, and Apostles: yet none of them can saye as Paule the Apostle saied. Our exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion was not to bringe you to error, nor to vncieanes, neither was it with gyle: our conuersation was not at any time with flatteringe wordes, neither in cloked couetousnes, neither sought we praise of mē. Ye are witnes and so is God, howe holy and iustly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable we haue behaued our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues emouge you. This said S. Paule. What can our new Apostles say? Out of all doubte the verie contrarie, as truly as euer S. Paule said the other. But for feare of Hypocrisie they dyd all their good workes in corners, that mē might not se them. Yet Christ said: Let your lyght shine before men, that they may se your good workes. But thoughe they were not men of manye good workes, yet had they many pretie Aualities, though I saie it. For I may lykē them well to the beast called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melopacdus: chiche being but one, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth
<pb facs="14"/>yet many beastes, as by hys necke, the horse: by his feete, the oxe: by his head, the Camell: by his spottes in his skinne, the Tygre. So these late preachers in their stoute countenaūce, they seemed warriers: in their lighte apparell, courtiers: in their familiar talke, rybawdes: in their gesture, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons: in their liuinge, ryotous: in the pulpyt, lying preachers: in their bokes, spiteful railers. If they haue not been suche as I report them, then showe me what they were, and howe muche ye that haue been their disciples and scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue profited vnder them, and by their example in godlynes of lyfe, in honestie of behauiour, in charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes your neighbours, sins ye first wēt frō your mother the church, &amp; left the auncient orders and customes of religion, and became gaye Gospellers after the gyse of your newe teachers? Beholde your selues in the glasse of your owne cōsciences, &amp; tel me trueth. Ye say, that they were godly teachers, and that through them ye haue attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a great knowledge of Goddes
<pb facs="14"/>word. The more knowledge ye haue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> more godly ye ware of lyfe. For wher the true knowledge of Gods worde is, ther is the true spirite of God, which euermore sterreth &amp; moueth mā to liue wel, according to his knowledge, &amp; the pleasure of God, whose knowledge he doth professe. But in Englande I am perfecte &amp; none of you cā sai nay, &amp; saie truth: but y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> ye haue growen in al wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, as ye haue growē in this newe religion, in somuche that there was neuer suche vnthriftines in seruaūtes, suche vnnaturalnes in children, suche vnrulines in subiectes, suche feircenes in enemies, suche vnfaithfulnes in frendes, againe suche beastlynes of myndes, such disdainfulnes in hartes, finally such falshood in promises, such deceitfulnes in bargaines, suche gredy extortiō, such insatiable couetousnes, such itollerable pride, as therfore ye are becōe a fable amōgest al natiōs. How saye ye, is not this true? whiche of you can denaie it? And be these the fruites of true knowledge? yea, do not these behauiours and vngodlye maners of
<pb facs="15"/>you, declare manifestlie that ye haue of late yeres geuen your selues rather to errors, then to trueth: rather to haue forsaken the catholike and pure faieth of our mother the true churche, and folowed the fonde fansies of a fewe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and false teachers, to the highe displeasure of God? Will God thinke ye reforme his churche if they were in error, or call his people to knowledge if they had been in ignoraunce, by the ministers of the deuil, by the preachers of Antichrist? Or can ye sai that thei be the ministers of God, that liue so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlye: that they be the preachers of righteousnes, whose dedes are so full of vnrighteousnes: that in comparison of them, other whom ye called papistes might be saintes for the honestie of their liuinge, and sobre behauiours, as ye your selues haue saied many times euen in my hearing? Be not these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Prelates, to be folowed? haue ye done a noble fete trowe ye, to forsake the vniuersall vnitie of all christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to be at defiaunce with your louing mother the catholike churche, whiche
<pb facs="15"/>hath fostred you from your infancie, and without whose help, furtheraūce, and succour, ye cannot be saued: for to folow suche blinde guides, suche grosse maisters, as whose doctrine hathe brought you in errors, to the high dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of God: whose example of vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clene lyuinge hathe ledde you into all wickednes, to your great ignominie, shame and rebuke with all godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? what good haue they done in this realme, either by their preachinge in wordes: or with their teaching by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample? Haue thei not brokē many good and godlye ordinaunces, and set vppe none? Haue they not caused for greate concorde and vnitie, great tumult and rebellious sedition? for godly fastinge, ryotous feasting? for deuout praiyng, peuishe prating? for due obedience, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull libertie? for peace, Gods plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and inough: warre, dearth &amp; famine more then inough? I write and wepe in my harte to considre, what maye be writen of the wretched condition and state that our countrie hath been in of late yeres. Which of you al, yea which
<pb facs="16"/>of your preachers, (whose light should shine that the worlde shoulde see it) which of them I saie, hath not been as redye as the worst disposed of you all, to eate vpon good friday or any other vigill daye, as soone the Pigge as the Pikerel, the Capon, as the Carpe: the Chykin as the Cheuen? Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Magistrates of this realme cōmaunded, the wisedome of the whole worlde thought necessarie, the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall consent of Christ his churche pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed the contrary. What seruaunt for the most parte hath any of you all, that loketh not to haue his brekefast, his dyner, and his supper, as well vpō Christmas eue, as any other daye, or els ye must prouide a newe seruaunt? Who can blame them? Are thei not as they haue been vsed? Rather then ye would obserue the ordre of fasting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the churche, ye woulde not stick at the beginning to giue your ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uauntes one meale more on the fasting daye, then ye woulde on any other day. And where ye would other dayes feede them with milke, butter &amp; cheese only,
<pb facs="16"/>on the fasting daie, they should be sure to haue fleshe. Yea and thought it a glorie whē ye had so done, that ye had so well reformed your householde, frō that popishe fast: calling all thinges popishe that was godly. But what haue ye gotten hereby? Surely ye had neuer so lytle good seruice, and yet ye neuer paide more for it then nowe. Ye had neuer such disobedient seruantes, and yet ye neuer cherished them better then nowe. Why so? Before they were better taught then fedde, and of late they haue been full fed and ill taught: Then were they obedient, trustie and diligent, as thei were taught: and now be they disobedient, slouthful, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trustie, as thei be fedde: then were thei well taught workers, and nowe ill fed porkers: then had ye diligent laborers, and now ye haue negligent loyterers. I speake as I heare your selues saye that haue them. Well, will ye haue a remedy? Thē begin where ye left: teach them better and feede them lesse. And for praying, how it hath decaied, which of you cannot beare witnesse? Finallye
<pb facs="17"/>what kinde of wickednes is there that ye haue not aboue other, and what one vertue is there, that ye haue not lesse then other, that professe the contrarie religion to you? One demaunded of kinge Agesilans what fruit and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite the lawes that Lycurgus made had brought vnto the Citie of Spart: marie quod he, <hi>Contemptum vitiorum,</hi> that is, the contempte of vices. But whoo shoulde require of me what fruit the innouatiō of religion hath brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this realme of Englande, I muste nedes saye as I knowe, <hi>Contemptum vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutum,</hi> the contempte of vertues and al godly liuing. If it be true knowledge, that ye bragge your selues to haue of Gods worde: came ye not to it by the spirite of God? And doth the spirite of God increase knowledge in you, and decrease godlines that shoulde be in you according to your knowledge? Is godlie zeale, is the feare of God, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes of life, is charitee towardes your neighbours wrought in your hartes without the knowledge of Christe his true religion, or els with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="17"/>therof? If it be in the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of worshippinge God, then of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie must ye cōfesse that before this innouation you were in better state of knowledge, because your liues were then more agreable to knowledge: and that sins, ye haue been erroniouslye taught and deuillishelye seduced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause your dedes &amp; doinges haue euer sins been more and more vngodly and deuillishe. For God did neuer begin to plante a doctrine vnknowen tofore, or renewe a doctrine afore neglected, and forgotten: but by suche as were godly and vnspotted, as in dede expressed the strength and vertue of their doctrine, in their life and behauiours. For as S. Ambrose saith, the wordes of teaching do vehementlie moue the hartes of the hearers, when the life of the teacher is not dissonant. Thē is the authoritie of the preacher firme, sure, &amp; alewable, when he clencheth his sayinges in the mindes of the hearers with the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of godly workes. For the iuste man in his worde and dede is alowed in his sayinges, this is required in all prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
<pb facs="18"/>and teachers commonlie, howe much more is it requisite in them that will preache and teache a newe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen doctrine? and woulde repell and olde knowen and well grounded religion, to plant some newe fangled inuētion? If thei were moued by God, then no doubte God woulde also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire them to doo it orderlie, that is, accordinge as him selfe did, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red other to doe. He him selfe (as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him) <hi>Caepit faeere &amp; docere.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan first to doe, and then to teach. And he instructing his preachers: said who soeuer breaketh one of these least cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, and so teacheth other, he shalbe called the least in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen: but whosoeuer obser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth &amp; teacheth the same shalbe called great in the kingdome of God. And S. Paule the worthie preacher of Christe his trueth, dothe testifie of him selfe. I doe chasten my bodie (saith he) and bringe it into subiection, least perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture while I preache to other, I my selfe be made a reprobate. Surely if God woulde innouate or alter the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb facs="18"/>so longe receiued, by reprobate men: then is he not the same that he was, nor one with his promise. For when he first began to plant the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of his sonne Christ, he chose such ministers and preachers therof, as for integritie of life, and also for diuers miracles (effectuall persuasions of anye thinge that they shoulde teache) were notable through all the worlde. But our holy preachers beginning to plant a newe religion, or (as they saye) renewe an olde doctrine this .xv. C. yeres neglected, lacke both. Thei haue neither good conditions to authorise, ne miracles to cōfirme their sayinges. O, you will say vnto me, though they liued not accordinglye, yet was their teachinge good. I saie they taughte naughtie &amp; false doctrine. How proue I that? because it is contrarie to the faith receiued and taught by our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vniuersall churche. But they brought the scriptures for them ye wil fai. Yea so did the deuil, so did Arreus, Donate, Sabellius, and as many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes as euer were, to maintaine their
<pb facs="19"/>doctrine, yet was their doctrine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, and blasphemous: and the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture true and moost true. But thei al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged the Doctours, and Fathers vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the scriptures. They did in dede, but in like sort and maner as diuers were noted to allege Homers verses. <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> hedles, &amp; end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, for whatsoeuer they founde in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the fathers workes, that mighte in any respecte seeme in apparaunce to mainteine their errors: the same wolde thei continuallie chat and charme on, allthoughe in dede it made either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them and their errouious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: or at least, nothinge with them, if they had well waied their workes throughlye as they did not. But they were snatchers and patchers only, and only snatched here and there a piece to patche vp a botching mater. I mighte well liken them to Apes for diuers qualities that were in them, for as the Ape being neither apt to kepe y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> house, as doth the mastie cur, nor fitte to bere burthen, as can the hors: nor meete to turne and till the grounde, as can the
<pb facs="19"/>Oxe: she only flattereth, she only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to laughter and pleasure, and with her folishe mockes and mowes maketh vs pleasaunt and merie. So these newe fangled preachers, for as much as thei had not the grace neither to kepe home w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> their mother, the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall churche: and with her to watch and kepe the wardes that her enemies assaulte her not, neither to turne &amp; till the groūde of mans soule, that it might be apt to receiue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> good feéde of whete, whiche their mother woulde haue so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen: neither yet paciontlie to bere the burthen and loode of her motherlie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, by fastinge and praiyng, and to suffre the crosse of her spouse Christe, which she would haue leide vpon their showlders: being vnfitte (I saye) and vnprofitable membres to these good purposes and vses. they became mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of pleasure, libertie, lyeence and ease, and they thēselues knowrle dope in them all. Whose onlie purpose was as Trasmus well noteth in his epistle to Bylibaldus, <hi>Census, &amp; vxor,</hi> thryuing and wyuing. ergo in this point they be
<pb facs="20"/>apishe. Againe when so euer they toke vpon them the handlinge of any good and weightie matter, their handling of it was apishelie: for either thei woulde rent and teare it into peices, and make it nought worth, orels by wrasting and wrething of it, they woulde force the same to mainteine their principall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente <hi>(wyuinge and thriuynge)</hi> and this is apishe. Further as of euill commeth good many times, so of thē came some good also. For we reade that the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes, plaie, and pastime that the Ape maketh, driueth away the Agew from the Lyon. In like sort the foly, the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceutious libertie of these new fangled preachers haue driuen awaie the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse securitie from the catholike sort, and haue been occasion that they haue giuen them selues more earnestlie to watche and warde for their mothers right, whiche tofore liued as careles without feare of enemies: and here in thei were as profitable to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> catholike, as Apes to the Lyon. Thus thoughe they woulde not abide to be papishe, yet were thei stil apishe. Thei haue lost
<pb facs="20"/>but one letter of the name, but they lacke an hundreth good conditions of them, that be so named. They will say here vnto me, now ye talke at pleasure of vs: but all this while why haue not you amongest you confuted by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and learning our doctrine, if it were so euill? I saie vnto them, what nede any of vs to cōfute your doctrine by argument, whiche the vniuersall church of Christ by consent, hath long ago cōdempued for heresie? Tushe they will say againe, you could say nothing against it. How know ye y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>, that when we speake you will not vnderstand vs, or els your selues haue so many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, that ye will neither vouchesafe vs time to speake, nor your selues leisure to here. Ye are so ful of wordes that ye cannot abide vs to speake, and soo full of malice, that ye will not sauer of it, if it sounde contrarie to your opinion. Ye are made like <hi>Porticus ī Olympia,</hi> which was called <hi>Septiuoca,</hi> hauing seuen voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or seuen soundes, because for one voice it woulde giue many. Soo, you were made <hi>Septiuoci</hi> for one worde you
<pb facs="21"/>will haue the tellinge of seuen score or els the sprite woulde fume and be in a greate heate: howe be it, manye times and often we haue confuted your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, although you hetherto were not coufuted, which coulde not be, for two causes: the one was because you were become heretikes, which will neuer be perswaded against their conceiued opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as Lucifer the heretike confessed of his disciples to S. Hierom. <hi>Vnum ribi confiteor quia mores meorum apprime nom, facilius cos vinci posso quàm persuaderi.</hi> I cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse this one thing to the, for asmuche as I do so well knowe the nature of my disciples, that to dye for, they will not be perswaded, rather will they by violent cōpulsion be vāquished. Next because ye are apishe as I say. For as the Ape whippeth here and there, and neuer staiethe in one place, lykewise pour custome and maner is, so to sterte and whippe from place to place, from matter to matter, from texte to texte, that it is not possible to preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you in resoninge. It is an olde saying &amp; some what to true, Frensie,
<pb facs="21"/>Heresie &amp; Gelosie after that they haue ones crepte into man, they will neuer lightlie out of him againe. Blame me not if I be some what quicke. Youre quicke spede heretofore requireth no lesse hast, Yet am I not so quicke to touch you for your euil doinges, which deserue no fauor, as ye haue been ouer hastie here afore to depraue vs for such matters as were worthye praise and commendation. If ye haue taken plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in deprauing vs, that offended not take not nowe displeasure, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, for that ye haue offended: ye haue many times spoke what ye ought not, and nowe nomaruell, if ye heare what ye woulde not. Who hath not bothe sene and hard in booke, balet and plaie your spurning and kycking, your croing and cryinge, your barkinge and bitinge against the faiethfull beliuers and catholike preachers? and why? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sothe for two causes. Let Diogenes tell the first and I will not sticke to tel the nexte, One asked Diogenes what was the cause, that some men woulde rather giue their almes to the creplte and
<pb facs="22"/>lazar then to a Philosopher, marye quod he, because they hope soner to be a creple or lazar then to be a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, that is, a louer of wisedome &amp; truethe. Nowe why haue ye so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mētly inueighed against the true prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Christ, and the trueth of hys spousesse our mother the churche, and haue extolled the false ministers of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichrist and the ministrie of his harlot the malignant churche? Speake Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes, speake. It is, because they soner hoope to be still the false ministers of Antichriste, then at any time the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preachers of Christ: soner to go to dwell in hell with the deuill for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye: then to raigne in heauen with god, for true religion. Wel saide Diogenes, and by promise I must tell the nexte cause. I haue readde of an vnskilfull Painter, who hauinge painted on a time in a table home lie and verie euill fauoredly, a companie of croinge coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and beinge preuie of his owne ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce, he commaunded his hoye to driue out al the pultry out of the house and that in no wise any liuelye Cocke
<pb facs="22"/>shoulde come night the place, where y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> table with his painted cockes stode, least the beholder or byer by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and collation of them together, might esely deprehende the grosse and rude ignoraunce of the Painter, and so hinder the vttraunce of his ware. So, beware saide our preachers beware of these papistes, beware of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistrie, harken not to them. Kepe not companie with them. Trie, fye on thē and let them go. Wherfore? The pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath told the cause. They were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie of their owne wicked ignoraunce. For they feared, &amp; I am out of doubte, that if ye had truely conferred their doctrine and liues with the doctrine and liues of the other good and godlye teachers, whiche they called papistes: if ye had quietly and diligently with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie of minde wayed well what they haue either saied in pulpit or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in bookes: ye had longe agone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the blinde and grosse ignorance of your guydes, Ye had eslie found out their treacherie, crafte and falshood: ye had soone tried that al their gaie pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="23"/>wart, was but bumling and fum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling peltrie, and not (as they made you beleue) faithfull religion, but deceitful delusion, not wittie writing, but wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wresting of well written trueth, not truethfull preching, but rutheful bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge of all christian ordres, not right reformacion of thinges amisse, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nellishe deformation of thinges that were well, &amp; to be short not repairing, but impairing of the catholike fayth. Alas most deere countremen that euer ye should be somuch bewitched by that deuelishe harlot that for her whigge &amp; whay ye should thus leaue the nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shinge milke of your louinge mothers brestes, for the durtie poudle of her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane pittes whiche bringeth death, ye shoulde forsake the cleane fountaine and well of your mother, where he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s springeth the water of lyfe. O alas dere frendes ye haue greatly hasarded the wealth of your soules, ye haue hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the burninge coles of vengeaunce vpon your owne headdes: ye haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly cast your selues awaye for euer, to be tormented body &amp; soule amongest the foule deuelles of hell in fire euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
<pb facs="23"/>if vpon this callinge ye repent not, and make hast homewarde into the bosome of your louinge mother. Ye haue ben often called, and fewe of you haue regarded. What pituous plages, what meruelous miseries, haue not you sene and moost of you felt, sins ye left the vnitie of the vniuersal church? And were they not all as Prophetes sent amongest you to put you in remē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce that ye were from home, that ye were out of the fauor of god? What desperation hathe there been amonge you? howe manye of you nowe of late yeres, haue died desperate of Goddes mercie? howe many haue caste awaye themselues with their owne violente handes? And was not all this suffered to let you vnderstand, that ye were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come disobediēt children to your good mother? that ye were no longer mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of that liuely bodie? can the childe despaire of the fathers mercie, as longe as he is obedient to the mother? Can he despaire to be saued by Christ, that is a membre of his bodie? no, no. Thus mercifullye by diuers meanes GOD
<pb facs="24"/>bouchesafed to call you home againe into his dere spousesse lappe, into your tender mothers armes. But it hath not moued your stonie and stouborne hartes. Nowe againe of his mesureles mercy he calleth you. And out of doubt this is the laste call, this is the laste sounde of the trumpet. If ye come not nowe home at this call, it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, least he will exclude you out for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and you that would not come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so many callinges, shalbe bidden goe at one commaundement <hi>Maledicti in ignem aternum,</hi> accursed into fire euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting. Ye haue been called diuersly by diuers and maruelous plages, and yet ye come not. Nowe last of all he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you by a more gentle meane, by his true elect Marye our most noble and godly Quene. Whom his inscru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table prouidence hathe preserued of a speciall purpose no doubte, that by her he might restore his true churche, of late yeres miserably vexed. And by her last of all, call you home into the folde, that haue longe straied as loost sheepe. She remembringe therfore whose mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistresse
<pb facs="24"/>she is, doeth not slacke to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute her office. <hi>Clamat virgo, Angli, surgite, sponsus adest.</hi> The faithful and heauenlie virgin crieth earnestlye vnto you, O my louinge subictes of Englande, O dere beloued people, arise arise, come &amp; accompany the spousesse of Christ our louing mother, for the spouse cōmeth. If ye be not of her traine, if ye be not of her familie, the Spouse will not knowe you: the Spouse Christe will not admit you where he hath to doe. If ye be not one with the spousesse, the spouse &amp; you must nedes be two. The spouse and the spousesse shalbe one in heauen, you and the deuil shalde one in hell. Wherfore arise, arise I sai. Come home come home. y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>are so louingly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Who calleth you? god calleth you. Whose vengeaunce you cannot escape, if you come not, if this last call bringe you not home. Your creatour calleth you, whose wilis to saue what he hath made. The lord of mercie calleth you, who by so many waies letteth not to seeke the lost shepe, in whose recouerie he more reioyseth, then in the hauitige
<pb facs="25"/>of ninetie and nyne.</p>
   <p>Thus God, the creatour, and lorde of mercie most gently and louingly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you. By whom? by many messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and nowe last of all by a famous Mary, whose merites and mercie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes you all, might moue you all to come: by an heauenly maide, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of life and constancie of faithe, ought to perswade you al to come wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly: by a mightie Quene, whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie might compel you all, to come with syede. whether to come? home, in to your mothers lappe, where lacketh no comfort, no cōsolation, no heauenly pleasure. With her, ye shal haue al, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge ones made mēbres of him that is al ī al. At home with her, you shal haue assuraunce of life, that caunot dye: of inheritaunce, that shall not quaile: of blisse that cannot ende: eternally to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in heauen with God. If ye tarie stil from home, what shall you haue? out of al doubte, ye shalbe assured of bitter deathe, of perpetual seruitude, of vnspekeable tormentes euerlastinge to endure in hell amongest deuilles.
<pb facs="25"/>Tan niether so great benefites per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you to come home, neither soo great displesures wery you to wādre from home? were ye so lightly caried from home by the deuil your enemie, that ye might be lost: and are ye nowe so hardly perswated to turn, whē god your redeiner calleth you, by so many louinge waies that ye might be saued? Shal I cal you mē that wilfully rūne into confusion, whiche the vntesona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beastes would not? Shal I cal you christians that so ofte and so louingly called, choose rather to folowe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ to hel, then christ to heauen? shal I cal you Englishe subiectes, that soo litle regarde the trumpet of your so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Ladie? Is it so harde to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men, (whiche shoulde haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,) to choose rather life then deathe, rather pleasure then paine? Is it soo hard to perswade christians to folowe rather God then the deuill, rather to raigne in heauen then to suffer in hell? Is it so harde to pecswade Englishe hartes, to obey so noble a Quene, soo godly a Mary, so heauenlye a virgin,
<pb facs="26"/>calling you home in such louing wife, where ye maye haue rest and quietnes, that haue been tossed with so many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series? where ye maie haue remedie of so many pestilent sores, and vlceres, wherewith your soules are infected? Come, come, louinge countree men. For the passion of Christ make hast and come. Be not slacke in comming, that made so great hast in goinge. Beholde your louinge mothers armes are open to receiue you, her bosome vnlased▪ her brestes bare to feede you with the swete milke of true knowledge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe ye haue vngentlie delte with her in forsakinge her. Yet come I saie and humbly submit your selues vnto her, and she wil louingly receiue you. She wil forget and forgeue al vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes past, and she wil deliuer you from so many euilles, perilles, and daūgers, that ye are in. She can and will, and without her, there is no other to bee loked for, but vtter confusion. If ye will not beleue the trueth vttered in wordes, yet credit the effecte expressed by example. When the raging waters
<pb facs="26"/>had ouerwhelmed the whole earthe, and drowned man &amp; beast and all that was, who then was saued, but Noe &amp; seuen with him? What did the Arke prefigure vnto vs? No doubte the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike churche of Christ, whiche doth regenerate you to God, and deliuereth all that abide in her from the peril and daunger of hell &amp; the deuill. <hi>Ad quam confugiunt omnes in omni pressura &amp; in omni tribulatione sua.</hi> Vnto the Arke of which catholike churche saith saint Austen al doe resort for succour in all persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, miserie and trouble. Ye cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue dere frendes the great comforte, consolatiō, and safegarde, that is with in this churche, because your headdes are so heuie with newe fantassticall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. Ye are so drousie and so blinde in the dead slepe of ignoraunce. But if ye would awake out of that dead slepe and see the trueth, then no doubte but ye woulde thinke with me &amp; saie with waking Iacob. <hi>Verè hic est domus dci, &amp; porta coeli. id est.</hi> In dede this is the house of God, and the gate of heauen. For be out of doubt, if ye he not of this house.
<pb facs="27"/>ye cannot entre into heauen, where God raigneth. If ye kepe not your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues within the Arke of this vniuersall churche, ye cannot auoide destruction: Ye must nedes perishe bodie and soule, Wherefore louinge frendes, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be saued, &amp; to raign with Christ, be at home with his spousesse. If ye louge to inherite as the children of our heauenly father, despice not the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of oure mother the catholike churche. If ye longe to drinke the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water that springeth into euerlas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge life, resorte home to the cleare fountaines of your kinde mother the churche, and abandon the company of heretikes. Leaue their broken and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane cesterues, whiche can holde no water, but poudle &amp; miere. For briefe, if ye desire to worshippe God rightly, and to walke in this true religion accordinge to his most holy will &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, then stagger not to embrace and folowe the olde religion, newlye reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and set furthe by our heauenlye and vertuous maiden Quene. For bee out of doubt there is nothinge in this
<pb facs="27"/>religion, but what the scriptures of God haue occasioned, the heauenlye spirite hath suggested, our true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the catholike church hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised, the holye &amp; learned fathers of all Christendome haue set furth, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of many generall counselles hath confirmed, the longe succession and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuaunce hath approued to be moost true syncere and perfect. O moost dere beloued frendes be not ashamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, wherein the Angelles of heauen will reioyce. Be not ashamed to arise that haue so shamefully fallen. Be not ashamed to come home to your mother the churche, sith she is not ashamed to receiue you. Thinke it not vilenesse to forsake the society of heretikes, that ye maie bee made the children of God. Thinke it no folye to twyne your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues out of the armes of an harlot, whiche will gripe you to deathe, that ye maye sit in the lappe of so tender a mother, whiche will cherishe you into life euerlastinge. Well it is time I see to breake of, for I haue exceded the iust measure of a Preface. And yet am I
<pb facs="28"/>loth to leaue. Blame me not though I cannot obserue measure in my talke to you, towardes whom my loue &amp; hartie affectiō knoweth no mean. And though I am in doubte how you shall lyke my doinges, yet be ye out of all doubte I haue done the same of a great zeale, and most frendlye affection towardes you all. And I protest before God I onlye seeke therby your soules health. Neither haue I written this to shame you, but as my dere beloued bretherne I warne you and call you into the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweship of the soonne of God Iesus Christe our lorde. Wherein if I ought preuaile, wel is it with me, but muche better with you. Here I will leaue &amp; gyue place to holy <hi>Vincent.</hi> Too whom I beseche you hartely giue atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue eare, and willinge harte to vnderstand his counselles, and no doubt but ye shalbe glad ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God in perfite Trinitie direct your hertes &amp; waies.</p>
