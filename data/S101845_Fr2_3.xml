   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost Honorable Lord, it commeth not within the compasse of my power to expresse all the duty I owe, nor to pay the least part: so farre haue your Honorable fauours outstripped all meanes to manifest my humble affection, that there is nothinge left but praying and wondering. There is a canker worme that breedeth in manie mindes, feeding onelie vppon forgetfulnes, and bringing forth no birth but ingratitude: to shew that I haue not beene bitten with that monster, for wormes prooue monsters in this age, which yet neuer any Painter could counterfait to expresse the vglines, nor any Poet describe to decipher the highth of their ilnes: I haue presumed to tender these Madrigales onlie as remembrances of my seruice and witnesses of your Lordships liberall hand, by which I haue so long liued, and from your Honorable minde that so much haue loued all liberall Sciences: in this I shall be most encouraged, if your Lordship vouchsafe the protection of my first fruites, for that both for your greatnes you best can, and for your iudgement in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke best may: for without flattrie be it spokē, those that know your Lordship know this, that vsing this science as a recreation, your Lordship haue ouergone most of them that make it a profession. Right Honorable Lord, I hope it shall not be distastfull to number you heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the fauourers of Musicke, and the practisers, no more then Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours that haue beene desirous to be in the roll of Astronomers, that being but a starre faire, the other an Angels Quire. Thus most humbly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting my selfe, my labours, and what euer is or may bee in me, to your Lordships censure &amp; protection: I humbly end wishing your Lordship as continuall an increasing of health and honor, as there is a daylie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of vertue, to come to happines.</p>
