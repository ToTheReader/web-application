   <p>OUr beloued Brother Mr. He. Cl.
after no small trauell, he finished a
booke contayning fully all poynts
of Church-cōtroversie specially now tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moylinge
our English people. Which
booke lying in myne house for a season,
I procured the third chapter of the Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
(the whole contaynes about 26. ch.) to
be copied out for myne owne vse, what
tyme both Mā ād Booke was presently
(by reason of busines in England) to be
sundred from me. In whose absence, as I
tooke no small delite in the same chapter,
so I demed it my duty (not knowing
when the whole might be published) to
put it in print for publike vtility. If cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Read thow fynde it comly ād pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
in it self whē thow hast read it, thē
easily iudge of the whole, when all the
members knit togither shold presēt it self
vnto the, as a reasonable body. Meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme
my desire is of all such faithfull
<pb facs="3"/>
people as to whom the whole or any part
of the said booke shall com, that (if it be in
theyr pouwre) they will for the edificatiō
of me ād others procure the printinge the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof.
The miserable distractions of the
Catholike confused ād scatred Church it
requireth such a salue: nor knoe I any
who of experience is better able to guide
distressed sowles in this fore-prophecied
tyme of disorder, whereyn if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the very Elect should be deceived. An
age wherein more heed is to be had of rē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
Wolues clad in sheepish conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as in skynnes: rather then of open
Beares, Lyons, and Leopards sittinge
in the midst of the temple and Catholike
wheatfeilde I meane the Church. And
thus, desiring the praiers of the faithfull
for my happy progresse in the wayes of
holynes, I leaue the to the gracious go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Christ his Spirit.</p>
