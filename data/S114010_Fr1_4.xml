<hi>Opinion,</hi> without experience of the whole Sexe: Which, in a strict Examination, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth more for <hi>The Honour of Women,</hi> than most men, as yet, haue acknowledged.</p>
   <p>At the first, She was created his Equall. Onelie the difference was in the Sexe. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyse
<note place="margin">
         <hi>GEN.</hi> 5.</note> they both were Man.</p>
   <p>If anie will argue from the Text, That Male and Female made Man; so the Man being put first, was therefore the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest: I answere; So the Euening and the Morning were the first day, sayth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: putting ever the Night before the <note place="margin">
         <hi>GEN.</hi> 1</note>
      <pb facs="5"/> Day: otherwyse the Day was vnperfect.</p>
   <p>And, altho <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> absurdlie, wold seeme to affirme, That, before the Fall, Man had Prioritie: Yet Saynct <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> stronglie, and truelie, confuteth his Grosse Opinion.</p>
   <p>Now, all must grant, Her Bodie to bee more Amiable, Admirable, and Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, than Mans. She is fuller of Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, and Noble Natures Wonders: both for Conception, and fostering the producted Birth.</p>
   <p>And, who, then, dare thinke, that GOD would put a worser Soule, into a better Bodie?</p>
   <p>It is certayne, that Women are of colder Constitution, than boyling Man: and, so, more temperate.</p>
   <p>Heate it selfe transporteth Man to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderation, and Furie: and hurrieth him to a Savage, and Libidinous Violence. But Women are, naturallie, more modest. And Modestie is, indeede, the verie Seat, and Dwelling-place, of Vertue: And
<q>
         <l>Fond Fortunes blasts cannot prevayle,</l>
         <l>To over-throw Dame Vertues Sayle.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Whence, I pray you, proceede the most
<pb facs="5"/> abhorride Villanies, but from a Masculine vnblushing Impudence? And what a deale of Sweetnesse doe wee finde in a mylde Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position? For
<q>
         <lg>
            <l>When Rage runnes swiftlie, step aside, and see,</l>
            <l>How hard th' Approaches of fearce Furie bee.</l>
         </lg>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>If a Woman groweth bolde, and daring, wee dislyke her, and say, <hi>Shee is too lyke a Man.</hi> And yet, in our selues, wee magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, what in her wee condemne. Is not this great injustice?</p>
   <p>Everie Man is so much the better, by how much the nearer hee commeth vnto GOD. And in nothing can Man bee more lyke vnto GOD, than in beeing Mercifull. Yet Woman exceedeth Man verie farre, in Mercie, Pittie, Pietie, Chartie, and Rueth.</p>
   <p>And, whereas wee are still exhorted to loue, I am assured, that Women are everie where spoken of, for transcending in that Qualitie.</p>
   <p>Men, indeede, haue ever holden Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; beene Judges in their owne causes: inacting their owne Wills, and not bearing the Women speake: whereby, verie easilie,
<pb facs="6"/> they may bee concluded guiltie. But let Men know, that
<q>
         <l>Who judgement giues, and will but one side heare,</l>
         <l>(Though hee judge right) is no good Iusticiere.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>How-so-ever, for my part, I would gladlie honour Vertue in everie Sexe. And, I thinke, in the Generall, I shall finde it more in Women, than in Men; though weaker, and more infirmlie guarded.</p>
   <p>And, though Women bee the Better, yet may they bee wrought (by wicked Men) to bee the worser.</p>
   <p>Neyther shall the faults of manie, make mee vncharitable to all: nor the Goodnesse of some, make mee credulous of the rest.</p>
   <p>Yet, hitherto, I confesse, I haue found more sweete, and constant, Goodnesse, in Women, than in Men: for, of such men as are constant in true Goodnesse, I haue found no great Number.</p>
   <p>And thus I end my Prologue, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth not with Apologies; neyther doe I end it with any intreatie of a kinde censure, which might seeme to disparage this Work, and beg partialitie. But if in these weake
<pb facs="6"/> Extractions, the Judicious and Godlie Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, may bee anie wayes pleased in their increasing affections still towardes Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Vertue, (all by-Respects put away) my Petitions shall ever bee to the GOD of all Goodnesse, to perpetuate their Happinesse; I ever remayning</p>
