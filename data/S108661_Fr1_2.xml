   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Christian Ladies,</hi> whome I loue in the
truth, till <hi>IESVS CHRIST</hi> be perfited in
you. It hath pleased the <hi>LORD of glory,</hi> by
a long, yet mild and fatherly visitation, of
late to summon me, his <hi>vnprofitable</hi> seruant to make ready
<hi>my Account:</hi> In the casting vp whereof finding my selfe
indebted vnto your <hi>Ladyships,</hi> for many christian and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
kindnesses conferred vpon me, a dispised brāch
and out-cast in the world: I haue indeauoured in these my
poore laboures to make acknowledgement of <hi>my debt,</hi> not
with any purpose <hi>to clear the score</hi> (for how should true mē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of <hi>Christs</hi> body not be euer bound to each other) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with intent to <hi>prouoke to a further debt:</hi> because the
debt of loue, as it ought alwaies to be payd, so it must alwaies
be due, and the more it is paid the more the debt is increased.
Til it be at length perfited, and so fully <hi>recompenced</hi> in
heauen. Whether seeing it pleaseth my god very mercifully
to hasten me by keeping me through many tedious and ling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring
infirmities; in an earnest hungring and fainting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>my deliuerance;</hi> therfore haue I rather hastened to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
this duty vnto your <hi>Ladyships,</hi> as to whom in regard
of your places such <hi>mementos,</hi> from a withered branche
<pb facs="3"/>
cannot be vnseasonable: and most seasonable on <hi>his part,</hi> to
bee preformed, who while hee hath tyme, and can doe
no other good, yet hath obtained mercy of the <hi>LORD,</hi>
to pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> his seruants in mind of his wonderfull mercies tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
them; that the memoriall thereof may hold them in due
thankefulnesse vnto so gratious a father, that so their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
in this life may be a pledge vnto them of that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
crowne which remaines for the Saintes in that blessed
Kingdome: These are my heartes desire vnto our gratious
<hi>GOD</hi> for you. And that you may be happily furthered ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and haue a true and liuely glasse to behold the bounty of
our <hi>GOD,</hi> I haue bin bold to committe to your remembrāce
that <hi>wonderful deliuerance</hi> of our <hi>Church and State,</hi>
from that <hi>horrible plot of poulder-Treason;</hi> Wherin eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true hearted <hi>Christian and Subiect</hi> may take a full view
of al <hi>GODS former mercies</hi> towards him, and if he do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
may see in the same <hi>a ful assurance</hi> of whatsoeuer
blessings of <hi>GOD</hi> are yet laid vp in store for him. The
<hi>greatnesse whereof,</hi> howsoeuer I haue heretofore endeauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>once</hi> and <hi>againe</hi> to measure, and so commend my <hi>scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
therof, to the <hi>due consideration</hi> of a <hi>thankeful heart</hi>
yet seeing the measure of that blessing is like the <hi>waters of
the sanctuary,</hi> which the more they were measured, the more
vnmeasurable they did appeare, till at length they became a
deepe, that could not be passed ouer. Therfore I haue bin glad
to take this oportunity of my dayes yet lengthned out, once
againe to measure this great deepe: And by an history of
a like wonderful deliuerance, to reuiue the dead memory
therof in the cares of a secure and vnthankefull world. That
so I might both <hi>pay my vowes</hi> vnto my <hi>GOD</hi> for my life
of late renued me as a prey, and as neere as I may
<hi>haue my conuersation in heauen,</hi> imploying the small residue of my
wretched life in meditations of <hi>GODS</hi> wonderful mercies
<pb facs="3"/>
which is the onely seruice that the saints performe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Oh what a glorious thing it is to be thankfull, when by
dooing this duty we come nearest to the Saints in glory! And
how wil this wonderful deliuerance teach vs to be thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?
How is this deliuerance of the <hi>Iewes</hi> from <hi>Hamans</hi>
malice a most liuely glasse to behold our deliuerance from
the <hi>bloody Papists.</hi> And may not the <hi>LORD</hi> lengthen out
my threed vntill I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e finished this story. This that I now
tender you is but onely the gate into the cittie, if it please
<hi>GOD</hi> that I may go through the Citty (as <hi>Ionas</hi> did) who
knoweth whether by that time <hi>Niniue</hi> may repent and
turne, and so the <hi>LORD</hi> may repent him of the euil, and
reuiue the good that is ready to dye. <hi>The patient abiding
of the righteous is ioy, and he that beleeueth maketh
not haste:</hi> yet <hi>If we beleeue, we shall see greater thinges
then these, and blessed are wee if we see a farre off.</hi> A
lesson which for <hi>a farewell</hi> I do heartily commend vnto
your <hi>Ladyships,</hi> not onely to see into the present, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a farre off, to looke vp to <hi>Moses to the recompence
of the reward,</hi> and not to esteeme to be accounted <hi>the sonne
of</hi> Pharoahs <hi>daughter,</hi> if we <hi>see not the present blessings</hi>
how can we see a farre off? And yet we may so <hi>doate on the
present,</hi> as not to desire to see a far off, and if we desire not,
is not the Lord iust to giue vs our <hi>present desire, and send
leanesse into our soules.</hi> Behold therefore your present
happinesse in that wonderfull deliuerance, yet looke vp with
<hi>Moses,</hi> and see therein also your future happinesse. And so
I heartily commend your <hi>Ladyships</hi> to the view of <hi>this
glasse,</hi> and therein also to the <hi>mercy of the</hi> almighty, who
giue you <hi>wisdome</hi> to redeeme the time by seeing your faces
often herein, and hauing viewed, not to forget what <hi>Iacob</hi>
did gratiously remembr,<note place="margin">Genes. 32, Luke, 17. 12.</note> and what <hi>our Sauiour</hi> wished to
<pb facs="4"/>
be remembred of his Disciples: So shall you preuaile with
<hi>GOD,</hi> and find fauour with men: your age shall bee a
crowne of glory, and your posterity shall be blessed: They shal
be of you which <hi>shal build the old waste places &amp; shal be
called the repairers of the breach: the stōes of the field
shal be in league with you &amp; the beasts of the field shal
be at peace with you: you shal laugh at destruction &amp;
death and shal not be affraid of the beasts of the earth.
GOD</hi> hath and shall deliuer you from all aduersity, and you
shall see the <hi>felicity of the chosen:</hi> these blessings the
<hi>LORD</hi> of glory increase vpon your <hi>Ladyships,</hi> to your full
perfection in <hi>IESVS CHRIST.</hi> To whose blessed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
I most heartily commend both you and yours.</p>
