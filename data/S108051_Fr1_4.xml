   <head>THE RAPE OF PROSERPINE.</head>
   <div type="part">
      <head>The Historicall Sense or meaning of the Storie.</head>
      <p>WHen men for their finnes, like other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, were forced to ordinary foode: the bread which they ate of (as <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and <hi>Suidas</hi> mention) was of Acornes: and <hi>Plutarke</hi> writes, that after the Flood it was of the same. At that time, <hi>Siculus</hi> reigned King of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> whose wife (named <hi>Ceres)</hi> a woman of a singular apprehension (to trie a Conclusion) tooke some of the wilde Wheate, which groweth naturally so in that Country, and sowed seedes of the same, and was carefull to till them: these in their due time produced of that Graine in great abundance, which shee caused to bee moulded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a paste, and (finding the sweetnesse of it) still sowed more and more, till she attained to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb facs="5"/>
of Tillage; (with which shee instructed all her Islanders) so that the <hi>Sicilians</hi> were the first Husband-men in the world, and taught other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, till such time as Wheate became the generall nourisher of all men.</p>
      <p>The commoditie the <hi>Sicilians</hi> reaped hereby, and the multitudes of such as applyed themselues to Tillage, were the causes of the diuisions of lands (touching which, <hi>Ceres</hi> made sundry lawes) some of which remaine euen at this day with vs: and for this cause the blinde <hi>Gentiles</hi> adored her as a goddesse, and consecrated that Island of <hi>Sicilie</hi> vnto her, as to the inuentresse of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest.</p>
      <p>It happened that this <hi>Ceres</hi> had a daughter, called <hi>Proserpina;</hi> who, for her exceeding beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was affected by <hi>Orion</hi> King of <hi>Epirus</hi> and the <hi>Molossians,</hi> and by him stolne away in the absence of her Mother <hi>Ceres:</hi> who when shee returned, and found that her daughter was thus gone (ignorant of the Rauisher) went ranging vp and downe the world to finde her, and in her progresse shee sowed all the Fields with Wheate as shee went, till such time as shee found <hi>Orion</hi> out.</p>
      <p>
         <pb facs="5"/>
This Story gaue matter to Poets, to faine, that <hi>Pluto</hi> stole away <hi>Proserpina</hi> from <hi>Sicilia,</hi> in her mothers absence (who missing her at her returne) sought her thorow the world, till she had found her with two blazing lights: and knowing that shee was in hell with <hi>Pluto,</hi> requested of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that she might remaine with her one halfe of the yeere vpon Earth, and the other with her Husband <hi>Pluto.</hi>

   <div type="part">
      <head>The Naturall Sense of the <hi>Storie.</hi>
      </head>
      <p>BY the person of <hi>Ceres</hi> is signified <hi>Tillage.</hi> By <hi>Proserpine,</hi> the seedes which are sowed, by <hi>Pluto,</hi> the earth that receiues them.</p>
      <p>By the diligence that <hi>Ceres</hi> vsed in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her daughter, is shewne the care that Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-men ought to haue in the tilling and sowing their grounds, and reaping of their Haruest.</p>
      <p>By the sixe Moneths that <hi>Proserpine</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Hell, are vnderstood, the sixe, in which
<pb facs="6"/>
the seede is vnder ground, before the eares ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare; and by the other sixe that shee is with her Mother, is set downe, when the corne is ripe, and in possession of the Husbandman.</p>
      <p>By the blazing lights, with which <hi>Ceres</hi> seekes her daughter, is meant the vigilancie of the Husbandman in prouiding for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of his haruest.</p>
      <p>By the lights themselues, are signified the instruments of Husbandry, without which the Corne could hardly be reaped.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="part">
      <head>The Allegoricall Sense.</head>
      <p>
         <hi>BY Pluto</hi> and his suddaine resolution of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying and warring against gods, is noted, the nature and disposition of the insolent rich man, who blinded with ease and plenty, desireth immoderately all that his Concupiscence leades him vnto.</p>
      <p>By the <hi>Destinies</hi> that striue to diuert <hi>Pluto</hi> from his purpose, is seene the force of heauenly power aboue humane.</p>
      <p>
         <pb facs="6"/>
         <hi>Mercurie's,</hi> being sent Ambassador to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> declares how necessarie it is that persons of a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly capacitie and mature iudgement, be sent to take vp strife and iarres betwixt Princes.</p>
      <p>By <hi>Iupiters</hi> decree to giue <hi>Proserpine</hi> for wife to <hi>Pluto,</hi> is shewne the Diuine Prouidence, that disposeth better of things for vs, then we our selues can wish.</p>
      <p>By <hi>Proserpine</hi> left alone in her mothers absence at her worke, is noted the good education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to which mothers are bound, that are honest and carefull.</p>
      <p>By <hi>Ceres</hi> leauing her alone, and <hi>Pluto's</hi> stealing her away, is put (as an example): That Mothers ought not to be so carelesse of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as to expose them to so great a hazard of their honours.</p>
      <p>By <hi>Venus</hi> Executioneresse of <hi>Ioues</hi> will, and <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> her Companions, is signified: that loue is a diuine connexion and bond, ordained from God, if the proceeding in the same bee with simplicity and purenesse of meaning.</p>
