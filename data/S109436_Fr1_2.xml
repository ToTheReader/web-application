next, if we obserue (in like sort) the like most admirable, and absolute order among all other the inferiour creatures (more especially in Man whom he hath purposely made a <gap reason="foreign">

Namely, first into a meere naturall bodie: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> meane a corporall substance consisting ioyntly in an health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full estate of sundry particular members sympathically com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined in one. Then next, into an Oeconomicall bodie, I meane a domesticall, or well ordered houshold condition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably plotted together. Then next, into a meere Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall bodie, I meane the publike estate of kingdomes, and countries collaterally compact in one mutuall consort.

   <p>As this fourefold order of bodies doth comprehend, and vphold to the full, the seuerall conditions of men here on earth: so surely, the second and the last of these foure seuerall estates I do purposely pretermit for the present, as hauing heretofore in <note n="d" place="margin">In a Treatise of household gouernment couertly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayed from me, and set <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="3"/>
hang downe the head, but all the other states else (by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent) they do collaterally become very crazie and weake, concerning any the dutifull discharge of their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar designements.</p>
   <p>As for example, the said stomacke it selfe, namely, the poore husbandmen, they are fearefully subiected to an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable feeblenesse concerning the timely performance of any their appointed functions; to offensiue yelkings, and vomitings forth of sundrie discontentments against the whole State; to an immoderate thirsting after other mens places; to many most bitter heart-burnings, gripings, and gnawings; to sodaine, and vnappeaseable inflammations of furie; to an vtter loathing of their appointed ordinary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; to a dog-like appetite after other mens profites; to an insatiable hunger concerning the speedie supply of their sundrie vnsufferable wants; to a very bad digestion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their present oppressions; to many windie sufflations, and proud puffings vp; to angrie belchings, to cholericke passions, to an vnnaturall fluxe of the purse, by meanes of too many their immoderate and superfluous dispendings; to inward heart-gripings; with sundry such other like feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full occurrents as do finally disable their persons from the orderly collecting, and proportionable dispersing of publike maintenance to any one of the other estates in that selfe same Politicall body.</p>
   <p>Yea, and not onely the said stomacke it selfe (I meane the poore husbandmen,) but all other estates besides are likewise (by a common consent as it were) collaterally sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected to sundry most dangerous distempers: whether we consider the superiour, or any the inferiour parts of that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall body.</p>
   <p>For first, (concerning the superiour parts) who may not
<pb facs="4"/>
easily see and perceiue how the head it selfe will forthwith begin to be fearefully tainted with capitall paines about the disordered State; with want of due rest, by reason of sundry occurring cares; with idle vertigoes, and many terrible turne-about thoughts; with sundrie implacable furies, with most secure and fearefull Lethargies, dreames, and drowsie securities; with crasinesse of memorie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their duties to God and man; yea, and (which more is) with such sodaine congealed Catalepsies, violent conuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ituall benummings, as if all conscionable sense and mouing (in and about their designed imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) were vtterly lost, or quite forgot, at the least.</p>
   <p>And then next, for the Shoulders and Armes (the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and Gentrie I meane) who may not likewise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, how that (when the poore husband-mans state, which did vsually aford their Politicall maintenance, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to fag) they do eftsoones begin to fall forthwith into fearefull Apoplexies, I meane, to an vtter decay of all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall mouing and sense; into quaking Palsies and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of heart, vpon euery crossing occurrent; into dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Epilepsies, and deadly downefallings to euill; into vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Conuulsions, with a sodaine shrinking vp of the sinewes of loue; into fearefull oppressing Ephialteis, and intollerable burdens of sinne, each houre surcharging their sorrowfull soules; into choking Squinancies, I meane, a mercilesse throatling of all their Inferiours; into sundrie most deadly Pleurisies, through the abundant spilling of innocent bloud; into many quarkening Peripneumonies, and suffocating Ptisickes, I meane, into a difficult brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing forth of any gracious decrees concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent good of the poore; yea and (which more is) into very many such impostumating Empiemaes, and most fearefull
<pb facs="4"/>
exulcerations of conscience (with other outragious enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) as bring an vtter consumption and waste to the whole Politicall bodie.</p>
   <p>And as the superiour, so likewise the inferiour mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that selfe same Politicall bodie, feeling once a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the stomacke (I meane in the poore husbandmans state) they do eftsoones decline to an vnnaturall weakenesse and distemperature of the Liuer and Splene (I meane, to a fearefull decay of Christian loue, for the timely discharge of any their Christian duties; to sundrie inflammations, obstructions, coldnesse, and hardnesse of heart against the whole State; to most filthie deforming Iaundeis, through an vnnaturall dispersing of cholericke pangs, and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke passions ouer all the Politicall bodie; to many most languishing Cachexies, I meane, to an inordinate consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and wasting of politicke nutriment, by reason of some euill disposition in their proper estates; to such dangerous Dropsies, and disordered cariages, as do either procure a dissolute loosenesse throughout their peculiar societies, or an vnnaturall swelling at least, against the peaceable, and prosperous state of the whole Politicall bodie; to dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Stranguries, and dangerous difficulties about the timely dispatch of their publike designements; to deadly benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Sciaticaes, and griefes in the huckle-bones, so oft as they are to vndergo the obsequious dispatch of their seuerall duties; yea and (which more is) into many preposterous Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagraes, and intollerable paine in their feete and ioynts, so oft especially as they are made to support and beare vp the necessarie burdens belonging to that Politicall body whereof they are made the vnited members.</p>
   <p>So as your most excellent Highnesse may here againe be pleased to perceiue very plainly, that (by the onely
<pb facs="5"/>
distempers of the stomacke it selfe in either of both these bodies) the whole bodies of both are most fearefully brought into such a languishing condition and state, as neither those stomackes themselues, nor the head, nor the shoulders, nor the armes, neither yet the legs, nor the feete are sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to dispatch their proper designements: by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eanes whereof, euen those selfe same bodies (with all their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts) must needs remaine in a languishing state. And therefore, as the good estate of the stomacke it selfe must be carefully continued, especially, if we desire to vphold the happie condition of the whole bodie it selfe: so surely I do verily suppose there may no better meanes be deuised about that good estate of the stomacke, then to become very carefull first, for the ordinary supply of whatsoeuer good meanes may be helpefull vnto it: and then next, for the powerfull and speedie suppressing of whatsoeuer occurrent may be hurtfull vnto it in any respect.</p>
   <p>Now then, these foure succeeding faculties are espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially helpefull to the good estate of the stomacke it selfe, if they be rightly had, and ioyntly continued: Namely, Appetite, Retention, Digestion, with an orderly Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution.</p>
   <p>For sith it is the proper office of euery particular sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, very orderly to concoct the whole sustenance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued therein, that so, the said sustenance may forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with become good naturall nutriment for the whole bodie it selfe: who seeth not therefore but that (in the stomacke) there must first be procured an able and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute appetite towards that the former receiued suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?</p>
   <p>And because it is to very small purpose though the forenamed Appetite be singular good, vnlesse the Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb facs="5"/>
facultie be also euery way fitted for the firme retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and orderly holding of whatsoeuer solide sustenance so soundly affected before: who seeth not now, but that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly a sound Retention must necessarily be wrought in that selfe same stomacke?</p>
   <p>And because the Appetite, and Retention both, will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little auaile to the good estate of the stomacke, vnlesse the said stomacke be throughly able withall, most soundly to digest whatsoeuer good sustenance so orderly affected, and so firmely retained before: who seeth not therefore, but that a very strong and absolute Digestion must third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be kindled, and firmely continued in that selfe same stomacke?</p>
   <p>And because both Appetite, Retention, and Digestion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, are to very small purpose for the good estate of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, vnlesse the said sustenance so affected, so retained, and so digested, be likewise as proportionably dispersed throughout the whole bodie for naturall nutriment to the seuerall members thereof: therefore, who seeth not fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that the said stomacke it selfe must be aptly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed towards the proportionable Distribution of that selfe same concocted nutriment to each seuerall part of the whole body it selfe? Now then, all those the forenamed faculties so fitly and so proportionably concurring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the orderly accomplishment of that the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nutriment, this stomacke it selfe may not properly be said to feele any want at all, for the timely dispatch of it owne imployments about any his designed functions.</p>
   <p>These fourefold faculties must (in like manner) all ioyntly concurre about the happie and prosperous estate of those our Politicall stomackes: if especially, we would haue them profitably imployed in the orderly collecting, and
<pb facs="6"/>
frugall disposing of publike maintenance, for the conuenient supportation of the whole Politicall body, in all and singular the seuerall parts thereof.</p>
   <p>And therefore, a principall care concerning the poore husbandmens happie condition, must first be made knowne to the world, by an orderly procuring of good Appetites in euery of them towards their seuerall husbandries: that so, they may chearefully, comfortably, and profitably both affect, and effect the fruitfull managing thereof in euery respect. Whereby it is apparently euident, that those their said Appetites must not be killed by vnreasonable Fines, by excessiue Rents, by ouer heauie Impositions, or any such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther importable burdens.</p>
   <p>And then next, there must likewise be cherished in euery of them, a powerfull Retention, an enabled facultie (I meane) to retaine, vphold, and continue their seuerall hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandries, for those the former publike respects. So as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a like prouident care must be further had, that by no meanes they may be discouraged from their said husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries by any mercilesse, vncharitable, or cut-throate dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: neither yet compelled (by any causlesse, and cruell oppressions) to cassier themselues from their former callings, and so (in a malcontentednesse) forthwith to cast their ploughs in the ditch.</p>
   <p>And then thirdly, they must yet further be furthered this way, by a strong &amp; speedie Digestion, with such warme and cherishing comforts (I meane) as may enable them all to the orderly maintaining, the husbandly managing, and the wholsome digesting of those their said husbandries for publike good.</p>
   <p>And lastly, there must very carefully be wrought in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them (by the ministeriall operation of the word and
<pb facs="6"/>
praier) a sympathicall disposition, in and about the timely Distribution of that their former collected maintenance, for the publike good of the Prince, the Peares, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the Gentrie, the whole Communaltie, and euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular member of that selfe same Politicall bodie. These things accordingly effected, who seeth not now, but that the naturall and Politicall stomacks both, are sufficiently furnished with whatsoeuer supplies may any way be helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to either of them both for publike good?</p>
   <p>And not onely things helpefull must so be supplied, but things hurtfull likewise must forthwith be suppressed, for feare of enfeebling or weakening the forenamed faculties. But there may not any thing be possibly found more hurtfull to the happie estate of those the forenamed stomacks, then superfluous excesse, or pining wants. For, as by superfluous excesse, the good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>state of those the said stomacks is feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerwhelmed and tumbled headlong into most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous surfeits and deadly distempers: so surely, by oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and pining wants, they are fearefully enfeebled, and finally disabled from the timely performance of their proper designements for publike good.</p>
   <p>First therefore (for the timely suppressing of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer superfluous excesse annoying the healthfull estate of both these stomacks) a prouident care must forthwith be had, that not onely all carowsing and quaffing, all gulling and gormandizing, all excessiue and riotous banquetting: but also that all superfluous buildings, all needlesse braueries, all extrauagant sports, and all other profluuious dispendings be heedfully auoyded in euery state, more especially in those the forenamed stomacks themselues.</p>
   <p>For these onely respects, I haue here euen purposely (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though yet synecdochically) censured all those the former most
<pb facs="7"/>
foule and shamefull disorders vnder the onely name of <hi>Tobacco fumes;</hi> putting downe a part for the whole: and naming that one vice especially, as a most liuely represent of those other the smokelike vanishing vapours; and as the very principall annoyance to both the stomacks: and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the flourishing estate of the naturall, and Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bodies themselues.</p>
   <p>And not onely all such superfluous excesse, but (which more is by much) all those oppressing and pining wants whatsoeuer, which may (in any sort) surprize the good estate of those stomacks, must forthwith be warily suppressed. Namely, the want of competent tillage for corne; the want of conuenient pasturing for beeues, for oxen, for milch-kine, for sheepe, with such other conuenient meanes to manure, mannage, enable, and strengthen their seuerall tillages and pasture grounds, for such a conuenient increase as may fully suffice from time to time, about the necessarie supportation of their owne, and the publike good. The want (in like manner) of politicke, of peaceable, and publike good orders, about the orderly and quiet collecting of such singular blessings as the Lord (in much mercie) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth vpon any their ordinarie labours for publike good, must be heedfully respected and timely redressed by publike authoritie.</p>
   <p>So as your excellent Highnesse may herein againe be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to see the great conueniencie of all those good penall sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes (were they but carefully executed) which do necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily concerne the orderly vpholding of husbandrie in it owne proper nature, or do purposely tend to the timely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of whatsoeuer riots, routs, and vnlawfull assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies that might respectiuely ouerlay the poore husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens labours, and peaceable proiects concerning any their
<pb facs="7"/>
peculiar professions for publike good.</p>
   <p>In consideration whereof, I haue here purposely, and largely laid open the vrgent necessitie for the timely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of that late disordered and vnlawfull attempt of lawlesse persons, in and about the vnorderly and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous disparking of pastures and seuerall grounds, vnder an idle pretence of the necessarie (though needlesse) augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of tillage: demonstrating most plainly, that their falsely supposed defect of tillage is no such an oppressing want, as doth presently hurt the poore husbandmans happy estate (all other things else proportionably and euenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected:) and that therefore there needed no such disordered and headie attempts, for the timely supply of that their falsly supposed want.</p>
   <p>Hauing hitherto anatomized the whole purport of this my purposed proiect for publike good, I am now, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing the same should be soundly peized with those the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued weights of the Sanctuary which will not deceiue. Especially, if our learned Physitions be made the indifferent cyzers and censurers concerning all Physicall questions: as also, if those our experimented Politicians and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke States-men may become the prouident weigh-masters of what points soeuer appertaining to matters of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie.</p>
   <p>More respectiuely (most dread Soueraigne) I do here ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry freely, and submissiuely put ouer the whole to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties approued consideration and view, as vnto the most competent Iudge of publike regard; very humbly intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your excellent Highnesse, that (from out of your long experimented Physicall skill) you would first of all be pleased, very soundly to censure that former part of this present Discourse, which more especially concernes those exceeding
<pb facs="8"/>
great hurts that do vnperceiueably surprise the bodies of men, by meanes of their inward taking of <hi>Tobacco fumes.</hi> And then next (with no lesse humble submission) I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intreate, that your vnmatchable wisedome for publike good, would likewise be pleased (from out of your long set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led iudgement, and experimented practise about the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suppressing of whatsoeuer shamefull disorders adiudged pestiferous to the publike good of our countrey) to priuiledge with the approued stampe of your authenticall approbation, that other part of this present Discourse, which more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiuely relateth the purses profluuitie about the superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous charges of filthie <hi>Tobacco fumes,</hi> and the pestiferous poysoning of the long setled peace of our publike State: so farre forth especially, as the truth it selfe, and present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions do instantly craue from time to time. Very submissiuely intreating moreouer, that the whole Treatise it selfe may find at your Maiesties hands, that fauourable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which your gracious wisedome shall thinke good to grace it withall: and thereupon also, may publikely and boldly march vnder the martiall ensigne of your kingly care for publike good, against all the fiery encounters of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fuming <hi>Tobacconists.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>So shall the almightie Iehouah his absolute wisedome be <note n="e" place="margin">Math. 11.19.</note> freely iustified of all her children; so shall your kingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation be iustly eternized among all posterities; so shall the publike State of our countrey be much more bettered, and more soundly conserued in a solide condition; so shall the almightie Law-maker be more largely magnified for his manifold mercies bestowed among vs; so shall the poore husbandmens hearts (as it were with kingly cordials) be forthwith reuiued; so shall our disordered <hi>Tobacconists</hi> be presently daunted, and for euer hereafter discouraged:

yea and so shall my poore selfe be more securely protected from whatsoeuer the fierie <note n="f" place="margin">Ier. 18.18.</note> strokes of venimous tongues, to my better emboldning, and further encouragement in such other like future attempts for publike good. And euen so, I most humbly surceasse my purposed suite for the present good of our publike State: beseeching the almightie Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uah to blesse your excellent Highnesse in bodie and soule, and to enrich you in both with a principall spirit, correspon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dent to your Princely place; to the publike good of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and your owne euerlasting comfort in Iesus Christ. Euen so Lord Iesus, Amen.</p>
