      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He substance of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, being at first, the materialls of some let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters written for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of a private friend, was afterwards drawne together into the forme in which it now appeares, and found the favour, from some unto whom it was communicated, to bee desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Presse; for which end it hath lyen in the Licensers hand, now above a yeare expecting the cōduct of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Prelate who upon speciall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion then offered, (as it appeares) by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, undertook this argument: Which having performed, like himselfe, with such variety of learning and profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of judgement, this Pamphlet of
<pb facs="3"/>
mine may now justly seeme as unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to follow, as heretofore it was unable and unworthy to leade the way: yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the brevity of it might make it passe and finde acceptance with some; and that, being of a mean straine, it might better meete with common capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, then larger and more elaborate tractates; I was willing it should see the light, and that in its owne garbe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any polishing or alteration. And so I commend thee and it to Gods blessing.</p>
