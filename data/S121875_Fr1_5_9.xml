   <head>To my good Friend M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Iohn Parkinson.</head>
   <l>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Age of Verse is out, what then? shall I</l>
   <l>Be silent, and not open in this cry</l>
   <l>And generall applause? that have more cause</l>
   <l>Then some that crowded in; nor shall the lawes</l>
   <l>Of friendship draw me from the rigide way</l>
   <l>Of bare and naked truth, and force me say,</l>
   <l>In Court civility, more then what I thinke.</l>
   <l>Such compliment is on the very brinke</l>
   <l>Of flattery, and destroyes the very soule</l>
   <l>And essence of true friendship, makes't a foule</l>
   <l>Commerce of mutuall sordid ends, which is</l>
   <l>The <hi>Panacea</hi> of humane miseries.</l>
   <l>But whether now, my Muse? 'twas not my end</l>
   <l>To treate of friendship, but to praise a friend.</l>
   <l>This weary worke of thy unwearyed braine</l>
   <l>Shall doe't for me, and save my further paine.</l>
   <l>But soft, that's onely for the Authour, shall</l>
   <l>I give nought to the Worke, which gives thee all</l>
   <l>Whatsoere th'hast here from us, because 'tis such;</l>
   <l>As like good wine, it doth require no bush?</l>
   <l>It were indeed not needfull, if that all</l>
   <l>Would enter in and taste, without a call,</l>
   <l>And gentle invitation; as in trade</l>
   <l>Chapmen passe by, nor enter, if not made</l>
   <l>And ply'd, yea rudely, with a violent hand.</l>
   <l>To such thy Customers, which come and stand,</l>
   <l>As 'twere at gaze; I promise here good ware,</l>
   <l>And cheape: all trees, all shrubs, all herbes, that are</l>
   <l>In the voluminous <hi>Dioscorides,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>
      <hi>Theophrastus, Galen,</hi> or <hi>Hipocrates;</hi>
   </l>
   <l>
      <hi>Cratevas</hi> or th'acute <hi>Arabians,</hi> who</l>
   <l>Retriv'd this Art first, and all th'other too,</l>
   <l>After the generall Deluge of the <hi>Goths,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>And swarme of other barbarous Nations, moths,</l>
   <l>And cankers of good Letters: nor here wants</l>
   <l>Whatsoere the diligent Modernes have of Plants,</l>
   <l>Omitted by the ancients, out of which</l>
   <l>Gleanings thou here hast made a pretty, rich,</l>
   <l>And fruitfull harvest; neither dost thou spare</l>
   <l>T'insert whatsoere the other world doth beare.</l>
   <l>Nor temperaments, or vertues dost thou misse,</l>
   <l>Names, faculties, or properties; and this</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="8"/>With such a perspecuity the while,</l>
   <l>Order, and method, that it does beguile</l>
   <l>The readers paines so charmingly, that he</l>
   <l>Thinkes it compendious, though so vast it be;</l>
   <l>And calls for <hi>London</hi> measure; and he has't,</l>
   <l>And I my purpose too, saying this at last:</l>
   <l>If any in this subject, seeke more now,</l>
   <l>Nature must adde to what th'hast done; not thou.</l>
