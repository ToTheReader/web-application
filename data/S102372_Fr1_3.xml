   <head>THE TRANSLATOVR to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>OVRTEOVS Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, seing the iniquities of these dayes are such, that diuers men there are, of so flagitious liues, in their conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and manners, that they liue as though there were neither God, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, Hell, or any <hi>Immortality of the soule;</hi> and it is to be feared, that diuers of thē, are in their secret iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēts so inwardly perswaded: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the awakening of all such, so monstrously peruerted and blynded, I haue taken the paynes to translate this ensuing Treatise, written by the most learned Iesuite <hi>Leonard Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> (a man in these tymes of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb facs="4"/>
talents in learning) wherin by many most irrefragable argumets is conuinced, and proued the <hi>Being of a Deity,</hi> and, <hi>the Immortality of the Soule.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I haue feigned the occasion hereof to be an Apparition of <hi>Syr Walter Rawleighs</hi> Ghost, to a liuing friēd, of his, intreating of him to translate the same. My reason of vsinge this Fiction is, because it is well knowne, that <hi>Syr Walter,</hi> was a mā of great Naturall Parts, and yet was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of the most foule and execrable crime of Atheisme. How truly, God and himselfe only know; though I must thinke the best of him, &amp; the rather in regard of that most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and learned Description of God, which himselfe setteth downe in the
<pb facs="5"/>
first lines of his History or Cronicle.</p>
   <p>Now, in regard of his eminency in the world when he was aliue, I am the more easily perswaded, that the very Name of him (by way of this feigned Apparition, and the like answerable Title of the Translatiō) may beget in many an earnest desire of perufing this Booke; and so become the more profitable. I hope for taking this method, I cannot be iustly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; for if I haue offended any, it must be <hi>Syr Walter</hi> himselfe. But him I haue not wronged, since I do vindicate, &amp; free him from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer blot, as presuming him to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of the suspected Crime. And thus (good Reader) thou hast the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this my proceding. And so I remit thee to the Treatise it selfe.</p>
