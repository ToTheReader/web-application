He therfore of good righte is to bee tearmed a passinge good workeman, which can with such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

altogether endeuored, sieking euery one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his veyne, in suche sorte to pollishe and beautifie that most excellent porcion of vs, the minde, as prepared the better to receaue the print of vertues seale, we mought in this race of frailtie climbe to some degree (at least) of trewe happines and sound felicitie. But bicause the name of vertue is of suche maiestie, as at the firste vewe it would dashe and dismaie her firste and feble beholders, certaine Philosophers castinge asyde their frostie beardes, and other such ceremonies of Philosophicall showe: with louing care to cherishe and mainteine those soft and gentle minds, that could not yet wel broke the pain full bruntes of scollerlike customes: haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised certein pleasant confections (as it were wherwith to sauce and sweten the studie of Philosophie,) handling eche parte therof so familiarlie, that the most wild and haggard heades were oftetimes reclaimed to harken &amp; follow their holsome Lessons. And so the phrigian fabler <hi>Aesope,</hi> geuing fained speche and conference of talke to creatures vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, vnder cloke and color therof lefte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reasonable most necessary preceptes of all humanitie and morall dewtie▪ The like

hath bene from time done by a number of noble Poetes, who in their fabled forgeries (yf they be well marked) haue vttered all maner of most depe and profound learning, I speake not of the Comike writers, who pretending but sport, by pretie contriuement of partes and persons, teache howe to beare our selues towardes all sortes, and specially to shonne the cosining trappes of those that are numbred amonges the vilest kynde of people. Which selfe same fruite is also to be gathered of these our common plaies and showes, which grounded (after a sort) vpon the rules of Philosophie, do whet and shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the wittes of the lokers on: euen as the Barriers, Tilte, Torney, wrestling, leaping or running do by vse strēgthen the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

   <p>In respect wherof, hauing fallen into my handes of late a certeine Frenche booke, the woorke sure of some learned and Skilfull writer, driuing principallie to the like good purpose, deemed it could not bee, but labour worth, to spende some vacaunt daies, in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching it to speake our mother english tonge.
<pb facs="4"/>
Especiallie for that in full perusing thesame I founde he had so handsomlye by waie of question, couched together the moste beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable pointes of all Philosophie, as to the diligent reader mought nedesly bring with it exceding riche encrease, bothe of profitte and pleasure. The rather truely, bicause in order of his treatise, not intermedling with the particuler dewtie of any calling or estate he generallie concludeth of matter not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to all degrees. So that leauing the rawenes of thinfant and childishe yeres to the care and correction of their nourses and scholemasters, beginneth to shape his fyrste preceptes to the best aduauntage of that age which (as it is most disposed to the vanities of loue, so moste likelie to be abused &amp; misca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by thesame) may here in some part lerne to knowe and eschewe the tempting deceip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of that Boy she godde, and his blinde dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. From thence leadeth he vs into the darke storehouse of natures secretes, where with open eies perusing the weke condition of the world and worldely thinges, yea and of vs our selues, for whose sake they were principallie ordeined, maie remaine therof both more mindefull and thankefull to our

creatour. Lastely, he bringeth vs to the foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taines of good nurture, teaching not onely in priuate cases of our owne liues and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but in common welthe matters also, to geue suche verdict of thinges incident, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges the wise and sagest gouernors, shal make vs estemed not altogether ignoraunt or emptie of good vnderstanding.</p>
   <p>All which thinges, although it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen, maie by the lerned be picked out of the works of thold &amp; autentike Clarkes, yet for so much as falleth not to al men such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, as wherby to rake vp their so huge &amp; infinite volumes, it is to be hoped, the greatest number, those specially whose good spirite moueth rather to geue their leasured howres to some vertuouse exercise, then to ydle (and for the mooste parte dispraisable games) will with suche equitie vse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre this englishing of these brief collections, as of a labour louingly vndertaken, bothe for their delectable recreation of minde, and profytable helpe of studie, wherevnto bee wished vniuersallie moost happie successe, tyll for the further benefite of them that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the reading of the Scriptures, which
