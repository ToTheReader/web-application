      <l>THese pure immortall Streames, these holy Streynes,</l>
      <l>To flow in which, th'Eternall Wisedome deignes,</l>
      <l>Had first their sacred Spring, in Iuda's Plaines.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Borne in the East, their Soule of heavenly Race,</l>
      <l>They still preserve a more then Mortall Grace,</l>
      <l>Though through the Mortall Pens of Men they passe.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>For purest Organs ever were design'd</l>
      <l>To this high Worke, the most Etheriall Mind</l>
      <l>Was touch't, and did these holy Raptures finde.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <l>You Sir, who all these severall Springs have knowne,</l>
      <l>And have so large a Fountaine of your owne;</l>
      <l>Seeme Borne and Bred for what you now have done.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Plac'd by just Thoughts, above all worldly Care,</l>
      <l>Such as for Heaven it selfe a Roome prepare,</l>
      <l>Such as alreadie more then Earthly are.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Next you have knowne (besides all Arts) their Spring,</l>
      <l>The happie East; and ftom Iudea bring</l>
      <l>Part of that Power, with which her Ayres you Sing,</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Lastly, what is above all Reach of Praise,</l>
      <l>Above Reward, of any fading Bayes,</l>
      <l>No Muse like Yours did ever Language raise.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Devotion, Knowledge, Numbers, from your Pen</l>
      <l>Mixtly and sweetly flow; whilst listning Men</l>
      <l>Suspend their Cares, inamour'd of your Theme.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>They calme their Thoughts, and in their Bosoms own</l>
      <l>Better Desires, to them perhaps unknowne;</l>
      <l>Till by your Musicke to themselves brought Home.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Musicke, (the universall Language) sweyes</l>
      <l>In everie Minde; the World this Power obeyes,</l>
      <l>And Natures Selfe is charm'd by well-tun'd Layes.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>All disproportion'd, harsh, disorder'd Cares,</l>
      <l>Vnequall Thoughts, vaine Hopes, and low Despaires;</l>
      <l>Fly the soft Breath of these harmonious Ayres.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Here is that Harp, whose Charms uncharm'd the brest</l>
      <l>Of troubled Saul, and that unquiet Guest,</l>
      <l>With which his Passions travel'd, disposses'd.</l>
   </lg>
   <note place="margin">Iob. Psalmes. Ecclesiastes.</note>
   <lg>
      <l>Iob, moves Amazement, David moves our Teares;</l>
      <l>His Royall Sonne, a sad Apparell weares</l>
      <l>Of Language, and perswades to Pious Feares.</l>

      <pb facs="4"/>
      <l>The Passions of the First rise great and high,</l>
      <l>But Salomon a lesse concerned Eye</l>
      <l>Casting on all the world, flowes equally.</l>
   </lg>
   <note place="margin">Canticles not Printed.</note>
   <lg>
      <l>Not in that ardent course, as where He woes</l>
      <l>The Sacred Spouse, and her chast Love pursues,</l>
      <l>With brighter flames, and with a higher Muse.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>This Work had beene proportion'd to our Sight,</l>
      <l>Had you but knowne with some allay to Write,</l>
      <l>And not preserv'd your Authors Strength and Light.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But you so crush those Odors, so dispense</l>
      <l>Those rich perfumes, you make them too intense</l>
      <l>And such (alas) as too much please our Sense.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>We fitter are for sorrows, then such Love;</l>
      <l>
         <note place="margin">Lamentations</note>Iosiah falls, and by his fall doth move</l>
      <l>Teares from the people, Mourning from above.</l>

      <l>All Springs of griefe are opened to supply,</l>
      <l>Streames to the torrent of this Elegy.</l>

   <lg>
      <l>Others breake forth in everlasting Praise</l>
      <l>
         <note place="margin">The severall Hymns.</note>Having their wish, and wishing they might raise,</l>

   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>These are the Pictures, which your happy Art</l>
      <l>Gives us, and which so well you doe impart,</l>
      <l>As if these passions sprung in your owne Heart.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Others translate, but you the Beames collect</l>
      <l>Of your inspired Authors, and reflect</l>
      <l>Those heavenly Rai's with new and strong effect.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Yet humane Language only can restore,</l>
      <l>What humane Language had impair'd before,</l>
      <l>And when that once is done, can give no more.</l>
