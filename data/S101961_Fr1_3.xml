went from <hi>Graecia</hi> to <hi>Egypt</hi> for a like purpose. All these
trauelled to get wisdome and learning.</p>

   </p>
   <p>Amongst vs there haue beene (and are still) sundrie
Trauellers of great name, which haue enterprised and
taken in hand great Voyages, and dangerous iournies;
Some to <hi>Venice,</hi> some to <hi>Rome,</hi> some to <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
some to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> some to <hi>Syria,</hi> some to <hi>Persia,</hi> some to
the <hi>Turke,</hi> some to the <hi>Barbarians:</hi> And these haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled
vpon diuers respects: Some for pleasure, some for
profit, some to see their manners, some to learne their
languages, some to get experience, some to get wisdome
and knowledge; not sparing any cost, fearing any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
nor refusing any paines. Others would trauell, but
are loth to be at any charges. Others would bee at the
cost, but feare to expose themselues to dangers by Sea
and by Land. It is good (say they) to sleepe in a whole
skinne. They cannot abide to bee tossed and tumbled
like tennis-bals on the turbulent and tempestuous seas,
as <hi>Ouid</hi> in his exile complained he was, when hee said,
<hi>Eleg.</hi> 2.</p>

   <p>That is,</p>

      <l>What boisterous billowes now (O wretch!)</l>
      <l>Amidst the waues we spie,</l>
      <l>As I foorthwith should haue beene heau'd</l>
      <l>To touch the Azure skie?</l>
      <l>What vacant vallies be there set</l>
      <l>In swallowing Seas so wrought,</l>
      <l>As presently thou look'st I should</l>

   </q>
   <p>
      <hi>Aeneas</hi> was tossed with a like tempest, as <hi>Virgil</hi> finely
describeth it, <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 1. which place is well knowen to
all yoong scholars. And these fresh water souldiers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
themselues from trauell, and say, It was one of
the three things which <hi>Cato</hi> repented, to trauell by Sea
when hee might haue gone by Land: And a charge
that <hi>Antigonus</hi> gaue his sonnes (when they were tossed
with a tempest) <hi>Remember (my sonnes) and warne your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
of it, that they neuer hazard themselues vpon such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures.</hi>
For Sailers and Aduenturers (as one saith very
well) are neither amongst the liuing, nor amongst the
dead: they hang betweene both, ready to offer vp their
soules to euery flaw of wind and billow of water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they are assaulted, especially to euery stormy wind,
and huge sea. And it is more safe (say they) to stand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="4"/>
the shoare, and to see the raging of the waters from
the sea bankes, than to be tossed thereupon, and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
thereby.</p>
   <p>Wherefore (albeit I be no great traueller my selfe)
yet to set foorth the praise of the one, who haue beene
at the cost, hazarded the danger, and returned with cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;
and to helpe the pusillanimitie of others who feare
to vndertake the trauell in regard of the danger; and to
releeue the miserie of others, who are loth to bee at the
cost though they delight to heare and see strange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
people, and manners: I haue thought good to
publish the trauels of others, which lately (by good
chance) is come vnto my hands, after the death of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Bezaliell Biddulph</hi> a learned and religious gentleman,
to whom they were first written. In whose study (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his letters and loose papers) was found first of all
a Copy of a voyage to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by Land, from <hi>Aleppo</hi>
in <hi>Syria Comagena,</hi> not long since vndertaken and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by fiue Englishmen there soiourning, viz Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>William Biddulph</hi> (Preacher to the Company of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Merchants resident in <hi>Aleppo</hi>) Master <hi>Ieffrey Kirbie</hi>
Merchant, Master <hi>Edward Abbot</hi> Merchant, Master <hi>Iohn
Elkin</hi> gentleman, and <hi>Iasper Tyon</hi> Ieweller.</p>
   <p>This vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>age was well penned, and generally well li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of all that saw it, who craued copies thereof, by
which meanes at length it came to my hands: which I
thorowly perusing; and finding therein mention made
of former Letters, concerning other voyages by one of
these fiue trauellers formerly performed, directed to the
said Gentleman <hi>Bezaliel Biddulph:</hi> I could not satisfie my
selfe vntill (by the meanes of friends) I came to the sight
of the rest also, which were many in number, at least
<pb facs="4"/>
twenty letters, besides the voyage to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> all dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
vnto one man: Some by the Preacher aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
maister <hi>William Biddulph:</hi> and some by his brother
<hi>Peter Biddulph</hi> Lapidarie and Diamond cutter in those
Countries. Out of all which Letters I haue gathered the
matter therein contained, (leauing out onely some salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and priuate matters) and haue thought good (for
the helpe of Trauellers and delight of others) to make
one body of them, and (without the consent of either of
them) to put them in print. For the one of these two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
is yet beyond the Seas; the other (after ten yeeres
trauell) is lately arriued into England, and hath sundrie
times beene requested (by diuers of his good friends) to
publish his trauels, but he could neuer be perswaded so
to doe, but answered▪ that he knew how to spend his time
better, and that he was not ignorant of the incredulitie
of others in such cases, who wil hardly beleeue any thing
but that which they themselues haue seene; and when
they heare any thing that seemeth strange vnto them,
they reply, that trauellers may lie by authority: but they
are liers themselues which say so; for trauellers haue no
more authority to lie than others, neither will they arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
vnto themselues more liberty to lie than others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
being men that feare God, as they (of all others)
should be, who goe downe to the Sea in ships, and see
the workes of the Lord both by Sea and by Land, and
his wonders in the deepe.</p>
   <p>In regard whereof, hee hath beene so farre from prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his trauels, that he (being a very modest man) taketh
no delight to speake thereof, except it be vnto some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
friend. But for that old acquaintance which I
haue had with him (hauing beene his schollar) and that
<pb facs="5"/>
mutuall loue betwixt vs of long continuance; I was so
bold to make knowen vnto him, that I had seene all the
letters which both he and his brother <hi>Peter Biddulph</hi> had
written to their friend <hi>Bezaliel Biddulph,</hi> (wherein they
discoursed of all their trauels) and what paines I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to gather them together for mine owne delight, and
direction in my trauels, which I purposed shortly to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake.
Whereupon he requested mee to keepe them
secret to my selfe, which I told him I had done, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as I had read in one of his letters to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Bezaliel
Biddulph,</hi> the like request, which hee made vnto him in
these words: <hi>I pray you keepe my Letters to your selfe, lest
whiles to giue content vnto you in writing what you would, I
receiue discontent my selfe in hearing what I would not.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Heereby I found him very affable, and willing to
conferre with me of his trauels, and to giue me direction
for mine, and to resolue me in any thing I desired, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
my purpose of imprinting them, when (by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with him and other trauellers into those parts)
I had perfected them. Yet, forasmuch as a publike good
is to be preferred before a priuate, I could not but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
vnto others that which I my selfe had learned of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
For that which <hi>Persius</hi> speaketh interrogatiuely,
in this case I vnderstand positiuely:</p>
   <q>Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire hoc sciat alter:</q>
   <p>That is,</p>
   <q>
      <l>It is nothing for thee a good thing to know,</l>
      <l>Vnlesse thou impart it toothers also.</l>
   </q>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>
And who knoweth what good may redounde vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by reading of this discourse of other Countries?
For hereby all men may see how God hath blessed our
Countrie aboue others, and be stirred vp to thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
   <p>Hereby subiects may learne to loue, honour, and obey
their good and gratious King, when they shall reade of
the tyrannous gouernement of other Countries, and of
the mercifull gouernement of theirs.</p>
   <p>Heereby hearers may learne to loue and reuerence
their Pastors, and to thank God for the inestimable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the preaching of the word amongst them; when
they shall reade in what blindnesse and palpable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
other nations liue, not knowing the right hand
from the left in matters that concerne the kingdome of
Heauen, and yet reuerence and honour their blind guids
and superstitious Church-men like Angels, and prouide
for their maintenance roially.</p>
   <p>Heere wiues may learne to loue their husbands, when
they shal read in what slauery women liue in other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and in what awe and subiection to their husbands,
and what libertie and freedome they themselues enioy.</p>
   <p>Heereby seruants may bee taught to be faithfull and
dutifull to their Masters, when they shall read of the
brutish and barbarous immanitie in other Countries of
masters towards their seruants; who not only beat them
like dogs, but sell them at their pleasure, and sometimes
kill them for small offences.</p>
   <p>Heere rich men may learne to be thankefull to God,
not onely for their libertie and freedome of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and persons; but of their goods also: when they
shall read, how in other contries no man is master of his
<pb facs="6"/>
owne, but as the fattest oxe is neerest vnto the slaughter,
so the richest men are neerest vnto death.</p>
   <p>Here poore men may learne to be thankefull to God
for their benefactors, and not to be repining and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
beggers (as many of them are) when they shal read
how in other countries the poore liue like brute beastes,
on grasse and water, the rich hauing no more mercie on
them, then the rich glutton had of <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Heere they that trauell in England may learne what a
benefit it is to haue the refuge of Innes in their trauell,
and bee content to pay well for it, where they are well v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
wheras in other countries they lodge without dores
all night and carie their prouision with them.</p>
   <p>And the publishing hereof without the Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
may perhaps bee an inducement vnto him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
this discourse, by adding thereunto the diuersities
of Religions in those countries, and what conference and
disputation he hath had with Iewes, Iesuites, and people
of sundry other countries: and by perfiting any thing
which herein shall be thought imperfect.</p>
   <p>And yet I haue had conference with one of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and shewed his Letters vnto many other trauellers
of good iudgement, who haue beene in those parts, and
all of them subscribe vnto the trueth of euery thing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
contained. And of my selfe I haue set downe nothing
but what I either haue found in the Letters of these two
brethren (master <hi>William Biddulph,</hi> and <hi>Peter Biddulph</hi>)
or else (by conference with one of them and sundry other
trauellers of credit) heard spoken and deliuered for truth.</p>
   <p>Onely in two things (I confesse) I haue beene some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
bold with mine Authors. First, in the number of
their: letters for whereas they wrote very many letters,
<pb facs="6"/>
and his companions went thither onely as trauellers to
see the Holy Land.</p>
   <p>Againe, if it were his owne doing, he being both wise
and Religious (as hee is accounted) would neuer bee so
simple to publish his owne disgrace in Printe, in going
to Masse, and obseruing many other ceremonies as are
mentioned in that booke which goeth foorth vnder his
name.</p>
   <p>In the voiage of the fiue Englishmen from <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi>
(which is the last letter) I haue written only of their
trauels thither, and such things as they saw there, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their returne, for I could not meet with any let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wherein my Authour had written thereof, neither
could I learne it of him by conference with him, for
when I spake vnto him thereof, desiring him to set it
downe in writing for my further direction, I could haue
no other answere of him but this which <hi>Aeneas</hi> spake to
Queene <hi>Dido,</hi> as <hi>Vigil.</hi> setteth it downe <hi>Aeneid. lib.</hi> 2.</p>
   <q>Infandum regina iubes renouare dolorem.</q>
   <p>that is,</p>
   <q>
      <l>A dolefull worke me to renew</l>
      <l>(Deare friend) you craue, wherefore adew.</l>
   </q>
   <p>Whereby I perceiued he tooke no pleasure to talke of
it, and lesse to write of it. The reason, I vnderstood by
others; because it was more dangerous, troublesome,
and tedious to him then all the rest of his voiage: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
nights they slept in the open fields, when it rained all
night exceeding fast, and in the day time they were often
<pb facs="7"/>
dangered by theeues, and oftentimes in the night they
were glad to hire a guard to watch whiles they slept, for
feare lest their throats should be cut whiles they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe:
and many other miseries they were subiect vnto,
as hunger and thirst, heate in the day, cold (being har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borles)
in the night.</p>
   <p>And besides many miseries which hee hath indured
by land; he hath very narrowly escaped many extreame
dangers by Sea, whereof I will mention only one, which
I haue heard, not only from his owne mouth (with grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
memorie vnto God for his miraculous and vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
preseruation) but also from others who were in the
same danger with him. In relation whereof they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in one, that it was on this manner.</p>
   <p>Ann. Dom. 1605 Febr. 9. He, with some other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen,
viz. <hi>Sampson Newport,</hi> and his brother <hi>Edward
Newport, Edward Concke, Martin Kentish, William Welch,
Thomas Mania<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>d,</hi> and others: hauing occasion to trauell
from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Zante</hi> (for want of an English ship)
imbarked thēselues in a <hi>Raguzean</hi> ship which was bound
thither. Wherein they sailed safely, vntill they came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> or the 53. Iles in the Arches, where
they were a while becalmed ouer against <hi>Milo,</hi> where
they were minded to touch.</p>
   <p>But suddenly this calme was turned to a storme, which
speedily droue them out of the sight of <hi>Milo,</hi> and <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milo,</hi>
and so confounded the <hi>Raguzean</hi> Mariners (being
no skilfull Nauigators) that they knew not where they
were, (an vncomfortable case in such a dangerous place,
amongst so many Ilands so thicke together.) Before them
they sawe land in three places, yet none of them knew
whether it were the maine land, or some Iland, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="7"/>
were ignorant what course to take. The prouidence
of God so directed, that they passed so neere the Ile <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigotta,</hi>
as seldome or neuer any ship did, and not rush
vpon the rockes.</p>
   <p>When they were past this Iland, they were out of the
Arches or <hi>Cyclades,</hi> and had sea-roome inough, which
was some comfort.</p>
   <p>But the ignorance of the Mariners, The violence of
the storme, The weaknes of the ship, and the prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the company with whom he was shipped, were
great causes of discomfort.</p>
   <p>The Mariners were ignorant, not accustomed to saile
by compas or cunding of the ship, but by the eie and
view, and to be still in sight of land, The storme still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
more vehemently, and continued three daies and
three nights together; during which time, they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eate nor drinke, nor sleepe. The ship was weake and
halfe full of water, ready to be split in pieces with euery
blast of wind, or to bee deuoured by euery waue of the
Sea.</p>
   <p>The boat which the ship towed after her, was cut off,
and let goe at randome without hope of euer seeing it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
lest it should be full of water, and sinke, and draw
the ship also vnder water. The companie as they were
of diuers nations, so of diuers natures: and as they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in religion, so likewise in their conuersation and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
during the continuance of this tempest. For the
storme increased, the aire thundered, the winds bluste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the Sea raged, and the waues thereof arising like
mightie mountaines, tossed vp the ship (to vse the Poets
<hi>Hyperbole</hi>) sometimes as high as heauen, and by and by
tumbled her downe againe as low as hell; so that (as the
<pb facs="8"/>
Psalmist speaketh, Psal. 107. 27.) <hi>They were tossed to and
fro, and staggered like drunken men, and all their cunning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gone,</hi> euery man called vpon his god (like the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in <hi>Ionas</hi> ship.) The <hi>Raguzeans</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the gods and goddesses, the Hee Saints, and She
Saints, and cast <hi>Grand Benedicta</hi> into the sea, to asswage
the madnes therof. Which nothing preuailing, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the ship called master <hi>Samson Newport</hi> (an English
Merchant) and told him in Italian that hee vnderstood
that the Signior <hi>Reuerendo Dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ore Inglese:</hi> that is, That the
reuerend English Doctor (who was in his ship) had bin
at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and requested him to speake vnto him, if he
had any holy reliques in his chest which hee brought
from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to giue him some to throw into the Sea,
to pacifie the rage thereof. M. <hi>Newport</hi> made answer,
that he knew that their English Preacher had no such
Reliques as he desired.</p>
   <p>Then there was nothing amongst the superstitious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
but weeping and wringing of hands; some prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
boards ready to cast themselues into the Sea, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
at euery blast when the ship would bee disiointed
and shaken asunder: Others pattering on beads, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
large vowes to <hi>Madonna de Lauretta,</hi> if shee would
deliuer them; and to this Saint and that Saint, if they
escaped.</p>
   <p>The Master of the ship, called <hi>Andrea,</hi> and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Stephano,</hi> (being both owners of the ship) said, that
surely the English Doctor was a Coniurer, for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
saw him without a booke in his hand, but still read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
vntill (by his learning) he had raised a storme vpon
them; and thought it best to make a <hi>Ionas</hi> of him, and
to cast both him and his books into the Sea: which they
<pb facs="8"/>
had done indeed, if God (in mercy towards him) had
not preuented them; for our Englishmen (like good
Christians) hauing learned out of the Scriptures (Psal.
46. 1.) That <hi>God is a pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ent helpe in time of trouble,</hi> and hath
promised to deliuer them that call vpon him in time of
trouble, gaue themselues both iointly and seuerally to
praier, and all the time of this tempest <hi>cried vnto the Lord
in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distresse.
He turned the storme to calme, so that the waues thereof were
still.</hi> And so (at length) by the prouidence of God, they
came all safely to their desired Port, where they heard
of many ships (as some reported, fiftie) which were cast
away in that storme, out of which they were deliuered.
Many such desperate plunges hath he escaped in his ten
yeeres trauell, which I haue heard of, but forbeare (for
breuities sake) to speake of.</p>
   <p>These things considered, I thought it not meet to presse
him any further therewith, lest the remembrance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
miseries, should be a cause of fresh sorowes, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he hath indured much hardnesse both by sea and
by land, &amp; so much as may seeme admirable, yea, almost
incredible that such a spare leane man, and of such a
weake body (as he seemed to be of) should endure in ten
yeeres tedious trauell together. And yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his continuall dangers both by sea and by land, hee
hath continued still to preach the Gospel constantly and
boldly (in Heathen countries) both by sea and by land;
receiued great honour amongst them; and is now at
length (by the prouidence of God) returned into his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
countrie in health and safety to preach the Gospell
wheresoeuer it shall please God to call him: and is at this
<pb facs="9"/>
day the greatest traueller (of a man of his calling, that I
know) in all England both by sea and land.</p>
   <p>By land, he hath trauelled further then <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the
same way that <hi>Iacob</hi> did from <hi>Hebron</hi> to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi>
and hath had as hard lodging in his trauell as <hi>Iacob</hi> had,
viz. the ground to his bed, a stone for his pillow, the skie
for his couering, and sometimes the aire for his supper.</p>
   <p>By Sea, farther then S. <hi>Paul,</hi> then <hi>Aeneas,</hi> or <hi>Vlysses</hi>
haue done, and all the whole way that they all haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled,
and further.</p>
   <p>Wherefore (gentle Reader) if thou take in good part
these his trauels, and my paines and labour in collecting
them together, it may perhaps encourage him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
them, and me to procure them, and to adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
his conference and disputations with Iewes, Iesuits,
and sundry other nations (which I vnderstand hee hath
had with them) and such arguments as haue beene vsed
on both sides, &amp; letters in sundry languages which haue
beene written on both sides from one to another.</p>
   <p>In the meane time, I leaue him (with his foure fellow
trauellers) soiourning at the earthly Ierusalem; and thee
(gentle Reader) trauelling towards the heauenly <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi>
where God grant at length we may all ariue, IESVS
CHRIST being our Pilot and Ienisary to conduct vs
thereunto, AMEN.</p>
