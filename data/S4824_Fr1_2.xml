   <p>Attentiuely then obserue, the curious Theorie, which from him a Patterne may bee well extracted: For it rightlie teacheth what; and of whom is to bee craued aught, and earnestly besought; and when soe it; and how; then what is true felicity; then solid rules as to conseruation of such pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed dignitie.</p>
   <p>The Penitentialls of the Kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, as they are found by him penned, are by diuers iudged to be parcell difficult, nay each of them abstruse, and hidden. To other some, they make shew indeed, of being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

soe sublime mysteries are deliuered, and with such breuitie. Therefore for the better satisfying, and enlightning them to their end: They are heere by <hi>Paraphrase</hi> layed open both perspicuouslie, &amp; at large: which primarily was compiled, and divulged in the Italian tongue, by a Florentine as well literate, as elegant. I lately (to my power) haue made it English. The learned kinde of Commentators, often giue light vnto their Authors. Too frequently doe Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators eclipse diuerslie, the genuine meanings of what they wrote. For the most part at least, they are deficiēt in the rendring them, with a curious manner of expression, and eake lustre.</p>
   <p>I cannot but mise-giue: that I much faile therein. Reallie I misdoubt: that I am too farr out, not nigh alas, the grace, &amp; puritie of his stile soe worthie. Nay that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap> lesse that the taske is hard, for any one, though of what soeuer rare endowments, to giue an Author his embellishments. But I will hope that in the version of this Treatise into our owne speach, I haue rendred its true sense. For the rest; I assume confidence in your Honors connivence, at my defects in cloquence: since well its Knowne to me, and many more, that y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
