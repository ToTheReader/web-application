   <head>The Preface</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Lato</hi> the Prince of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers who for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent doctrine, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning many things agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was called <hi>diuinus,</hi> amōg many other his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts in Philosophie, giueth vs this lesson: <hi>Omnia amicorum sunt communia,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest friends all things are common. The which also in olde time was taken in custome of the auncient Christians, for I find it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Acts of the Aposcies: <hi>Nemo eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum qui nomina Christo dederunt, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam suum esse dicebat, sed erant illis omnia communia:</hi> None of those which were named Christians, did affirme any thing to be their owne, but all things were common amongst them. I therefore, desiring to bee esteemed among Christians, doe thinke it wil be a shamefull thing for me to hide any thing ielously to my selfe: yea, although it bee neuer so simple, wherein I might hope something to profite the common wealth, For it is euident that all men cannot offer golde, precious
<pb facs="4"/> stones, silke or purple, but there are also that doe gratifie &amp; shew a thing very thankefull, if they giue but a flower, or some thing of lesse value, for this cause therefore I haue thought it good (Christian Reader) to publish this my little booke, to the vse of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to beholde and marke Gods omnipotencie and goodnesse, of diuers tokens &amp; warninges, not only before time sent, but also diuers other tokens by these great coniunctions &amp; euents of the Planets is like to ensue. The considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, hath caused me for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, by writing to place before your eyes, such vndoubted signes of his comming (although I will not take vpon me to tell the very houre, day, and yere, which is knowen to God alone) that easily you will beleeue and persuade your selfe, that it will not bee long afore hee come. Perhaps there may be some maliu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lue moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king person yet aliue, whose only practise is scoffing and scorning: yea, whom nothing, be it neuer so well, can content, that will finde faulte with our doinges, by reason they haue drunke such a deepe draught of despight. I wil nothing at al be dismaid, for why should I? considering I haue written nothing, but that which is alreadie tried by the principles of
<pb facs="5"/> Astronomie, vnlesse perhaps there bee some <hi>Midas asininis auribus dignus,</hi> which doth iudge wrongfully of this notable science, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the vtter subuersion of the same. And here I shall desire the good Reader, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some man pricked with pride shoulde put in print some peeuishe peece of woorke in dispraise of Astronomie, thou wouldest giue no credite vnto his foolishe reasons, sith this Science hath heeretofore of the wisest and learnedest men ben honoured. And further thou mayest gather, that whosoeuer doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the contempt of any one sciēce, seemeth to be ignorant, not only of the same, but also of all good learning. For <hi>Cicero lib. 3. de ora.</hi> saith in this wise, <hi>Omnis ingenuarum &amp; humanarum artium doctrina vno quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam societatis vinculo continetur:</hi> That is to say, All Arts liberall and humane are coupled or linked together with one hande of societie. But Reader, I purpose not nowe to inueigh against those kinde of persons before spoken of, considering that it requireth more matter than can conueniently bee rehearsed in a short Prologue. Wherefore to conclude, thou shalt vnderstande that it is not the taunting toyes of skorners, nor the wresting
<pb facs="5"/> wittes of the arrogant, is able to blemish our arte, as all auncient monuments of Wryters: yea, &amp; the orders of the Planets themselues, (which for mans behoofe is the workmanship of God) doe manifesty proue. And thus I make an ende, praying thee to take the paynes to reade this Booke, and learne therby to amend thy former wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked lyfe. Farewell good Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
