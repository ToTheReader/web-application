   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLE Reader, I
haue layed open in this
treatise the operations or
effects of the subtill and
cruell dealings of a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
of whose manner and behauiour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
haue written heretofore, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the same to haue bene the cause of the
ouerthrow of kingdomes, states, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales
and families. But forasmuch as
they haue not made the application eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
some writing thereof according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Diuinitie, others according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of diuerse lawes, I haue taken oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to describe briefly and allegorically,
the historie of <hi>Saint George</hi> for expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
thereof: the rather, for that I do
find recorded by <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed
<pb facs="6"/>
author, that this Dragon is the
chiefest head and cause of rebellion and
variance in countries, and was therefore
altogether banished in the old time, when
least corruption of life appeared amongst
men. For he ouerthroweth the harmonie
of the strings of the good gouernment of a
common-wealth, by too much enriching
some, and by oppressing and impouerish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some others, bringing the instrument
out of tune: when as euery member of the
same should liue contented in his vocation
and execute his charge according to his
profession. For albeit, that equalitie wold
be the cause that euery man should haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
which made some of opinion that
goods ought to be common: yet forasmuch
as the same was neuer vsed or established
in any age, reason requireth, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the course of humane affaires, all
things should be gouerned in the best and
most assuredst maner that can be deuised,
and as it were, seeking a certaintie, euen in
vncertainties, which is tearmed Pollicie:
<pb facs="7"/>
For all worldly and transitorie things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mutable, maketh the world properly
to consist of strife, warre, discord, enuie,
rankor, burning, sacking, wasting, spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and destroying: a very vncertaine
ground to build vpon. And yet a certaine
equalitie and concord is required in euery
well gouerned commonwealth, the prince
or gouernor hauing the disposing both of
the one and the other. Equalitie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the trafficke and negotiation betwixt
his dominions and other countries in the
trade of merchandize: and Concord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the members of a commonwealth,
when euery member thereof doth liue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly
and proportionably in his vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Both these are brought to confusion
and vtter destruction by the means of this
Dragon, a monster found out by couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
the roote of all euill: whereunto Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
is annexed which mooueth sedition
and ciuill warre: when pride doth oppresse
loue, which prouoketh disdaine and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth
malice, confoundeth iustice, and at
<pb facs="7"/>
length subuerteth states: whereas huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
stirreth vp affection, augmenteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
maintaineth loue, supporteth equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and most soundly preserueth cities and
countries. This Dragon bringeth inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
in a commonwealth by the meanes of
his taile, wherein lyeth his greatest
strength, making the expences thereof to
surmount the reuenues. For he depriueth
the Prince (which is the father of this
great houshold) of his treasure and readie
money, which are <hi>Nerui bellorum,</hi> and
is the cause of many other inconueniences,
as both in this and in another treatise I
haue described vnto you. This he effecteth
by falsifying the valuation of mony, which
is the rule and measure of things, which
money he caused to be made vncertaine,
and as it were a merchandize, giuing
thereby a wonderfull ability to some of the
members of a commonwealth to oppresse
the other: whereby the concord is broken,
and men cannot liue in their vocation, by
that whereunto they were borne or bred.
<pb facs="8"/>
Hence do arise the causes that states-men,
or magistrates which haue the managing
of the gouernment of kingdomes, and are
the Phisitions of commonweales, are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times blamed and found fault withall,
for not lealing effectually the biles, bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ankers and sores thereof, albeit the
fault proceedeth not of any act or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of theirs, neither is the same properly
to be attributed vnto them, but vnto this
old venimous sore, being <hi>primum mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi>
and yet not spyed out: in the curing
whereof they would be thought to be very
foolish Phisitions, if by their medicine the
bodie were cast into a more dangerous sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Wherefore as the wounds of this
dragon are inueterated, so must he be dealt
withall by degrees and lenitie, depriuing
him first of the strength of his taile, which
will cause a great obstruction to his
breath, whereby his power shall so much
be weakened, as he may easily be brought
into a consumption: albeit that the polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike
gouernment of some states do admit
<pb facs="8"/>
him, as a necessarie euill, with the keeping
of a lombard to qualifie his extreame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
of the poore. This dragon is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Foenus politicum,</hi> his two wings are
<hi>Vsura palliata</hi> and <hi>Vsura explicata,</hi>
and his taile inconstant <hi>Cambium.</hi> The
virgin is the kings treasure: the champion
<hi>Saint George</hi> is the kings authoritie, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with the right armor of a Christian:
who with the sword of the spirit of Gods
most holy word, explained and corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with seuerall other lawes, signified by
the Pybal horse whereon he was mounted:
did destroy the cruell dragon, rescuing the
kings daughter, and deliuering the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
as by the circumstances of the
historie may appeare: the Allegorie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
requireth a due consideration, which
would dilate vnto another treatise. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leauing this to thy good acceptance
and friendly censure, I wish and pray that
all things may be well, although it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to haue perfection and soundnesse
of life in all men, and amongst all states.
<pb facs="9"/>
God graunt that all men may amend their
liues in euery vocation, and that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
may come hastily amongst vs, to the
comfort of his chosen people. Farewell,
<hi>London</hi> this 24. of May. 1601.</p>
