   <head>AN ADMONITION OF THE Author, to all Readers of this his histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: comprehending the Argument and contents thereof.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>Nowinge well by longe and daiely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased experience, the great and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous persecutions, which formerly haue beene raysed, and persecuted in England against consecrated Preists of the Romane Church, and professors of that Religion; and for nothing more, then holy priesthood, and the sacred sunctions thereof. And yet often hearinge all sorts of people, euen persecutors themselues, contestinge and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge out, they would willingly stand to the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, and bee arbitrated by diuine Authoritie, and reuerend antiquitie: I an vnworthie member of that holy order, a longe student in diuinitie, to which these are either parts, or haue a subordination, for my discharge of dutie to God, and his holy Church, comfort and strengtheninge those that bee in truth, and satisfying, or confounding such, as bee in error, haue taken in hand to write a briefe history of this subiect, beginning at the first originall of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, especially in this Kingdome of great Britaine, to which onely after my more generall Introduction,

and preface ended, to preuent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap> both in writer, and Readers, I will confine my selfe.</p>
   <p>And to winne the loue and likinge of all, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the dislike of any, I meane to follow that most frendly, and to all protestants, fauourable maner, and methode in writinge, insinuated in the Title of this worke, alwaies, or moste commonly to carry with mee, the allowance, and warrant of the best lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctors, and Antiquaries of their Religion. And yet for Catholicks, I trust none of them shall finde the least occasion of feare, that though I shal walke vpon so vnl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>uell ground, I will betray their moste iust, and holy cause: but rather adde a greater luster, and splendor of glory, then bringe any the least dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of honor vnto it. And make this matter so palpably manifest, by all Authorities, diuine, and humane, the scriptures both of the old and new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all kinde of expositors of them, friends or ennemies, that they which shall not acknowledge the vndoubted, and onely truth of the doctrine of the holy Catholike Church in these misteries, must needes bee said wilfully with malice to close their eyes against it.</p>
   <p>And though the lawe of Moises wherein the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets liued, and God spake by them, was but a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of thinges to come, and gaue but a darke sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, or glimeringe of the gratious brightnes, and shininge, which our blessed Sauiour, the true light of the world, reuealed vnto it, in the lawe of the ghospell: yet I shall in the very beginning as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to this holy historie, so inuincibly proue, by the
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
scripture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> old testament, by all original texts, hebrue or greeke, all Authors, the Rabines before Christ, the best learned Doctors of the primatiue Church of Christ, and protestants themselues, that the Messias promised and foretold by the Prophets, was to ordeine a new sacrificing priesthood, and that blessed sacrifice of his bodie, and blood which wee cōmonly name the sacrifice of the Masse and this was one of the most apparant distinctiue signes to know him by; so that whosoeuer denieth this, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently denieth Christ to bee the true Messias.</p>
   <p>And the more plainely to demonstrate this, when I come to the first plantinge of the faith of Christ, in this kingdome in the Apostles time, I will make manifest, by all testimonies, and antiquities, that Christ our blessed Sauiour and Messias accordingly to the prophesies of him did institute this sacrificing priesthood, and both celebrated, and ordeined the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Masse for his Church for euer. That all his Apostles were sacrificing massing preists, and offered that blessed sacrifice And that in this kingdome of Britanie in particular, as in the whole Christian world besides, in euery age, and hundred of yeares, from the first preachinge, and receiuing of Christian Religion here, in the Apostles time, in the first, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third, fourthe, fift, and six hundred yeares, of Christ, and so longe as the best learned protestants affirme, that holy primatiue Church remained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted, in the first receiued truthe, and integritie thereof.</p>
   <p>The same holy sacrificing priesthood, a continual
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
succession of sacrificinge massinge preists, and Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, and sacrifice of Masse euer continued here, in the same maner as they are now vsed and obserued in the present Romane Church, without any the least essentiall change, or difference. By reason whereof many cheife Articles in Religion now questioned, as the supernaturall change or transubstantiation of bread and wine into the blessed body, and blood of Christ, there offered a propitiatorie sacrifice for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; prayer to the blessed Virgin, S. Mary, &amp; other Saints, and Angels, prayer for the faithfull depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, merit of sacrifice, and good workes, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiencie of sole faith, and other principall things which protestants commonly disallow in Catholicke Religion, will bee thus proued, and deduced in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie age, in this our Britanie, euen with the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our best learned protestants, and such anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, as they approue, and cannot disallow. One most materiall point of the Popes power and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall prerogatiue in this nation, from the first em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracinge of Christian Religion in all ages, which I promised in my first parte, I vnderstand to bee effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually performed already. Therefore I shall sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie make mention thereof, in this history, except in some things, and places, where it shall bee needfull for the more perfect handlinge of the present subiect of this worke.</p>
   <p>And hereby it will sufficiently appeare, vnto all protestants, and persecutors of the holy Catholike Romane Church, that seeing the controuersie is, whether the Catholike, or protestant church is the
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>
true church of Christ, that by no possibilitie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant congregation can bee this true and holie church. For by their owne Articles of their Religion, to which all protestant Bishops and ministers haue sworne and subscribed. (Articl. of Engl. protest. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig. articul. <hi>19.) The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithfull men, in which the pure worde of God is preached, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bee duly ministred, according to Christs ordinance, in all those things that are requisite to the same.</hi> Which bee the verie wordes of their owne subscribed, and sworne Article of Religion.</p>
   <p>Therefore when they require three things to the true Church, true and lawfullie consecrated preists, and preachers, the pure word of God preached, and Sacraments duely ministred, and all these shall be found in the Roman Church in all ages from the first preaching of Christ, and not any one of them in the protestant parlamentary Church of England, or any such other, but a manifest opposition and persecution of those sacred preachers of the word, and ministers of the Sacraments, as of the word, and Sacraments themselues, so preached, and ministred, none of these can possibly bee the true Church of Christ, but a company of professed aduersaries and enemies vnto it: and that the onely true Church which they haue so vnchristianly persecuted the Catholike Romā church is that true and most holy church of Christ.</p>
