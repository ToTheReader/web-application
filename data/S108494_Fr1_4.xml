   <head>TO THE MOST EXCEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LENT, AND MOST GRACIOVSE QVENE MARIE, AND TO THE MOST noble king Iames her sonne, Quene and kyng of Scotland, his vndoubted Souereignes, Iohn Lesley, Byshop of Rosse wisheth all true felicitie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> FALL the most excellent guyftes and benefites, which God of his goodnesse hathe bestowed vpon mankynde, I knowe not whether there be any one, for profit, more fruitfull, or in estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more excellinge, than is the inclination among menne to mutuall loue and amitie. For suche is the force thereof in matters of greate importance, as the persone in whome it is once well establyshed can not be at any time, eyther by counseil seduced, by iniquitie of time imbased, by fortunes frowning disquyeted, nor by any violence shaken, muche lesse ouerthrowen or destroyed: In somuche as, I must nedes saye that, whosoeuer wanteh this guyft of nature: he is not onlye farre from all commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of constancie and wysedome in greate affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: but also putteth of all humanitie, and is become impious, wylde, and sauage. And this sense or feling of loue and amitie, although it be naturally planted in euery man and woman: yet is it most especiallye in them, that are by blood and kynred most neerly conioyned together. VVherfore, so often as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the tender loue of parents toward their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp; the pietie of children toward their parents: I
<pb facs="6"/>
alwayes acknowleige this naturall inclinatiō to loue and amitie (without whiche no common wealth can endure, nor any famylie stand) to be a speciall benefit of God, bestowed vpon mankynde. And so often also (most graciouse Princes) I fynde iust cause to moue me in the behalfes of your Maiesties, and of your subiectes, to reioyse, and to gyue God thankes, for that these lawes of nature and guyftes of grace in you by God singularlye planted, you haue reserued and kept whole and inuiolate, from the iniurie of the time, and from the malytiouse stinges of peruerse detractours: in suche sorte as, you could not, by any other occasion, haue gyuen a better testimonie of honorable courtesie and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: nor haue raised in the hartes of your subiectes a more assured hope of the best mean to preserue, yea and to enlarge also, and amplyfie your kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For to me, and to all your louinge subiects nothing can be more gratefull, than this firme and fast loue and agrement betwene you: nothing that ought to be more acceptable to your selues: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge more agreable to the generall wellfare of all men. Ernestlie therfore, and in the most deutifull manner that I can deuise, I humblie beseche your Maiesties, at no time to suffer the accustomed heat of your mutuall loue, in any one point, to coole: but that it take such deep holde, and daily encrease so muche within your graciouse brestes, as it neuer be extinguished, eyther by treason of false detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, by the cruell ficklenesse of fortune, or by any flagitiouse meanes that the malice of this world may procure. So vse the matter, as this louying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of your two hartes may be vnto you a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen wall: defend you this wall stoutlye, that double tongued Sycophantes may dreed it: let this woorke suche an effect in you, as all those be out of your
<pb n="6" facs="6"/>
fauoures whiche carie in their mouthe a flatteringe woord, and in their hand a cruell weapon: suche as pretend peace by woord, &amp; practise warre by deed: such as in peace vse deceit, and in warre outragiouse violence: and so by deceit kill mennes soules: and by violence destroye their bodyes.</p>
   <p>Now, as touching the exceding tender loue and zeale of mothers towardes their children: it is of suche force, as hath wrought very much profitt, not only to priuate families, but also to whole common wealthes, yea and to the greatest Empyres. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpō arose the honorable fame of Eurydice of Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia, for that being a banished woman in Illyria, &amp; well stroken in aige, she applyed her mynde wholy to learnyng: to the ende she might better instruct her owne children. But, (to come somewhat nearer to your Maiestie, my deare Soueraigne ladye) if the care of this woman ouer her children, and of all other mothers whosouer, be compared whith your woonted singular loue towardes your sonne: so muche further shall you exceede them all, as it hath bene harder in this yron age, constantlye to holde that course of vertueouse loue, which your Grace, with continuall care, and great fortitude, hath kept and performed towardes his Maiestie. But how ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull you haue bene for his safetie (beinge your only sonne, well beseemyng such a mother as your selfe, and right woorthie to be your best beloued) your motherly affection hath bene declared many wayes in your owne persone: As your great instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, &amp; earnest trauaill in commendinge hym to the tuition of such as were thought most faithfull, hath giuen good proofe thereof. Euen so when those horrible broyles were begonne in your Countrie, all thinges by seditiouse tumultes ouerturned, and the face of your common wealthe with the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
<pb facs="7"/>
thereof (by violent expulsion of a laufull authoritye, and by iniuriouse intrusion of others) transeformed and deformed: then (alas) what fear and dreed possessed your tendre hart, what anguishe and vexation your carefull mynde endured for his sake, that is to you most deare: all the worlde may easely iudge: and they best of all, that knowe what it is to be a mother of an infant, beinge vnder the warde of his mortall enemyes. But with what faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diligēce your Grace dealt for his safetie, aswell with the nobilitie, as with those whiche had the custodye of hym, (not by letters onlye but by messengers also: and by great rewardes aswell as by other gentle intreatye) I my selfe, am a present witnesse, and (as I think) no man eyther can better testifie, or ought more plainly to manifest the same. For, at that tyme I was by your Maiesties appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made priuie to all those matters: and in the execution of my commission they passed throughe my handes: yea I haue oftentymes with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion &amp; pitie beholden your Grace shedde abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of deuout teares, kneeling vpon your knees in deuout prayer to God for his wellfare. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde, when the matter came to this issue, that you might haue bene deliuered vpon certeyn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: you preferred the honour of your sonne, and the aduauncement of his Royall dignitie befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re all worldly thinges, and (as I may well saye) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your owne lyfe: In so muche as euen then you dyd most constantly affirme, that you wolde neuer gyue your consent to any thinge that myght be hurtfull, or preiudiciall vnto hym: albeyt you had bene oftentimes solicited, and sore vrged to the contrary: An honorable sayeng (truely) well besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng your motherlye pietie, and Royall descent: and a speciall good proofe of your singular good
<pb n="7" facs="7"/>
will towardes your sonne.</p>
   <p>And as to your maiestie (most noble kynge, of whom the worlde conceyueth so great hope, and whose iudgement surmounteth your age) when you shall well wegh these and many other greate argumentes of this your mothers naturall loue and pure good will (wherof you should haue bene ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertysed long before this time, by most trusty mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers and many letters, if oportunitie had serued) you shall finde good cause to saye to your selfe:
<q>
         <l>Doeth neyther Mothers loue, nor vertue of thy kynde</l>
         <l>Force thy desire to treade her steppes aright,</l>
         <l>To bear lyke loue, lyke faith, lyke pietie in mynde,</l>
         <l>And trust her best aboue eache mortall vvyght?</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>But at the least, considering your selfe to be so infortunately bereft of so good a mother, you may applie vnto your selfe (as a dolefull Swannes song) that distiche whiche Homer verie fitlie vseth in the persone of Thelemachus bewaling the losse of his brother, as a great calamitie, in this sorte.</p>
   <q>
      <l>And me poore youth hathe Ioue so left alone,</l>
      <l>That of my stocke there novve remaines but one?</l>
   </q>
   <p>Yea more occasion you haue thus to complayn than Thelemachus had: For the nearer in bloode a mannes mother is than a brother, somuche dearer ought she to be vnto hym.</p>
   <p>Therfore (to thende you maye more reddelye performe such offices as are expected in you) pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with your selfe (I humblie beseche you) beside her pietie and naturall kyndenesse towardes you, what mightie kyngdomes, what ample Regions, what populous prouinces may by right of successiō fall vnto you from her only, and vnder her title, if God graunt you that happie longe lyfe whiche we dailye praye for. And to make a playne demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof (omitting to speake of your right to the
<pb facs="8"/>
Croune of Scotland, whereof no man at home or abrode putteth any doubt at all) I thought it mete (and that not without good cause) to sett downe in writing what maye (without cause of offence, iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and laufully) be hoped touching your right and interest to some other kyngdomes and prouinces.</p>
   <p>Now therfore, because some men perchaunce (bothe forrayners and inhabitantes of the same Countries) are kept in suspense and dowbt what to thynke touchinge the succession of so great domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, &amp; to the ende that none may be Ignorant of the right, title, &amp; interest, which your noble mother before all others, and your selfe, her Graces onlye sonne, and heyr, (after her) hathe to the inheritance and succession of the Croune of England: and of all the dominions thereunto annexed or belonginge, vpon the decease of the now Quene thereof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out laufull yssue of her bodie: I present vnto your two Maiesties this Treatise: wherein is sett downe the state of the whole cause, and the right, Title, due order, course, and processe of that succession, with a playn confutation of all those obiections whiche your aduersaries pretend to the contrarie. And this trauaille longe agoe whiles I was Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour in England I dyd willynglye take in hand: aswell, thereby to wynne the good willes of many vnto you, as for the honour and generall commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of your Countrie: VVherein at that time I had muche conference with some of the most expert and skillfullest Iudges &amp; best practized counseilers towardes the lawes of that land: and after many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses and muche debatinge, I clearly sifted owt their opinions, and Iudgementes, touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And not longe after vpon mature deliberation: whē I had well reuolued these thinges in my mind: I thought it euery waye agreable to my deutie tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde
<pb n="8" facs="8"/>
your Maiesties &amp; your Countrie, to contriue in some litle volume what I had learned in so longe tyme: being also hereunto induced by the persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of diuerse Christian Princes: whome, after my departure out of England, coming to visit them, I had made acquainted with this matter: whiche they were glad to hear, and for their better instruction desirous to be infourmed therof at more length by writing. VVherevpon, first to satisfie the honorable meanynge of those noble personages, I compiled and published a Treatise of this matter in latin. And now further to accomplishe my deutie in defence of your Royall Dignities, and to setle the myndes of the wauering communaltie, and for the generall commoditie of all suche as haue any interest in this matter, I haue sett forthe this Treatise in English. And I verilye hope (suche is your princelie good meanyng, my most vndoubted Soueraignes) that you will accept in good parte this my trauaile, as a testimonie of my duetifull good will, reuerence, &amp; seruice to your Maiesties: and that you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue my intention and aduise to this attempte, as (in your iudgement) agreable to the weight of so great a cause: and allowe thereof, for the manyfold commodities that therehence may arise.</p>
   <p>Now then, as a right and laufull combination of manye Regions by iust title of succession be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longyng to you, most manifestlie argueth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth a Regall Soueraigntie, deriued vnto you by many famouse kynges, your Maiesties Aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors: so doeth the same require and exact of you an vnion and coniunction of mindes, and a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the vertue and religion of your forefathers. For nothinge can be more agreable with the name and title of a king, and with the honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noume of so noble a successiō, as so fortunatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth
<pb facs="9"/>
from suche a mother to suche a sonne, than that with suche an vndoubted title &amp; right to rule a kyngdome, there be annexed an vniforme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in sincere Religion. To whiche ende, as the mother hitherto most religiouslie foloweinge the vertue, faith, and pietie of her noble progenitoures hathe euermore showed suche constancie, as that Sexe scarsely beareth: so the yong kyng her sonne in succession goeng with her, must diligently fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resee, that in a sincere profession of one selfe same Catholik religion, he be not behynd her: but that, as he hath truely imitated all her other vertues, wherein she woonderfully excelleth her own selfe: so he resemble her in true faith and in vniformitie of the Catholique Religion. And thus the mother can haue no occasion offered her to remitt any part of her true loue, and affection towardes her sonne: but by daily encrease of naturall affectiōs betwene them, she will so answer hym in courteouse kynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: as, thoughe she be forestalled of his presence, yet shall she enioye great comfort of hym in his absence: in so muche as, all the world at home and abrode shall admire and wonder at their laudable emulation in offices of naturall zeale and pietie: Yea, thus it will fall out, that your own people (moued by your example) will induce one an other to peace and amitie: and freely of their own accorde, without any contention, will offer vppe vnto you, suche kyngdomes, regions, &amp; prouinces, as are, or shalbe due vnto you by right: and desire nothinge more than to be vnder the dominion of them, whome they see in one mynde, faythe, and religion, with good lawes and true Iustice mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their common wealthe. VVhiche kyngdomes and the Subiectes thereof, God the kynge of all kynges which ruleth the hartes of all Princes graunt
<pb n="9" facs="9"/>
you grace well to gouerne, to the glorye of his, holy name, to the propagation of his holy churche, and to the maintenance of common peace and tranquillitie. Amen.</p>
