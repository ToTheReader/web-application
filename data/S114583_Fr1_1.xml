      <salute>Noble Sir,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>Nowing a good CONSCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENCE to be euery honorable, &amp; (indeed) euery honest mans Saint and Mistresse (in both which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, I assure my selfe you haue a large &amp; plentiful interest) I haue ventured here to present to such mens viewes in generall, a poore and rough draught of her perfection; and in speciall, to you as one, to whom it shall be no disgrace, that I account you amongst her principall seruants: which beleefe in your affection, and deuotion to her, draws me to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in your inclination to pardon, and withall to accept this (in truth vnskilfull) picture that here I send you, though it bee as far from the life, as earth is from heauen. I shall happily bee censured for not selecting othermore specious seruants, &amp; fauourites of hers, which boast and make a face of great attēpts and endeuours, and employments of their valour, &amp;
<pb facs="3"/>integrity, in the full maintenance and preseruation of her noble and God-like temper, and in aduancing of her deserued honour and reputation: but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I haue euer found (in that weake discouery, which my feeble vnderstanding could make of men) those which excell in brauery, and number of wordes and profession, to fall short in deedes and execution, and on the contrary, least proserers, best performers.</p>
   <p>And therefore as notwithstanding the want of glorious &amp; flourishing Protestations (cōmonly faltring in performance) and maugre the spight and diuelish deuises of your enemies (in whom it is a hard questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether their malice or follie be greater) seeking to auile and minish your hearts faithfulnesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity: I yet do firmely credit the vnfained respect you beare to that heauenly Mistresse of yours: so I despaire not of faire interpretation and acceptance at your hands of this her purtraiture: though (as I told you) done so ruggedly. The pouerty of which offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, I haue no means to relieue, but by praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God long to continue your health and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rtey; to blesse both your outward and inward estate: and that therein you may dayly indeed manifest your selfe, to be what I fully beleeue you are; namely, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruer and a patrone to a good conscience. So with the signification of that duty and seruice, which I am iustly tyed to tender both you and your worthy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Lady, I remaine</p>
