      <hi>Many haue done vertuously, but you surmount them all,</hi> in your great perfection of Arts, and happy progresse in Grace, the world can number but few such. <hi>Vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ne violem frontem tuā, sedem honoris, testem verecundiae:</hi> I know the sound of the trumpet of your praises is no musick to your eares, neyther doe I loue such straines: the land in generall ecchoes your renowned applause, and God who hath so blessed you, and by the Kings Maiesty promoted you to so honourable a Place, continue you an happy instrument of much good to Church and Common-wealth, and prosper your noble proceedings according to the promise of your admired entrance.
