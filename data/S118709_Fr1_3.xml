      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN truce on <hi>Death</hi> thy pow'rfull Art had prest,</l>
   <l>And Hels grim Ferriman had forc't to rest:</l>
   <l>Thy rest, learn'd Holland, was, from pitchy night</l>
   <l>And darknesse damn'd to bring to publike light</l>
   <l>Knowledge of Times and States; which antique Rolles</l>
   <l>Had veyld and wrapt in Greeke and Latine scrolles.</l>
   <l>Hence hath our Language Natures mysteries;</l>
   <l>Moralls, Domestique, foreine Histories:</l>
   <l>
      <hi>England</hi> knowes <hi>England.</hi> For the thanke is thine</l>
   <l>
      <hi>That</hi> Pliny, Livy, Plutarch; Marcelline,</l>
   <l>Suetonius, Camdens Britaine, Xenophon,</l>
   <l>Speake English, now can stand alone.</l>
   <l>But though thy skill o're Lethe and Styx have power,</l>
   <l>Can save, what Death and Time would else devoure:</l>
   <l>Yet can it not escape that blatant Beast</l>
   <l>Which at the heeles dogges vertue; whose chiefe feast</l>
   <l>Is gall of base Detraction; which barkes</l>
   <l>That Learning earst engross'd by languag'd Clarks,</l>
   <l>Entaild on Gownes, by the Translatours pen</l>
   <l>Is now made common to meere Englishmen.</l>
   <l>And why should Spanish, French and other Nations,</l>
   <l>Rather than wee, make use of such Translations?</l>
   <l>Why should not Courtiers reade what Courtiers write?</l>
   <l>And Souldiours know what Souldiours doe recite?</l>
   <l>Besides, that Authours oft are rectifi'd</l>
   <l>In the translating, and their wants suppli'd.</l>
   <l>I wish in Arts as Story we might save</l>
   <l>Labour and time for language: wee should have</l>
   <l>Sooner and sounder Science, fill our mind</l>
   <l>With things, not words, eat fruit, not gnaw the rind.</l>
   <l>Live long, grave Sir, and write, write thus: so shall</l>
   <l>The publique profit grow th' Ingrossers fall,</l>
   <l>Greeke spight, and Latine envy, breake their gall.</l>
