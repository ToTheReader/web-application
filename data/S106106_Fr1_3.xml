         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Parable: is properlie one thing,</l>
      <l>That of an other doth conceiuing bring.</l>
      <l>Yea: (oftentims (as parables are scand,</l>
      <l>One score of things: by one, be vnderstand.</l>
      <l>Eche one of all: scanned and vsed well,</l>
      <l>Maie teache the scanner good: to take &amp; tel.</l>
      <l>Contrarilie: scanned and vsed ill,</l>
      <l>Like il likewise, the fruite a mounteth vntill.</l>
      <l>Wherfore, before entrance to scanning here:</l>
      <l>In present parable here to appere,</l>
      <l>First to induct (for to conduct) the waie:</l>
      <l>How readers and scanners: redilie maie:</l>
      <l>Right scanning (in right reading) here purchase,</l>
      <l>Good readers: reade and scan (rightlie) this case.</l>
      <l>There chaunst at once: at one fayre glasse to bee,</l>
      <l>Them selues tatire at once, fayre women three.</l>
      <l>Where one an other enuide: till all were drest,</l>
      <l>Who might (when all weare drest) seme dressed best.</l>
      <l>But in the time of trimming of their geare:</l>
      <l>There foreheads striking vp: broyding their heare:</l>
      <l>Lacing and laying it: with euerie thing:</l>
      <l>Lookte in the glasse: directing trim trimming,</l>
      <l>In all this time: these women euerychone,</l>
      <l>Behelde eche other: but them selues not one:</l>
      <l>That in the glasse: vpon her selfe cast iye,</l>
      <l>Good or ill tiring (in her selfe) tespie.</l>
      <l>One heare ley low: one other lay to hie:</l>
      <l>On this side: or on that side: cleane awrie.</l>
      <l>But herevpon: when eche had other espide:</l>
      <l>In tire atired: all a wrie or wide,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="3"/>
Lord in all three: what inward sport there was,</l>
      <l>Eche one to se an other, in that glas.</l>
      <l>All three sore sweld: but be it best or wurst:</l>
      <l>Twayne must vent vpward streight: or both must burst,</l>
      <l>While margret went a side: her pins to fet,</l>
      <l>Marian and margerie: back they both get.</l>
      <l>To touch thatire, of margaret thus worne.</l>
      <l>Betwene them twaine, to laugh that third to scorne.</l>
      <l>Marion saide to Margerie: se you not,</l>
      <l>How Meg is drest, yes Madge (quoth she) god wot.</l>
      <l>Might not a beetill blind beast: bring to passe:</l>
      <l>To dresse her selfe as well at any glasse,</l>
      <l>Yes madge: and with one Iin: I can now se:</l>
      <l>What spots (vnsene to her) in her face be.</l>
      <l>Ye Mall (quoth Madge) I thinke I should il hie me:</l>
      <l>To dresse my selfe so ill: the glasse so nie me,</l>
      <l>God hath done his part: she hath a good face,</l>
      <l>Which gift of God, her selfe doth ill disgrace,</l>
      <l>Marion at this: stepping fro margerie,</l>
      <l>Margret to Margerie: stepth by and bie.</l>
      <l>And streight of Marion: margret falth in hand:</l>
      <l>How fer from frame: Marions a tyre both stand.</l>
      <l>Madge and Meg finding faute: at marion more,</l>
      <l>Then Madge and Marion: found at Meg before.</l>
      <l>The thirde corse was: that madge did start a side:</l>
      <l>Whearwith Marion to Meg: hastelie hide.</l>
      <l>And Margeries atyre: they set a broche,</l>
      <l>As yll (or woorse (the worle her to reproche,)</l>
      <l>Then she was tierde in deede. Thus all these three:</l>
      <l>Deuided thrise in twaine, did thrise agree:</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="3"/>
Eche twayne, the thirde to mocke and geste vpone:</l>
      <l>Tyll euerie one, had mocked euerichone.</l>
      <l>Eche mocking others faute: they fautie all,</l>
      <l>Eche mockers mocke, most on her selfe did fall.</l>
      <l>This done, one of these three to the glasse went:</l>
      <l>No face but hers, then being represent.</l>
      <l>Where: when she did her selfe onlie behold,</l>
      <l>Her silent sight: her fore follie so told:</l>
      <l>That marking first her selfe, her selfe she a tierde.</l>
      <l>And then the rest, (in theyr atyre) desierde,</l>
      <l>That eche vpon her selfe: wolde set sure iye,</l>
      <l>Ere she cast iye on other, low or hie.</l>
      <l>They doing so: all weare atired so,</l>
      <l>That whether a part, or they together go:</l>
      <l>Had they bene willing: they had bene vnable,</l>
      <l>Sparke or spek to spie: discommendable:</l>
      <l>Ech in others atire. Which women and glasse,</l>
      <l>Are a glasse, this booke, and readers to compasse,</l>
      <l>In scanning sence to towch men in this booke:</l>
      <l>As glasse lookers lookte: if booke readers looke:</l>
      <l>He vpon him: and he on him: to scan:</l>
      <l>Sence most and best, naie most and worst thei can:</l>
      <l>Scanning who is the spider: who the flie:</l>
      <l>Neither of either: to him selfe taplie:</l>
      <l>Scanning no whit: by scanning here to se:</l>
      <l>In case spiders: in case flies: all scand maie be,</l>
      <l>Glasse looking: and booke reading: in such wise,</l>
      <l>May well be scand, one lyke vaine exersise.</l>
      <l>Who that this parable doth thus define,</l>
      <l>This parable thus, is his and not mine,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="4"/>
To this, this one thing I must mind you to minde.</l>
      <l>Concerning spiders, flies, and eke thants kinde.</l>
      <l>Wheare I: their naturall operacion:</l>
      <l>With the largest enlarge: tenlarge foundacion:</l>
      <l>Wheron I frame this top storie: here to see,</l>
      <l>As both: both in length and breadth: maie most agree,</l>
      <l>This (for this cause) strecht the more long and wide,</l>
      <l>I praie you beare with me: wheare it is spide.</l>
      <l>Wherin: my faut maie seme sumwhat the lesse,</l>
      <l>That wiser men then I (in like processe,)</l>
      <l>Haue done the like and late: one wise and olde:</l>
      <l>In an old booke did reade (as he me told,)</l>
      <l>That when so euer spiders, flies, and ants speake,</l>
      <l>Their approprid properties, they likewise breake.</l>
      <l>Which if them selues do: ye will graunt I hope:</l>
      <l>That I (doing it for them) may haue like scope.</l>
      <l>Thus wishing wishinglie: in reading this,</l>
      <l>Readers: to reade and scan: all sentencis:</l>
      <l>As we first marke and mend our selues: and then,</l>
      <l>To marke: to mend: the fautes of other men:</l>
      <l>Without more scanning here: I now herein,</l>
      <l>End circumstaunce, the substaunce to begin.</l>
