   <head>THE AVTHORS EPISTLE DEDICATO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the King of SPAINE.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>Sir,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He cause why the Ancients by fire signifie Loue, is, for that this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the hardest to be hid: For the more a man seekes to couer it, the more it discouers it selfe, and blabbs the place, where it is. Of this quality is Loue, and truly participateth of the nature of fire. I came (saith our Sauiour Christ) to put fire into the world. And the holy Ghost, which is the true God of Loue, came and shewed it selfe in the shape and figure of fire. So that Loue is a kinde of extraordinary actiue fire. Nor can it, wheresoeuer it be, be hid, or idle. <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur magna, si est,</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Gregory) si autem non operatur, amor non est.</hi> Loue will be alwayes in action, alwayes in working; it worketh by benefits; it
<pb facs="6"/>
worketh by good workes, and by friendly offices, and charitable seruices: And when it cannot worke what it would, or when the subiect whereon it would worke, hath no need thereof, it supplyeth that defect with good desires, and words. God, who needeth not the seruice of any, contents himselfe with this in those that are his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, accepting (when they can no more) the will, for the deed. And the Kings, which here vpon earth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent his person, doe not require tribute and seruice, saue onely in that, which euery one is able to giue. That which J am able to affoord, and doe here offer vnto your Maiestie, forced thereunto by the loue of my seruice, (howbeit my desire hath euermore had a larger extent) is onely a parcell of words; which if they proceed from the soule, and come truly and sincerely from the heart, are of some worth and estimation, and perhaps (vpon occasion) may proue likewise profitable and aduantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Howsoeuer, it may serue at least to expresse that my seruice and deuotion, which euer hath beene, is, and shall be ready prest to serue your Maiestie. And I am willing to shew it in this little, that <hi>I</hi> may not wholly seeme vnprofitable. And therefore with this affection of Loue, sutable to my subiect, ouercomming those feares which are wont (and not without reason) to withhold those that treate with great Kings, Princes, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narckes, and write of such and the like subiects, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to aduertise them, and in this paper to propone
<pb facs="6"/>
vnto them, that which I finde written of those that are past and gone, (and seemeth very fit and conuenient for the conseruation and augmentation of the authority and greatnesse of those that are now liuing and present a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs) and will with all possible breuity, procure a full resolution and distinction herein: And (as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith) <hi>Totum comprehendere sub exiguo;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Sen. epist. <hi>84.</hi> in princip.</note> To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise much vnder a little. For, as that is the better sort of money, which in the matter is the lesser, but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in value; so likewise that Learning is the best, which is briefe in words, and large in sentences. It is <hi>Maximus</hi> his counsell, that <hi>Multa, &amp; magna,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Valer. Max.</note>
      <hi>breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sunt dicenda.</hi> Matters that are many and great, are briefly to be deliuered. For this breuities sake therefore, as also for the greatnesse of your Maiesties employments, and the great burthen of so many weighty businesses that lye vpon you, I will not here interpose any large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses and long disputations, wherewith to entertaine and spend the time: but briefe, certaine, and generall Doctrines, such as are of most profit, comprehend most subiects, and may be applyed to particular, both persons and things, all taken out of the Politicks, the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and men that are Statists, and no way contrary to the Law of God, and Christian Religion: As likewise out of ancient Philosophers, and wise men, both Lawyers and Law-makers. Accompanied wholly for to giue credit to the cause, and that the subiect may
<pb facs="7"/>
not be disesteemed as an egge of mine owne hatching) with the examples of Kings and Emperours, (if the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Kings may moue Kings) and with those which cannot but moue, bee esteemed, and beleeued, being drawne out of the holy Scripture. Which being well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and put in execution by Kings, they shall obtaine that end for which they were intended; To wit, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and preserue their Kingdomes in peace and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
   <p>Reade it therefore, <hi>I</hi> beseech your Maiestie, and take it to heart; for it is a piece of worke that is directed to the seruice of Kings, of their Fauourites and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. And let them not say, that they are Metaphysicall, and impracticable things, or, in a manner, meere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities, but rather, that they are very conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our possibilitie, and practised by our Predecessors, Princes of famous memory, for their wisedome and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and in Kingdomes and Common-wealths, of great Concernment, Artifice, and Policie, in matter of Gouernement, and reason of State. And viewing those with these times, and that which then was, with that which now is, it will appeare vnto vs, that your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Princes doe not come much behinde their good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours: And that which is good, stands alwayes in a way or degree of ablenesse to become better: and that which is not so, may be bettered in the end. Time is a great proficient, it attaineth to all, and can doe all. And
<pb facs="7"/>
your Maiestie (whom God preserue) may likewise in time doe the like, if you will really and resolutely affect the same; and that you will be pleased to put in execution, what in these Aduertisements shall seeme good in your eyes. And seeme they, or not seeme they good vnto you, sure I am, that my desire, in these, in the rest, and in all, shall indeuour to hit the marke whereat it aymeth. God direct it as I desire. For mine owne part, J rest well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with my paines, and hold my selfe well paid for my labour, in hauing put them into your Maiesties hands. And that you shall vouchsafe to dwell a little vpon them. For matters of State, Justice, and Gouernment, and of things of this high nature, is a King-craft, and a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or science that deserues your care and discourse. Let others doe as they lift; particular men may follow their particular pleasures and delights. But this well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth Kings.</p>
   <p>The Argument of this Booke, is the Head of Mans body; beginning at the vnderstanding, till we come to the last of the senses. For therein, and thence they haue the <hi>principium</hi> or beginning of their operations. And as in mans body, so in the mysticall body of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, Kings are the Head, to whom Regiment &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment belongs; and what choyce they are to make of those who are to assist them therein; the qualities which they ought to haue, and how they should carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues towards them. How they shall come to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
<pb facs="8"/>
the humours, affections, mindes, and dispositions of their Ministers. And in a word, how they ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue themselues in all, and with all.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>I</hi> search not into the secret closet of any mans bosome, nor touch vpon any particular person, it being the least part of my intent and purpose. I treate onely in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and manifest vnto all, that what I write, being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and true, and grounded vpon principles and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine causes, may serue to reforme, amend, and correct, and (if neede bee) alter those fashions and customes they finde to bee amisse. This I am bold to vtter vnto your Maiestie, and dedicate the same with that securitie and confidence, which mine owne knowledge doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and prompt vnto mee; being not ignorant, that I talke and discourse with mine owne proper King and Lord, whom I humbly beseech, that hee will bee pleased, out of his great prudence and naturall pietie, to runne all this ouer with his eye, and to cast his cloake ouer my faults. And though (no doubt) his Maiestie may meete with some, yet my minde telleth me, that he may likewise light vpon something in this Treatise, that may be of some profit for the seruice of his Maiestie, and for the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of that authoritie and greatnesse of place (which he so iustly possesseth, and for the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. For, there is not that Booke saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) so vnprofitable, whence some good may not bee gathered. And though this (in supposall, or it's owne nature) may
<pb facs="8"/>
be small, and of little or no price, yet is it of no lesse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and royall a condition, to receiue a little louingly, and with a gratious acceptance, then to giue much liberally. All this your Maiestie doth with all, and I assure my selfe you will likewise doe the like with me. For the naturall Loue which I beare vnto your Maiestie, meriteth no lesse, nor the minde wherewithall J doe it. And herewith I shall in some sort satisfie my desire (which is to hit the marke I ayme at) and that obligation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I was borne to serue you, whom I shall neuer wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly offend. And euermore, in all my prayers, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, I shall humbly on my knees beseech the Almighty God, to preserue your Maiestie, to giue you many, and those most happie yeares, and that hee will conserue you in his diuine grace, and humane Greatnesse, with much augmentation of Estate, both Temporall and Eternall. Amen.</p>
