   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T IS commonly seene (Christian Reader) that cunning men are daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and that the boldest are the blindest oftētimes: and it is to bee lamented that this curiositie should so bee founde in Christianitie, and that any professours of the Gospell should be deintie to do good. Alas it is but little we can do, when we haue done all, and our life it self is not very long:<note place="margin">Iob. 14.</note> whyle we haue time therefore let vs be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. vers. 8.</note> for Satan neuer sleepeth nor ceaseth destroying. VVe are all in debt to Christes Church, and are bounde to buylde accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Talent. Let euery man set too his helping hande then, and let Christes cause neuer be hindered for mans credite. Let vs rather consider the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and expresse our loue by feeding. Tongues that are silent in speaking, should argue hands diligent in writing, especially in a Minister: but when both are ydle, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="3"/>
all is euill, and that Minister but an Idol before the Lorde. The wise debter vnable to pay all, vseth policie in trifling presents, and findes good ease thereby. Owe we all vnto the Lorde? and shall we bring nothing to his Church? I must needes confesse that I haue bin tardy, and lingred in this fault too long my selfe, but fearing the rashnesse of them that come to soone, I see the daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous lapse, or lashe of them that come too late, and happie is that seruant, whom when his Maister commeth he shall finde dooing. Surely I had denied many petitions, beeing priuie to many infirmities of mine owne, but looke what the forwardnesse of my friende coulde not doe, and that hath the frowardnesse of certayne brought to passe, and I trust all for the best: only I mark this for my learning, that what I denied to doe voluntarily, I am made nowe by an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in a maner to doe violently: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hinder Gods purpose. VVherfore I craue pardon of them, whose instant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests I did incessantly denie, but chiefly of God, whose church is wronged if any thing
<pb facs="3"/>
that may profite hi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> be at any time concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. To auoyde which fault, at the last I am resolued, and be<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ing persuaded that the playner is the better, for the most part, I haue vsed no curiousnesse in the matter, for it can not be so simple, but if it be sounde withall, it shall profite the faythfull reader. The worst fault I finde, is of the most part, who can be content to let all Sermons slip, and scarcely buy one: or if some buy them, to let them sleepe in their houses, who were as good let thē alone, for so they lose both their money, and that precious pearle which no money can buy agayne. The benefite of writing deserueth more diligēce in reading, especially of good things: but the thousands of Pamphlets &amp; toyes are caught vp quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; deuoured in hast, though they shal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be disgested into any good substaunce, I feare, they are so full fraught with poyson. It were happie that they were all buried in darknes, or burned in the light, which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster matter to Fansies schole, or Pleasures pallace, but nothing vnto the church of god. Redeeme the time, for the dayes are euill.<note place="margin">Eph. 5. ver. 16.</note>
      <pb facs="4"/>
Let this be a warning to you that feare God, to let goe suche Bookes, and to haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with them, the worlde is full of them. Emptie you your houses in the name of God, and let not your youth once finger them, for they are the bane of youth. and learne to play the Bee, not onely to flye and see the floure, but to sucke also: the worde of God is sweeter than hony, or the hony combe. <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. <hi>vers.</hi> 10.</p>
   <p>Beeing diuersly called at this time, I am fayne to prefixe no other preface than the very same whiche I vsed at the Crosse, and that worde for worde, as both my Sermons are, excepting in my latter I haue kept back certayne things, which I thought not so cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient or necessarie to divulgate, bicause they concerned the persons then and there more particularly. God encrease thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and with knowledge fayth, and with fayth zeale, that thou mayst growe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and righteous to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Iesu Christ. Amen.</p>
