   <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>EXperience hath taught me (gentle Reader) that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry daungerous in this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some age to cōmitt any thyng to Printe for thy behoofe. So farreforth hath that frettyng cāker of carping curiosity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed: So busily pryeth in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Printers shoppe that way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward churle <hi>Zoilus</hi>: So diuers and variable are the wittes and dispositions of our age, readyer to breake downe open roades thorough other mens hedges, then to stoppe neuer so little a gappe with any frythe of their owne. To such be it aunswered, that the greatest barkers be not commonly the best byters: and it falleth out for the more parte, that such bytesheepe curres smell of the cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, when the gentle houndes feede of the croomes. And so I leaue them to them selues, whose sinister Iudgement as I litle regarde, so I groape not after their prayse. Onely my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is to profitt the vnlettered English men: Emongest whom the gentle natured will interprete the best, and findyng ought amisse, will with courtesie rather correct (I trust) then with carpyng condemne the course of my labours, for whose onely behoofe and benefitt I aduentured vpon this translation, and published the same in Printe. Some bytternesse of speache will now and then occurre, which at the first blushe may happely breede some offence. But if we call to remembraunce the sharpenes of speach, vttered by kyng Dauid, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Paule, and by all the holy ones them selues almost, in their feruencie of zeale, agaynst the Enemies of God, and aduersaries
<pb facs="3"/>
of the Crosse of Christ, this offence will be lesse offensiue in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the opposed aduersary, whose mouth ruffleth and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ouer euery where, with more then Ruffianlike and rascal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like tearmes agaynst our most dread Souereigne, agaynst her highnesse Nobilitie, agaynst her subiectes, and the whole state of her most gracious Gouernemēt, to the vtter defacing of the Gospell of Grace: which no true harted Englishman can endure to Read without greeuous anguishe of mynde. This licentious lauishenesse of rayling tounge sithence outraged so monstruous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was conuenient to be mette withal with some libertie of free speache: That so the gentle Prelate, beyng otherwise squeymishe to heare shrewde wordes, might hereafter learne to wryte more modestly, and more beseemyng his Pastorall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and functiō, and geaue lesse occasion of iust reproche. The rest I commende to thy gentle consideration, requiryng none other guerdon at thy handes for my trauaile, then thy frendly acceptaunce, and some spare of thyne idle tyme, to be employed in perusing for thy better instruction. So shalt thou encourage me (as knowledge shall increase and oportunitie serue) to acquaynte the with the fruites of the rest of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Which I shall hereafter vndertake by the conduct of Gods holy Spirite: who enlighten thyne hart with spirituall vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, to the glory of his name, and the establishement of thy Fayth, Farewell.</p>
