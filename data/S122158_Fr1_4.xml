   <p>TO auoyde (Gentle reader) the yearly care, trauailes, and peines of other, with the confusions, repugnāces, and manifold errors, partly by negligence, &amp; ofte through ignorāce, cōmitted: I haue agayn breefly set forth a Prognostication general, for euer to take effect: adioining thereto diuers profitable collectiōs, &amp; many pleasāt cōclusiōs, easy of all willing ingenious to be perceyued Here note (Reder) wher as the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Pole, &amp; Meridian should be considered: in this work it is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for London: bycause I wiss he this Meridian, Situation, or Clime the exact truthe of thinges. If any yearly practises in lyke maters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not with my calculatiōs: be assured, they are false, or at the least for other Eleuatiōs, or Meridians supputated, and therefor litle seruing thy purpose. And that the late rude inuētiōs, and grosse deuises of some (this yeare, and two yeares past, published) might be of them perceued, then filed, and so serue to some profit: I haue purposed euen now to put forth a boke named Panauges, well seruing their turne, and so generally and most exactly all Europe, pleasant, profitable to the learned, and no small delight to all maner mē. An other boke is also redy to come to thy handes, titled Tectonicon, a treasure vnto the Masons, Carpenters, and Landmeaters: correcting their olde errors, wrōgfully rekened of them as infallible groundes: teaching faythfully, sufficiently, and very brefely, the true mēsuration of all maner land, tymbre, stone, bourde, glasse, &amp;c: and at the ende cōteining an Instrumēt Geometrical, appointed to their vse-Take in good worth these labors (Louing reader) and loke shortly for the pleasant frutes Mathematical, euē such as haue ben promysed by my frendes, and partly by me. Neither shall my desire to profit here stay: but entendeth farther to procede, yf these seme accepted As the good wil of Printers not had, hath kept the foresayd from you: so I trust the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde and excellēcie of Thomas Gemini, shal bring them shortly vnto you. Certes my hope is, while life remaineth, not to be vnfruteful to this commune wealth, with study, and practise.</p>
