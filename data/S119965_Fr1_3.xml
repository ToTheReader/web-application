With other things pleasant and profitable for the weale publick, not heretofore extant in our vulgar: partly collected out of foreigne moderne writers, and partlie inuented and practised by the author.

      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Longitude (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) for which this present Treatise was chiefly compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) is defined to be the shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test distance that can possibly be taken vpon the Globe of the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two <hi>Meridians</hi> propounded, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to reckon the same (from west to East) at the Meridian of the <hi>Iland Coruo,</hi> which our latest writers for diuers good reasons account for the first Meridian: To find the longitude, is by some meanes to search how many degrees the Meridian of the place, where you make obseruatiō, is distant from some one Meridian giuen. The knowledge whereof being so necessary as that the <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers</hi> and <hi>Nauigators</hi> cannot with exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse performe what (in their Arts) necessity requireth, without the same: Therefore haue many worthy men taken great paynes, and with al ingeniousnes labored to supply that defect, with the most exquisite meanes they could deuise for the readiest finding therof; who haue set downe many Propositions to
<pb facs="4"/>that effect, and both learnedly and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously left vnto posteritie such tokens of their loue to the publique good, as may iustly challenge to merit infinite memorie and commendation. As <hi>Ptolome,</hi> by the time of an Eclipse in two seuerall places beeing knowne, to find the longitude. <hi>Appian,</hi> the true places of the <hi>Moone</hi> and a fixed Starre being giuen, to find the Longitude. Others by the Angle, that a fixed Star maketh at the moment of time shee entreth into the first minute of <hi>Cancer</hi> or <hi>Capricornus,</hi> and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of tyme wherein such an angle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, to find the Longitude. Some with portable watches, the true hower of sundry places beeing giuen, to find the Longitude. The tyme beeing giuen, and the way of the Ship, to find the Longitude. The poynt of the Compasse &amp; the way of the ship giuē, to find the longitude. The Latitude, and the way the ship maketh, to find the Longitude, &amp;c. All which are found to be subiected vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to inauoydable errors, or els clogged with such difficulties, or want of expedient exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; as that they cannot absolutely bee
<pb facs="5"/>concluded for perfect apt meanes to finde the Longitude at Sea: the want of which, is the greatest imperfection in the Art of Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiō. Take here in good part (friendly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) these few propositions, not heretofore written in this our vulgar, cōtaining partly collections which from sundry Authors in other Languages I haue sought out, and augmented or abreuiated for thy better vse; and partly practised obseruations, which (time &amp; opportunity permitting) my selfe haue experienced both on Sea &amp; Land. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing, that with the friendly eye of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, thou wouldest consider them well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou divulge any vnaduised censure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: Not doubting but euery one that shall deign a due perusing hereof may find som thing worthy his bestowed labor. And so, graying excuse if I seem to omit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny necessary poynt in the premisses (which I might soon do, in regard I much striued to auoid prolixity) doe heartily wish thee thy lawfull desire, and my selfe present to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound any thing that seemes herin difficil; referring my labor to your curteous fauors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
