         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ARCVS</hi> the Romane Emperor; whom it is easier to admire in silence then to praise, it being altogether impossible to equall his merits with any expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of words. For from his youth ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving betaken himselfe to a compozed, and setled course of life, hoe was never seene to alter his countenance, through either feare or pleasure. Hee most approved the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> not only in their order and discipline of life, but also in their course and method of learning. He therefore from his younger yeares, became so famous and illustrious, that <hi>Adrianus</hi> intended of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to settle the Empire upon him: but having after a more legall way first setled it upon <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> hee never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse reserved the succession of it unto <hi>Marcus.</hi> He thought good also by marriage to ally him unto <hi>Anton. Pius,</hi> that so by succession of blood also he might come to the Empire. As for <hi>Marcus,</hi> he still continued in the same private course of life, and in the like subjection as other Romans did, and was in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing altered by this adoption, and new affinity. And when he was come to the Empire, and had the absolute power in his hands, he was never knowne to doe any thing insolently, but as in matters of bounty he was alwaies most free, and exuberant; so in his government, he was no lesse meeke and moderate.</p>
