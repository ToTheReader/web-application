      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Adam,</hi> as euer since my first cōming to Westminster, I haue liberally tasted of your Honourable bounty; so now your daily charity vnto mee, hath made my life so much more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Many, who haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued great and speciall fauours done by your Honour for their good, haue confessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues bound in all thankfulnesse of duty and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice as debtors vnto you: Amongst the which, my selfe (most deeply ingaged) haue thought it meete to shew some token of this my duty and thankfulnesse to your Ladyship: (And that is this booke, an vnworthy present) which I beseech you
<pb facs="3"/>to accept of, as you shall bee pleased to iudge of the matter, not of the bringer.</p>

   <p>Of which number my selfe being one (though the most vnworthy of all men) hauing receiued this sacred bill, my text, as a receit for grace, which I haue applied vnto this Congregation:</p>
   <p>And now by experience, finding it <hi>probatum,</hi> part of the best physicke that can be ministred to such an vngracious world (as this wherein wee liue,) I haue therefore committed the same vnto the Presse, for the publike benefit (so farre as may be) of Gods holy Church, and doe commend the same vnto your Honourable protection. For which I shall euer acknowledge my selfe bound, to remaine</p>
