   <head>TO THE RIGHT
VVORSHIPFVLL, SIR
EDWARD BARRET, Knight.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, I haue often wished, that some oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
might be offered vnto me, to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that louing and honorable respect
which I haue euer born vnto you. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no other, I gladly embraced this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
occasion of publishing this Sermon, concerning Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination,
which I long since preached, and of late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiewed.
For seeing diuers conferences which I had at
your house, concerning this, and some other like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
first of all occasioned me to think of the reuiewing,
and then of publishing thereof: I was desirous to offer
the fruits of that labour, as a testimonie of my louing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
vnto you. And your vnfained loue to Gods
truth, and that religious affection, which from your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
Progenitors, as an hereditarie blessing, is des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
vnto you, doe perswade, yea, euen assure me, that
<pb facs="3"/>
you will accept this not so much as a pledge of mine, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
of the loue of God vnto you. For that right and interest
which your selfe, and euery one of Gods children haue in
Gods Election, makes delightfull, yea, sweetneth vnto
them; as euery doctrine of Gods Word, so this especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
wherein is contained the chiefest treasures of their
spirituall comfort. In the handling whereof, I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured,
according to that measure of knowledge
which God hath vouchsafed vnto mee, to satisfie the
mindes of the godly, and cleerely remoue those principall
doubts, and cauils, which occasion some maliciously to
carpe; others, in the weakenesse of their vnderstanding,
to stumble and take offence at this holy doctrine. What I
haue performed in this so weighty and obscure an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I willingly submit to the iudgement of Gods
Church and children, not doubting but the same God,
who put these meditations into my heart, will accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
the same with his owne blessing vnto the hearts of
many of his children, and seruants. In which confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
together with my hearty desire to God, that hee
will continue and multiply his blessings vpon you,
I remaine</p>
