   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>IKE AS THE</hi> Sonn of God
vouchsafed to come downe
from heauen to earth, and to
make himselfe man for the wel-fare
and life of man, according to that
the selfe same word incarnate<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 10. b Gal. 4. a.</note> saith;
<hi>I am come that men may haue life, and that
they may haue it plentilully:</hi> euen so, for the
conseruation of this life of grace, and
spiritual consolation of man, one of
the thinges that maie moste chieflie
helpe him herein, is the often medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
of the life of the saide worde
incarnate <hi>Iesus Christe</hi> our Sauiour, and
the imitation of his most meruailous
<pb facs="5"/>
examples; sith, the celestial Father
hauing geuen him to the world for a
<note n="a" place="margin">Luc. 2. c. Ioh. 1. a. 3. c 8. b. 12. f Act. 13. g</note> light, for a guide, and for a Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master
and teacher of men; and the
Sonne him-selfe assuring vs, that<note n="b" place="margin">1. Ioh. 1. a. 2. b. Ioh. 13. b 1. Petr. 2. d</note> al,
whatsoeuer he did, was done to geue
vs an example, that we should do the
same; what should such doo, as could
not enioy his vifible presence here in
earth? how should they be illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
guided, and instructed of him, if
they had not this remedie of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
of his moste holye life? by
means wherof, he euen at this day il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminateth,
guideth, and teacheth vs,
as though he were present, with that
he earst did (wandring corporally in
this world) speake, worke, endure, and
teache.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>IT BEHOVETH</hi> therfore, that this
meditatiō serue vs as a mirror, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
by eftsons looking &amp; taking view,
we may with the eies of our soule see
that, which with the eyes of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb n="2" facs="5"/>
we neither could nor can see; and
according to it direct and frame our
life, sith<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">

and seruant of Iesus Christ, <hi>ought
to walke as he hath walked.</hi> As if he had
saide: Who-soeuer saith, that he is a
member of Iesus Christ, must be low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 11. d</note> and meeke, as Iesus Christ was;
must contemne al delightes, honours,
and woorshipp of this worlde, as he
did, seeking in al things the only glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of God,<note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 7. c 8. g</note> &amp; not regarding in any
thing his owne peculier estimation;
he must loue frendes and<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 5. g.</note> foes, doo

him,<note n="f" place="margin">Luc. 6. d 1. Pet. 2. d.</note> bear it patiently; desire rather
to serue others, thē to be<note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 20. d</note> serued him
self. To be short, he must so loue his
neighbour,<note n="h" place="margin">Mar. 10. g</note> as if need require at any
time, he be ready to lose his life for
his welfare and saluation.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
Howe is it then possible for a true
Christian to doo these and so manie
mo things as be necessarie to be done,
to imitate Iesus Christ a-right, but if
he knowe that Iesus Christ him-selfe
did first practise and doo them moste
exactly? and howe shal he wot them,
but by eftsons meditating his life, &amp;
the liuely &amp; perfect examples, which
of such like workes he left vs? and
howe may a man learne the lessons
of charitie, patience, pouertie, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and of al other vertues, but if he
knowe the life of the Lorde of al
vertues? and therfore, as saith glorious
S. Bernard:<note n="a" place="margin">Ber. sub finē serm. 22. in Can.</note> In vaine trauaileth he
to attain vertues, that hopeth by anie
other meanes then by the Lord of al
<note n="b" place="margin">Ps. 23. b. 79. 83. 88.</note> vertues to attain them; whose doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
is a nurcerie of prudence; his
mercie a worke of Iustice; his life a
mirrour of temperance; his death a
liuely paterne of prowes. Thou seest,
Reader, by this holye Doctour his
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
wordes, confirmed by the testimonie
of so manie other famous men, howe
necessary the continual meditation
of Christes most holie life is, to the
obteining of such vertues as be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for al those that couet to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of the true and euerlasting life.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, besides this so great a
profite, which proceedeth necessarily
out of this moste laudable exercise,
weigh wel, good Christian Reader,
what other fruites, graces, and store of
spiritual treasure doo associate this
holy meditation. Tel me, I pray thee,
what thing more sweeter, and of gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
consolation may any man desire,
that hath not wholly lost his taste,
then to meditate, discourse, and think
vpon the wordes, workes, examples,
and life of our Sauiour Iesus Christe?
Of whom we finde<note n="a" place="margin">Sap. 8. d.</note> written, <hi>That his
conuersation was without al sournes, and his
companie had no encombrance, but ioy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation:</hi>
What time maye we deeme
<pb facs="7"/>
better spent, then that which is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied
in such profitable meditation?
what exercise can there be more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
or acceptable to Christe,
then this, wherin the soule is busied,
in performing Mary Magdalen that
most woorthy penitent her function
&amp; office, who<note n="a" place="margin">Luc. 10. g Aug. 1. de Trinit. init ca. 10. to. 3.</note> chused the best part,
in sitting her downe at our Lordes
feete, and listning to his wordes. The
like did our Souerain Lady the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
virgin Mary,<note n="b" place="margin">Luc. 2. g</note> marking wel, and
reuoluing the same wordes in her
heart: What thing may ther be more
valable to gain mercy, grace, and the
familiaritie of Iesus Christe? what
more soueraine remedie to come by
litle and litle to the contemplation of
his infinite maiestie, then is attentiue
and serious meditation? Seing the
same our Lorde assureth vs him-selfe
therof,<note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 10. b</note> saying: <hi>If anye enter in by me
he shal-be saued, and shal finde most sweete fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</hi>
In fine, what thing may ther be
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>
more easie or more pleasant for al
sortes of people, then is this holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation?
sith in meditating the life
of Christe, we must needes meditate
withal the life of his blessed mother,
as also cal the Apostles and other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
Saintes to minde, that liued and
conuersed with him: yea, al the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Angels too, who greatly delight
in this kinde of exercise, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
no doubt, but fauour greatly al
those that vse it. In such wise, as if
thou wert not to receaue any other
guerdon, nor to reap any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
by this so holy an exercise,
yet ought this onely thing to allure,
yea, constraine thee, to frequent and
practise it; to wit, the pleasure and
sweetnes which thy soule shal feele,
in contemplating so holy a life, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
his so absolute and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
workes, in beholding with the
eyes of thy soule so beautful<note n="a" place="margin">Ps. 44. a Sap. 13. a Bern. initio Ser. 2. de Epiph.</note> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
a Lord aboue al the sonnes of
men.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="8"/>
What thing can be more sweete,
then to consider his most holy beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours?
howe humble he was in his
conuersation; howe affable in his
wordes; howe milde in his answeres;
howe feruent in his preaching; how
seuere in reprehending vice; howe
zealous in procuring diuine honour;
howe patient in putting vp iniuries;
how diligent in seeking the sauegard
of soules; howe ful of compassion, in
bewailing others annoyes; how cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in receauing sinners; how mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
in pardoning offenders; how li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral,
in graunting that which was
required him; howe mightie in his
miracles; howe modest in his going;
howe temperate in his eating; howe
great a louer of pouertie; how prone
to paines; how frequent in watching
and praying; how gratious and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
towardes al men: he despised
none, although a sinner; he shunned
none, were he sick or a lepre; he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="5" facs="8"/>
not the riche, ne draue the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
out of his companie; he fledd al
worldly honours, and was not careful
for temporal treasure; he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to al; and to<note n="a" place="margin">Sic Paul 1. Cor. 2. d.</note> win al, conuersed
with al. Briefly, he was so delectable,
so sweete, and so amiable, as it is not
possible to finde, wish, ne yet ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
a more gratious, exact, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
life then his was. What is he
therfore that wil-be so senselesse, and
of so corrupt a taste, as wil not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
therwith, and feele a singuler
sweetnes in meditating of this so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
a life?</p>
   <p>Neuerthelesse, thinke not, that in
saying, that the meditation of Christ
his life is of so great importance, I
meane to exclude his passion and
death, neither yet his Resnrrectiō and
Ascension; sith vnder this worde of
life, al these misteries are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and out of thē al oughtest thou
to gather, as it were, a pretie posie, to
<pb facs="9"/>
beare alwaies about thee in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
like to that of mirrhe, which
the Spouse<note n="a" place="margin">Can. 1. d</note> said in the Cantikes, she

Bernard saide, howe he had gathered
such a one, out of al the distresses and
annoyances our Lorde had in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie,
the paines he abidd in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
the toiles he endured in his
voiages, the temptations he surmoū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in fasting, the teares he shedd in
praying; and to say al at once, out of
al the iniuries, outrages, scornes, spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges,
blows, nailes, with al the other
tormentes; and amongst so manye
branches of this most sweet-smelling
mirrhe, he saith, how he left not that
out of the soure drinke which was
geuen him on the Roode, nor yet that
wherwith he was anointed in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.
By which wordes this holy
Saint declareth, howe in meditating
our Sauiours life, al these thinges are
to be considered.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="6" facs="9"/>
Howbeit, forasmuch as it is not
long agone, that being commaunded
by my superiors, I made a smal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
that was published abroade, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the matter of the Passiō, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
were certaine instructions and
aduertisementes geuen, both of the
principal pointes therof, and in what
maner they were to be meditated;
mine intent was in this Treatise (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in like maner commaunded me)
to haue principally intreated of such
other misteries of this most holy life,
as had not beene spoken of in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Treatise. Notwithstanding, whē
I afterwardes had perceaued, how to
write al that might be gathered
out of the holy Gospels touching the
life, preaching, and miracles of our
Lord, would be a veri long thing, and
require a iust volume, I determined
with my selfe to write onely vpō the
misteries of the Rosarie of the moste
blessed virgin Mary; sithens, besides
<pb facs="10"/>
is so godly, renowned, and approued,
a deuotiō as is abouesaid in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue;
therein, in my fancie, are the
chief points of the life of Christ cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined,
frō the time of his incarnatiō,
vntil the sending downe of the holy
Ghost; in-somuch as, who-soeuer he
be that shal meditate these wel, may
assure him-selfe to haue meditated
the greater and more principal part
of his most sacred life.</p>
   <p>This is the thing therfore, my dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
beloued brother, which I here
present vnto thee; to wit, the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the misteries of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide
Rosarie, whereof eche one, (as
was done in the other meditations of
the Passion) is distinguished into
three pointes, as-wel for the perfectiō <note n="a" place="margin">Aug. ca. 16 lib. 2. de doct. Chris. to. 3. &amp; li. 2. q. euan. cap. 6. to. 4 &amp; in psal. 6. tom. 8</note>
and deuotion of this number, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that eche one may meditate them
more amply, and with lesse confusiō.</p>
   <p>But because the pointes which I
noted in the other meditations of the
<pb n="7" facs="10"/>
sacred Passion were no whitt ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and dilated, but onely a bare text
set downe of the matters that were
to be meditated vpon (the which was
done, supposing that eche one would
them-selues, according to their deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
haue dilated and amplified the
same) vnderstanding since, that if
some doo make this discourse and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latatiō,
yet, al for lack of capacitie doo
it not; for this cause haue I done mine
indeuour in this booke, to content
both th'one and th'other; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
my selfe, as S. Paule<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 1. b.</note> saith,
to be indebted both to the learned
and the ignorāt. For the lerned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I haue thought good, after a text
wise, first to set downe that which
they maye meditate vpon in euerye
misterie, leauing eche one to pause
therein, and to dilate the same, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their capacitie and deuotion:
nowe for the ignorant, that knowe
not howe to doo this, without some
<pb facs="11"/>
further helpe, I haue shewed thē the
maner, how to interteine thē-selues,
and to discourse vpon eche point,
which soeuer they may thinke good
to meditate vpon; out of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of amplification they may gather
these commodities folowing.</p>
   <p>1. First, they shal better vnderstand
the historye of that point, whereon
they purpose to meditate.</p>
   <p>2. They maye conceaue the docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or example, which some-times
is intermedled for their iustruction.</p>
   <p>3. They maye learne, howe other-whiles
to aske our Sauiour suche
thinges, as the point whereon they
meditate, may most fitly minister oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casiō
of; other-whiles to yeeld thanks
for such graces and mercies as they
maye be put in minde to haue beene
done vnto them, and to this purpose
may they apply the vocal prayer set
downe at the end of euery misterye.</p>
   <p>4. They maye with the reading of
<pb n="8" facs="11"/>
these amplifications, helpe thē-selues
to auoide the distractions and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of minde, which other-whiles,
yea, eftsons, happeth in time of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>
   <p>5. The Apostrophes and familier
speeches which I haue nowe and thē
intermedled in this methode and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
of dilatation, may serue to excite
and kindle deuotion, being weake or
wāting, as happeth many times to be.</p>
   <p>6. After they haue read more then
once the foresaid maner of amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vpon eche point, they shal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
them-selues so sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
as that of them-selues they
may eyther altogether, or in part, be
able to amplifie such articles as they
are minded to meditate vpon; and
when they found nothing suggested
of their owne brayne and peculier
deuotion, yet maye the readinge of
these points that are here propoūded
thē, with their amplificatiōs wel and
<pb facs="12"/>
leisurly considered, serue for a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
meditation, whiles nothing els
were graunted them. And of these,
and such like fruites which the
simple sort may suck and gather out
of the fore-saide amplifications, the
learned may in like wise helpe them
selues ther-withal at some times, whē
best shal like them; so that, as-wel to
th'one as th'other they shal not be
vnprofitable.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, this maner of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
and entertaining a mans
selfe vpon euerie article, may serue
for al sortes of people; for who so
mindeth to discourse vpō al the three
pointes of the misterie, whereon he
meditateth, wel may he so doo; and
who fancied not to pause in eche
point so long time, may make choise
of that point that shalt best like him;
seruing his turne, if he thinke good,
with the meditating of one onely
point, and the amplification therof,
<pb n="9" facs="12"/>
if he list; which he may right easilye
finde out, seing euerye point is so
plainly distinguished a-part, as one
hangeth not of an-other, but ech one
is absolute in his owne conclusion. I
thinke it good besides, to aduertise
thee in this place, that the instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which I haue geuen thee in the
6. 8. and 11. Chapters of, The exercise
of a Christian life; as also those adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that I set thee downe in the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
I wrote of the meditation of the
Passion, at the ende of the instructiō,
may greatly helpe thee to the better
meditating of these misteries; al the
which documentes I here omitt for
breuitie sake, referring thee onely to

   <p>Finally, I thinke it meete to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
thee, that for-somuch as in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Rosarie it is ordeined
that tenn <hi>Aue Maries</hi> and one <hi>Pater nos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
be recited vppon euery misterie,
<pb facs="13"/>
these maye be saide in three sundrye
maners. The first is, to recite them
before thou enter into thy meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The second is, to say them in the
very time of meditation. The third
is, to saye them after a man hath fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
his meditation. And this last
way is, in mine opinion, the best, sith
the soule doth commonly after me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
finde it self more supple, and
better disposed to praye with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and deuotion. Yet meane I not
hereby to make a lawe, but that eche
one may say them, at such time as best
shal like them.</p>
   <p>These particularities haue I thought
good to touche, minding thereby to
helpe nouices, and such as are smallye
acquainted with this exercise, a labor
that I haue willingly laide my handss
to, as-wel, for that it was appointed
me by those that haue authoritie to
commaund me, as also, in regarde of
the hope I haue conceued that it shal

benefite the brethren of our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
for whose profite and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
this pamphlet was principallye
composed: whom I exhort and pray
as earnestly as I can, to geue them
selues diligently to this holy exercise
of meditation, considering that for
so smal paine they are promised so
great a gaine, and so singuler consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as I am persuaded al those shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
able to testifie, who with a willing
and feruent desire shal for some time
geue them-selues to assaye and proue
the same: For verily doo I hope, that
such shal by experience finde his life
to be the guide of their life, who is
