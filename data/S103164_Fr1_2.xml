   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, the strang violent late proceedings, both of our High Commissions in their Commission Courts, and of our Bishops and their Visitors in their unwarrantable Visitations, upon Canons Oathes and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of their owne forging, printed on their owne Names, without any commission at all from his Majesty under his great Seale, (contrary to the <hi>statutes of</hi> 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 19.21.26. <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 1.31. <hi>H. c.</hi> 26.37. <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1.2.5. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Eliz: c.</hi> 12. with other statutes and to their owne 12. Canon.) Yea contrary to the <hi>statute of Magna Charta c.</hi> 19. and the late <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> now layd a sleepe;) hath occasioned me to sett forth another impression of these <hi>Quaeres,</hi> wherein all the whole controversie concerning <hi>the Bowing of the name of Iesus in time of Divine service and sermon,,</hi> is summarily Discussed; which Quaeres I would desire our <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, Bishops and Visitors</hi> to resolve and Answer in a satisfactory manner (which yet they have not done,) before they violently without Law, reason, or lawfull authority, silence, suspend, present, excommunicate, fine, deprive, or imprison any of their Fellow-Brethren, or vex any of his Majesty Subjects; (as they have of late mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested many) either for omitting, or speaking against this Ceremony. It is the duty of all good Prelates, first to instruct and informe mens consciences and judgment <hi>with the</hi>

      <hi>spirit of meeknesse,</hi> in such Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which they have good cause to deeme unlawfull for them to use, before they urge them with violence to the practice of them, or rigidly proceed against them in judgment for omitting them. This they have not hitherto sufficiently done, in case of this much urged Ceremony, pressing it only by Club-law, without reason or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Let them therefore now satisfie these, their weake Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns Quaeres, if they can; or else cease to molest them, or urge this Ceremony longer, if they cannot doe it; since their great Guide <hi>Bishop Andrewes,</hi> though in other things famous for his learning and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; is doubles miserablie mistaken in this particular, and can noe longer patronize either his owne, or this their cause, as these Quaeres will demonstrate, having so oft times passed abrode in print without resolution.</p>
