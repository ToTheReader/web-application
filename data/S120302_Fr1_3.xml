   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER</head>
   <p>Good Reader, before I remit thee to the perusall of this ensuing discourse, I here thinke it good to acquaint thee with the occasion inducing me to wryte it, and with my methode houlden therein. And as touching the first, thou art to conceaue, that the worthles es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme, which we haue had of M. Whyte his booke (how soeuer his owne followers do magnify it) as see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it fraught with such impurity of stuffe, haith for theese yeares past preuailed with most of vs so far, that we weare determined to forbeare the answea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereof, houlding it altogether vnworthy of such labour; yet seing in diuerse passages of his late second worke, he vaunteth in great exultation, and iolity of words, that this his first booke doth not stand charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with any wilfull corruption, falsification, or other such imposture, and that he confidently prouoketh his aduersary (if any such be) to set them downe: Therefore to controule this mans most shamelesse as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seueration (as being one of an obdurat conscience, not caring how falsly he wryteth, or how impudently he iustifieth it being wrytten) I do here charge his said first treatise with most fowle abuses, falsifications, &amp; other such fraudulent dealing, &amp; will in theese few sheetes following particularize to thee diuerse of them, whereby thou shalt haue reason to assure thy selfe that M. Whyte, in reguarde of his calling in his new Ministery, and his exercise therein, may truly be num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bred amongest them <note n="a" place="margin">Roman. 1,</note>
      <hi>Qui Commutauerunt verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Dei in mendacium, who changed the truth of God onto a lye.</hi> Now concerning my methode taken, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing of his falshood, and deceate, thou art to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised, that my cheefe proiect in this treatise being to proue M. Whyte in his wrytings a most dishonest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionles,
<pb facs="6"/>
and faithles man: therfore forbearing to confute the whole course of his booke in respect of doctrine (which is already learnedly performed by my fellowe A. D. in his reply to M. W. said worke) I do here restraine my selfe to three heads, redu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ing all theese impostures, in which hereafter I intend to insist, to some of them. The heads are these Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Lyes, and Impertinēcyes. By Corruptiōs, I meane those depraued authorityes of the auncient Fathers, and our own moderne Catholicke authours, which this our Minister (thereby to make thē to speake in his protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant language and dialect) haith most shamelesly alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, either by inserting, or adding some words of his owne, as part of their sentences; or by concealing of some part of their words, which do expound the rest of the testimonyes, in a far different sence frō that, in which M. Whyte doth vrge them, or lastly (though setting downe their words truly) by strangely detorting and wresting them from the intended sence of the authors.</p>
   <p>By Lyes, I vnderstand false assertions and vast vntruthes mantained by M. White, whom the more fully, and irrepliably, and for the greater compendiousnes, to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince therein, I haue made choice of those vntruthes, as are acknowledged for such by the most learned Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, thus making his mother (to wit the <hi>Vniuersity</hi>) the iudg, and his owne <hi>Brethren</hi> the plaintifs, betwene himselfe and me herein.</p>
   <p>By Impertinēces, I conceaue his idle and fruteles aledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either of scripture, fathers, or Catholick writers, to disproue thereby some poynt of our religion; where my meaning is, that allowing the sense and constructions to those authorityes, which the wordes necessarily and truly importe, yet they doe in no sort disable &amp; wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the catholicke poynt, for the impugning whereof they are there by our Minister produced, so that it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<pb facs="6"/>
that his illations drawne from those testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, to the question intended, are most absurd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous, and inconsequent. These three now are the seuerall particuler deliueries of our minister, in his so much applauded worke, himselfe in this his scene, sometimes acting one part, sometimes an other, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the former heades, but wee lesse maruaile, since eich man knowes that whyte is successiuely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of seuerall tinctures. Now touching the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of these his impostures, thou art (good reader) fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vnderstand that my meaning is not to displaye all those with which his booke is stored, for this would require too painful a labour, and rising to an ouer greate volume, would be lesse fitting to be printed and diuulged. Besides, seeing my maine proiecte here is to decipher the dishonest dealing of our minister, euery cleere iudgment will acknowledg, that the true charging him euen with a few wilfull and vnius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable corruptions, doth condemne and proue him for such a man: and euery one knoweth, that who is found out of malice to corrupte some few places, would in like sorte depraue as many authorities as opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity might licence him. Therfore touching his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions or deprauations, I haue contented my selfe onely with fourty, which fourty, are taken out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout some twenty different writers, hauing in truth no more bookes alledged by him, wherewith to examine it: from which circumstance thou maist thus conclude, that if, restraining my selfe onely to twenty authours more or lesse, I can find fourty most notorious corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theyr testimonies, how many scores in all lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of such like deprauations might be found in all the rest of the authors alledged by him, which amount nere-hand to a hundred, if diligent search weare made of them: &amp; the rather considering, that many bookes produced by him, but omitted by me, are most
<pb facs="7"/>
to be gotten, and therefore he might corrupte their sayinges more securely, and with greater bouldnes, as presuming beforehand, that such his corruptions through want of the bookes them selues, could not easely be espied.</p>
   <p>In like sort concerning his lyes, I haue made choyce onely of such as are all of thē acknowledged for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes by his owne learned brethren. From which point thou maist also thus infer; if M. Whyte his booke, doth minister sundry such grosse lyes against our catholicke faith, as that the most learned protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that euer writ, are forced (though to their owne disaduantage) to confesse them for such: How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other vntruthes might be found therein, which through some shewe, or culour of answeare, and eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, are such, (as though being lyes indeed) wil not yet be so acknowledged by our aduersaries, who are loth to confesse more in fauour of our catholicke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then the vnauoidable euidence and clearenes of the truth it selfe constrayneth them.</p>
   <p>Lastly all his impertinencies, or weake absurd reasons hereafter set downe, are taken out of lesse then twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty leaues of his booke, from which thou maist in like maner thus collect, that if twenty leaues, and theese in the first part of his booke (deuiding the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three partes) do afford such a boundance of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent allegations, and authorityes, how many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds then in all probability of like nature, are disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed throughout his whole treatise, it contayning a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boue two hundred leaues. And the rather, seeing that diuers authours do commonly fortify and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the first part of their wrytings, with more forcible proofes and authorities then the latter part, both thereby the sooner, and with greater speede to inuade the iudgment of the reader, as also knowing, that
<pb facs="7"/>
many do peruse the beginninges of bookes, who through a werisome carelesnes do neuer reade the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of them.</p>
   <p>And thus much of my methode in this my treatise. Here now thou seest (curteous reader) what I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to performe, that is to make euident, that M. Whyte his first booke is stored with most shameles fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifications, lyes, and other such collusions: the which if I doe not effect, I am content to become a reproche, and shame, not onely to my particuler profession (the sacred function whereof I hould my cheefest honour) but also to the Catholicke cause in generall; for here I protest in the sight of god, and as I shall answere the truth or falshood of this my protestation at the most dreadfull daye, that I neuer perused booke of this quantity, wherein I did find more vnanswereable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, lyes, and impertinencies, then in this worke of M. Whytes. And if so eminent a man (as he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed by many to be) doth stand cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>geable with such prophane, and wicked deportments: what shall we then censure of other inferiour wryters of his side, Since <note n="b" place="margin">Math. c 6.</note>
      <hi>if the light be darknes, how great is the darknes</hi>: or what may we iudg of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> iustnes of their cause seeing the faith of Christ is of that force, as it scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be vphoulden with the weake supporters of such deceatfull meanes, it being no better, then an impious deuotion, or irreligious godlines, to deferd truth with falshood, or to blaze forth the light of the gospel, by the workes of darknes? And as touching his second booke, which is fraughted with all base scurrility of wordes, and railing, I will onely say, that seing there hath not bene as yet sufficient opportunity for the particuler examining of it, yet I am assured, that who shall impose that labour to himself, shall find the same to stand chargeable with no lese store
<pb facs="8"/>
of impostures, then this his other: for if this his booke impugned by me (being the strength and first borne of his cause) be found so corrupt, how can we proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly coniecture that this other second feminine, and lesse perfect labour of his, should not pertake of the former blemishes and deficiences.</p>
   <p>But now good reader, I will detaine thee no longer from perusing this my accusation, earnestly entreating thee (euen for the good of thy soule) that if thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand latin, thou wouldest see the testimonies them selues, as they lye in the authours, the which I doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch to be here corrupted, which if thou dost, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly thou shalt be forced to confesse, that M. whyte is a most egregious falsary, and howsoeuer he ename<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his cause, with the phrazes of <hi>the waye to the true Church, of the enlarging of the Ghospell of Christ, of roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out superstition and blindnes,</hi> and the like, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lesse thou shalt find that he is most conscious, and guilty both of his owne weake cause, as also of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious, and prophane mantaining and defending of the same, so as in reguard of his hipocrisy, and dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion herein, thou shalt see the wordes of the apostle iustified in him <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 9.</note>
      <hi>all they are not Israell, which are of Israell,</hi> himselfe being one of those <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 13.</note>
      <hi>which will not cease to peruert the way of our Lord.</hi>
