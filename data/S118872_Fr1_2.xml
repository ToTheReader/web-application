      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN first true intent of bounden dutie and entire zeale had quickened and pricked me forward to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent your Ladishippe with the dedication of this smal volume (Right honorable and my verie good Ladie) I grewe full of doubtes in my selfe, whether to proceede and go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, or els to surcease and reuoke my presumed enterprise. And abiding some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in this vncerteine and vndetermined conclusion, one while adaunted and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with the vnworthinesse of the woorke, in respect of mine owne labours, beeing an vnlearned translation, an other while animated and encouraged by the godlinesse of the matter comprehended and included therein: then pulled backe, and in manner put to silence by many doubtes of presumptiō, rudenesse, or rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="3"/> eftsoones againe imboldened and harted on, partly by duetie to vnfolde and shewe my willing minde, partly by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine knowledge and dayly report of your Ladiships good inclination to vertue and godlinesse, wherevnto adioyned the great fame of your singuler humilitie &amp; mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde curtesie, leaning at length onely to this staffe, I wounde in time out of this doubtfull Laborinth of inconstant passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and became plainely resolued in the processe and going forwarde of this mine enterprise: wherevnto I was yet the rather and more easely induced, for that as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the hard and vntoothsome bone, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the sweete marrowe, and as the vnsauorie shell, comprehendeth the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant kirnell: so vnder the rough and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smothed grace of mine vnlearned stile, is shrowded much wisdome, vertue, &amp; godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and in the simplicitie and plainnesse of my translation, many profitable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and holesome lessons conteined, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be embraced and followed of all men.
