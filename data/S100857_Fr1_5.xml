   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I enter into the Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Wounds made by Gun-shot, and the Curation of them,<note place="margin">Intention of the Author.</note> it seemeth vnto mee to bee very conuenient, (to bring the Reader into an appetite, before I place him at this Table, serued forth in so many seuerall dishes, seasoned with Salt-peter) to discourse heere briefly of the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentors of this so pernicious &amp; dangerous an Instrument of Warre: And into how many kindes it hath beene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersified and varied, euery kinde thereof hauing a name imposed theron, according to his vse and hurtful quality towards Mankind. <hi>Polydorus Virgill</hi> in his second Booke of the Inuentors of things, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. saith, that <hi>Artillery</hi> was first inuented by an <hi>Alleman</hi> of base condition: and that by a sudden and vnexpected Accident. This man borne for the ruine and destruction of Mankind, hauing kept in a Morter for some certaine intention of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Powder (which since by reason of the principall vse thereof hath beene called <hi>Gunpowder</hi>) the which hee couered with a stone: it happened, that in striking of fire with his Steele and Tinder, a small sparke fell into this Morter, and presently the Powder hauing taken fire, the force thereof did beare away the stone with violence; the which did both astonish and amaze him, and also taught
<pb facs="6"/>
the force of that comixture not knowne before: so that making a little hollow Instrument or Pipe of yron, and composing of the aforesaid Powder, he made tryall of that Engine, and seeing the effect fall out according to his desire,<note place="margin">The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had the first vse of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery.</note> he first taught vnto the <hi>Venetians</hi> the vse of this deuillish inuention, in the Warre which they had against the <hi>Genowaies</hi> in the yeere of our redemption 1380. in a place heretofore called the <hi>Clodian Valley,</hi> but now <hi>Chiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Diuers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons touching the time when Artillery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</note> Neuerthelesse, according to the opinion of <hi>Petrus Massa,</hi> in the eight Chapter of the first part of his diuers Lessons, this inuention should be more ancient, because that in the Chronicle of <hi>Alphonsus</hi> the eleuenth King of Castile, who Conquered the <hi>Argezirian Iles,</hi> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded that in those warres, which was in the yeere 1343. the besieged <hi>Moores</hi> shot at their enemies out of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Mortors of yron the seuerall reports whereof, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an exceeding horrible sound in the ayre, equall vnto that of Thunder. The Lord Don <hi>Pedro, Bishop</hi> of Leon, in the Chronicle of King <hi>Alphonsus</hi> hee that Conquered Toledo, writeth, that in a battell by sea, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the king of Tunis, and the King of Seuill, a Moore, (it being foure hundred yeeres agoe and more) whose part the King <hi>Alphonsus</hi> fauoured: those of Tunis had in their ships certaine Engines of yron or Bombards, with the which they shot against their enemies. By this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that Artillery hath beene heretofore in vse, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it neuer came to perfection till this present. The inuenter of this engine hath had but little recompence, for his name and profession are altogether vnknowen to the world, as being not vnworthy of any memory for such a wicked and damnable inuention. Howbeit <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>et</hi> in his <hi>Cosmographie</hi> speaking of the <hi>Sweuians,</hi> a people neere about the Low-Countries, writeth out of
<pb facs="6"/>
the authority of an old written Booke, that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said German had been in former time a Monke,<note place="margin">The Author of Artillery and his name.</note> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher or Alcumist by profession, of the Countrey of Fribourg: his name <hi>Constantine Anelzen.</hi> Yet howsoeuer this engine was first called Bombard, by reason of the sound that it causeth: which the Latines conformably doe call Bombus. Since the time of the first inuention thereof, being before rude and imperfect: The time; Art,<note place="margin">What things hath s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>nce bin added to the Artillery.</note> but aboue all, the malice of men haue added much vnto it. For first of all, for the matter it selfe, it being first of yron, they haue since beene cast of Brasse or Copper, Mettals more forcible, and tractable: besides lesse subiect vnto rust. Secondly, at the first they were but simply formed, and as it were but a rude masse of yron; but since they haue beene diuersified into an hundred fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yea vnto the mounting of them on wheeles, to the end that they might be caried with the more swiftnesse; and as it were run to the ruine and destruction of men; The first Mortor pieces not being sufficient or cruell enough to vomit forth fire and shot.</p>
   <p>From thence haue proceeded these horrible monsters, as Cannons, doubles Cannons, Bastards, Muskets,<note place="margin">Diners names of the Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: &amp; whence they are taken</note> Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and Morter Pieces, &amp;c. These furious beasts of Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerings, Serpentines, Basilisks, Sakers, Falcons, Falcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Chambers, Murderers, and infinite other kindes, all of diuers names, not onely drawne and taken from their figure and qualitie, but also from their effects and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Wherein truely they shewed themselues wise and vnderstood well the thing they vndertooke. I meane those that first imposed such names which are not onely taken from the most rauenous animals, as from Sakers, &amp; Falcons: but also from the most dangerous enemies of Mankind, as from Serpents, Snakes, and Basiliskes, to
<pb facs="7"/>
shew, that such Engines haue no other vse; and were not inuented for any other end or intention, but onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy suddenly and cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lly the life of man: and that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them onely named, we should haue them in horrour and detestation. I omit to speake of other Pieces lesse in body and substance, but in force and cruelty more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. For so much as they can take away our liues neere at hand, and may surprise vs by treason, being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all meanes of preuention: such are the Pistols, Dags, and such like, which easily may be hidden in a mans poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. Betwixt these two kindes before spoken of, the Harquebuz of Crocke holds a meane, the which cannot be shot off vnlesse it be first bound or fixed in some peece of wood: the Caliuer which cannot be discharged at the cheeke, by reason of their thicke and short stocks, but are helde against the breast. Also the common Muskets all: which haue beene inuented for the commoditie of foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for shot and bullets. The generall word imposed by the Latines is <hi>Sclopus,</hi> through the imitation of the sound, &amp; by the Italians <hi>Sclopoterre,</hi> by the Frenchmen, Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buze, a word also taken from the Italians, by reason of the touch-hole, by which the fire first entreth into the Piece: for the Italians call a hole Buzio▪ and it is called <hi>Arc</hi> from the word <hi>Arcus</hi> a bow, because they are vsed at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent instead of bowes formerly vsed in the time of warre. For in former time the Archers held the same Front in the battell,<note place="margin">From w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">

Thus are both the yron and fire armed against vs, to take away our liues through the malice of men, for the conseruation whereof they were at the first created.</p>
   <p>Truely when I heare the engines spoken of, vsed by our Ancients, either in their warres or assaults:<note place="margin">A comparison of the Engines vsed by our Ancients, with those of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

And yet neuerthelesse, the ordinary and naturall Thunder is nothing in a maner to these infernall engines: which may easily be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by comparing the effects of the one with the other.

The Thunder-bolts are neuer seene to descend lower then fiue foot into the earth; from thence it commeth that those that are fearefull of Thunder doe make themselues Caues or hollow Vaults in the earth, therein to retire themselues as in a place of saftie. It is said also that the Bay tree is neuer strooke with Thunder,<note place="margin">What things are preserued from the force of Thunder.</note> and therefore in times past, and is at this day taken for a victorie. Wherefore the Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> fearing Thunder exceedingly aboue all other things, caused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be crowned with a wreath of Bayes, at the least sound he heared in the Ayre.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Sueto. in Tib.</hi>
      </note> I haue reade also that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for the like occasion haue made themselues Tents of the skinnes of Sea-calues, because that this Animall hath this gift in particular, neuer to be touched by Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The Eagle is said also to haue this priuiledge aboue all other foules, neuer to be touched by Thunder, and therefore he is called <hi>Iupiters</hi> bird, as saith <hi>Pliny lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 54. &amp; 55. But against the Artillery, Charmes, and Incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations preuaile nothing: neither the victorious Bayes, nor the Sea Calfe, nor any thing whatsoeuer: no not an opposed Wall it selfe, of ten foot in thicknesse. Briefly, this sheweth the inuincible fury of Artillery, in respect of Thunder in this. For the Thunder may be dissipated by the ringing of Bels,<note place="margin">Artillery dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth away Thunder.</note> the sound of Basons, or by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of Ordinance: For the concussion of the clouds meeting together violently, causeth the Thunder: and by the aforesaid agitation of the Ayre; they are discipated and dispersed. But the fury and pride of Artillery will
<pb facs="8"/>
not be appeased by any thing whatsoeuer. There are some Times and Regions which are exempt and freed from Thunder;<note place="margin">The times which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>e without Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> for Thunder was neuer seene in the hart of Winter, nor in the midst of Summer, the which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by two contrary reasons. For in Winter the Aire is very thicke, as also the cloudes; and therefore those exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the earth are easily dispersed and distinguished, being of themselues but cold and glaciall. From thence it commeth to passe that the country of Scithia, and other cold countries thereabouts, as Tartary, Liuonia, Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia, Russia, &amp; other neighbor countries are exempt from Thunder, as to the contrary, Egypt is seldom endamaged by Thunder, by reason of the great heat in those part. For the exhalations and vapours of the earth, which are hot and drie: are conuerted through their vehement heat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to small cloudes, which haue no force, as saith <hi>Pliny.</hi> But as the inuention,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 50.</note> so is the tempest and damage of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, dispersed as a contagious pestilence ouer all the earth, and at all times the heauens are sencible of the complaining cryes of those that feele the furious effects thereof. Thunder for the most part hath but one blow, but one bolt, and neuer killeth but one man at a time. But Artillery at one blow will massacre an hundred men. The Thunderbolt oftentimes, as being a naturall thing, falleth as it happeneth, sometimes on a rocke, sometimes on a mountaine, sometimes on a Tower, seldome on a man. But the Artillery,<note place="margin">Designe and end of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> being guided by the wicked dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie of man, coueteth nothing but man, hath quarrell to none but man, him alone hee slayeth, him alone hee chooseth among a thousand other things. The Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt doth a good space of time giue vs warning by the voyce of Thunder, the forerunner thereof; to aduertise vs of the ensuing tempest: but the Artillery it striketh in
<pb facs="9"/>
Thunder, and Thundereth in striking; sending assoone his mortall bullet into the bowels, as he doth his sound into the eares. This is the reason why we do, &amp; that iustly detest the Author of such a hurtfull and pernicious inuention: as to the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>trary, we ought to esteeme those worthy of great praises, who either by words haue studied to reuoke all Kings and Princes from the practise of such a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inuention, or by effects and writings haue stvdied to ordaine and prescribe remedies to those that haue beene wounded thereby: the consideration whereof hath been a principall motiue to me to write of this matter and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. But before my pen shall run in this carriere, I will for the easier vnderstanding of the ensuing Treatise, which I intend to publish,<note place="margin">The reason that moued the Authour to write of Gunshot.</note> place two discourses in the beginning of the Booke; to extirpate certaine ancient opinions out of the fantasies of many, which seeme vnto me to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together false.
