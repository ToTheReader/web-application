Knight, S<seg rend="sup">r.</seg> ROBERT NAVNTON, Principall
Secretary to the Kings Maiestie, and of his
most Honorable Priuie Councell; all Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

      </gap> you cannot but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that, from the first beginning of our old
acquaintance, I haue alwayes made you the
<hi>Aristarchus</hi> of my writings. The exactnesse
of whole iudgement; I haue euer found, so
pleasingly tempered, with <hi>Sharp,</hi> and <hi>Sweet,</hi>
that, to the one of these, your <hi>sharpenesse,</hi> in discerning the least
escapes and errors, there could nothing more be added: of the
other, your <hi>sweetnesse,</hi> in pardoning the greatest, there could
nothing more be required. The recordation of which mixture,
hath giuen me now the boldnesse (notwithstanding the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of your affaires, wherewith I euer find you pressed) yet, to
offer vnto your censure, this vnperfect worke, as matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
for your more reserued time: wherein, I nothing
doubt, but you haue your oft returnes, to meditations of this
kind. The heads which I haue proiected, in this worke to be
discussed, are all of them such, as though most needefull to be
beleeued; yet least laboured in by <hi>Diuines,</hi> to further our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe;
and therefore the most subiect, both to question and
doubting: Especially, with men of the sharpest witts, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
spirits, and the richest endowments: whom Nature hath
prepared, for the search of the highest; and most difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<pb facs="3"/>
These men (out of the penetrating and diuiding nature of
their firie wits) doe trouble themselues with many Quaere's
and doubts, in all these <hi>foure Positions</hi> which neuer creepe into
the heads of simpler and vnlearned persons; framing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
such Obiections, as to which, they themselues cannot
giue good and sufficient Answeres, but are, <hi>ipsi sibi respondentes,
inferiores:</hi> as it was sayd of <hi>Chrysippus;</hi> euen for this very cause.
For the better helpe of which men, and to rid them out of the
snares of their owne curiosities, wherewith they oftentimes
intangle themselues; and to preuent, that they doe not, <hi>ipsi se
compungere suis acuminibus, that they wound not themselues, with
the sharpe needles points of their owne pricking wits;</hi> I haue done
the best I could, to ioyne my helpe with theirs, by answering
all Obiections, which I could coniecture might any way trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
their <hi>sciences,</hi> or <hi>Consciences.</hi> For this so meane a worke, I
affect no great Patronage. <hi>Satis▪ magnum alter alteri the atrum su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
Your loue is the greatest: which I haue euer found ready
to couer my greatest: wants. The summitie of my ambition is,
that, as you haue giuen a noble testimony vnto the world, of
the incomparable faithfulnesse of your loue towards me: so I
might yeeld a returne of my like fidelity of thankefulnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
you. Your gracious acceptance of this mine imperfect
worke, shall be a brazen wall vnto mee, against the maleuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
disposition of all detracting spirits.</p>
