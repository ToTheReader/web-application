      <l>So, on the throate of the rude Sea, he sets</l>

      <l>Nor is this <hi>Allegorie</hi> vniustly rackt,</l>
      <l>to this strange length; Onely that Iewels are,</l>
      <l>In estimation meerely, so exact:</l>
      <l>And thy worke, in it selfe, is deare and Rare.</l>

      <l>For, though thy hand was scarce addrest to drawe</l>
      <l>The Semi-circle of <hi>Seianus</hi> life,</l>
      <l>Thy <hi>Muse</hi> yet makes it the whole Sphaere, and Lawe</l>
      <l>To all State Liues: and bounds Ambitions strife.</l>
      <l>And as a little Brooke creepes from his Spring,</l>
      <l>With shallow tremblings, through the lowest Vales,</l>
      <l>As if he feard his streame abroad to bring,</l>
      <l>Least prophane Feete should wrong it, and rude Gales,</l>
      <l>But finding happy Channels, and supplies</l>
      <l>Of other Fordes mixe with his modest course,</l>
      <l>He growes a goodly Riuer, and descries</l>
      <l>The strength, that mannd him, since he left his Source;</l>
      <l>Then takes he in delight some Meades, and Groues,</l>
      <l>And, with his two-edg'd waters, flourishes</l>
      <l>Before great Palaces, and all Mens Loues</l>
      <l>Build by his shores, to greete his Passages:</l>
      <l>So thy chaste <hi>Muse,</hi> by vertuous selfe-mistrust,</l>
      <l>Which is a true Marke of the truest Merit,</l>
      <l>In Virgin feare of Mens illiterate Lust,</l>
      <l>Shut her soft wings, and durst not showe her spirit;</l>
      <l>Till, nobly cherisht, now thou lett'st her flie,</l>
      <l>Singing the sable <hi>Orgies</hi> of the <hi>Muses,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>And in the highest Pitche of <hi>Tragedie,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Mak'st her command, al things thy Ground produces.</l>
      <l>But, as it is a Signe of Loues first firing,</l>
      <l>Not Pleasure by a louely Presence taken,</l>
      <l>And Bouldnesse to attempt; but close Retiring,</l>
      <l>To places desolate, and Feuer-shaken;</l>
      <l>So, when the loue of Knowledge first affects vs,</l>
      <l>Our Tongues doe falter, and the Flame doth roue</l>
      <l>Through our thinne spirits, and of feare detects vs</l>
      <l>Tattaine her Truth, whom we so truely loue.</l>
      <pb facs="5"/>
      <l>Nor can (saith <hi>Aeschilus</hi>) a faire young Dame,</l>
      <l>Kept long without a Husband, more containe</l>
      <l>Her amorous eye, from breaking forth in flame,</l>
      <l>When she beholds a Youth that fits her vaine;</l>
      <l>Then any mans first taste of Knowledge truly</l>
      <l>Can bridle the affection she inspireth:</l>
      <l>But let it flie on Men, that most vnduly</l>
      <l>Haunt her with hate, and all the Loues she fireth.</l>
      <l>If our Teeth, Head, or but our Finger ake,</l>
      <l>We straight seeke the Phisitian; If a Feuer,</l>
      <l>Or any curefull maladie we take,</l>
      <l>The graue Phisitian is desired euer:</l>
      <l>But if proud Melancholie, Lunacie,</l>
      <l>Or direct Madnesse ouer-heate our braines,</l>
      <l>We Rage, Beate out, or the Phisitian flie,</l>
      <l>Loosing with vehemence, euen the sense of Paines.</l>
      <l>So of Offenders, they are past recure,</l>
      <l>That with a tyranous spleene, their stings extend</l>
      <l>Gainst their Reprouers; They that will endure</l>
      <l>All discreete Discipline, are not said t' offend.</l>
      <l>Though Others qualified, then, with Naturall skill,</l>
      <l>(More sweete mouthd, and affecting shrewder wits)</l>
      <l>Blanche Coles, call Illnesse, good, and Goodnesse ill,</l>
      <l>Breath thou the fire, that true-spoke Knowledge fits.</l>
      <l>Thou canst not then be Great? yes. Who is he,</l>
      <l>(Said the good <hi>Spartane</hi> King) greater then I,</l>
      <l>That is not likewise iuster? No degree</l>
      <l>can boast of emminence, or Emperie,</l>
      <l>(As the great <hi>Stagerite</hi> held) in any One</l>
      <l>Beyond Another, whose Soule farther sees,</l>
      <l>And in whose Life the Gods are better knowne:</l>
      <l>Degrees of Knowledge difference all Degrees.</l>
      <l>Thy <hi>Poëme,</hi> therefore, hath this due respect,</l>
      <l>That it lets passe nothing, without obseruing,</l>
      <l>Worthy Instruction; or that might correct</l>
      <l>Rude manners, and renowne the well deseruing:</l>

      <l>Because much troubled Earthy parts improue them:</l>
      <l>Which mixed with the Odors we exhall,</l>
      <l>Do vitiate what we drawe in. But remooue them</l>
      <l>A little space, the Earthy parts do fall,</l>
