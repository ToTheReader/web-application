      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Jnce the purposed tender of my first Noueltie, time that is sometimes propitious to gratefull Intentions, hath made me fruitfull in a second producement. As therefore I resigned to you my display of the <hi>Banian</hi> Sect, so also may you be pleased to accept this of the <hi>Persees:</hi>
      <pb facs="63"/>
since by the strength of your fauours, and the oportunities of your imployment, I haue beene inabled to bring it forth also. As for the strength of the Superstition, why the <hi>Persees</hi> should make the Fire their God, seemes to weake purpose, as one <hi>Canopus</hi> an <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Priest once euinced. For vpon a time when there was a publique Tryall and Contention amongst the Nations, whose God was most powerfull, and the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Persees</hi> as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> testifies, in the second Booke of his <hi>Ecclesiasticke Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> ostentated their god of Fire; affirming that it was able to destroy all the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> gods, and Idols of gold, siluer, brasse, wood, stone, or whatsoeuer, and consume them to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: <hi>Canopus</hi> to elude this Assertion brings in a stone vessell, orbicular and full of holes like a <hi>Cullender,</hi> filled with water; and the ventages thereof so cunningly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered with waxe, that the fraud went vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected; which being set to mannage his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention with the Fire, the heate melting the waxe, gaue the liquid humour within liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

to extinguish the Fire, which was the <hi>Persians</hi> god; which proiect if it seeme but circumuentiue and deceiptfull, to iustifie the power of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> god of Stone, aboue the <hi>Persians</hi> god of Fire; yet who sees not, that if so be any be pleased to make the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his god, it would quickly extinguish the Fiery god which these <hi>Persees</hi> worshippe? and so by consequence wee may hold this a poore Superstition. Howsoeuer then both these and the former, seeme to bee issues ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate and branded in the Conception with the name of base begotten, because they are Superstitious; Yet since our <hi>Physitians</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> haue learned to make the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in forraigne Countries medecinable and soueraigne in our owne; J hope t<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
