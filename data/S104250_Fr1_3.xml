   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat irregulare and wilfull tyraunt <hi>Custome,</hi>
      </hi> whose bare worde is holden and embrased as a law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth me, though much against my will, to salute the Reader with a breefe Epistle. For first I was neuer apt by nature, to craue acquaintance of a priuate person, with out vrgent cause, much lesse at random of a multitude, which neither can be visible in one certaine place at any time, as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill lawes sette downe, nor saluted otherwise then in a kinde of generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Where duety bindeth Pastors to enstruct a flocke, or counsailours are bounde by fee, to discourse or pleade, I can allow this course because there is none other choise, but where mens scopes are francke, what grace an other hath, in plotting for the fauour of a person whom he neuer knewe, or perswading with so many sundry sortes of men, whose humours he did neuer vnderstande, I can not well conceiue, but for mine owne part I am taught by <hi>Sappho,</hi> that no note of Musique, and by <hi>Crassus</hi> that no vain of Rhetoricke contenteth all mens eares, that listen or apply their sences to the sound or hermony. Beside, if it be thought &amp; holden for a seruile kinde of flattery, to fawne or hunt for pleasing words, whē I am sure before my sute begin, to take a flatte repulse at one hand or other, I would be loth to hasarde or engage my selfe, so farre within the daunger of vnthankefull men, as to leaue it in theyr choise, whether they will consirue &amp; interprete matters in good parte, or declaime with bitternesse. For either the worke it selfe deserueth prayse, in which case, deinty wine is rather called into question, by those that haunt the Tauerne, then sette foorth and graced with an Iuie garlande, or els it smelleth of the sockette, and then we may with as much good maner craue to be beleeued in a lye, as countenaunced &amp; borne out in an ouersight: againe if the reader be so wel disposed of hys owne good nature, as not to wrong himselfe by misdeeming of an other mans desert, the letter néedeth not, if so seuere in setting downe a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie iudgement, as entreatie can not winne his fauour, it easeth not, if so wilfull as no termes of courtesy can alter him, it booteth not. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, I haue noted and obserued in mine owne experience, that how pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full soeuer, any preface hath beene to the reader, if the stile &amp; matter were not worthy praise, small credite hath beene gotten, and on the other syde, where matters are well handeled, it skilleth not in how reckelesse and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a manner, we prescribe of those, whom reason mooueth to be kind, and the goodnes of the cause to stand indifferēt. But to be short, of two things it behooueth me to giue the readers warning, of what soeuer moode or quallity they be. The first is, that although I meane God willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende and iustify the matter of the booke, yet will I not avowe the faults, which are escaped in the Printing▪ for most reasonable and indifferent is that exception of the Pretor <hi>Quod meo nomine gestum, non est, ratum non
<pb facs="12"/> habebo.</hi> The seconde is a poynt of satisfaction, concerning that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doone with good aduisement, may notwithstanding be mistaken as an errour. For though I promised to make a cleare dispatch of all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that are brought in defence of Dreames, Oracles, Astrologie, coniuring, or any other meane, (from whence these prophecies are drawn) as it were in one masse or lumpe, before the winding vppe of the discourse▪ yet I haue vpon some better consideration of the matter, thought it to be more conuenient, that euery scruple may be satisfyed and answered in hys proper place, least eyther like a braunch that is deuided from the body, it may leese the former grace, or cōfusion might take away the greatest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and delight, or the readers may be more encombred, because the grounds and principles, vppon which the greatest part of cauilles and conceites depende, will be worne out of memorye. Thys being doone, I coulde deuise to entertaine the reader with straunge properties of herbes, and stones, which neither God infused at the fyrst creating of the worlde, nor men of skill and practise in the simples haue obserued since, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be, that eyther they haue beene abused to delight, and tickle the wilde humores of thys age, or for default of learning, in more weighty matters and discourses of more worth, haue presumed and obtruded by necessity. But when I call to minde, in howe base account such kindes of authores were esteemed in the time of <hi>Sozomen,</hi> as for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, rather then they woulde bee silent, forged groundes and bent theyr studdies, rather to the maintenaunce of vanity, then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of vertue, when I remember that we must account for euery wast and idle worde, and that such fantasies come neuer further out of season, then when graue matters are debated with authority, me thinks it is high time to leaue a wanton haunt, lamenting the distempered and sickely tast of this diseased age, which like women that are spent with a disease called the greene sickenes, preferre chalke before suger, and coales before comfittes. Thus leauing the iudgements of my secrete thoughtes, to him onely that sercheth both heart and raynes, and of my labors to the learned, I wish to the Readers as to my selfe, and to all that professe one Christ, that we may build our selues an euerlasting tabernacle, in that hill of Sion, whose Prince is Verity, whose lawes are Charity, whose limits are Eternity. Amen.</p>
