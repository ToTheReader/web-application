   <head>The Preface to the
godly Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat Mr. <hi>Luther</hi>
in his last Sermon
at <hi>Wittenberg</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde,
we see in these
our dayes fully performed and
accomplished: hee had observed
thirty severall sects, and secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
raised up by Satan in his
time against that holy doctrine
preached by himselfe; all which
had hee not beene able by the
Scriptures to have resisted, and
refuted, he must have beene (as
himselfe said) of thirty severall
religions. Among them he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
the <hi>Anabaptists, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomists,
Libertines, Servitians,</hi>
&amp;c. of all whom he foretold, that
<pb facs="3"/>
though now they (saith hee) by
the power of the word, and by the
vigilancy of godly teachers lye
close and still; yet will they be
intent, and ready on all occasions
to rise, and raise up their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
errours to disturbe the
peace of the Church, and the
prosperity of the Gospel. And
indeede accordingly have we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the Church of God in all
times since, lesse or more infested
with these dangerous sectaries,
I meane the <hi>Libertines,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
enemies to the Law of
God, and to the holy obedience of
it. Against whom as St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
in his time wrote two books
<hi>against the Adversaries of the
Law:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Contra Legis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarios.</note> so Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> dealt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
in his time, in his booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,<note place="margin">Adversus furiosam sectam Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note>
      <hi>Against the furious sect
of the Libertines:</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
godly men since that time.
Let not us be offended that the
spawne and succession of those
lewd libertine sectaries are now
<pb facs="3"/>
issued forth in troopes amongst
us,<note place="margin">Nemo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur aut consterne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur cum tam inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litos, &amp; ab omni rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res cernas: Calv.</note> nor marvaile that the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of Gods most righteous
Law prevaileth amongst a rude
multitude, the <hi>sonnes of Belial;</hi>
whom Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> calleth a
<hi>prodigious</hi> and <hi>belluine</hi> sect,
furious and madded in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and fierce as unbroken
coltes against whosoever would
curbe them, and straiten the
reines of their unbridled licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse.
But rather let us
observe, 1. Satans malice in
sowing tares where good seede
was sowne, and that in the Lords
field. 2. Gods just permission of
so many schismes as <hi>tares</hi> rising
with the graine; and therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
the contempt and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of his word, he hath
sent strong delusions, that many
should <hi>believe lies,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Thes: 2.</note>
      <hi>who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not the truth in the love
of it.</hi> 3. The levity, wantonnes,
and instability of unsetled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spellers,
that are in every new
<pb facs="4"/>
fashion of opinion, with every new
man that hath the tricke of mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
novell conceits against re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
truthes; that if thirty
new-minted fansies should rise
up in their age, they were like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be of thirty religions,
and of every last praise God, that
the truth was never truly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
till now. 4. Let us excite
our selves to the love of truth,
to the hatred of errour, and to
the fencing of our selves against
seducers; importuning in seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
invocation the God of truth,
not to punish our wantonnesse in
profession, with <hi>taking the
word of truth utterly from us:</hi>
and thus shall we temper poyson
to a remedy,<note place="margin">Quod ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur in perniciem, convertit Deus in adiutori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um: Aug: Epist: ad Sextum 105.</note> and turne that to
an help which the enemy intends
for our hurt. For the setling of
mine owne people (some of them
looking that way) I delivered
lately some grounds, both to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the rule of the Law upon
the regenerate, as also to refute
<pb facs="4"/>
the contrary errour of our new
audacious Antinomists, and
Libertines, and Famelists, who
as the olde <hi>Manichees</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionists,</hi>
abolish the <hi>whole Law,</hi>
and that <hi>wholly.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>One preacheth, that <hi>the whole
Law since Christs death is
wholly abrogated, and abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
Another, that <hi>the whole
Law was fulfilled by Christ
1600 yeares agoe, and we have
nothing to doe with that.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
that to <hi>teach obedience
to the Law of God, is to teach
popery, and to leade men into a
dead faith.</hi> Another, that <hi>to
doe any thing because God
commands us, or to forbeare
any thing because God forbids
us, is a signe of a morall man,
and of a dead and unsound
Christian.</hi> And upon these hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and deceitfull grounds doe
these masters of errour bottome
a number other ridiculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
which yet they deliver as
<pb facs="5"/>
oracles, and anathematize who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall not so receive them.
As 1. That the Law being abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
to the justified, <hi>God can
see no sinne in them;</hi> for hee
can see no Law transgressed.
2. <hi>That the regenerate cannot
sinne;</hi> for where is no Law, is no
transgression: according to that
Luciferian principle rife among
them, <hi>Be in Christ, and sinne if
thou canst.</hi> 3. That being in
Christ, they are <hi>Christed with
Christ,</hi> as pure as Christ, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
as Christ, as farre beyond
the Law as Christ himselfe: the
right brood and spawne of the
olde <hi>Catharists</hi> and <hi>Puritans.</hi>
4. That the Law is not to bee
taught in the Church, and they
are legall Preachers that doe
so, and preach not Christ. 5. They
hence disclaime all obedience to
the Law, and raile at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and practise of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as good for nothing, but to
carry men to hell; and cry out
<pb facs="5"/>
on the Ministers as Popish, and
as <hi>having Monks in their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
who set men on working, and
doing, and walking holily. 6.
They renounce and reject all
humility, confession and sorrow
for sinne, they scorne fasting and
prayer, as the seeking not of God,
but of our selves. One saith, that
<hi>neither our omissions, nor
commissions should grieve us:</hi>
and another, <hi>Neither doe my
good deedes rejoyce mee, nor
my bad deedes grieve mee.</hi>
They deride and flout the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of repentance and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and upbraid such as walke
humbly before God. What say
they? <hi>Will you repent all your
dayes?</hi> and, <hi>You cannot sinne,
but you must repent an whole
fortnight after.</hi> Nay they are
set upon so merry a pin, as they
can thinke of their former sinnes
with merriment. <hi>I am glad of
my sinne</hi> (saith one) <hi>because
it hath drawne me to Christ:</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
and why doest thou not mourne
that by those sinnes thou hast
pierced Christ? 7. They reject
the Saboth as Iewish wholly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated
with all other comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements;
as one of them profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that <hi>were it not for offence
of men, he would labour in his
calling on that day as well as
any other.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>These with many other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents
of the same stampe, all
tending to loose the conscience
from all awe of God, from all care
of duty, from all feare of sinne,
and judgement to come, (though
they walke in all licentiousnesse,
and prodigious courses) are such
as a right bred Christian cannot
but tremble at; and were there
but a few droppes of modest blood
in their veines, the Masters of
such lewd and libertine opinions
could not but blush at: who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
answer before God (without
a sea of teares of tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ling of simple
<pb facs="6"/>
men (and women especially) into
such desperate wayes.</p>
   <p>My intention being onely to
propound the grounds of naked
truth, (which as a right line is
the rule of it selfe, and of that
which is crooked) and that to
my owne, in my owne plaine and
ordinary manner; it was farre
from my thought to make my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
more publicke, till partly
the scorne and insolency of these
schismaticall spirits on the one
hand, and partly the importunity
of many godly both Ministers
and private persons thrust mee
into a second survey, and review
of what I had delivered. They
said they knew some drawne off
their opinions by hearing the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
preached; and doubted not
but if it were made more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke,
it would be much more
usefull to the Church, especially
seeing these seducers creepe into
such corners of the Citty and
Country, where are weakest
<pb facs="7"/>
meanes of resistance, whose stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
hopes and holdes lie in the
ignorance and too credulous sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of their proselites. I
made many objections to my self,
some to them: I knew this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
soundly and judicially
handled already by others; that
it might more profitably and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
be undertaken by some
other better furnished with gifts
and leisure: how little I could
expect the satisfaction of others
in an argument of this moment,
who in the throng of businesse,
and burden of many weekly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
could scarce gaine
thoughts or time to satisfie my
selfe: How unsafe to thrust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a publicke quarrell: how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
and <hi>lawles</hi> the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
who holde not themselves
countable to God, for any wrong
they doe unto man. But yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
to deny my selfe for the
service of God and his Church,
and that the seasonablenesse of
<pb facs="7"/>
the treatise might adde an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
unto it, and that it
might be some stay to the teacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
untill a more elaborate, and
compleate worke might by some
other be prepared: I yeelded unto
the publication of that little
which I had done; animating my
selfe with the same arguments
that wise and prudent Generalls
use to encourage and hearten
their souldiers withall, when
they are to joyne issue with the
approaching enemy: and they
be foure. 1. The goodnesse and
<hi>justice of the cause,</hi> which is
just, and honourable; for we take
part with God, and fight his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
in the quarrell of his most
righteous Law. 2. The <hi>victory
is easie and certaine,</hi> unlesse God
and his Law can be conquered:
and who ever rose up against God
and prospered? 3. <hi>The quality
of the adversaries</hi> must adde
courage unto us, Christians in
name, but siding, and sorting
<pb facs="8"/>
with the damnable heretickes of
ancient times: of whom I will
not speake what they are worthy
to heare, but what I may with
judgement write, and whom the
sequell discourse will shew to be
of proud, furious, and audacious
spirits. 4. <hi>The assurance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
assistance:</hi> for are the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
such? certainly then
is their strength gone: God's spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is gone from them, for he <hi>tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
the humble,</hi> and sendeth
the proud empty away. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the <hi>spirit,</hi> and outboast all
men, that they are taught, and
led, and moved by the <hi>spirit,</hi> and
are past all motives and persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of man or meanes: but God's
spirit is a soft, sober, calme and
quiet spirit, both in Christ the
head, and in all his members:
and that furious, factious, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and quarrelsome spirit of
theirs,<note place="margin">Deus ecce furentibus obstat.</note> is that uncleane spirit of
Satan, usually breathed into he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes
and enemies of the truth,
and of the spirit of truth: by
<pb facs="8"/>
whose onely assistance wee shall
shape them (not as they say in
scorne, a garment after our owne
fashion) but such an answer out
of the Scriptures, as shall not
hide their nakednesse, but unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their ignorance, emptinesse
and folly, and vindicate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Law of God from their schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
cavills, and hereticall
contempt. And why not? For
doe we exclaime against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
for blotting out the second
commandement, as sacrilegious
persons? and against the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists
for denying the fifth? and
shall we be silent at these secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
whose blindnesse hath made
them bolde to blot out all the ten
at once? which although they
were writen with God's owne
finger, and that in tables of stone,
yet these mad men presume their
nailes so steeled, as that they can
scratch them out all at once, and
yet God see no sin in them. I shall
speake unto them all along the
<pb facs="9"/>
Treatise; and now will onely
desire of them, or rather of God
for them these two things: <hi>First,</hi>
that my reproofe may be a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
unto them; at least if it be
conceived a wound, yet not of an
enemy, but of one that out of
love desireth to leave them a testimony
of faithfulnesse: and the
other is,<note place="margin">Optimus portus poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiae mutatio consilii: Cic: Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip▪</note> that the Lord would
worke in them a timely change
both of opinion &amp; practise; so as
they may no longer <hi>turne the
grace of God into wantonnesse</hi>
and liberty, but get out of this
snare of the Divel, wherein they
are held to doe his will, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> who in
every thing opposeth, and resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the righteous will of God re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>vealed.</p>
   <p>But to you that are desirous
to walke in the olde and good
way, and are not yet infected
with this spreading gangrene of
licentiousnesse, I shall be bolde to
give some advise for prevention.
As 1. To looke carefully to your
<pb facs="9"/>
precious soules, which Satan ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wayes beleaguereth: let not
pretences of faith in Christ loose
you from duty towards God;
catch not at ease, or presposterous
and overtimely comforts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the impostour hath you at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
2. Looke well to your
estates, and outward meanes, lest
these impostours make a prey,
and advantage on you, as they
have done on some already, who
have confessed that these pedlars
have basely inveagled from them
even to the very cushions of their
windowes: for the Apostle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
not in vain, that <hi>through
covetousnesse they make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise
of unwary soules.</hi> 3.
Suspect such men as come with
a strange language, and unwon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
phrases and manner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:<note place="margin">Etiam lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendum cum Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia recte sentiente: Cyprian:</note>
for errour is a fruitfull
mother, yet is she ashamed of her
brood, and is willing to cover
and apparell them with philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall
and metaphysicall phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
<pb facs="10"/>
and so these men are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
we should seek out the brats
of their owne braine,<note place="margin">Sublime et tumidum dicendi ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nus; pere grino quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam idio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur, ut qui ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sos audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt prima facie stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefiant. Calv: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert: c: 2.</note> in the bush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and thickets of intricate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
and in the meanders
and laborinths of uncouth lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
wherein they desire to be
<hi>admired,</hi> rather than <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood:</hi>
not unlike their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
in <hi>Calvins</hi> time, of
whom hee saith, that they were
like <hi>Gipsees,</hi> that had gotten a
cheating, and canting language
proper to themselves;<note place="margin">Quemad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum circulato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, alii{que} <hi>errones,</hi> &amp;c peculiari sermonis genere u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuntur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de cap: 7 eiusdem libri.</note> and this is
one of the first principles of their
cousening trade. Surely the
Ministery of Christ, and his
Apostles, and of all godly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
is to <hi>cast off all cloakes of
shame, and to walke not in
craftinesse, neither to handle
the word of God deceitfully;
but in declaration of the truth,
to approve themselves to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mans conscience in the sight
of God.</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Cor: 4. 2</note> These cleane contrary
studie how to involve things in
<pb facs="10"/>
darknesse,<note place="margin">Non est humano aut seculi sensu in Dei rebus loquendū. Hilar. lib. 8 de Trinit.</note> and to obscure and
extinguish (if they could) the
light, and devise to speake as
in the riddles and oracles of old,
in ambiguous, and new-minted
phrases of their owne; as if the
phrase and expressions of the
Scriptures were onely to be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in opening of the mysteries
of Scriptures.<note place="margin">Sequamur <hi>loquendi regulam</hi> quam tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, neque extra illos fines eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemur.</note> But leaving these
bolde impostours to set the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost to schoole to teach him
to speake, wee acknowledge wee
have not onely a rule of <hi>doctrine</hi>
prescribed us in the Scriptures,
but also a rule of speaking, unto
which we must frame our selves;
and utter wholesome doctrine,<note place="margin">Calv. cap: 7.</note> in
<hi>wholesome words,</hi> and <hi>words
of understanding:</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lofty, arrogant, and subtle
manner of speaking, so as that
which is <hi>uttered</hi> cannot be well
<hi>understood,</hi> the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

      <note place="margin">1 Cor: 14. 9</note> 4. Nourish the grace of
humility, for God <hi>teacheth the
<pb facs="11"/>
humble:</hi> beware of curiosity and
affectation of novelties; be wise
to sobriety, and thinke it an high
wisedome to be established in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and received truthes. The
ficklenesse of hearers, and unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lednesse
in the grounds of holy
truth, together with the wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of opinions, have opened a
wide doore to impostours: and
while for want of judgement men
are ready with <hi>Salomons foole
to beleeve every thing,</hi> all the
labour and diligence of able and
godly Ministers is too weake,
to keepe multitudes from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
after the Ministers of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
furnished with all arts to
deceive, and to cheate them of
the truth which is <hi>according to
godlinesse.</hi> Against whom while
I endeavour to establish others,
I may seeme to forget my selfe,
and that I must incurre many
censures and contempts from
this lawlesse generation of men;
but my labour is with the Lord,
<pb facs="11"/>
and my reward is my conscience
of well-doing: I shall contemne
their contempt, love their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
hate their errours, and
studie while I am, to be
as serviceable to the
Church, and the
faith once given
to the Saints,
as I can.</p>
