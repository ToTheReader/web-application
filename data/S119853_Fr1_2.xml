   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I would have made any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I could stoope no lower then a Prince: the subject me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth asmuch, had it beene handled accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: and if it had, yet I durst not flye so high,
<pb facs="3"/>though <hi>Riolanus</hi> taketh boldnesse to tell <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of France, that the faculty deserveth the patronage of a Prince, both in respect of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, necessity, subject, and office; For Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie a twinne with the Divine, for so soone as the soule was breathed into man, it was then <hi>Corpus humanum vivens &amp; sanabile,</hi> and so the subject both of Phisicke
<pb facs="3"/>and Theologie: for had <hi>Adam</hi> never sinned, yet must his body have been preserved and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by diet, which is part of physick. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his fall so violated his equall temper, that as then hee became subject to mortalitie and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall decay. Then came in the necessity of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and ever since for this necessitie sake, hath the Almighty comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="4"/>an honour to bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Phisician, for he hath created him an Angell of mercy. Also in respect of the subject about which this art is exercised, it rightly challengeth precedence of all other faculties (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Theologie) for it is the body of man: a world, a wonder, the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God himselfe, and such a piece of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, as the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
<pb facs="4"/>would not vouchsafe to frame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Councell. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice then of preserving and maintaining it, must needs bee high and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and may well befit a King to exercise: Such esteeme it had obtained when <hi>Avicenna, Isaac,</hi> and other Princes were Phisicians: nay, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty hath crowned some to this day with ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Prince, witnesse the
<pb facs="5"/>house <hi>de Medicis.</hi> And if I should say it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties I dare attempt the proving of it. First in respect of government as Agents they ought to be obeyed in practice, even by Princes, for they are subject to sicknesse and must die like men; and Iudges which have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to condemne poore malefactors or others, yet they must receive their
<pb facs="5"/>sentence of death from the Phisician, if they come to a faire and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end. And as they make lawes for the well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and governing the Republique. So doth the Physician prescribe rules, for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of harmony through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this little world, but <hi>ab quantum mutatus ab il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo!</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, was his Motto in <hi>Homer.</hi> Now if <hi>Stercus</hi> and <hi>Ʋri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>can bee pickt out of the vanities of <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> it shal be thrown upon the purple robes of the Physician, by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant or impudent. For Science hath no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy but ignorance, nor is vilified among any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept pigritious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent persons. Then let the ignorant prattle, still the Physitian shall be the instrument of all common good in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,
<pb facs="6"/>and if no vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinarie man of any condition bee able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect any solid good, either to his King, Countrie, or selfe, as he is not, and the power of restoring and healing him, bee given principally to the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian. And if also upon that prolongation of life, if upon but one houre or moment eternity doth or may depend, then conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Physician
<pb facs="7"/>must bee acknowledged an instrument of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, principally to the body, accidentally to the soule. What if I shall seeme in the eyes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to advance my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, higher then their judgements wil imbrace? yet can I not justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a frowne, where a probable truth is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest: nor is my intention, hereby to undervalue any person or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="7"/>nor overvalue my owne, whatsoever <hi>Cicero</hi> shall affirme to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in these words <hi>Nemingem unquam, ne{que} Poetam, ne{que} Oratorem fuisse, qui quenquam me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorem, quàm se arbitrare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> but rather to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my faculty of those contempts and dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, which vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dispositions cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. What I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten concerning the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
<pb facs="8"/>subject, begs nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acceptation, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiastick favour, nor doe I quit my selfe of temerity; <hi>Suffenus</hi> will be a companion for the best learned, and some wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse will escape the tongue and pen of the wisest man, in this or that thing. Therefore I doe feare no frowne (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept from my naturall Prince) and those whom he hath commanded me
<pb facs="8"/>to feare and obey, and thus as a loyall subject I doe. In testimony wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have indeavoured to open this mysterie of life and health to my King and Countrey. If I have frustrated any expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the handling of it, let my <hi>velle</hi> be accepted, <hi>in magnis est voluisse sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi>
