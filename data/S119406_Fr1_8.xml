   <l>GOe stately forward in thy Spanish pace,</l>
   <l>And boldly stampe defiance in the face</l>
   <l>Of <hi>Romes</hi> proud Harlot, let her know she must</l>
   <l>Lie prostrate now to scorne, not to her lust.</l>
   <l>She that can make faire statues speake, may looke</l>
   <l>On her owne image, speaking in thy Booke</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="7"/>
Reproach vnto her selfe, that all may see</l>
   <l>Her vices and her sinnes Anatomy.</l>
   <l>Tis happy, the beguiled Fathers sonne</l>
   <l>So wisely should delude delusion.</l>
   <l>And in such mists of error should descry</l>
   <l>And tract the footesteps of an Heresie:</l>
   <l>Which leauing now at length, perchance it shall</l>
   <l>Be found a Comet, and presage a fall</l>
   <l>To <hi>Romes</hi> vpholders, whose chiefe strength doth lie</l>
   <l>In iugling and in false Diuinitie.</l>
   <l>But though they stand, thy Booke I take no lesse</l>
   <l>Than writings to intaile thee, happinesse.</l>
