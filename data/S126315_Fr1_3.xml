   <head>TO THE CHRISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AN READER, Health.</head>
   <p>CVrteous Reader, not many yeres since a book vvas pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished <hi>Of Christian Exercise, appertaining to Resolution:</hi> vvritten by a Iesuit beyond the seas, yet an Englishman, named M. <hi>Robert Parsons</hi>; vvhich Booke M. <hi>Edmund <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>unney</hi> hauing diligently perused, committed to the publique vievv of all indifferent iudgements: as glad, that so good matter proceeded from such infected people, and that good might arise thereby to the benefit of others. Since the manifestation of that Booke, the first Author thereof, named M. <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> hath enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the same Booke, vvith a second part and nevv Additions, vvherein hee hath concluded and finished his vvhole intent of the Resolution, and that vpon speciall causes, as himselfe sets dovvn in Preface in this maner.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Beeing admonished by the writings of diuers, that since the publishing of my first Booke, it hath been misliked in two principall points. First, that I speake so much of good works &amp; so little of faith. Secōdly, that I talked so largely of Gods
<pb facs="4"/>
iustice, and so briefly of his mercie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, conceiuing by the information of manie, that diuers persons, hauing a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in themselues to reade the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ormer booke, but yet being weake &amp; fearful to be touched so neere in conscience, as they imagined that Book did, durst neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedle therwith, being informed there was nothing in the same wherewith to entertaine themselues, but only such ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement matter of perswasion, as would greatly trouble and afflict them. For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of which inconueniencie, I haue framed this second part of that work, &amp; therein inserted diuers chapters and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of matters more plausible, &amp; of themselues more indifferent, wherewith the Reader may solace his minde, at such times as he findeth the same not willing to feele the spur of more earnest motion to perfection.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Hereupon grevv the occasion of his framing his second book: vvhich being perused by sundrie lerned men vvho haue thought it as vvorthy to bee seene as the first, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s novv (gentle Reader) presented to thy vievv: read it indifferently, and iudge thereof, as thou findest occasion.</p>
