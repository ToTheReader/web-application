                 <title>The perpetuitie of a regenerate mans estate : VVherein it is manifestly proued by sundry arguments, reasons and authorities. That such as are once truly regenerated and ingrafted into Christ by a liuely faith, can neither finally nor totally fall from grace. It is also proued, that this hath beene the receiued and resolued doctrine, of all the ancient fathers, of all the Protestant churches and writers beyond the seas, and of the Church of England. All the principall arguments that are, or may be obiected against it, either from Scripture, or from reason, are here likewise cleared and answered. By William Prynne Gent: Lincolniensis</title>

      </gap> them and discusse them.</p>
   <p>Your first accusation and objection, against our present <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> assertion is this. <hi>That there are none but Puritants who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

         </gap> it.</hi> Surely, if you so confidently affirme, that there are none but <hi>

         </gap>
      </hi> who oppose it: if any of you thinke I speake to harsh in this, I haue the warrant of our late and learned <hi>Soueraigne King Iames,</hi> to justifie mee, who hath sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them (<note n="g" place="margin">Declaration against <hi>Vortius.</hi>
      </note>) <hi>Heretickes, and Atheisticall Sectaries</hi> vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. But are there none but <hi>Puritans</hi> who defend it? Sure I am (and I hope I haue sufficiently proued it) that Christ himselfe, his <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles:</hi> that all the ancient <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and some <hi>Councells:</hi> that-all <hi>Protestant Churches,</hi> and

         </gap>:</hi> (at which there were the choice Diuines of most <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> &amp; <hi>reformed Churches:</hi>) that the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and all her chiefest worthies: and that <hi>King lames</hi> of blessed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, haue from time to time deliuered, published, defended, propagated and resolued this our present assertion as sound and orthodox: and yet are there none but <hi>Puritans,</hi> or are they all <hi>Puritans</hi> who defend it? Was <hi>Christ,</hi> his <hi>Prophets</hi> &amp; <hi>Apostels Puritans?</hi> were all the <hi>Fathers</hi> and the <hi>Primitiue Church, Puritans?</hi> are all the <hi>Protestant</hi> and reformed <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> beyond the seas, and all their sound and orthodox wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Puritans?</hi> was thè famous <hi>Synod of Dort,</hi> but a meere packe of <hi>Puritans?</hi> are the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and all her chiefest worthies, <hi>Puritans?</hi> or was <hi>King lames</hi> a <hi>Puritan,</hi> that none but <hi>Puritans</hi> should maintaine this truth? If you will condemne all these for <hi>Puritans,</hi> (as you must doe, if your accusation goe for currant truth,) and so make <hi>Puritans</hi> to be nothing else, (as they are in truth) but the true <hi>Church</hi> and Saints of God, who professe, propagate and maintaine the truth and puritie of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and will not bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne or seduced from it: then we willingly acknowledge the accusation to be true, and account it, not a blemish, but a grace and honour to our cause: but if you will haue none of these to be the <hi>Puritans</hi> which you accuse: your accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then: <hi>That none but Puritans defend this assertion,</hi> must needes be false: vnlesse you know to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> maintained it in former times, &amp; such as doe defend it now. Now that I may giue a further answer vnto this false, scandalous, and malitious accusation, I will a little inquire what kinde of creature this <hi>Puritan</hi> should be, which makes such a stirre and businesse in the world, and is so much accused, condemned, hated, persecuted, inueigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at and spoken against; that so the odiousnesse and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> of the very name, may not impeach the worth the credit, the qualitie, or condition of the person on whom it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>. Certainely, the onely <hi>Puritan</hi> that is now aymed at, and so commonly accused and spoken against, is nothing else in
<pb facs="11"/>
veritie and truth, (if you will but lay aside the name that so you may behold him as he is). <hi>But a godly and syncere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, who stickes close vnto the word of God both in his iudgement and his practise, being more abstemious from all kinde of sinue, more diligent and frequent in all holy duties, and more industrious to serue and please the Lord in all things, then those who doe condemne, reproach and censure him.</hi> Hee that now sticks fast and close vnto the word of truth, and will not be withdrawne from it: hee that shewes forth the power and efficacy of grace in the constant holinesse of his life: hee that is diligent and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Gods seruice, and squares his life and actions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his word: hee that makes a conscience of all his waies and workes, and will not be so vitious and licentious, so riotous and deboist: so prophane dissolute and desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked as other men: hee, and hee onely, is the <hi>Puritan</hi> which is now so much condemned: hee onely is the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> who now is made the very <hi>But</hi> and obiect of all mens ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, malice, enuy, scorne and disdaine: hee onely is the <hi>Puritan</hi> whom you doe here accuse. Take but away the vgly, horrid and mishapen name and visard of a <hi>Puritan,</hi> (which doth now wholly ouercloud, the persons on whom it is imposed, and present them in a strange and different forme from what they are in truth) and consider but the persons, the liues, the graces, and the inside of those men who are reputed sor the greatest <hi>Puritans,</hi> disrobed and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cased of the name it selfe; and then the greatest and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Ante-puritan</hi> of you all, (if his conscience be not strangly cauterized) must bee forced to confesse, that as it was with the <hi>Christians</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> so now it is with <hi>Puritans,</hi> among such as seeme to be <hi>Christians:</hi> (<note n="h" place="margin">Tertul.

And as for the <hi>Church of Geneua,</hi> and the <hi>Belgick Churches,</hi> though they differ from vs in their discipline, yet none but <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Arminians</hi> can cauell at their Doctrine: if you are such (as you must be such, if you continue to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our present assertion) goe on and cauell at them whiles you will: your cauells will but honour them, not disgrace them: and this our cause shall neuer fare the worse, because it hath these <hi>Patrons</hi> to defend it. Since therefore the quality

of the <hi>Patrons</hi> of this truth, can neuer change the nature of it, and make it not to be a truth: since <hi>Puritans</hi> appearing in their proper colours, are men of greater grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse than the best of those who slander them and stile them so; and are not such in truth, as they are commonly taken and reported for to be: since <hi>Christ,</hi> his <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the whole <hi>Church of God</hi> from time to time haue propagated, embraced, resolued, and defended this our present assertion as sound, and there were neuer none as yet, but <hi>Pelagians, Papists,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> nay, <hi>Atheists</hi> that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it: then this your accusation, <hi>that none but Puritans doe defend it,</hi> must needs be false and forged: at least it must bee idle and impertinent; because it is but a meere euasion and waiuing of the <hi>Controuersie,</hi> a meere Calumnie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and a falling foule vpon the persons of syncere and vpright Christians who defend it, for want of truth or lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to answer to their workes.</p>

      <hi>factious, and seditious persons.</hi> Indeed <hi>St. Paul</hi> had this very accusation laid against him by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> because hee was so zealous to maintaine, propagate, and defend the <hi>Gospell</hi> and the word of God: and I am verily perswaded, if <hi>St. Paul</hi> were now vpon the earth, as one vnknowne to you, that you would presently flie vpon him, accusing and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him for an <hi>Arch-Puritan,</hi> for a <hi>Pestilent, factious, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious fellow;</hi> since you accuse his followers of the selfe-same crime, for defending this our Doctrine and assertion, which he himselfe hath commended and recorded to them, when as they are nothing like so hote and zealous for this truth as he. But are there none but pestilent, factious, and seditious persons, who maintaine our present assertion: then <hi>Christ himselfe,</hi> his <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> then all the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and all the <hi>Churches</hi> of God from age to age were but a faction: and a packe of pestilent and seditious persons: then the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and the Reformed <hi>Churches</hi> in forraine parts, are but a faction: then the <hi>Synode of Dort,</hi> and our late

Soueraigne <hi>King</hi> IAMES, who was the cause of assembling and calling of it, together with all the other <hi>Germaine States and Princes</hi> who were parties to it, were but a faction: for all these haue maintained, defended, and resolued this very as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of ours as sound and orthodox. If these were not a faction, (as none but <hi>Heathens, Atheists,</hi> or <hi>Diuells</hi> dare to stile them) then surely those are not a faction who defend it now: and so this false and scandalous accusation, which you labour to fasten vpon others that are guiltlesse, must truly light and rest vpon your selues, who striue with all your might and maine, and lay your heads and force toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to question, vnsettle, and suppresse, this ancient and approued truth, which hath beene so long established, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, and resolued in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and in this our <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church.</hi> If one man should set an house on fire, and another shauld indeauour for to quench it: If one man should raise and stirre vp strif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

I pray which of the two should be the pestilent, turbulent, factious, and seditious person? which of them is it who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues the blame? he that puts out the fire, or hee that kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles it? hee that seekes for to appease the strife, or hee that stirres it vp? he that heales the wound, or hee that giues it? he that defends the truth, or he that doth oppose it? Now those whom you accuse for pestilent, factious, and seditious persons, they doe but labour to extinguish and put out the flame: it is you that kindle, nourish, and increase it: they doe but appease the strife: it is you only that stirre it vp: they doe but seeke to heale and to repaire, the wounds and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of our <hi>Church,</hi> it is you that giue and make them: they doe but shelter and defend the truth, it is you only that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it, and seeke to quell and roote it out: therefore you onely are the <hi>Incendiaries</hi> and fire-brands, you only are the turbulent, factious, and seditious spirits, you only (and not

Indeede the truth is this: you know your cause is bad: you know that this your Doctrine is but false and counterfeite, and quite repugnant to the Doctrine of our <hi>Church:</hi> and therefore you dare not put it to the tryall, for feare it should be proued to be false: you dare not go about to proue our position to be vnsound, or to giue an answer vnto such as haue defended it: all your labour is to quell it,
