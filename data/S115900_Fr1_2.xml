   <head>To the right honorable Syr Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher Hatton, Knight, Captaine of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Garde, Vicechamberlayne to her Highnes, and one of her Maiesties most honourable priuie Counsayll, Barnabe Ryche wisheth long and happie lyfe, with increase of Honour, as your Noble heart both desireth and deserueth.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE common and vulgare sorte of people (Right Honorable) are accustomed to estimate and valewe of such thinges as shall happen to their sight, more rather according to the credit and opinion that they haue conceyued in the authour, then for the substance or matter of that is eyther sayde, or written.</p>
   <p>For better proofe I could alleadge sundrie examples, but leauing many others, this fable may suffice (fayned by the Poetes) of the man, which by the consent of all the goddes, was deemed for his feauture in euery proportiō to be so pure and perfect, that with one generall verdite they all commended him to bee without any maner imperfection.</p>
   <p>In the ende <hi>Momus</hi> taking the vewe of this goodly personage, and throughly perusing the excellencie of this creature, perceyued yet one faute which all the rest had missed: which was, that there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a windowe in his brest, through which his thoughtes might bee looked into, whereby might be seene what there remayned within him.</p>
   <p>Meaning that there were no man that almost might be founde, howe comely so euer he was in his personage, how gallantly so euer he went in his apparell, howe smoothly so euer he could speake with his tongue, howe demurely so euer he seemed in countenance, nor howe plausible so euer he appeared in his other demeanours, yet if his secrete thoughtes might be seene into, and that the priuities of his heart might be throughly considered of, there is no doubt, but there would be founde some great corruption yet remayning.</p>
   <p>If this faute had bene founde by <hi>Pallas</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> questionlesse it would haue bene registred amongest the sayinges and sentences of the wise: but proceeding from him whome they rather had in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, then esteemed in any credit, it was reputed to be but a mocke and a scorne.</p>
   <p>I haue here (right Honourable) rashly and aduenterously taken vpon me to become a writer, wherein a great number (I knowe) will
<pb facs="3"/>
likewise condemne me, and the rather considering my simplicitie &amp; trayning vp, which hath not bene so much with my penne, but more with my pyke, nor in the scholes amongst learned clarkes, but rather in the fields amongst vnletered companions, or as some will terme them, amongst a company of rustike souldiers.</p>
   <p>Wherefore most humbly I desire your Honour to accept of these my slender trauayles in good parte, the which I do here present vnto you with my simple seruice during my lyfe, to be at your Honorable disposition: And although I do know both the one and the other to be to farre insufficient to be presented vnto you, yet though not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mine owne deseruing, eyther for the valew of that I haue written, yet according to your accustomed clemencie and goodnes, that you would vouchsafe to protect and shroud them with your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable countenance, whereby they may be made more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the readers, and be the better welcome to such as shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use them.</p>
   <p>I do here omitte to follow the order of some writers, which is with great circumstance to blase the vertues of such as they choose to be patrons of their workes: for what may bee sayde sounding more to your aduancement, then what your selfe haue already gayned, whose noblenes hath not onely aduaunced you to so great honour, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in euery mans iudgement hath made you to be deemed worthie to enioye it?</p>
   <p>But I may not here omit, that amongst other honorable roomes whereto you haue bene called, what a president you haue begunne, whereby our captaines of Englande may learne and gather light.</p>
   <p>I meane where her Maiestie hath worthily appointed you to bee Captayne of a worthy bande, what care and consideration you haue euer had, aswell of the maners and conditions, as otherwyse of the personage and abilitie of any one that you would permit, whereby her Maiestie is guarded with a bande of men, not onely indued with actiuitie, but also with honestie.</p>
   <p>Howe much they be bound to your Honour, that was the onely meane to her Maiestie, for the amending of their pay, whereby they are made the better able to do her seruice, I leaue for them selues to reporte, and do but onely wishe that our Captaynes of Englande would by your Honourable example, take such light, whereby they might be made the more renowmed.</p>
   <p>Thus desiring your Honour to pardon my boldnes &amp; simplicitie, I humbly take my leaue.</p>
