   <p>For the Treatise it selfe, by reason
there are but too many of that depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
pallate, to whom all seems insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
and disgustfull, that is, seasoned
with any taste of pietie, to occur to
such infirme appetites, I have served
up their meat in little pieces, thus cut
up unto their hands, which in greater
perhaps they would not like so well.
To make it a more spreading work, if
I would, I could have beat it thinner,
<pb facs="7"/>
(the matter was plyable enough unto
the hammer) but I like not works of
that raritie, defined by the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
<hi>Sub magna quantitate sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia
parva.</hi> And hold in books as
in coyne, those of most value in least
quantitie the best. That I am so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in Latin citation, those I am
sure who are verst in the language,
will easily pardon it; the rest, I hope,
will not be difficile, when they shall
find in the reading, the sense compleat
without it. If any demand, why then
I inserted it, I answer, works of this
fabrick, consolidate and built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
authority of holy Writ, without
frequent Texts of it, for foundation
and cement, are worthily esteemed,
but weake and loose-written things.
Now that I chose the Latin to any
<pb facs="7"/>
other vulgar; I presumed, as a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
they would give me leave to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
my materials, when I supposed
them at best hand to be got. But I
detaine thee too long in the porch, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
with <hi>Malchus</hi> thou thinkest
much to have an eare in the passion:
Enter the work, and if thou receivest
but as much profit in reading, as I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
thee in writing, we shall both
be happy in it. Farewell:</p>
