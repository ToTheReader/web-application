Amen. For as moch as lieth hyd in the letter &amp; vnknowne to the laye people the greatter parte of the profyt of holy scryptures nowe cōmaūded by the Kynges Maiestye to be had and red in Englyshe, for the the which thankes are to be gyuen to god, hygh laude and prayse to the Kynges Maiestye, that wold his people shuld not lake the necessary foode of their soules, whiche is the worde of god to feade them spiritually in their soules, that they shuld not perysh, but lyue here a lyfe acceptable to god alwaye in the loue and feare of god, by trewe knowlege of him, whiche knowlege commyth by hearynge readynge studyinge of goddes worde, or by preachynge of it, or by readynge of some exposition or cōmentary wrytyn in latyne or in ynglysh, where in godds word is purely and syncerly opened and declared to goddes glory and to the profyt of other.</p>
   <p>That part of this great profyt shuld the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be knowne and optayned I (although I knowe my talent is of the lest sorte) haue wrytten this exposition in ynglyshe vpon the Epistle of saynt Paule to the Philippians for the glory of god more to be dilated, his

word better knowne, god loued &amp; dread more and for their sakes that do not vnderstonde the latyne tonge, but onely can red ynglyshe, that these might attayne to some parte of the frute and profyt of holy scryptures that lyeth hyd in the letter, and vnknowne to the most parte of thē that can rede ynglyshe. Although they shall rede in ynglyshe the letter of holy scrypture, and do vnderstande the ynglyshe tonge, yet oftymes they nother attayne vnto the mynde of the holy goost, by whose inspira<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion the holy wryters of the scripture of god wrote. 2. Peter. 1. Nor yet they atrayne to the great comforte and consolation of holy scryp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures. Therfore some reading the letter of the holy scryptures haue lytyll swetnes therin or loue to god the authour of holy scripture, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth lytell comforte or nothyng at al, yea some gather poyson for good meat, error or heresy for veryte and treweth, death and damnatiō for health and saluation whiche commeth of them selfes, and not of holy scriptures, for the scriptures of god be the necessary foode of the soule. Mat. 4. Lyght to our feet. Psalme. 118. The worde of trewth that saueth our soules Iacob. 1. That bryngeth the spirite of god and lyfe euerlastyng. Iohn. 5. But this frute lyeth hyd in the letter to many readers and appereth to many to be nothyng lesse, thē that it is in very dede, it appereth to some to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poyson to kyll them then holsome meate to feade them and saue their lyues, rather to brynge in errors &amp; hereses thē to expelle them and to bryng verite and truth, rather to hold

      </gap> power of the byshop of Rome and all romyshe dreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Bycause I dyd se fewe or none to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute this thynge but many rather to study to kepe the people in ignoraunce error and in euyll opynyons styl. Therfore I as one of the lest learned of all, as it hath pleased god to giue me his grace herein, haue set forth rudely (more regardynge to open the syncere doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne of the holy goost, to goddes glory and to the edifyinge of other then I haue studed for eloquence in wordes) an exposition in the Epistle of sanyt Paule to the Philippiās openynge this parte of holy scripture as I trust accordyng to the mynde of the holy goost by whom it was wryten, exhortynge all men to reade the holy scriptures and expositions of them with all reuerence to god and to his worde in meakenes of spirite desyrous to know god, loue him and feare him and to know their dewty to god and to there nygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure and to vse their knowlege with all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryete and to flee vyce and take vertu, yf not for loue of god yet for feare of punishment of god for vyce and synne, for the ende of synne is death Ro. 6. And so I trust I haue opened this Epistle accordynge both to the mynde of the holy goost the author of holy scriptures, and also to the trewe vse of holy scriptures with al sobriete not passynge the boundes of scripture. And to do this thīg I haue vsed the
<pb facs="7"/>
helpe both the tonges and also of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyky authors that best declareth the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures and most for the glory of god and the edifiyng of the vnlearned in the latine tonge, as shall appere more planly to all them, that wyll reade with a good mynde desyrous to know god and loue god this rude exposition partly set forth for the discharge of my consci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence and small talent gyuen me of god not to be ydle, but to exercise it to goddes glory and to the edifycatiō of other, and partly to excite better learned men then I am to set forth in prynte some commentares or expositions in latine or in englyshe, that goddes word might the better be knowne and god more gloryfied of all mē, vyce destroyed and vertu and godly lyuyng brought in the stede of vyce vsed and euyll lyuynge. And so I wolde wyshe that hye Ruelers and bysshoppes wolde set lerned men on worke, and cause them to set forth some godly expositions vpon the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that the vnlearned people shulde not erre nor take amysse the holy scriptures, or otherwyse gather ony sence of them, then the holy goost wylleth. And for that cause and other I haue here in this lytell epistle shewed my mynde after the talent gyuen me of god. yf this my rude labors &amp; paynes do agre with holy scriptures as I thynke they do agre, I beseche the gentle Reader accepte them in goodworth, and gyue laude and prayse to god the author of all goodnes and not to the wryter of this exposition whose mynd is and euer haue bene to profyt all men and to hurte
<pb facs="7"/>
no man. And yf this my rude labors shalbe-thought profytable to the christiane congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Englande as I iudge it shalbe coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, god wyllynge I intende to set forth lyke thynges in other places of holy scripture in englyshe or in latine, yf it shalbe thought good or elles I wyll absteyne from wrytynge. But yf any thyng by ignorance or otherwyse hath escaped me in this rude exposition that I haue here wryten other wyse then goddes worde teacheth refuse it gentyll Reader, and knowe that I am a man and maye erre and that to one man be not all knowlege gyuen lesse he shulde be to proude in him selfe and contemne al other. Therfore as holy wryters of scriptures saith of their doctrine so I say of my sainges or wrytinges, that I wold they shulde be iudged trwly by the holy scriptures and no furder to be beleued then they maye be prouede and confyrmed by holy scriptures as knoweth god to whome be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory euer AMEN.</p>
