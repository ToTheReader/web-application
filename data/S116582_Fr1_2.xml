   </head>
   <p>GOd forgeue me my negligence, that I haue not vsed the pretious giftes of God laid vp within me, more to his glory in my time: Yet I thanke God that I haue not vsed them in vaine glorie, or to please the vaine affections of men.</p>
   <p>After my death my enimies will become my friendes, except some that knowe me not, and those which haue no feelinge of the trueth: For I haue faithfully serued the Lorde and my Prince in a good conscience.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>A Preacher saying vnto him: It is for thee a great blessing that thou shal depart in peace, and goe from many troubles that our brethren shall beare and see. He answered:</hi> I shall goe from many troubles and leaue many behinde me. If the Lord hath appointed that his saintes shall suppe togither, why goe I not to them: but if there bee any doubting or staggering, our Lord reueale the trueth.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Hearing one say, He hoped that in his silence, his minde was neuertheles exercised in godly meditation. He answered:</hi> As a poore frayle man, and the least of all the elect saints, yet beleeuing and lookinge on Christ my saluation. We shall all meete togither with the sweet harmony of the Lord of hostes. What a cloude of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses is heere: yet a little while and we shall see our hope. We haue ouertaken the endes of the worlde which is come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, and we shall quicklie receyue the ende of our hope which we have waited for. Afflictions, sicknes and payne, are but the worlds portions from the Lord. It is not to begin for a moment, but to continewe in the feare of God all our dayes: for in the twinckling of an eye we shalbe taken away. Dallie not with the worde of God, make not light of it: Blessed are they that vse their tongues well when they haue it.</p>
