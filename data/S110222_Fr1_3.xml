   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, I haue endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to discouer and lay open the vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie filthinesse, and hainous wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of foure sinnes, wherewith our land is much corrupted and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; namely, the abuses of Oathes in vaine swearing and impious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing; Drunkennesse, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Briberie. I am not ignorant how distastfull these discourses will be to their palats, who haue alreadie relli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the sweetnesse of these sinnes, and doe still nuzle them in their bosomes, as their dearest darlings. But I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie learned, that if it bee the chiefe end of my labours to please men,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.10.</note> I shall but thereby get this testimonie vnto mine owne conscience, that I am not the seruant of Iesus Christ: yet may I truly say thus much for the answering of all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils and calumniations, that I haue not willingly intended to displease any man, but haue laboured to aduance the good of all. For God and mine owne conscience can beare mee witnesse, that I haue not in any spleneticke and satyricall humour, aimed at the disgrace of any mans person, professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or calling, but haue had mine onely quarrell against their sinne; nor yet discouered their nakednes that they may be laughed to scorne; but that themselues taking notice of it, may hide it, and turning from their sinnes by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb facs="6"/>may escape those iudgements which they haue deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the day of Gods visitation. If any notwithstanding my iust apologie shall yet take exceptions, they shall but by their kicking shew that I rub on their sore, and by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning manifest their guiltinesse; for in particular I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse none, who doe not stand accused before God, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of their owne consciences. And these of all others haue least cause to be offended, seeing if at all I handle them roughly, it is not to hurt, but to cure them of their wounds of sinne, which otherwise might fester to their destruction. And thus praying that these and all other my labours may tend to Gods glorie, and the saluation of his elect, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thee to Gods protection,<note place="margin">Act. 20.32.</note> and <hi>vnto the word of his grace, which is able to build thee further, and to giue thee an inheritance among them which are sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
