   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Author of this Treatise was perswaded to Pen the reasons of his opinion against absolute Reprobation, that he might satisfie a worthy friend of his, who required it. VVhat satisfaction that learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, his friend, hath received by these reasons, I know not: but sure I am, they have given good content to some others, who have read them, and doe still desire a Copie of them for their further use. To ease whose paines in transcribing this Treatise, it doth now appeare in this forme. If any of contrary opinion, shall undertake to answer or refute it; I wish, he would set downe his opinion and reasons with that perspicuitie and modestie, that our
<pb facs="3"/>
Author set downe his. Such a course of disputing will gaine more credit to himself and his cause, then volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Vagaries about impertinent things. If any shall use railing speeches, or unnecessary diversions from the cause; I shall ever interpret that to be a strong signe of a weake cause: or, at least, I shall think it to be an argument of an obstinate minde, who neither knoweth how to yeeld to the Truth, nor to defend his error. I hope the Reader, who loveth his owne salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be a more indifferent Iudge in a question, which concerneth him so nearly. And so I leave him to Gods blessing.</p>
