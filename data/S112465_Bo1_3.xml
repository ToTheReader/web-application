      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ehold a strange passage,
frō a Triumph to a Tombe.
I had prepared this discourse
as a Table of the Kings most
memorable actions,, and did
desire to end it by the great effects which were
expected of that mighty Army, which was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the frontier; but in a moment all my
thoughtes were ouerthrowne, and this remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which should haue beene beautified with
the trophees of his armes is filled with the
mournefull spoiles of his life. As sometime the
<pb n="121" facs="165"/>
Citty of Athens was at one instant transported
with great ioy for the happy returne of <hi>These<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
from his voyage of Candy, and afflicted
with exceeding griefe for the death of King
<hi>Aegeus</hi> his father, witnessing both the one
and the other passion by that cry, which since
hath beene solemnly obserued by the Oschopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> whereof the first is a sound of
triumph and courage, and the other a voyce of
amazement and affliction; euen so France full
of contents, and apt to receiue greater, sawe it
selfe it an instant plung'd in a gulfe of sorrowes
and afflictions for the execrable paricide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
on the sacred person of her King.</p>
   <p>This misery, the bottomlesse spring of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
and complaints, hath made this Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyre
imperfect, for whereas it should haue
ended by the glory of things done, I cut it off
with the hope of that which was to doe. It
shall haue perfection enough if it may appeare
among so many goodly and rich peeces, which
the mournefull Muses haue erected about the
tombe of this great <hi>Achilles.</hi> They haue not
<pb n="122" facs="166"/>
ceased these ten moneths, to honour him with
crownes of all prices, of all fashions, and of all
sorts of flowers. What may bee done more? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
some leaues which they haue left all bathd
with teares, the which as much obliged as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but lesse diligent then any, I adde vnto this
publick sorrow.</p>
   <p>If any one say that I performe this duty too
late, this griefe is alwayes in season. It is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
and violent, as it growes more bitter by
consolation, it resists reason, it is renued with
time, it is comprehended more by feeling then
discourse, constancie cannot vanquish it, nor
wisdome dissemble it. I wept when as all
the world spake, and now when as the time
of mourning wipes away teares, I continue
and renew my complaints. My afflictions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
when as I heare of consolations. Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
growne to a custome, are pleasing to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
men, the obiects reuiue them, and the
Historie of this great King, which is the
Rocke I rowle dayly, furnishing mee at euery
moment where-with to make his life to bee
<pb n="123" facs="166"/>
admired, giues mee but too much subiect to
lament his death. Farewell Reader, and
passe on.</p>
