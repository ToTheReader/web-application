   <head>A Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are few resolutions that are filled with more hazard, then those which are vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to giue satisfaction to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered humors; wherein whilest euerie man would seeme eyther not to erre at all, or to haue some colourable excuse for that which they had rather call freedom of conscience and Christian libertie then tearme errour, the state of the Church hangeth ballanced with some oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site contrarieties, as if it were the most profitable wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to stand in consultation, and not to aduenture to hold any thing. Doubtlesse no cause hath gained lesse to the defendants then this of the Church gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for first being in it selfe barren, it hath little wherein there can be vse of the ancient Fathers: for whilest men out of their owne fancie will frame dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, wee can but in the generall alleage the constant moderation of our forefathers, and without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for particulers, satisfie them so farre as Religion and reason will giue leaue: Secondly, all men are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with a pittie naturally toward such whom they suppose to suffer for the testimonie of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whilest others are suspected to flatter the present state; as if nothing could be reputed honest, which were not a bold opposition (vnder colour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciene)
<pb facs="5"/>
to a setled gouernment, vnto these may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that which is not the least euill, that whilest impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience &amp; zeale openeth the mouthes of our enemies for any fault in our answering committed by vs; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy doth open the mouthes of our supposed friends, for that which may be thought to be done well. So that though the recōpence hath nothing in it to be desired, this only remaineth as the comfort against all trobles, that it is a right vse of our small talent dispensed with Humility and dutie for the benefit and peace of the Church of Christ; <hi>where,</hi> first in the daies of our late dread soueraigne of blessed memory some fearing su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition might returne (like a troublesome guest, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther long nor farr absent) sundry of the most learned &amp; most sincere, not called to the honor &amp; the burden of a Bishopprick were consulted with all, to giue satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to such who seemed rather to follow the example of forraine Churches, then to haue iust reasons to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like their owne.</p>
   <p>To this end letters were sent from the reuerend fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers of the Church, to desire the resolution concer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning the apparell of ministers, Ceremonies, and other indifferent things to <hi>M. Bullinger, F. Martyr, Gualter, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> &amp; others, men without comparison for integrity &amp; learning equall to the best in those times, &amp; not much exceeded by any, to my knowledge that haue liued since; their answers to these questions for the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our brethren (if they loue peace) we thought to haue published in the end of this treatise.<note place="margin">By Master Cartwright Martin. &amp;c</note> After these times, by the suggestion of some both from Geneua &amp; Scotland, the Church had not long rest, but that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers admonitions, were written to the Parliament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring a new discipline, sundry Inuectiues against the
<pb facs="5"/>
Bishops &amp; diuers vnhallowed pāphlets from the brood of <hi>Cham,</hi> who gloried in the discouery of the supposed nakednes of their owne fathers; a little more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rigor (for their malypart boldnes had awaked the accustomed clemēcy of a most gracious prince) by the execution of some few, stopped in a manner for a time the mouthes, &amp; the Pennes of all; letting the ages that come after vnderstand thus much, that writings how learned soeuer (as what could be more excellent for modesty &amp; iudgement,<note place="margin">D. Whitgift.</note> then the pains of that most worthy Archbishop) are able to do litle good for the quiet of the Church, if the magistrates be wanting to giue aid: &amp; that they who at first make holines &amp; refor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mation the scope of whatsoeuer they say or write, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to aime at nothing but to make men better; in the end, by degrees fall to a vanity prophanely to libel to make others laugh, &amp; in my weak opiniō few things euer hapned in this kingdom more auailable to breed Atheisme then that was. But the scope being for a Presbyteriall discipline it found with the most of that faction this fauour to be reprooued no more sharpely then the sin of the sons of <hi>Hely</hi>: hitherto all stroue for a Presbitery, wherof at the first comming of our most gracious soueraigne to this kingdom many were filled with a vain hope, doubtle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> deceiued by such men, who either vnderstood not the state of this cōmonwealth or had little care of the happy prosperity of this Church.</p>
   <p>But in the end, when authority was more blessed, &amp; assisted from aboue, then to be deluded with such mists or to giue any hope to couetous affections gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily longing for the fall of Bishops (which one Act of preseruing their state and honour) amongst many thousand arguments of fauour shewed towards them shall stirre vp the praiers of all that now liue for
<pb facs="6"/>
the continuance of his state, and make his memorie blessed amongst all posterities to the worlds end; then I say many began to make a rent in the Church, and to breake from vs (chusing rather (with what consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they know) to forsake their function and calling, then to yeeld their conformitie to the cerimonies of this Church; which hitherto by themselues were euer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eputed as things indifferent; and doubtlesse neither so many nor so dangerous, but in this time of light and knowledge they may be admitted without supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all: forseeing (as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> saith) we be so free as we haue but a few Ceremonies, and those easie and gentle, it would be an intollerable thing, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be condemned,<note place="margin">P Martyr. 20 C. Coun. part. 4. cap 11. sect. 9</note> if we should not performe them without corruption. I wish those to consider well, who are desirous to make these things simply vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, both how they differ from themselues and others at other times, and what bondage (vnder the name of libertie) they impose vpon the Church by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying her authoritie to ordaine ceremonies; in which if little or nothing be left vnto her, neither shall she need much the directiō of Gods spirit to guid her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations, nor challenge any great obedience in her owne name, if all things that are, be simply either good or euill: to which errour if Zeale or opinion shall tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any, he must eyther make the worship of God to be without Ceremonies, or those Ceremonies simply necessarie, without which there is no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe; none that I know would haue religion to want all Ceremonies, sauing onely those who would haue all men to want Religion: some there are which wish that these ceremonies were simple, chast, and few, that is not significant at all: It were doubtlesse a
<pb facs="6"/>
great folly (if not an idlenes in God seruice) eyther to admit or retaine those ceremonies, which they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed should signifie nothing; but moderate minds do think otherwise, that neither ceremonies nor their sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, are to be misliked as vnlawfull, whilest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is signified, but that which thēselues wil account lawfull. So then, neither depriuing the Church of the vse of ceremonies in diuine worship, nor making these of that vnchangeable nature as simply eyther her good or euill, but onely as things of themselues indifferent, (for better place and respect they neuer retained in our Church) we will briefely set downe for the satisfying of some men; that indifferent things by Ciuill or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall constitution do change their nature, and by vertue of commaundement become necessarie; so that eyther they must be not indifferent, but simply vnlawfull; or being indifferent, such as by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement are made necessarie. To denie that there are things indifferent, is to take Christian libertie from men: and to denie the ceremonies in their owne nature to be such, is to take al liberty from the Church for without these what is there wherein the Church is not expresly and necessarily directed by the word of God? we are taught that all things which happē vnder the compasse of human action are of three sorts; eyther good, or euill, or indifferent: of the first and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kinde are all things commaunded or forbidden in the law of God, (except the ceremonie of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath) commaunded to the Iewes but not to vs: Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things are of that nature, that by themselues, and properly they are neither good nor euill, but in respect of some other thing,<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> as to drinke Wine, Ale, or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to vse these or those garments which of themselues
<pb facs="7"/>
haue no holines in thē, &amp; by which a man is not made better: &amp; of these only, &amp; such like, the Apostle speaketh, all things are lawful forme:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.22.</note> wherin whilst he professed his freedome, yet he acknowledgeth that he became boūd, &amp; to the Iew a Iew, to those that were vnder the law, as vnder the law, to those that were without the law, as without the law, to the weak he became weake, to cōclude, he became al to al, that he migh win some: thus he made a vow at <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> circumcised <hi>Timothy</hi> which he did not to <hi>Titus,</hi> by reason of false brethren crept in to spy their liberty: so that all things were law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful, not only which cōcerned cōmon life, but also in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies &amp; the outward worship of God, in which (as one wel noteth) the spiritual worship is shadowed, but not contained. But when experience had taught, that such liberty became dangerous to the Church &amp; the cōmonwelth, being turned oftētimes into a lice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tious impiety or superstition, vnlesse it were bounded with some limits, the one sort aduenturing to do all things that seemed pleasing, and thereby reiecting the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as too great a burthē, being things not as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God, who will be worshipped in truth: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strictly obseruing all ceremonies, as if the greatest holines &amp; principall parts of Gods worship consisted in them: thus the one led to prophanenes, &amp; the other to superstition, the two dangerous extreames o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> true religion. For which mischiefe necessitie hath onely found out this remedy, to moderate this liberty that it neither erre on the right hand nor the left, that it ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come short nor go beyond a meane; therfore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith all things are lawful for me, but al things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit not, all things are lawful, but al things are not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diēt, wherin he toucheth the extemities at both hands. Now then the means to keep our liberty, that it neither
<pb facs="7"/>
be too much, nor too little are of two sorts: general, &amp; speciall: the general is charity the principal direction of mans life. For whatsoeuer we desire to do or omit (being in it selfe indifferēt) charity must consider how farre to proceed without offence: for why should our liberty (saith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) be condēned of another mans con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>science? &amp; therfore in this case we are rather to depart from that liberty we haue, then to be offensiue to those who are more weak, &amp; so giue occasion for thē to speak euil of vs, &amp; of that which was left free: for charity wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs in these things to respect others more then our selues, &amp; rather to omit that which is lawful for vs, thē to do that which is hurtfull for them: the other rule to limit indifferēt things is speciall: which is not so distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht from the other, as if it were without charity, but that charity which ought to be in all, is here directed in a speciall maner: for howsoeuer charity so extendeth it selfe that it may serue to all parts of our life, as though we need not to be directed by any other law, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause al men are not so wel sighted perfectly to discern what is expedient at all times, &amp; for that the offices of charity are somtimes changed, (for times &amp; occasions may fal out, that things iust &amp; to be done, may be clean contrary) therfore there is required an experienced and mature iudgment to determine what is fit, least whilst we labour to profit we iniury the Church &amp; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, in which are contained the charities of all. God therefore respecting mans weaknes hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed magistrates &amp; Gouernours in both, to serue as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ies to guide &amp; direct what is fit to be done, &amp; to this end to make lawes concerning indifferent things, that so the whole body may be gouerned with <hi>comelines, order,</hi> and <hi>edification.</hi> This no man can denie, but such as desire to be exempted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rom all lawes; For executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherof God hath appoynted Magistrates to be his
<pb facs="8"/>
Ministers to whom we must be subiect, not for feare but for conscience; obeying also our spirituall rulers, for they watch ouer vs to giue account vnto God for our soules.<note place="margin">Rom. 13 Heb. 13</note> And therefore no man can denie, but that in things of this nature, all men are to be gouerned by their lawes; which whilest they are in force, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or forbidding binde the conscience as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue doth. Herein if any would seeme to see more then those that doe make lawes (a thing not likely se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most, and the wisest, and the best experienced are assembled to that end) we cannot think it warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to be so presumptuous, nor expedient to dispute (but in place of counsell) of the equitie of lawes when they are once established: this moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if all men had obserued, doubtlesse long since this Church had beene blessed with a happie peace. But if any man be perswaded that the ceremonies inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are not of this nature, it is but an opinion lately sprung vp, whereunto the necessitie of obedience in indifferent things hath compelled them to flie, and it satisfieth vs (though it cannot then) that with all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, and the Church we do thinke otherwise: God grant vs all in due time truly to thinke and to speake the same things. Farewell.</p>
