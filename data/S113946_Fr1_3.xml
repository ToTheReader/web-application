      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eaders, whether ye be men or women, kinde or curst, friendly or frumping, all is one to me. I respect not your kinds, kindred or kindnesse; your kinds being but natures instruments for propagation of mankinde. And for other respects, which are worldly, I force not at all, for Truth is spirituall, essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, internall, and cares not for outward formalities. Onely I weigh your tongues the <hi>Detracting</hi> instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Sathan</hi> sor both your genders, to the pretu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of your deere soules. In your tongues I finde no more distinction or denomination of male and female then I finde of your soules, which likewise are ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ther male nor female, but al one, all alike in both your sexes. I finde this originall accident coincident aswell to tongues as soules, that there be good <hi>Aesops</hi> tongues, and euill <hi>Aesops</hi> tongues; the good ordained to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Hymmes, to ioyfull Iubilees, to Angelicall <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leluiahes:</hi> the euill tongues to taunt, to detract, and with <hi>Iobs wife, to curse God and die.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Ye daughters of <hi>Eue,</hi> misconster not my simple speech. I taxe not all your tongues in generall. There
<pb facs="7"/>
are voices of <hi>Angels,</hi> voices of <hi>Men,</hi> and voices of <hi>Diuels.</hi> The first are heauenly (as I said before) being sweet smelling sacrifices of <hi>Christian</hi> Quiristers, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Oracles of the <hi>inward man.</hi> The second earthly, as <hi>sounding brasse</hi> or <hi>tinckling Cymbals.</hi> The third hellish, as the roaring of a rauening Lion. The first I commend as <hi>the rare song of a blacke Swanne.</hi> The second I meane to amend as the penitent crie of <hi>the prodigall childe.</hi> The third and hellish voyce of <hi>the spirit of Detraction</hi> I commit as the <hi>Parisians Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens,</hi> or <hi>Scicilian Euen-song</hi> into the Dungeon of hell, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth. These di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities of tongues and voyces sprang vp from the same <hi>tree of good and euill.</hi> Out of the same <hi>Eue (like</hi> Lycurgus <hi>his whelps,</hi> or whelpish twinnes) came <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abell.</hi> Vertuous Dames, let it suffice, that for your sakes I spare to play the <hi>Satyrist</hi> against the <hi>Detracting Niobes</hi> of this age. Onely I controule them with a gentle checke; and because you pleade in their excuse, that they be the weaker vessels, and not enabled with such a noble courage as the man: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I giue them the milder bridle, the golden snaffle.</p>
   <p>Curteous Readers, I speake not to you: for they that be whole, neede no Phisitians. Captious Readers, on you I call. Behold, here are bridling bits for your byting mouthes. Readers, yeeld to your Riders, shew your selues pliable, peaceable, and ready to receiue conuenient cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements.

   <p>O Tongue, how is thy perfection peruerted, thy sense depraued, thy sound degenerated! How comes it to passe that the soules Embassadour is become a turne-coate Herald! <hi>Expectaui legatum, inueni Heraldum,</hi> I expected an honourable Embassadour, but haue found a
<pb facs="9"/>
huffe-cap Herald, as our late Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memory sometime nickt a presumptuous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour of <hi>Polonia.</hi> I expected to heare nothing but truth out of the mouth of Gods similitude, specially, to his neighbour in <hi>Christ,</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> in his members. But (alas) I finde nothing but lies and libels. <hi>Omnis homo mendax.</hi> I expected for reformation, but haue met with ruinous relapses. O Tongue, tongue, how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable are the effects of thy motions! Being made for a watchfull clapper to the Bell of Gods <hi>Temple,</hi> to pray for Grace, to comfort the sicke, to confirme the penitent, to confute the absurd, to confound the <hi>Detractour,</hi> why ringest thou out such paltry peales? Why ragest thou against thy Masters will, against thy selfe without iust cause or neede? In thy youthfull time thou crakest and vauntest of thy vaine worth, bursting thy lungs welnigh with windy bragges. In thy more mellow or maturer age thou standest elated in thine owne conceit, as though thy hoarie colour hath added vncontrouled trust and truth vnto thy stale assertions. In all the progresse of thy wagging, in all thy proceedings, thou abusest thy proper function: for which the Lord will not hold thee guiltlesse at that vniuersall Synod, when the heauens shall be folded together, like a booke, when our consciences, the true table-bookes of our soules shall lie open without lies against vs, and we shall yeelde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for euery idle word.</p>
   <p>These things expended and examined by me in the ballance of vnderstanding, and fearing least I might participate with them in their derogatory crimes, or encurre the penalty of trayterous Misprision towards
<pb facs="9"/>
our righteous Lord for my cowardly conccalements, if according to that measure of spirit, which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon me, I reproued them not: therefore haue I published this humble Treatise, that therein, as in a glasse or map, they may behold the reflexion of their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy faults extinguished and extirped. What do I know, whether the great <hi>God</hi> hath deliuered me from diuers dangers for these or such like purposes? To this end was I b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

To this end I wish with all the veynes of my heart, that what ability of wel-saying and wel-doing is defectiue in mine owne person, the same by the Diuine bounty may be liberally supplied to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this present booke. And that the Readers hereof may learne in sparing speech to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the <hi>holy Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> who for their honest admonitions and humble exhortations were ouercast with a cloude of scorne among the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of this world; or at least wise, that they imitate some of the heathenish <hi>Philosophers,</hi> namely <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> who imposed <hi>Decennale silentium,</hi> ten yeares silence on his schollers, or <hi>Socrates</hi> who for many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers together would sit silently musing on the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workemanship of God, or <hi>Arcesilas, Solon,</hi> and other enemies of Detraction. To this end I heartily wish, that all they, which finde themselues subiect to this <hi>spirit of Detraction,</hi> may be terrified from that idle vse with such magicall motiues of <hi>Michaels myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> as I haue herein inserted, like as if the <hi>Vtopian Syphograunts,</hi> the <hi>Athenian Ostracisme,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Censors,</hi> the <hi>Spanish Inquisition,</hi> or as if the
