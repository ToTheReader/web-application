      <salute>Worshipfull Sir,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>East I should be thought to be idle, or to waste the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den time of my daies (the rarest of all jewels) in the service of that Right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull Knight, your good father, with whom I now live, without some monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or impressions of my industry: as
<pb facs="3"/>
also thinking with my selfe what I might present some way to expresse my love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, in remembrance of those not to be requited favours I have received, not onely from your selfe, but from that Right worshipfull▪ and religious Knight your father; and that vertuous Lady your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which have wholy obliged mee to their house. I have thought good for the first to undertake the translation of <hi>Marcus Ausonius</hi> his foure bookes of morall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts intituted <hi>Cato:</hi> and for the latter I am inforced (for want of better way to shew my good meaning) to dedicate to you, this rude and slender booke transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of Latin hexamiters, into English meter. Wherein if I have any way mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred you occasion to mislike me for dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the same unto you (one whose love towards me, I must and will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to requite, though never able to cansell the obligation of your many and infinite curtesies) I trust you will bee so far from taxing of me, that you will rather hold me excused therein. For if a man be bound, by all meanes that he may (as sure
<pb facs="3"/>
he is) to gratifie his well deserving friends: then may not I quiet my selfe, and be at silence till I have devised the requitall of some part of your friendships, by some slender gift, such as my fortune, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent chance will permit me to exhibit unto you. And none can I finde (sweet sir) that in my minde will be more pleasing to your gentle nature, for the encouraging of you to the laborious and industrious obtaining of the Latin tongue, where into you are even now entering: or more fitter for your worships tractible disposition, being of very yong, and tender yeeres, and in whom the very sparkes of a philomathy is already seene, then this new translated Poet, which will so fill you with sweet counsell, wholesome instructions, and abundance of knowledge (unto which we must all in some small measure attaine, before we can step to any other grace or vertue, leading to perfection) as also teach you, how to behave and carry your selfe, in the whole course of your life, aswell towards your inferious as superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, that your company will not onely
<pb facs="4"/>
be admired of all them, that know you, but likewise desired of all those that shall at any time be so happy, as to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with you. For the Booke it selfe is so exquisit that notwithstanding, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour thereof was a heathen, and had not the true knowledge of Christ Iesus by faith. Whereby we must all bee saved, living in a time and place where the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes of salvation lay hid in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity and darknesse, as it did a long time after, being many yeeres before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ: yet I pray God, what ere his faith and beliefe was, that his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse and strictnesse of life towards God and man, doe not condemne us, who are, or would be thought Christians, living under the resplendent light, and Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine of the Gospell. And although hee was a heathen (as I said before) yet shall my charity bee such towards him, being dead, &amp; in whom was such an actuall habit of a good life, whiles he lived, as all the histories that I have read of him, besides his owne workes, by his many good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions to others, left behind him, doe
<pb facs="4"/>
witnesse the same; I cannot thinke, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it sinke into my heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that hee died altogether in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and knowledge of the true God. For at the very period and end of his daies, being praised of the Romans for his courage at his death, laughed: they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the cause why he laughed; hee answered, ye marvaile at that I laugh, and I laugh at that you marvell: for the perils and travels considered wherein wee live, and the safety wherein wee die, it is no more needfull to have vertue, and strength to live, then courage to die. And if wee looke but a little backe into his life, wee shall not have much cause to marvell at his comfortable and patient bearing of the stroke of death; for he was a man of such milde, and temperate spirit, that he could never bee seene to be wroth, or out of patience with any man, but alwaies coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled that were angry, that if they desired to live long, cheerefully, and die comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, to bannish rage, as an enemy to them both; a worthy saying of a heathen, and to be had in estemation and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb facs="5"/>
of every good Christian. But should any bee so unwise, to thinke his precepts are the lesse worthy of immita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for being a Heathen, I would aver the contrary against any seditious turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent spirit whatsoever, the best of us all being bound to receive the doctrines of many which doe write, tending to our good, though wee be not tied to follow the lives which they leade, if bad. Gold is nere the worse for being presented unto us, out of a beggers hand in a lether bagge; or a sermon ere the worse which we heare preached, because he that preacheth it, is of an ill life. It is our wisdomes to looke what the gold is, and not what the bagge is that it came in, or what the man was that brought it. We are not to inquire so much what the life and conversation of the Minister is, as what his doctrine and admonitions are that hee teacheth; not what this <hi>Cato</hi> was, but what his precepts are; which in a word, are so wise, honest and good for every Christian man and woman to reade and practice, that you shall not finde any Author, from whom
<pb facs="5"/>
a civill life may gather better instructions. Many there are of my knowledge, which will not have their children brought up in learning, because forsooth the Authors which they should learne are heathenish, as this our <hi>Cato, Turrence, Mantuin, Ovid, Virgil, Homer,</hi> and the like: desiring rather they should live like idiots, and die like fooles, then to attaine knowledge (as they thinke) by such unlawfull meanes. Others because of the tendernesse, they beare to their children, will not have them brought up to learning too soone, thinking them even too yong to be taught, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse their errour they affirme, if the child should bee chastened it would make him both sicke and foolish. But what is their end? they are soone too old to learne, and so become unprofitable to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, infamous and disobedient to their parents, so evill in conditions, so light and unadvised in behavour, so unfit for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, so inclined to lies, so envying the truth, that they are not onely a shame to their fathers which begot them, and a reproach to their mothers which bore
<pb facs="6"/>
them, but a scandall and disgrace to the succeeding generations after them. How ought you then to study and make use of your time, now whiles you may, least you repent you hereafter, when it will be too late. The tree that blossome not in the spring, will hardly beare fruit in Autumne. If you labour no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> for learning now in the summer and spring-time of your youth, you will hardly ever have any fruit thereof (as humility, love, obedience, and all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and spirituall blessings) in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and declining Autumne of your age. What although you be well descended, and your fathers eldest sonne, and so the likelier to have the heaviest purse? the better and more nobler you are borne by birth, the better ought you to be instructed in your youth; and the more wealth you are like to have the more learning you ought to have put into you: for such as leave great riches to their children, without seeing them brought up in literature (as <hi>Socrates</hi> saith) are like unto them that give much provender to yong horses, but never breake them at all, so that they waxe fat,
<pb facs="6"/>
but unprofitable. The father (as one saith) is bound no more towards his childe, but to banish him from his pleasures, and to give him vertuous masters to instruct him. What the pleasures are which fathers ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish from their children, I know not; who let loose the raines of liberty so upon them, that the child which most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they love best, (as the eldest) runne most at randome, unto all kindes of loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and licentiousnesse of life. Vertuous masters I confesse, they many times have to teach them, but as the old saying is, as good nere the whit, as nere the better. For what are their children ere the better for them? they must not forsooth be taught abroad, for feare the winde should blow on them; or from under their mothers winge, least they should ketch cold: but be taught at home in the presence of their parents, that they may not stand in awe of their Tutour, and so learne too much. For so much audacity, is given to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that are taught at home, and so little countenance showne to the masters which teach them, that one cannot well discerne,
<pb facs="7"/>
who stands in most feare many times, the master or the scholler. That masters must be thought either very indiscreet, or too base and meane to give correction when they thinke fitting; or fathers very unwise to thinke that their children should be too good to be corrected, when they deserve it. Yet thus it is in great mens houses, when children are negligent, and will not learne, masters would correct rhem, but fathers and mothers forbid them, so that it little avayleth one to pricke the horse with the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ure, when he that sitteth upon him holdeth backe with the bridle. And therefore let parents know although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters be never so ignoble and meane, and children never so noble and well descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet must they stand in awe of them by whom they are taught, and have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection at their hands, when occasion serve, if ever they would have them to learne well; but with the fondnesse of those parents whose children are borne to higher fortunes, then others are, the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest brother many times is saine to suffer for the eldest brothers fault, or some other
<pb facs="7"/>
meaner Gentlemans sonne, that is trayned up with him to be his asociate, insomuch that an elder brother without contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, now adaies, either of parents, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, or any one else, may doe any thing but that which is good, or be any thing but a wise man, which seldome troubles him. For although the eldest brother hath all the money and lands, yet the youngest most commonly gets all the wit and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and in time proves not onely the richest in estate, as I know some, but also in grace as there be many; whereas if they had met with the same sauce in their childhood, that their yonger brothers have done, it would so whetted their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makes, that they would have had as good an appetite to all goodnesse, as their yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brothers. But as it is reported of the Ape that she killeth her young ones, with overmuch hugging of them: so there be many such like apish parents who spoyleth their children, with making too much of them, especially if they have but one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly childe to inherit their estate after them. For all the time they are at home, they
<pb facs="8"/>
not be spoken to, or contradicted in any thing they doe, though never so ill. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> in any thing they speake, be it never so bad; counting great faults but small ones, and small ones none at all; suffering them (indeed) to have so much their owne wils, and so long without restraint that when they would reine and curbe them in, they cannot. For too much liberty in youth is a manifest token of disobedience in age. When they are put out to schoole though it be long first ere they goe, or be taught at home, the masters hands are so fast bound through a strict command given them from the parents, not to touch them being taught at home: or large golden promises, not to correct them if they bee taught abroad, that the disciples they teach many times perish for want of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and impunity. I speake not this concerning your selfe, that you or your parents are any waies to be taxed herein, as I of mine owne knowledge can witnes the same, but what I have seene in others, that I may bee an instrument of good to reforme them that are overmuch to bee
<pb facs="8"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lamed, for their negligence this way, that would have masters to instruct their children, but not to correct them, which sometimes is as necessary as documents of wholesome instructions. Therefore if any should thinke, I have showne but little wit, and lesse manners in dealing thus plainely, or have any waies offended in delivering my minde thus freely, my apologie for my selfe shall be onely this: I would that my labours (being your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant) should be accounted rather honest than wise: For the wise can but please, but the honest can never displease. But what should I need to make any apology for that I have said; when as I know some that are so golden, or rather earthly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if they can but heape up moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of wealth to leave their children, to make them rich; they care not how little mole-hils of learning they have to make them vertuous: forgetting that it is better to leave unto their children good doctrine whereby they may live, than evill riches whereby they may perish: whose offence (as a wise Philosopher saith) is
<pb facs="9"/>
impardonable, that for heaping up of riches, forget to bring up their children in honest manners. If this be not true that I speake, let experience speake for me, who of her owne knowledge can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many lamentable examples of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens sonnes, and great heires abroad in the world, who have had more wealth left them, than wit to use it, through want of this one principle of learning put into them, to season and relish those other parts and ornaments of nature they have beene endowed withall. Wherefore it standeth parents in hand that have any true inward love toward the good of their children, to see them as well vertuously educated in learning as to provide for them great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>How much better is it to get wisedome then gold? and to get under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing▪ rather to be chosen then silver?</hi> Let fathers and mothers then take it into their considerations, to use all the best meanes they can to put wisedome and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into their childrens heads, as well as money into their purses by training them up to learning, when they are young. <hi>A</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/>
      <hi>wise childe,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon, maketh a glad fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but a foolish childe is a heavinesse to his heart.</hi> It is not possible to keepe meate well savoured, unlesse it be first salted: It is impossible that fish should live without water: it is not unlikely, but the Rose which is overgrowne with the Thorne should wither; so it is impossible that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should have any comfort in their children, unlesse they bring them up to learning and vertuous education in their youth. Nothing maketh a more deepe impression in the mind of man, than those rules he learned when he was a child: for whatsoever good instructions children learne in their youth, the same they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in their age, which made <hi>Cato</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe be a Schoole-master to his owne sonnes, because he would not have their youth infected. Goe on then, Noble Sir, in the race you have begun, who have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had (God be praised) vertuous edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and godly bringing up, having not onely a Wise, and a religious Father to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise you, a vertuous and godly Mother to counsell you; but also a prudent and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
<pb facs="10"/>
Master to instruct you; let it then be your care, having such worthy Patternes of imitation laid before you, for a square and a rule to direct you in your youth, as few have the like, to adde thereunto wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and learning, your selfe, as farre as in you lie, by diligence in your study, which will be the most absolute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect way, to make you a complete Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that as you patriseat your father eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way in person, so you may strive to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him as neere as you can in vertue, whose instructions goe not alone, onely as daily Moniters, to disswade and dehort you from that which is ill: but his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are as so many lectures read unto you, to exhort and encourage you to that which is good. As you would not then have others goe before you in riches, which of Philosophers and Poets are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the gods of Fortune: so let not others goe before you in learning, which is the Mother of Vertue and Perfection, and without which, a man, though never so rich, is but as a sheepe (as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> termes him) with a golden fleece, or an
<pb facs="10"/>

      </gap>ed over with fine gold, and beautifull colours. Study and labour then to get knowledge, learning, wisedome, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding now whilest you are young, being lesse painfull (as one saith) to learne in youth, than to be ignorant in age. A mans whole life time indeed, ought to be a continuall study, for no man can be too old to learne, yet a mans infancy and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is the chiefest time; when the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and groundworke of this building is to be laid. Hee that goes about to build a house, begins it not in the Winter, but in the Spring, that he may have the Summer before him to finish his worke; yet better to begin it in the Winter then not at all: so hee that would be a good scholler, must not beginne to fall to his booke and study when he is a man, or in his declining age, but in his childhood and youth; yet better to learne in his old age, then not at all, as one to that effect writeth thus: It is fitter for young men to learne, then to teach, and for old men to teach then to learne; and yet fitter for
<pb facs="11"/>
old men to learne, then to be ignorant▪ but there is no man that can learne so much, that he shall need to learne no more and I hope I shall not live so long, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> shall be too old to learne. How excellen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> in all both old and young, but especially in young? that as <hi>Iob</hi> speakes of Wisdome, so may I say of learning; it is so excellent, that man knoweth not the value thereof; it cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof; it cannot be valued with the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> with the pretious Onix, or the Saphire, the gold and the crystall, cannot equall it, and the exchange of it, shall not be for je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells, of fine gold. No mention shall be made of Corall, or of Pearles; for the price of learning is above Rubies, which made grave <hi>Plato</hi> in contemplation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, cry out and say, <hi>Oh Science, how would men love and esteeme thee, if they knew thee right,</hi> and well might he doe it; for it is the lightest burthen, and richest merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise that a man can possibly traffique in, or carry about him, a fountaine whereunto
