   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR so muche as it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of euerye Christian man,
not only in hart to pray with
the Prophet Dauid, saying:
Deale mercifully O lord in thy good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
with Syan, that the walles of Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
(that is of the churche) maye bee
builded vp agayne, but also to put to hys
helping hand so muche as he is able to the
repayring of it, I thought it to appertaine
to me, which am (I trust) a membre of
Christ hys Catholyke churche, to doo as
muche as in me lyeth, that the broken and
battred walles of it may be reedified. And
where as it passed my strengthe, to bryng
any principall beames, any corner stones,
by wrytyng newe workes of myne owne
inuention, rather then I would be an ydle
loker on, I thought it my part to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
laborer, to bryng morter, to carry
sand, and as it were beare baskettes, by
translatyng some worthy worke of some
other wryter. And although I dyd well
<pb facs="3"/>
knowe, that there were many workes in
Latten, which beyng translated in to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glysshe,
myght helpe to rayse vp the ruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
walles of Christ hys churche in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
yet among so many, this one semed
to me to conteine moste spedy remedie and
reparation: whiche as it was of the first
author dedicated to a most excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cesse,
so of me the second translator (for
one before me hath trāslated it into Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che)
is named not without a cause, <hi>A PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIOVS
PEARLE FOR A PRINCE.</hi> If any
man meruaile, what moued me to trāslate
this Epistle,<note place="margin">3. causes of this trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> I do hym to vnderstand, that
three causes styrred and prouoked me.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first is, that I myght moue all godly
Englishe hartes, to morne and lament, that
thei in England should be so blynded with
the smoke of ignorance, that they them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
coulde not see the greate flames of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,
which dayly burne theire sowles, but
were fayne to be warned of them which be
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in farre countries. The second is, to gyue
<pb n="3" facs="3"/>
God thankes, that allthough the eyes of
them which dwel in England, can not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
those furiouse fyars, for so muche
as they dwell in the mystie vales of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
yet that it hath pleased hym, to make
greate learned men, which dwell on the
hygh hylles of the Catholyke fayth, a farre
of to discrye the flames which dayly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
England, and not onlye to discrye
them, but also to send holy water of moste
godly councell to quenche them.</p>
   <p>The third cause is, to styrr vp all deuoute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Catholykes not learned in the Latten ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
to pray to God for the Quenes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
that as she hath good councelloures
abroade in farr countryes, so she may haue
good councelloures at home in her courte,
which with <hi>Osorius</hi> may be <hi>osores</hi> of all
false doctryne and heresie: which with <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorius</hi>
maye persuade her to come oute of
the cockring bote of scismaticall noysom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
in to the stedfast arcke of Noy, that is
of holsome and catholyke vnitie: which
<pb facs="4"/>
with Osorius may instruct her to gyue no
eare to theis deceptfull shypmen,<note place="margin">A mete metaphor for suche maryners.</note> whiche
clymyng vp in to theire pulpyttes, as in to
the topp of the mastes, crie to them which
be beneathe, that thei see the port and saffe
hauen of God his worde, when in deede
thei be in the mayne sea of their owne wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
phātasies: which beare her in hand
that they sayle with a fore wynde of the
holy ghoste, when in deede they ryde with
a sydewinde of dyuellishe suggestion: which
make her beleue, that she hath with her the
warme southe wynde of charitie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde,
when in deed thei leade her with the
colde Northewynde of dissention and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde:
which persuade her that thei goe
Eastewarde, where the bryght Sonne of
true doctrine doth ryse and appeare, when
to say the truthe, thei goe VVestwarde,
where the cleare beames of veritie doth
vanishe and shrynck oute of syght. Oh that
so noble a Princesse should be so abused by
them which crie against abuses. But to my
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
purpose. These be the three causes, which
hartned me to translate this epistle, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandyng
I knew I should displease
some, for God is to be pleased rather then
men: notwithstandyng I was not ignorant
that our base tounge coulde not atteine to
the maiestie of <hi>Osorius</hi> his Laten, for I
regarde not so much the fynes of wordes,
as the diuynenes of the matter: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this epistle of <hi>Osorius</hi> is after a
sorte answered à <hi>quodā osore veritatis,</hi>
who shall be nameles, for all the world can
wytness that the answer <hi>osoris illius</hi> is no
more to be compared to the epistle of <hi>Oso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
then the light of a lampe to the light
of a lynck, then the light of a lynck to the
light of the Sonne. Allthough being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with other of his owne sect, I confess
hym to be as he is taken a man of handso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
eloquence. But compare hym to the gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stryng
starres, which are this daye in the
catholike church, and namely to <hi>Osorius,</hi>
against whome he setteth hymselfe, he is
<pb facs="5"/>
but a candle vnder a bushell, as he shall
well perceaue at <hi>Osorius</hi> next answer, if
so be <hi>Osorius</hi> thinck hym worthie to be
answered. But to leaue all comparisons, for
that thei be odious, I wishe to that answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
not the eloquence of <hi>Osorius,</hi> which I
know he wold abuse in setting out the false
Churche, but the grace and spirit of <hi>Oso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
to be one of the true church. Then I
doubt not, but he will wishe when he made
that answer, he <hi>had don</hi> some other thing,
but I will say no more, for I almost <hi>had
don</hi> his name to be vnderstanded against
my will. Only, gentle Reader, I desire the,
diligentlye to reade this epistle, in reading
it to learne, in learning to lyue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as it doth councell. For I assure the
this is a pretiouse pearle, which held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Sonne of good vnderstandyng,
casteth oute suche a glystring light, that
Princes thereby may learne to rule, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes
may learne to obey, wauerers in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
may be stayed, wanderers may be
<pb n="5" facs="5"/>
brought in to the right way. If thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
gyue God the cheife prayse: and if
thou thinck me worthie no thanke for that
I haue but declared and sette out in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
an other mans his doing in Latten, I
am well cōtent. Yet remembre that many
tymes we see those men, which haue iewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
in keeping, which be none of theire
owne, to receaue greate thankes at
theire handes, to whome they
do shewe them.</p>
