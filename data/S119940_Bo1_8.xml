   <p>VVHILST this booke was in printing there came to my hands fresh letters out of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> with Aduertisment of new Lawes enacted against the Catholicks, this last Parlament: as though the former were not inough, to proue the Patience of those which suffer, and the miserable estate of the Lawmakers. They mention likwise a memorable case, wherin is discouered Gods great mercy with sinners, and his care and prouidence ouer his chosen, many times when they least thinke of it, and haue most need. <note place="margin">(F) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      <head>The Letter sayth thus.</head>
      <p>ONE of the Lawes of this Parlament is, that the New Oath be tendred to all of eyghtene yeares and vpward, vnlesse they be Barons. A new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance to no other purpose, but to make more odious those which without necessity make such lawes, &amp; to confirme our experience, that ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences be alwaies accompanied with suspitions and feares; besides the forcing of men to periury. For I do not see, but that when any man sweareth against his conscience, though it be true, he incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth periury. Neither do I see, what it can auayle the Kings Maiesty, if all his Kingdome sweare what he pleaseth, if first he persuade them not that it is truth which they sweare. For he is neuer a whit the more secure, that all his people commit periury. Besides the very obliging them in this manner to sweare, maketh them lesse true vnto him: for suspition and iealousy is the bane of friendship. And how can they loue him, of whose loue and fidelity he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth himselfe to doubt? For if he trusted them, he would not in all wisdome and prudence, proceed in this rigorous māner, so to burden their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by forcing them to periury. And this is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall opinion heere with vs. By vertue of this Law they haue put to death a Priest, called <hi>Cadwalledour,</hi> that in this manner refused the Oath. And for the same cause haue they condemned many others, both men &amp; women, to losse of their goods, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall imprisonment; casting them into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="173" facs="67"/> Iailes amongst theeues &amp; malefactors, thinking therby to make breach in their Consciences with this vexation.</p>
      <p>They haue likewise made a Law against Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who, as hath bene said, had the priuiledge of women in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes. This Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, that such as will not goe to Church, and cōmunicate (with the Caluinists) be put in prison, till their Husbands redeeme them, by paying ten pounds a moneth, or the third part of their goods. And it cannot be imagined, what confusion this Law maketh in the whole Realme, where many Husbands be Protestāts, &amp; their Wiues Catholicks.</p>
      <p>An other Priest they haue also condemned in <hi>Oxford</hi> for the same Oath; who liuing in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Iaile, it happened that there were two Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists malefactours chayned togeather, and one of them moued by the presence of the Priest, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to informe himselfe of the Catholicke Religiō, but hindred by the two Lawes against <hi>Recōciliation</hi> and <hi>Persuasion,</hi> and with the chayne, so that he could not speake to the Priest, but that his fellow must know it, nor seeke the others consent without daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Law. After much perplexity, and many conflicts, he resolued to open himselfe to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, as he did, and brought him likewise to desire his saluation; and so came both togeather to the Priest, and being instructed, they renounced their heresy, and resolued to die in the Catholicke fayth.</p>
      <p>After they were condemned, as they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to execution, the Caluinist-Ministers came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="174" facs="68"/> them, offering to exhort them after their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: but the prisoners cast them of with contempt, and being asked the cause, answered, that their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine had brought them to the gallowes, and seing it could not help them to heauen, they had resolued to die Catholiks: and if they had liued in the same Religion, wherin they desired to die, they had neuer come to that infamous death: but seing things past could not be vndone, they most willingly accepted the punishment, which God had layd vpon them, with great confidence and assurance, that for the merits of our Sauiours passion and death, he would receaue theirs, and their harty repentance, in some recompence of their former sinnes. And so died with great edification, and example to the people, verifying in <hi>England</hi> that which Christ sayd to the Princes of the Iewes, <hi>Publicani &amp; Meretrices praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vos in Regno Dei.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>The Caluinists or Protestants (call them as you list, for they be eyther) haue intrenched themselues in this Iland, like so many mutined souldiars, that haue gotten a strong Hold, and there they make Lawes at their pleasure, disguising their vnlawfull proceedings with honorable termes, and honest manner of speach, and (as it seemeth) persuade themselues, that others must vnderstād them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. But it is impossible, that so euident a truth can be hid vnder their bushell. The nature of truth challengeth her place in the view of the world, and for themselues it most importeth, that truth be laied open and discouered, to the end that when all other respects should faile, yet the iust feare of infamie
<pb n="175" facs="68"/> may moderate their excesses, or at least keepe in others by their example; as the Poet sayth:</p>
      <l>
         <hi>—Auidos vicinum funus vt aegros</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Exanimat, mortis{que} metu sibi parcere cogit:</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Sic teneros animos aliena opprobria saepe</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Absterrent vitijs.—</hi>
      </l>
      <bibl>Horat. lib. 1. serm. 7.</bibl>
      <p>I haue also heard these dayes reported by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of credit lately come from <hi>Spayne,</hi> another case worthy to be knowne; for it confirmeth not a little that which hath beene sayd; to wit, that the Catholicke fayth <hi>the</hi>
         <note n="(A)" place="margin">Sicut palma florebit</note>
         <hi>more it is trodden downe,</hi> the more it riseth: the more it is cropt, the deeper roote it taketh, and the more it is oppressed with persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the more it spreadeth it selfe, and euery day gayneth more ground, and more opinion and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in all good mens minds, and is more loued and esteemed of all.</p>
      <p>The report is also, that about the same time that in <hi>England</hi> they banished by Proclamation all Priests and Religious men from <hi>London</hi> their Court; God Almighty inspired <hi>a Stranger</hi>
         <note n="(B)" place="margin">Caesar Bogaçio.</note>
         <hi>to call them,</hi> by his last Will and Testament, to the Court of <hi>Spayne,</hi> leauing them commodious dwelling, both for the situation, and capacity of the houses, and all his goods, to make an English Colledge in <hi>Madrid,</hi> moued, as they say, by that which he had seene in the Seminarie of <hi>Valliadolid,</hi> as a neere Neighbour to it, when the Court was there. And two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances concurre in this action, worthy to be noted: one that he began this Colledge in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Court, the very same day, that his Maiesty of <hi>England</hi> had prefixed for the Priests to depart out
<pb n="176" facs="69"/> of his. The other, that the partie who gaue this gift, did it vnder condition, that no memory should be made with men, of that which he did. But for the very same reason I haue taken this occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him. For honour of right belongeth only to them that flie it, and God Almighty vseth to reward not onely in heauen, but in this world also works of vertue done purely for his sake.</p>
      <p>This Gentleman was an <hi>Italian,</hi> borne in the Citty of <hi>Luca,</hi> although for his long continuance in the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> his seruice, he was accounted as one of that Countrie. And here likewise it is to be considered, that <hi>Antonius Bonuiso,</hi> the Man that with his charity maintained the Lord <hi>Chancellour</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and Martyr <hi>Syr Thomas More,</hi> patterne of loialty in Kings Counsellours, and seruants, all the time that his Lord King <hi>Henry</hi> the eyght kept him prisoner in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> because he would not consent to his vnlawfull outrages, was of the same Citty of <hi>Luca.</hi> And the same <hi>Bonuiso</hi> afterwards with great liberality intertayned in his house at <hi>Louayne</hi> the Priests and secular Catholikes that left <hi>England</hi> in the beginning of Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> persecution.</p>
      <p>And if any man aske me what correspondence there is, or what occasion of amity betwene <hi>England</hi> and the State of <hi>Luca,</hi> that from thence should arise men so eminently well affected to English Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes in such occasions as these? There can be giuen no other cause (as I suppose) but the good pleasure of Almighty God, that layd hand vpon <hi>Abacuc,</hi> and carried him from <hi>Iudaea</hi> by the haire of his head, to
<pb n="177" facs="69"/> feed his Prophet in the dungeon of <hi>Babylon:</hi> and chose <hi>Zachaeus</hi> for his Host in <hi>Iericho,</hi> and the house of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> &amp; his sisters in <hi>Bethania</hi> for his ordinary Inne, and would not do this fauour to any of the Scribes or Pharisies in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> nor to any other Inhabitant of that Citty. This is a priuiledge which our Sauiour granteth to whome he pleaseth; and we can giue no other reason, why he doth it, but his holy will. Onely by experience we see, that he will not be serued of euery mans house, nor of euery mans person, or goods, in these like occasions. In fine, he is Lord and Owner of all: <hi>Domini est terra &amp; plenitudo eius.</hi> And as the Princes of the earth do not serue themselues indifferently of all, but of their best beloued, and most trustie seruants, in things of their particuler liking: so it fareth with this great Lord of Lords. And as it is a fauour when he giueth any man meanes &amp; possibility to do good works: so is it a double, and farre greater fauour, to giue him withall, prudence, good occasion, and desire to do them, and to bestow profitably that which God hath left to his disposition. And amongst all the imployments, that can be in this world of temporall goods, there is none so certayne, and of so great interest, as that which Christians haue, vnder the gouerment of Infidels, that spoyle them, and make hauocke of their goods, because they will not forsake their fayth, nor consent to their errour. For these men (doubtlesse) in lieu of the little which they can leese for God, receaue euen in this world the comforts and pledges of eternall saluation (wherof hath beene spoken
<pb n="178" facs="70"/> aboue) and soone after shall enter into his riches that haue no measure, and enioy the treasure of euerlasting felicity, and be made partakers of his Kingdome for euer.</p>
