   <p>If he that <hi>Anno</hi> 1575. published the troubles which began at <hi>Franckford Anno</hi> 1554. (and continued to the end of <hi>Q. Maries</hi> daies, among the people fled thither for the <hi>Ghospell,</hi>) compleyned, and lamented for the vnsavourie dealings against the truth, and the professors thereof, by reason of those troubles: and that not onely profane, and vnbrideled skoffers, but even preachers (and that in theyre pulpits) such as were to be reverenced for the gifts <hi>God</hi> had given them, brake into verie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savourie speaches, and vniust accusations: If (I say) in that age those trobles found such? What may these trobles looke for in these Daies, wherein skoffing is come to the height, and all is covered vnder pregnancie of witt, <hi>Policie</hi> more then <hi>Religion</hi> possesseth mens hearts, and all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread with the<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.16.</note> cloke of <hi>(counterfeyte)</hi> wisdome? Surely, if both profane, and politike persons turne these things to their further hardening in sin, and encrease in securitie, they shall the sooner fill vp their measure, and so at length be broken, yet I hope the vpright hearted and verteous sorte will make a better vse thereof, and help the <hi>Lord</hi> against the mightie in battel, that so they may escape the judgment<note n="f" place="margin">Iudg. 5.23. Ier. 48.10.</note> pronounced agaynst such as neglect to help him, or do his work deceytfully.</p>
   <p>Herevpon the reader (whosoever hee be, frend or foe) is to be requested, that hee make not a wrong vse (to the<note n="g" place="margin">Iam. 1.22.26. Ier. 4.22.</note> deceybing, and hurt of his owne soule) of the things declared in the discourse following: for the truth is the truth, and<note n="h" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.8 Psal. 19.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
      </note> holy: sins personall may not condemne it, the persons are to be tried by it, and to be knowne by their fruites<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 7.15.16.17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ioh. 8.31.32.</note> but it not to be iudged by the<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 7.15.16.17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ioh. 8.31.32.</note> walking of the professors thereof.</p>
   <p>It is pittifull (I confesse) and much to be lamented, that men professing one <hi>true Religion,</hi> especially professing themselves banished for true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions sake should be at controversie, because (as one truely and well noteth) <hi>vvorldly vvise Politike men iudge it, and beat it into the heads of others as a token, vvhat the mindes of such men are, and vvhat theyr Religion is:</hi> Whereas <hi>(silly soules)</hi> if they would looke into <hi>Gods</hi>

   <p>Let not therefore the winter or stormes of persecutions and aflictions without, or within the Church, neyther the stones or weedes which thou mayst see or heare to be in the beds of the <hi>Lordes</hi> garden, or in his vyneyard discourage thee from entering into the same garden or vyneyard: being entered, let them not dismay thee to drive thee back agayne, but enter,<note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 1. &amp;c</note> worke, be of good courage, labour, continue, endure the heat of the day tyll the maister of the vineyard come: Help to<note n="t" place="margin">Isa. 5.2. and 62.10.</note> gather out the weedes, ād stones, those which thou canst not leave vnto the perfect gatherer, which will not onely in this lyfe have the grosse stones, ād weedes removed, but in the great Day will also seperate the verie smallest<note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 13.27.28.29.30 41.42.43</note> tares from the wheat: If thou in this life for thy labour be<note n="vv" place="margin">Luke. 12.45.

   <p>The Church of God as it is generally cōpared to a vineyard, so the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular congregations thereof may be compared to beds, which (as the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, so they) are planted with the best plants, and the Lord looketh for good fruites: If they answer not the Lords expectation, let them know, that if he spared not the<note n="x" place="margin">Isa. 5.5.6. jer. 7.12. &amp;c.</note> vineyard, neither will hee spare them.</p>
