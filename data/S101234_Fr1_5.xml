   <lg>
      <l>
         <hi>I</hi> Write not Elegies, nor tune my Verse,</l>
      <l>To waite in mourning notes vpon thy Herse</l>
      <l>For vaine applause, or with desire to rank</l>
      <l>My slender Muse'mongst those, who on the bank</l>
      <l>Of <hi>Aganippe's</hi> streame can better sing,</l>
      <l>And to their words more sence of sorrow bring.</l>
      <l>That stirres my Genius, which should excite</l>
      <l>Those pow'rfull wits: to doe a pious Right</l>
      <l>To noble vertue, and by verse conuay</l>
      <l>Truth to Posterity, and shew the way</l>
      <l>By strong example, how in mortall state</l>
      <l>We heau'nly Worth may loue, and imitate.</l>
      <l>Nay, 'twere a great Iniustice, not to saue</l>
      <l>Him from the ruines of a silent Graue,</l>
      <l>Who others from their Ashes sought to raise,</l>
      <l>To weare (giu'n from his hand) eternall Bayes.</l>
      <l>It is by all confess'd, thy happy Straines,</l>
      <l>Distill'd from milky streames of natiue veines,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="5"/>Did like the liuing source of <hi>Naso's</hi> Song,</l>
      <l>Flow to the Eare, thence gently glide along</l>
      <l>Downe to the Heart, in notes so heau'nly-sweet,</l>
      <l>That there the Sister-graces seem'd to meet,</l>
      <l>And make thy Brest their Seate for soft retire,</l>
      <l>And place from whence they fetch'd Promethean Fire,</l>
      <l>To kindle other hearts with purest Flame</l>
      <l>Of modest Verse, and vnaffected Fame:</l>
      <l>While pedant Poetasters of this Age,</l>
      <l>(Who stile their saucy Rimes, Poëtique Rage)</l>
      <l>Loose humours vent, and Ballad-lines extrude,</l>
      <l>Which grieue the Wise, captiue the multitude,</l>
      <l>And that thy ▪Poems might the better take,</l>
      <l>Not with vaine sound, or for the Authors sake,</l>
      <l>Which often is by seruile spirits tryde,</l>
      <l>Whil'st heau'n-bred soules are left vnsatisfyde▪</l>
      <l>Like to the Bee, thou didd'st those Flow'rs select,</l>
      <l>That most the tastefull palate might affect,</l>
      <l>With pious relishes of things Diuine,</l>
      <l>And discomposed sence with peace combine.</l>
      <l>Which (in thy <hi>Crowne of Thornes</hi>) we may discerne,</l>
      <l>Fram'd as a Modell for the best to learne:</l>
      <l>That Verse may Vertue teach, as well as Prose,</l>
      <l>And minds with natiue force to Good dispose,</l>
      <l>Deuotion stirre, and quicken cold Desires,</l>
      <l>To entertaine the warmth of holy Fires.</l>
      <l>There may we see thy Soule exspaciate,</l>
      <l>And with true feruor sweetly meditate</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="5"/>Vpon our Sauiours sufferings; that while</l>
      <l>Thou seek'st his painefull torments to beguile,</l>
      <l>With well-tun'd Accents of thy zealous Song,</l>
      <l>Breath'd from a soule transfix'd; a Passion strong,</l>
      <l>We better knowledge of his woes attaine,</l>
      <l>Fall into Teares with thee, and then againe,</l>
      <l>Rise with thy Verse to celebrate the Flood</l>
      <l>Of those eternall Torrents of his Blood.</l>
      <l>Nor lesse delight (Things serious set apart)</l>
      <l>Thy sportiue Poems yeeld with heedfull Art</l>
      <l>Composed so, to minister content,</l>
      <l>That though we there thinke onely Wit is meant,</l>
      <l>We quickly by a happy error, find</l>
      <l>In cloudy words, cleare Lampes to light the mind.</l>
      <l>Then blesse that Muse, which by vntrodden wayes</l>
      <l>Pursuing Vertue, meetes deserued Bayes</l>
      <l>To crowne it selfe, and wandring soules reduce</l>
      <l>From paths of Ignorance, and wits abuse;</l>
      <l>And may the best of English Laureats striue,</l>
      <l>Thus, their owne Fun'rall Ashes to suruiue.</l>
