      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Scribes and Pharyseis and other enemies of Christe euer dyd oft tymes attēpt him with diuers questiōs sometime of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours trybute, sometime of the hyghest and greatest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the lawe, sometyme of the ryght way to eternal lyfe, and suche lyke. Al whiche que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions they did demaunde not to serche out the truthe in any of the sayde articles whereby to sattle and grounde theyr cōsciences, nor to be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in them as though
<pb facs="4"/> they had doubted in any such matter as they questyoned wyth hym of, but onely as the holy text sayth to tempt hym, and out of his aunsweres to gather some matter agaynst hym whereby to trappe hym, or els to be confyrmed rather in theyr olde and longe before conceyued opinions than to be wythdrawen from them, for they had determined with them selues before what they would holde and beleue, and neuer to swarne there from nor to suffer them selues to be perswaded there from, what so euer Christe or any of his Apostles shewe or teache to the contrary. For where as they neyther woulde nor coulde beleue hym to be the heauenly doctor whiche had
<pb facs="4"/> his commission not from any of the high bishops or priestes, but from the bosom of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of heauen geuyng hym this testimony. This is my deare beloued sonne in whom I delyght and am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, heare him, heare him, how coulde they receyue or beleue any poynet of hys doctrine: But whatsoeuer he or his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyples sayde or taught, theyr minde &amp; mindes is being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely festyd wyth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rust of igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rans and partely ouercomme with peruerse obstynacy they neuer mynded to alter theyr olde corrupt iudgementes &amp; opinions nor to reforme the least errour wherewith they were blynded. In so muche as they woulde not ones ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb facs="5"/> their moste great errours to be any errours at all, but woulde defende them rather as infallyble truthes. And euen at a lyke poynt (the more pytye) is the wycked worlde at this present. Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers men are redy to moue dyuers questions, some of one thyng, and some of another thyng, but howe many are there that make their demaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and moue theyr puestions to the intent to learne or to be better instructed: No no, they do it rather eyther of a curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syte for some colour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens or els to be confyrmed in theyr former iudgementes and doynges. For if they dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bted of suche matters as they question of, they woulde ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steyne from doyng the thynge
<pb facs="5"/> whereof they moue theyr doubt, vntyll suche tyme as they were fully resolued whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they myght lawfully doo it or no. Were it not an vnse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng thyng for a iudge fyrst to condempne a man to death and than afterwarde to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre whether hys cause be worthy of death or no? He ought rather to suspende the sentens vntyll suche tyme as the matter were fully tryed and examyned. Euen so there are dyuers that axe and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che whether it be lawfull to lende money for increase and aduauntage and to vse vsury and vsans. And in the meane tyme they practyse the thyng to the vttermooste they can dryue it, as though it were a matter so lawfull as had no
<pb facs="6"/> maner of doubt in it. O Lord what a blyndnes and peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senes is this, what doo thys men dyffer from the Scribes Pharyseis and enemyes of Christe, the name onely reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that they are and wyll be called Christians the holy Scriptures were neuer more taught, reed nor preached nor better set furth then they are at this daye, but let vs cōsider what is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> worlde y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> better, but rather cleane contrary the better preachynge the wors lyuyng, iniquite wyll euer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the vpper hande more and more styll. To passe euer other matters were the myndes of men, euer so vncharytable or so vnsaciable as they be at this daye euen in this lyght of the Gospell? The more increase
<pb facs="6"/> God geueth of all thynges, the greater starsenes &amp; dearth is there. The more God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewyth men with ryches the more couetous are they and the more shamefull vsury doo they practyse therewith se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng them selues onely as though they were borne for themselues onely saint Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les lesson teachyng all men to seke their neyghbours welth and not their owne is forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. And Iudas lesson Quid vultis mihi what wyll ye gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, what wyll ye gyue, is lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the fyngers endys.</p>
   <p>And this causeth so muche mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sery in the worlde as is. Yet it prouoketh Gods vengeans dayly more and more vpon our neckes, I praye God we prouoke it not to muche that
<pb facs="7"/> it lyghten not vp on vs to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, I pray God euery may refourme hys enormyties in tyme. And specially suche as are so drowned in coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnes that they care not though their euen Christen famysh for honger, as there haue some of late bene herd of in this realme, lamentable it is to be hard of. But at whose handes shall their bloud that so peryshe but at the couetous cormorātes the couetous leas mongers the couetous rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasers, the couetous, I can not tell what ye call them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossers, rakers and scrapers of so vnsaciable an hundreth mens lyuynges wyl not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce one of them. And whē they haue the deuell and al in their handes that the poore muste
<pb facs="7"/> bye of them, they wyll sell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng but at their owne pryce. And hereof spryngeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausyng of all thynges.<note place="margin">Agaynst the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous vsu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rers.</note> And what Godly lawes statutes or proclamacions soeuer be set furth by the Christen rulers, they can take no place in them though they be founde neuer so fauty, they wyll shyft oute one waye or other, yf they be iustly complayned of to the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, some of them wyll bee more redy to excuse them thā to punyshe them, he? No he is to honest a man to do any such thing. Thus one claweth ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther in the meane tyme deuou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryng vp the poore <hi>Tanquam escam panis,</hi> as Dauid sayeth euen as a morsel of bread. And what shall I saye of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous vsurers, howe many are
<pb facs="8"/> gnawen to the bones and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vp by them. What make they of the returne of their mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ney in one month? But howe lawfully how godly how cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, this lytle treatyse and dyaloge translated out of the germanis tonge doth teache, yf suche as are corrupt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with that kynde of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes wyll be admonysshed, they may receiue admonicion and instruction thereby. If they wyll not their bloud be vpon their own heades, they can not saye but they were taught and warned. To be short God graunt that euery man may consyder the duty of Christen charite and practyse the some, it was neuer more time, it was neuer more nede. If they wyll not let them be
<pb facs="8"/> sure of this, The oxe is layde at the rote of the tree, the rod is redy made wherewith we shall be scourged. If any man may be called back at least frō this vice of vsury by this lytle worck, bothe the wryter and the translatour, shall thinke their labours well besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed and sufficiently recompensed, God graūt they may so doo Amen. ⁂</p>
