   <head>The Argument of this Poeme.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T what time that great and fatall enemy of Rome, <hi>Hannibal</hi> (after that he had wonne those memorable and famous battels of Ticenum, Trebesa, Thracimen, and Cannes) had ouer-run and subdued the most part of all Italy, putting Rome her selfe into a maruellous feare to haue beene surprised if he had then followed his fortune: Of all her great Captains and Commanders (she then had) <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> was estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the most wise and politicke, <hi>Marcellus</hi> the most valiant, because by experience in sundry conflicts, he made the Romans know, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was not inuincible: yet of them all none so much repined to see the Maiesty, and greatnesse of her state limited, as it were, within her owne wals, as young <hi>Publius, Corn. Scipio,</hi> the sonne of that <hi>Publ. Scipio,</hi> who first fought with <hi>Hannibal</hi> at his coming into Italy, and afterwards kild, valiantly fighting against his enemies, in Spain, with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cne. Scipio.</hi> They both thus dead, &amp; the army there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of a Commander, the Senat long time consulted to find out some worthy Captaine to supply that roome, but could find no man that durst vndertake so dangerous a charge, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the losse of two so great and famous Captaines before. Til at length, the whole assembly beeing called, to chuse a Vice-consull, all the other Princes and Peeres of the Realme being silent at so worthy a motion, <hi>Scipio</hi> beeing but 24. yeares of age, accepted the charge, and immediatly thereupon departed for Spaine, which to his immortall glorie, he quickly subdued againe to the Romaine abedience; from whence returning to Rome, he was presently chosen Consul, with the greate ioy and applause of the people: and had Cicill assigned to him for his Prouince, with power (if he pleased) to make war in Aphrick.
<pb facs="4"/>
So beeing stirred vp therto by the often intreaties, and great promises of <hi>Massinissa</hi> king of Numidia, a valorous and coragious young Prince, and a great friend of the Romanes, he leauied new forces, and hauing prepared ships and munition in Sicill fit for such a iourney, went thither: and after many famous baettels, at the last he ouercame <hi>Hasdrubal,</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phax</hi> king of the Mascaecilians; who to enioy the beautie of <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> the daughter of the sayd <hi>Hasdrubal,</hi> had but lately left the Romane friendship, to take part with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians; to follow whome <hi>Scipio</hi> sent <hi>Massinissa,</hi> with <hi>Caius Laelius</hi> and his light horse-men, whom they pursued to his owne country, and there in a new conflict tooke him priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Thereafter <hi>Massinissa</hi> went to Cyrtha the chiefe citty of his Realme, which he took, and there at the first view became enamoured with the matchlesse and incomparable beauty of <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> whom not only he promised to free frō Romane bondage, but also tooke her to his wife: which <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> vnderstanding, sharply rebukes him for his fault, telling him that no Romane confederate was able to giue libertie to a prisoner taken by the Romane armes, who heauily regrating his offence, to so courteous and continent a Captaine, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, hee could not obserue his promise to <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> sends her a cup of poyson, with a letter, shewing her, hee could not else obserue his faith giuen to her but by that potion, which she immediatly drinks, to preuent all further misery, and giues me the Argument of this Poeme.</p>
