   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>REader, I must first intreat thy Patience, afterward thy Ingenuity; thy Patience, that thou wilt read somewhat before my verses: thy Ingenuity, that thou wilt not censure them the worse, because thou shalt finde them censur'd to thy hand. The purpose of this Poem is Religious Delight, which if thou shalt finde in any place wanting, or disjoyned, understand, that it was either not my intent, or mine Error. And yet I dare affirme no man shall be the worse by it, and that if there be any want, it is more of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light then of the Religion: If I intended excuses, I could tell you, and that truely too; that these verses were not now first made, although they are now first published, and the Composure was a younger mans, though the Edition be a Divines. This I could say, if I thought Poetry incompatible with Divinity, if it were a serious truth, that God could bee onely magnified in Prose: But when I consider that <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> could be both a Poet, and a Saint, and that it was heresie that cast <hi>Tertullian</hi> out of the Church, and not his Verses, I dare acknowledge these for mine owne, and feare not to suffer in that cause, wherein those Worthies were so magnify'd: Especially, since these Essayes (which I feare their weaknesse will too strongly testifie) were not my study, but my Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when in the vacations having for a time inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted my more serious affaires, I chose Poetry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Idlenesse; yet I have not chose Poetry with the

hazard of my Conscience, &amp; so instead of a Divine have writ a superstitious worke; howsoever Malice or Ignorance may wrest a passage unto Popery, I meane that, where <hi>Abraham</hi> prayes for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Israelites: But besides that the Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is generall for the Church, which no judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine but will allow for Orthodox, it is made by him, whom a Popish Divine will deny at that time to bee able to intercede: there was no solliciting of him they saw not, and the holiest of the Patriarchs (as they will tell you) saw not God till after the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I have the more fully exprest my selfe in this, because I would not be esteem'd as one of thē (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is too great an harvest) who play the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons with Religion, that will halt betweene two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and in spite of the Prophet, at the same time serve God and Baal, who like not Orthodoxe truth, unlesse delivered in hereticall tearmes, &amp; so by a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table new tricke of Iugling, call that Pacification, which is Conspiracy, of whose proficiency in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I can speake little; but this I may most confidently affirme, that (perhaps not after the Apostles mind, yet certainely in his words) they goe on from Faith, to Faith. Of this crime, and of the suspition of it, I trust I am sufficiently acquited: for other errors which Malice ond Curiosity will aboundantly mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, I onely referre my selfe to the truely Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who know that a good Poem is as a good Life, not wherein there are none, but wherin there are the fewest faults.</p>
