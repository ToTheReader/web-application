      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He memorable vertues and actions of the renowmed <hi>Bernard Stuart,</hi> Lord <hi>D'Aubigni,</hi> recorded in sundry histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, although but incidently, and in seuerall places, haue inuited, yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited me by a collection of them, and of what else I could learne concerning him by written Records and credible relations of honorable Persons, to renew his memory. Which I did first in <hi>French,</hi> for that from his youth hee hauing serued two French Kings, and bin the most worthy &amp; victorious of all the Commanders imployed by them in their warres: yet are his vertues and braue exployts more sparingly and slightly recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>French</hi> Writers, then by those of the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Nation, against which he warred. And now haue I done the same in <hi>English,</hi> for that, albeit hee were borne of an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Familie in one of the Kingdoms of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> and deserued wel of them both, as it is testified by good Records, and by <hi>Lesley</hi> Bishop of Rosse, in his Latine history of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Yet is he scarcely remembred in any other publique history of either of them. But if any that shall read his Memoriall writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by me in <hi>French,</hi> find it in some points different from this, let him know that it is not in any poynt of historie, but onely in some amplifications: vvhich I haue endeuoured to better in this, beeing my latter labour.</p>
   <p>The reason which induced me thus to write, rather in verse then in prose, was, because what I could gather beeing not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for a competent relation of his life in prose, I might with more libertie and congruitie, enlarge the same in verse by di-<gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">
