   <head>Vnto the godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N what account this worke is to be had, the learned in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie neede not to be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. The text of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being such, as of it selfe deserueth all reuerence: the Commentarie so framed, as a taste of it being taken, it will easily procure a good appetite to embrace the whole throughly. But that such as be desirous of heauenly wisedome, and yet haue not attained to such ripenesse of iudgement, as they can of themselues discerne of bookes (that in these dayes are set forth in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) which are most for their profit, may bee put in minde of the excellencie of this treatise to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their godly studie, I thought good, beeing thereto required, in fewe wordes to encourage them to vndertake the reading thereof to the ende they maye reape such profite thereby, as may delight them for the present, and the frute thereof remaine with them for euer. The wisedome of God, in all the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inspired of God, sheweth it selfe, according to the matter whereof it entreateth, to be most excellent. The argument of this sermon being of wisedome, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that instrument of the holie Ghost, whome God chose aboue all men (except him in whome all the treasures of wisedome are layd vp, our Sauiour Christ I meane) in whome hee would place the excellencie of vnderstanding, about the attaining whereof all the
<pb facs="4"/> wise men of the worlde dulled their wittes in vaine: there must needes be opened vnto vs thereby a certain and vndoubted way vnto the holy closet of true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and heauenly wisedome. <hi>Solomon</hi> himselfe the Preacher, a right figure of our Sauiour Christ, both in his peaceable and glorious kingdome, and in his excellent and supereminent wisedome, was a man so prepared of God, to be a moste notable storehouse of Sapience, as no meane of comming thereby in him was wanting. For first by naturall towardnesse, good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, studie, and other ordinarie meanes, he attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to such extraordinarie knowledge, as euen in his tender yeares, which age is most subiect to folly, hee obtained the name and credite of a wise man before he was a growen man, which not one among tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand euen in his gray heares deserueth to carie. Secōd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by special grace &amp; diuine reuelatiō, he was aduaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the highest degree of wisedom &amp; vnderstāding, so that no man either before him or after him might aspire to the like. And last of al, before the endighting of this diuine preaching, he had the principal of al his former knowledge, &amp; matter of this sermon confirmed by experience, which among men is counted to haue so great moment to the obteining of wisedom, as no man lightly is counted wise, which vnto knowledge &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning hath not ioyned practise &amp; experience. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the same <hi>Solomon,</hi> by the secrete &amp; yet most wise iudgement of God, was suffered for al his wisdom to fal into such folly frō which many thousāds of gods childrē, not cōparable to him in knowledge, are preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by grace, to shewe a most cleare distinction betwene
<pb facs="5"/> these two giftes of God, the one of wisedome to knowe, the other of strength to stande: yet must no man sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that any thing thereby is derogated from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of those writings, which the spirite of God hath appointed by that his instrument to be penned, for the perpetuall instruction of his Church in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And lest of all of this booke, which as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to haue beene written in the latter ende of his dayes, so it is thought of many learned men, that it is a testimonie of his repentance after his fall. If anye thing therein seeme hard to be vnderstood (as some things are in deede, which the vnstedfast and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruert, as they do the rest of the scriptures to their owne destruction.) These difficulties are so well ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the true and naturall sense of the whole text with the right scope and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>de thereof, is so lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nedly expressed in the Commentarie, that in mine opinion, no man hath either with more faithfulnesse, sinceritie, or dexteritie, to the satisfying of the best l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>arned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted this booke of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> then this learned man <hi>Serranus.</hi> Finally, the same Commentarie▪ is so truely translated, by one which is a learned Diuine himselfe, and vnderstandeth the worke whereof the Commentarie entreateth (as euery one doeth not that taketh vpon them to translate in these dayes) that the studious Reader, by the assistance of Gods spirite shall vndoubtedly finde such frute of his trauaile, as he shal neuer repent him of his labour bestowed in reading.</p>
