   <head>TO MY NEIGHBOVRS AND VERY LOVING Friends, the Inhabitants of the Parish of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg> ANDREVVES, within the CITIE of CANTERBVRY.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>ELOVED being of late requested by some of you, to Preach the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Sermon, of that worthy Preacher of the word of God, and a lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer for many yeares in this Citie, M. <hi>Thomas Wilson,</hi> a man for his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular gift and facultie in Preaching, and worthie works which he hath penned of good note, even among such as neuer saw his person in the flesh. And of great esteeme, among his owne people, and many others that haue profited by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery;
<pb facs="3"/>You found me readie to tender my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as the last dutie of my loue, to my fellow la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer in the Lords haruest, and now with the Lord.</p>
   <p>But to a second request, made since by some, namely, to publish what was then deliuered; To this, I deferred my answere for a time, yet after a pawse, hauing in the interim, duely considered, that it is a thing too common in these dayes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the enemies of truth, secretly, and cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to depraue such after their death, who haue beene worthie instruments of Gods glory, in the time of their life, and that by the publishing, of what was then spoken of him, many abroad may truely vnderstand the excellent resolution of this faithfull Pastor, the watchfull eye he hath had alwayes ouer his flocke, his constancie in the truth, peaceably, and comfortably, shutting vp his eyes in that Religion and Faith, which he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in his life.</p>
   <p>And also on the other side, that others may take notice, of the vnfained affection, true zeale, feruent loue; of so great a multitude within this Citie to the Gospell of Christ, taking to heart, the losse, and deprivation by death, of so emmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a Teacher, who by the providence of God was planted among them, whom I may terme a painfull labourer, and withall a skilfull builder in the house of God.</p>
   <p>In respect hereof, I haue at length rather satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied others, then my selfe, in publishing by my pen, what I lately deliuered by word of mouth.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>The reasons why I haue dedicated this Sermon vnto you (my good neighbours and friends) are these;</p>
   <p>First, because I am perswaded, many of you were well affected to the deceased, even for his message sake, as you are readie at all times, to harken to all such as come vnto you in the name of the Lord. Your diligent attention to the word of God, both at home and abroad, deserveth a due prayse.</p>
   <p>Secondly, to whom more fitting can I tender the first fruits of my pen, then to such, on whom in my yonger yeares, I bestowed both the first fruits of my ministery in the preaching of the Gospell, and also the residue of my labours, even now to a riper age?</p>
   <p>Thirdly, to signifie hereby vnto you my thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, for the continuance of that loue vnto me your Minister, and Pastor, now 30. yeares. In which loue of the Inhabitants of this Parish my most louing Father, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Thomas Swift,</hi> my prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor in the Parsonage of S. <hi>Andrew</hi> the space of 22. yeares, a Preacher of Gods word among you, did not a little reioyce.</p>
   <p>Yea, I boldly affirme, vpon sure knowledge, that in his declining age, he ioyed not more in any worldly blessing then in the loue of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who on his death-bed, when as it was questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his friends, where his body should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred, charged his Executor in his last Will, in these very terms, that his bones should rest in that Church where his people so intirely loued him.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>The premisses considered, I intreat you, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this small token I send you. And as I haue so many yeares past (as you all know) by the preaching of the Gospell, indevoured to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of my power, to build you vp in the faith of Christ; So my prayers still are, as they haue beene daily made vnto God on your behalfe, that you, and all yours, may grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Iesus Christ, to the salvation of your soules, vnto whose blessed protection I leaue you.</p>
