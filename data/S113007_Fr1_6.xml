   <head>TO the protestant reader, wherin is declared how we haue free will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to doo good woorkes.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>MANY</hi> erroures I fynd in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> fancy of Protestants religion which roote owt of mennes hartes all christian deuotion &amp; pietie. For graūt me once an imputatiue iustice, that Christes good woorkes &amp; merittes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, iustify vs before God, by only apprehensiou of faithe; to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose then requyre they good woorks of vs? They answeare, as fruites of faith, but these fruites auaile me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to iustification the which wente before them, &amp; iustifyed me without them, therfore imputatiue faith, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vpp all good woorks by the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, that prepare the way to iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
   <p>After one is iustifyed, they haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> prouyded dyuers other poysens to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the plant of grace &amp; iustice, soft by the indeuoure and cooperation of mannes good will, with the grace of God, it blossom deuotiou, &amp; fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy

      </gap>re iustice, vertues, &amp; operations, done either by the good inclination of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or helpe of godds fauoure and grace, are sinnes, a steaned clothe, abominable in Godds sight, deserue death &amp; hell.</p>
   <p>That we are not able (sustyned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by Godds grace) to kepe his commā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, to walke in his iustificatiōs withoute deadly sinnes &amp; such offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as deserue damnation. That he which once inioyeth a lyuely faith, is iustifyed before God, &amp; admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his fauour, seeth most euidently by his <hi>Plerophoria,</hi> that is a certayne internall &amp; full perswasion, that god haithe accepted him into the nomber of his elect, and that as assuredly he shal neuer descēd to hel as Lucifer shal neuer ascend to heauen. What fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowethe of this? <hi>Edamus, bibamus,</hi>

<pb facs="8"/> of Paradyse in this world, and in the world to come. But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant presently will reply, that such a man had neuer faith, because faith necessarily bringeth with it good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. Ah poore wretches, then a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant can not make such a resolution what hīdreth him? Haith he not liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to sinn, although he lacke liberty to do well? Do we not see daily those that boasted somtimes of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, to chang their religion &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com catholicks or puritans? This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare declareth well what the protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants defende, but taketh not away the argument, as if a man should say, Dauid in killing Vrias had no chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <note place="margin">2 Reg. 11.</note> It is true, but this yeldethe not the cause why he had no Charity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to the protestantes religion, no more then he that seeth a tree wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, rendereth a reason why the tree lacketh lyfe, by saying it lacketh leaues, because this is an effect: the reason is lack of nourishment, or som fault in the roote. Nowe these men will sweare vnto death that they see
<pb facs="9"/> their faith as well as the best protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in the world, which is, as they say, the life of all good woorks, and therfore they will lowse their senses to all lustes &amp; ryotousnes.</p>
   <p>Besides all protestants by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, should be confirmed in grace, not only not to sinne finally, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so at any tyme for the lyke reason we may &amp; must geue of the one, as the o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther. Yet I hope they will not denye but S. Paule, Mary Magdaleyn, S. Peter, Dauid, &amp; dyuers others, as good protestants as they, sinned, &amp; that most heanously for all their <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophoria.</hi> For I would learne of them whether Dauid, or S. Peter, by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, lost their faith or noe? For that they lost their Charity, the Scripture proueth most plainely <hi>Qui non dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Io. 3.</note>
      <hi>manet in morte.</hi> He that loue the not, remaneth in death, but Dauid in killinge Vrias, loued him not, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid therfore remained in death. The death of the soule is want of charitie, Dauid was dead in soule, Dauid ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wanted charitie, but accordinge
<pb facs="9"/> to the protestants ignorant diuinity, he that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ith faith, can no want charity Dauid had faith, therfore he coulde not want Charity. The Maior is a-lowed of all protestants, because cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the fiute of faith: The minor they also graunt, for he that once had faithe, can neuer loose it, Dauid had faith before, therfore by sinninge, he lost it not. This poynt I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more largely, because I take it that thousandes of oure countrie men are gone to the deuill grounded vpon this hereticall foundation. And I harde of men of good credit, that there was a puritan of late that killed him selfe not farr from London &amp; left writen vpon a table, that no man should conceiue ill of his death, because he knew him selfe one of gods elected, &amp; therfore he shortned his dayes to go to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. And in very deede if the protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants religion were true, we must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des confesse, that he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> saued: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by this enormous sinne &amp; presūp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuous he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>esy either loste he his faith, or his Charity, for he that once haith
<pb facs="10"/> faith, can neuer loose it finally, but is assured of his election.</p>
   <p>Many moe erroures I fynde in the protestants religion which ouerthrowe good workes, but especially one that toucheth to the quick &amp; stingethe to the verie harte of deuotion &amp; piety, that is want of free will to do wel. For if we wante free will, then all good workes procede from vs by a certaine necessity &amp; compulsion, neither lyeth it in our power, to serue God when we will, fast when we will, loue God when we will: neither can we pray more feruently, nor fast more rigou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouslye, nor loue God more exactly, if we resolue oure selues neuer so effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, because it lyeth not in our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to performe those determinations although we be guyded &amp; assisted by godds grace. This heresy, for that I know it haith made great impression in many mennes harts, and the verie thought therof might not impeache a little all my labour &amp; industry, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose good soules to receiue: by gods grace brefly I intend to ouerthrow.
<pb facs="10"/> For of all other it semeth to me, not onely impious, absurde, and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but also senceles &amp; most palpably to be perceiued.</p>
   <p>Three or foure arguments onely I meane to propoūde, reseruing the rest for amore conueuient place.</p>
   <p>Firste I will begin with comon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that euery man prouethe in him selfe, for as sensibly as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in my self free wil to sitt downe &amp; ryse vpp, to open myne eyes and shutt them: so euidently &amp; sensibly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen nowe I perceiue, that if I will, I may pray &amp; not pray, geue almes &amp; not geue almes, faste to day and not faste, say in my harte, o lorde I loue thee, &amp; presently make a rash oath or offend god. And in truth he that will deny these experiences, may aswell deny that he seeth or heareth, his ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res being attent, &amp; his eyes vnshutt.</p>
   <p>But the protestantes say, this can not be done without Godds grace, &amp; did euer Catholick deny this? Had not Adam before his fall accordinge to the protestants doctrine, free will?
<pb facs="11"/> and yet he neither could pray nor loue God without grace. But this doctrine repugneth with goddes woorde. This we deny, and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t but the protestan es bring one lyne from thence to proue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently their errour, &amp; I will Ioine is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue with them.</p>
   <p>The se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ond experience I gather, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> their daily practise, for they cease not to exclame against catholicks, because they come not to church, and accepte their protestancy. Nowe you say that catho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ks goe not to churche, you say they are obstinate &amp; wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ull, in n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, ergo they may go if they will, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go they haue free will, for what els is free will, but power to doe well or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil. Therfore either yelde vnto vs that we haue free wil to do good works, or cry no more againste vs, since we feele not that compulsion &amp; force of Godds grace which you say is requisite, or suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer vs with pati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>

      </gap>ceyued it.</p>
   <pb facs="11"/>
   <p>Secondly I would desire the protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to geue me a signe, wherby they know in ciuill actions, that men haue free will, or what maner of dealing they vse with them whom they knowe to haue free will, &amp; would induce their libertie to one part, rather then to an o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther: &amp; I will fynd expres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>y in scriptures the lyke proceding of God, in woorks of pyetie &amp; religion.</p>
   <p>Election &amp; choyce can not be but in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> liberty, as all learned men will confesse, for therein freely a man acceptethe one meane as conuenient for his end, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth the other: as when a man taketh a iournay, if he may goe by water or by land, on foote, or on horse backe, with company or alone, by sūdry waies or at diuers tymes. If he chose one of these &amp; leaue the other, by thē vertue of election, no man can deny, but that he haith free will.</p>
   <p>This choyce &amp; election in woorkes of vertue &amp; Religion, we fynde in the scriptures ascrybed to men. Iosue put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tethe it in the choyee of the Israelites, <note place="margin">Ios. 24.</note> whether they will serue the true God,
<pb facs="12"/> or false godds. <hi>Optio vobis datur, oligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te hodie quid placet, &amp;c</hi> Election is ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uē you, chose to day what pleaseth you whom you ought most to serue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the goddes whom your fathers ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> or the goddes of the <hi>Amorites</hi> in whose lande you dwel: for I &amp; my house will serue our Lord. And the people answeared, god for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that we should forsake our Lorde &amp; serue strange godds.</p>
   <p>Heare we see choyce proposed, the true God, &amp; the goddes of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopotamia,</hi> &amp; the goddes of the <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,</hi> put to their election, whom of these three they intended to serue: the people reiecte the false god, &amp; electe the true god. What libertie can a mā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demaunde more manifest then this, in any woorkē of pietie or religion?</p>
   <p>The lyke free will we haue regestred that Salomon vsed, when God willed him to aske what he would, <hi>Postnla a</hi>
      <note place="margin">3. Reg. 3.</note>
      <hi>me quid vis, vt dem tibi,</hi> Demaunde of me What thou wilte, that I may geue thee. Now Salomon was put to his choyce, he might haue asked welth,
<pb facs="12"/> longe lyfe, reuenge of his enemies, yet he preferred wisdome before them all: &amp; this election so pleased God, that<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he woulde not demaunde them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he might, for so much those woordes signify, <hi>Quia post ulasti,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast desyred this thing; &amp; asked for thy self, neither longe daies nor riches, nor the lyues of thyne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes: with wisdom he gaue him all the rest. For if he could not haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syred the other of god, at what time he requested wisdom: God had not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered a iuste reason why he gaue him with wisdom, riches &amp; glory, for the particle <hi>Quia,</hi> yeldeth a reason or cause of this gift.</p>
   <p>The like we haue of Abraham, who might haue offered &amp; not offered his Sonne Isaack. The woorde <hi>tentauit,</hi> God tempted Abraham, declarethe libertie. It was put in his election, for so those woords signify, <hi>Per memetip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum iura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>i &amp;c.</hi> I haue sworne by my selfe, saithe our Lorde, because thou hast done this thing, &amp; not spared thy sonne for me, I will blesse thee &amp;c.</p>
   <pb facs="13"/>
   <p>Some protestants will say, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham could not but offer his sonne because he was a figure of Christ, &amp; a representation of his passion: but by this answeare they mighte aswell say, that Iudas was compelled to sel Christ and the Iewes to crucify him, because god foretould them by his Prophets, &amp; represented them by figures in the ould testament, which weare a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blasphemy. True it is that as god foresaw that Iudas by his libertie abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, was to sell Christ, &amp; therfore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painted it in the ould Testament: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so soreseing the good vse of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahames free will with his grace, or deyned the oblation of his sonne as a figure of Christs passion.</p>
   <p>In ciuill actions we declare libertie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by conditionall fpeches, as by saying if thou doe this, this will befall thee, if otherwyse contrary: &amp; the reason is most pregnant, because by conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on adioyned, we foretell the euente that shall folow, intending therby to induce libertie rather to one part then an other. As for example, the ciuill
<pb facs="13"/> Magistrate in his lawe will say, if a man steale, he shall be hanged, if he defend his countrie, he shall be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if he committ treason, his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shall be punished, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>In workes of pietie &amp; religion, in a hundreth places of scripture we fynd the lyke conditions annexed to Gods <note place="margin">Leui. 26 Deu. 28. Psal. 94 Mat. 19</note> promises or threatninges, <hi>If you heare me, you shall eate the frute of the earth. To day if you will heare his voyce, har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den not your hartes. Si vis ad vitam ingreds, serua mandata.</hi> If thou wilte enter into lyfe, kepe the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>
   <p>Those that haue free will to doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> one thinge and an other, we vse to threaten with punishmente and death if they omitt that we would ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e thē to doe, or committ that we inhibite them. As for example the galowes to theires, because they may lyue truly if they will. So God threateneth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall deathe to those that kepe not his cōmaundementes, exercyse not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of pyetie, in a hundreth places of the scripture, <hi>Nisi paenitentiam egeritis</hi>
      <pb facs="14"/>
      <hi>omnes similiter peribitis.</hi> If youe doe <note place="margin">Luc. 13</note> not penance, you shall altogether pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. <hi>Nisi quis renatus fucrit ex aqua &amp;</hi>

If a man had not grace to repent, or it weare impossible hauing grace but to repent, soothly these comminations weare ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous. For weare it not a madnes for a hundrethe men houldinge a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister tyed hande &amp; foote in a corde, they aboue in a turret, &amp; he belowe, to threaten him death &amp; all terrours if he came not vppe, if they intended effectually afterwards by mayne force to hayle him vpp? This poore mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister can not stirr or moue him selfe vpwards, &amp; yet they stand threatning, to what ende? when they haue done all they can, they must compell him,
<pb facs="14"/> and inforce him vpp. After this sorte standeth it with the protestants, they say man lyeth bound hande and foote wit &amp; will, body &amp; soule, in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of sinne.

   <p>Moreouer all those scriptures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Christ is said to knock at the doore &amp; desyre to enter, or to expecte that we come to him. For if he effected all, of necessitie he opened the doore of him selfe, he neded not to stay till we would come to him. <hi>Ego sto ad osti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>

   <p>The laste reason shall be reason it selfe, for in truth as experience doth manifestly proue our liberty: so reason doth without reply conuince it. The firste reason, is remorse of conscience in this lyfe &amp; in hell. For if men had not libertie, remorse shoulde be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguished. For what euill soeuer we do of necessitie, presently we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it, &amp; acquite our conscience with the impossibilitie. As if a man should drinke poysen, not knowinge, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer would haue any scruple of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, because it was inauoydable, he could not preuent it. But if he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it of him selfe, or mighte haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented it &amp; woulde not: then the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of conscience, will presently rack hi, because he might haue done good saued his owne lyfe, &amp; would not. For he that resisteth any sinn doth wel accordinge to that sayinge, <hi>Beatus ille</hi>
      <note place="margin">Eccl. 31</note>
      <pb facs="21"/>
      <hi>qui potuit transgredi, &amp; non est trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressus.</hi> Againe the torture, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Conscience, that stickethe so depe with her stinge in the soule of all damned creatures, shoulde neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in hell, if man weare depryued of libertie. For their torment consisteth in this, that for their owne demerites being created of God in suche sorte, that if they would, heauen laide open for them by doing well: and yet they cast them selues into hell by their own accorde by woorking euill. For if they could not haue done well but of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie weare plunged into finne, I see not what remorse they can haue.</p>
   <p>The second reason is, for that noe Law with iustice can be enacted, but such as may be obserued, because the ende of the law is to make good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, &amp; therfore it weare most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surde, that all men were not able to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kepe that law, which was ordeyned for all men. Againe euery law may be preuaricated, for els why should pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment be annexed to the law? and so consequently euery law suppose the
<pb facs="22"/> libertie. Moreouer the verie state of man, who is as it weare in this world fighting, requyreth libertie. For stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding betwene heauen &amp; hell, God &amp; the deuill, placed in this theater either to ouercome or be ouercome: all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son requyred, that he might be plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both wayes, &amp; of a flexible will, either to accept god, or reiecte him, folowe Sathan, or pursue him, yelde to his temptations, or resist them, as by practise we see effected in the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall comedie of Iob. For if Iob had lacked free will to do well, what great masterie had it bene for God, with such necessary grace, to haue ouercō Sathan? But Iob hauinge free will, frayle fleshe, assaulted of the deuill, pursued of his frendes, tempted by his wyfe, spoyled of his riches, bereaued of his children, vlcered in body, and yet to ouercome all insernall forces, by suche grace of God, as he mighte haue vsed or abused at his pleasure: plainely conuinceth the greate victory both of God &amp; Iob against the deuill, because for godds loue, his changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="22"/> will, perseuered without change.</p>
   <p>Scotus one of the mirroures of witt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that euer this worlde brought forthe, thought the experience of free will so palpable, that he iudged the truthe therof not able to be proued by any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument more euidētly, then by whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the denyer so longe, till he con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fessed that the whipper had free will to whipp him, &amp; to leaue whipping. So in good sooth I thinke if any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister weare in lyke case, he woulde confesse, that the whipper mighte for the loue of God, let him alone if he would, and procede in his beatinge if he listed.</p>
   <p>If we wante free will, what Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall that be in Scriptures so oft <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> tymes repeated, that euery man shall receiue accordinge to his woorkes? What Iustice will there appeare to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment men eternally for sinne &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, to whom it was impossible to do any good? Or what rewarde shall that be which God bestowethe vpon them, that weare compelled to doe well, neither was it in their power to
<pb facs="23"/> doe euill.</p>
   <p>In myne opinion, all the theues &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> harlottes whom the protestantes haue punished in this tyme of erroure, shall geue testimonie against this hereticall assertion. For certainly when the thefe stoale, &amp; the harlot abused her bodie, they did it vpō vehement temptation, (for otherwyse they neuer would haue plunged both theire soules &amp; bodies into so great daungers.) This temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation then I demaunde if they could haue resisted at that tyme or noe? If not, what law will hang a man so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thinge vnauoydable, for it layde not in the theeues power to auoyde it? If he could resist it, then he had liberty to do a good woorke &amp; did it not, &amp; consequently answeared not the grace of God (without which he could not resist any vehement temptation) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he might haue frely answeared.</p>
   <p>Finally this errou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> is the roote of all licentiousnes. For thus God knoweth two may reason in Englande, and in the protestantes schole insolubly; Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we haue grace to do well or not,
<pb facs="23"/> If I haue it, then it is impossible to do euill, if I haue it not, it is impossible to do well, for all goodnes procedeth of grace which compelleth our willes, &amp; all euill cometh of lack of grace, which we haue not at our wills. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all Epicures liue as licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they will, all riotous persons passe theire dayes in all dissolution, for this erroure will warrante them sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.</p>
   <p>The arguments or rather sophismes that protestantes bring against this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, experimented, practised, &amp; allowed veritie, in all antiquitie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue rather hissing then answearinge, yet one I will answeare, that by it the reader may Iudge of the reste.</p>
   <p>They alledge forsothe that parte of the scripture in the parable, where the <note place="margin">Luc. 14</note> Kinge commaunded his seruantes, to compell them that they founde in the high wayes, to come to his marriage dinner, &amp; the other scripture wheare <note place="margin">Cau. 1. Ose. 11 Io. 6. et 12.</note> God is said to draw men vnto him. But this rotten obiection, oflong since rooted owt heresies, must haue as ould
<pb facs="24"/> a solution, for by this drawing &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pulsion, the scripture meanethe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that god vseth great helps to drawe men vnto him, for which they are in excusable if they come not. As if one inuyte me to supper, yet I excuse my self, he insisteth with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reasons, at the last he induceth me: after I say, he compelled me to come he brought so many perswasions. For do we not see that one of them which weare compelled, came withoute a mariage garment? so that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion <note place="margin">Mat. 22</note> of godds grace, slandeth with the abuse thereof.</p>
   <p>I haue bene longer in this preface, then perhappes the proportion of the gate with the howse requyred by iuste Ceintrie, yet the opportunitie and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, causeth builders often times to breake their square, as it befalleth me at this presente. And therfore I leaue of purpose an other discourse of the meritt of good woorks, the which I could proue as manifestly as this, &amp; perhapps it weare as necessary: but an other occasion will not wante.
<pb facs="24"/> In the meane tyme, I request all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants in the woundes of Christe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus as they tender their owne saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ponder these reasons with the balance of indifferent iudgment, and dailye to goe forwardes in good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes for which they shall receiue theire Iudgment.</p>
