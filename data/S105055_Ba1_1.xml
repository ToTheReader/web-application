Notwithstanding that also in the cause I will declare, appeareth plainelye the force of Fortune, in retourning a man vnto <hi>Italy</hi> oute of the extreame partes of the worlde of the Orient, after that he had suffered and passed fiue and twentie yeres such greate fortunes, aswell by sea as by lande.

And for that I hearde by manye, that he declared of manye singular things, I desired muche to heare hym, and not onelye to demaunde of him concerning the things whiche hée hadde séene, in the presence of wise Barons, and of greate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, but also to enforme my selfe wyth hym in myne owne house, and to take a note of his relation, for that there mighte remaine a remembraunce of it vnto those that hereafter shoulde come after mée. And of a trueth hée tolde so certaynelye, so wisely, and so attentiuely all hys trauaile made amongest people of so farre Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the vse, manners, and custome of the <hi>Indians,</hi> the diuersitie of wilde beastes, trées, the lynages of Spices, and in what place it groweth, that it appeared well, hée dydde not declare a fained tale, but the trueth of that whiche hée hadde séene. And as it séemeth, this man went so farre, as none of the olde tyme hadde béene, for he passed the riuer <hi>Gangy,</hi> and wente beyonde the Ilande <hi>Taprobana,</hi> where we reade there came none, excepte one Captaine of <hi>Alexanders</hi> fléete named <hi>Onesycrito,</hi> and a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> that by fortune of tēpest arriued in those parties in the time of <hi>Tiberius Cesar.</hi> This <hi>Nicholas Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> being yong, was as a Merchaunt in the Citie of <hi>Damasco</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and hauing learned the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue, he departed from the sayde Citie in the company of .600. Merchantes, the whiche company they do call <hi>Carouana,</hi>
         <pb n="135" facs="82"/>
or <hi>Carauana,</hi> &amp; trauailing with his merchaundize through the deserts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> otherwise named <hi>Petrea,</hi> and from thence thoroughe <hi>Chaldie,</hi> he came vnto the greate riuer <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Hée saide, that at the going out of the Deserte, hée sawe a meruailous thing, that aboute midnighte, being all at reste, he heard a great noise and sound, that they thoughte it hadde bin companies of <hi>Alarabes</hi> wild naked menne, or robbers, and that they were comming to doe them some hurte, and all the whole company arose and were al ready with the feare, and they sawe manye battels of horsemen whiche passed harde by their tents much like an hoste, doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto them no hurte at all, and those that hadde vsed that way, said it was certaine companies of fiends which did ouer run in that sorte the Deserts.</p>
      <p>There standeth aboue <hi>Euphrates</hi> a noble Citie that the walles of it be of fouretéene thousande paces. And this Citie was a parte of the olde <hi>Babilon,</hi> and those of that Countrie, name it by a newe name <hi>Baldachia,</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> runneth in the middes of it, and they doe passe ouer a bridge that hath fourtéene arches of ech side, where appeareth many remembraunces of the olde <hi>Babilon,</hi> and manye edifications throwne downe. It hath a strong and a greate Pallaice royall standing vpon a mountaine. The King of this prouince is of a mightie power. From hence vp the riuer twentie dayes sayling, he sawe manye noble and populous, and earable groundes of Ilandes, and so he trauailed eight dayes iourney by lande vnto the Cittie <hi>Balsera,</hi> and from thence in foure dayes he came vnto the Sea of <hi>Persia,</hi> whiche ebbeth and floweth as ours doeth, and so there saylyng fyue dayes, he arryued at a Hauen called <hi>Chalcou,</hi> and from thence hée wente vnto an Iland named <hi>Omersia,</hi> whych is a small Iland, &amp; distant from the firme lād about .12000 paces, &amp; frō thēce he passed toward
<pb n="136" facs="83"/>
         <hi>India</hi> a hundred myles, and came vnto a Citie named <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labatia,</hi> which is a noble Citie of the <hi>Persians,</hi> where mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunts vse to traffique, and here he was a certaine time, and learned the Persian tongue, and made him apparell as the <hi>Persians</hi> had, and so he passed from thence forward al his time and trauell. And here he tooke shipping in a shippe with company of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and of the <hi>Moores,</hi> &amp; among them they kéepe muche their promise, lawes, and othes made in company, and so sayling a moneth, he came vnto a noble Citie named <hi>Cambayta,</hi> situated at the second entraunce that the riuer of <hi>India</hi> maketh in the lande. In this Countrie there is founde the pretious stones whiche are called <hi>Sardins</hi> or <hi>Sardonicas</hi>: and here when the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band dieth, they do burne his wife or wiues that he hath, with his body, and she that he most loued, layeth hir neck vppon hir husbandes arme, and in this wise being in hir husbandes armes, they burne them: and the other wiues they burne in an other fire whiche is made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and of this vse it shall be rehearsed hereafter. And passing on twentie dayes iourney, he founde two Cities, the one named <hi>Pacamunria,</hi> and the other <hi>Hely.</hi> In this Countrey there groweth Ginger whiche is called in that countrie <hi>Bellyedy, Gebelly,</hi> and <hi>Belly,</hi> and it is the roote of trées of two cubites in height, the leaues are great, and after the fashion of a kettle, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bark is hard like y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> barke of Canes, &amp; it couereth his fruit: out of it procéedeth the gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which mingled with ashes, &amp; layd against the Sun, it drieth in thrée dayes. From hence he went trauailing frō the sea coaste thrée hundreth myles, and he came vnto the greate Citie named <hi>Berengalia</hi> whych, is in compasse thrée score myles, being enuironed on the one side with harde and highe rockes, and on the other side towards the valleys and playne grounde with strong adarnes and boughes. They saye héere is .900000. menne that may weare armoure. The men of that country take
<pb n="137" facs="83"/>
as manye wiues as they lifte, and are burnte with them when they dye. In this their King hath ouer them greate vantage, for he taketh twelue thousād wiues, and of these there goeth on foote after him wheresoeuer he goeth foure thousande, whych do only prepare and dresse his victuals: and there rideth foure thousand on horsebacke, well appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, and of more estimation than the firste. The other foure thousand ryde in carts and wagons, and of these at the leaste there be two thousand or thrée thousand of them that he taketh with condition, that when the king is dead, they of their owne frée willes muste be burnte wyth him: vnto these they do great seruice and obedience. This king hath another very noble Citie, which hath ten thousande paces in compasse, being eight dayes iourney from <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia,</hi> from whence in twentie dayes iourney by lande, hée came vnto a Citie vppon the sea coste, with a good hauen called <hi>Pedifetaman,</hi> and in these twentie dayes iourney hée went through two Cities, the one named <hi>Odes Chyria,</hi> and the other <hi>Conteri Chyrian,</hi> where there groweth the redde <hi>Sandolos</hi> or Saunders. From hence he passed vnto a Citie named <hi>Malpurya,</hi> whiche standeth beyonde the seconde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, that the riuer <hi>India</hi> maketh in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> end, wher the body of <hi>Saint Thomas</hi> the Apostle lyeth honourably in a fayre and famous Church, where he is greatlye honoured and worshipped by the Heretickes Nestorians: and there liue almost a thousande men of them in this Citie. These doe liue throughout all <hi>India</hi> scattered as the Iewes doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs. All this prouince is named <hi>Mahabaria,</hi> beyonde there standeth a Citie named <hi>Cayla,</hi> where there be plenty of peares, and many trées that beare no fruite, of sixe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits high, and as muche in compasse: the leaues of these trées are so thinne, that being playted or foulded vp, you may put one of them in the palme of your hand. They doe vse these leaues in steade of Paper to write vpon, and for to couer their heades with when it rayneth, for one leafe
<pb n="138" facs="84"/>
will couer thrée or foure men, when they doe trauell. In the middest of this sea there standeth a noble Ilande na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Zaylan,</hi> whyche is thrée thousande myles in compasse, where there be many precious stones, as Rubies, Saphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, Granates, and those that are named Cattes eyes, whyche are muche estéemed there. Also there is plentye of Synamon, whiche is a trée muche like vnto oures of the greatest Hawtho<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>es, sauing that the braunches runne not vpwarde, but open and streight slopewise: the leaues be muche like vnto our Bay leaues, sauing that those of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Synamon are bigger: the rine or barke of the braunches is best and thinnest, and the rine of the bodye and roote is thickest, and of lesse taste: the fruite is like vnto the Baye berries, out of whych there commeth a very swéete Oyle, and the people vse to make oyntment of it, wherewith the <hi>Indians</hi> do annoint themselues: they burne the wood of the trée, when the rine is taken away. There is in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey a lake, and in the middest of it standeth a royall Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thrée myles compasse. The Lords of this Iland are of the lynage of the <hi>Bragmanos,</hi> and are taken to be of more witte than the others. The <hi>Bragmanos</hi> Studie Phylosophy all their life, and also Astrologie, and liue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly. From hence he passed vnto the famous Ilande na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Taprobana,</hi> which the <hi>Indians,</hi> call <hi>Scyamucera,</hi> where is a noble Citie, and there he was a twelue month: it is sixe myles in compasse, and is a famous Citie, hauing greate trade of Merchaundise there, and in al that Iland. From hence be sayled with a prosperous winde, leauing on the right hand the Iland <hi>Adamania,</hi> which is as much to say, as the Ilande of Colde, whyche is 800. myles compasse, wherein the <hi>Euitrofagitas</hi> doe liue, and no straungers goe thyther, except it be for necessity of weather, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately those barbarous people hewe them in péeces, and eate them. He sayde that <hi>Taprobana</hi> is 1600000. paces in compasse, the men are verye cruell, and of stubberne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="139" facs="84"/>
and the men and women haue very bigge eares, laden with Hoopes of golde, and with precious stones. They do weare linnen and cloth of silke or cruell downe vnto their knées: they take many wiues: their houses are lowe, by reason of the greate heate that the sunne hath there. They are Idolatours, and haue muche Pepper named the greatest, and of the long Pepper, and greate plentie of Camphore and golde. The trée that maketh the pepper is like the <hi>Yedra,</hi> or Iuie trée, the berries are gréen lyke vnto the Iuniper berries, and redde, and being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled wyth ashes, they harden with the sunne: there is a gréene fruite named Durians, of the bignesse of Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And there be some of them lyke Orengies or Lemans, of diuerse sauours and taste, as like butter, lyke milke, and like curdes. In that part of this lande, whiche is named <hi>Bateth,</hi> y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
         <hi>Antropophagos</hi> dwel, and haue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all warre with their neyghbours, and eate the fleshe of their enimies that they doe take, and kéepe their heades for treasure, and vse them in steade of money, when they do buy anye thing, in giuing moste heades for the thing that is most worth, and he that hath moste heades of the deade men in his kéeping, is estéemed to be most rich.</p>
      <p>Hauing the Iland <hi>Taprobana,</hi> and sayling fiftéene days, he arriued by tempest of weather, vnto the entring of a riuer called <hi>Tenaserim,</hi> and in this region there be manye Elephants, and there groweth much Brasill. And goyng from thence trauelling many dayes iourney by land, and by sea, he entred at the mouth of the Ryuer <hi>Gangey,</hi> and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led fiftéene dayes vp the riuer, and came vnto a Citie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Cernomen,</hi> very noble and plentiful.</p>
      <p>Thys Riuer <hi>Gangey</hi> is of suche breadth, that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng in the middest, you shall sée no lande on neyther side, and hée affyrmeth that it is in some places fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene myles in breadth. In the armes and braunches of this ryuer there be Canes of suche a maruellous lēgth,
<pb n="140" facs="85"/>
and so bigge, that scarce a manne maye compasse one of them wyth both his armes: and of the hollownesse or pith of them, they do make things to fishe with, and of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wood which is more than a spanne thick, they do make boates to trauell with vpon the riuer, and from knot to knotte of these Canes it hath of hollownesse the length of a man. There be in this riuer certaine beasts, hauing four féete, named <hi>Crocodiles,</hi> which liue in the day time vpon the lād, and in the night in water: and there be many kindes of fishe whiche are not founde among vs, and vppon the braunches of this riuer be manye fayre Gardens, habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and delectable grounde. On eche side there groweth a kinde of fruite muche like vnto a figge, whych is named <hi>Musa,</hi> and it is verye pleasaunte, and more swéete than honnye. Also there is another fruite, whyche we call Nuttes of <hi>India,</hi> and manye other diuerse fruites. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from hence vppe the ryuer thrée moneths, leauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him foure famous Cities, he came to a goodlye fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Citie named <hi>Maarazia,</hi> where there is great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the trées called Alloes, and plentie of golde, and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, Pearles, and precious stones. And going from hence he directed hys waye vnto the mountaines of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for to haue Carbuncles, and trauelling thirtéene dayes, he returned firste to <hi>Cermon</hi> and afterwardes vnto <hi>Buffetanya.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>And after that, sayling a whole moneth by sea, he came vnto the entring of the riuer <hi>Nican,</hi> and sayling vppon it sixe dayes, he came vnto the Citie also named <hi>Nican,</hi> and he went from thence seauentéene dayes iourney throughe deserte mountaynes, and plaine countrey, the fiftéene days of plaine countrey, vntil he came to a riuer greater than the riuer <hi>Gange,</hi> which the people of that countrey cal <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,</hi> and sayling vp this riuer a month, he came vnto a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous great Citie called <hi>Aua,</hi> being 15. miles in compa<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

They haue greate plenty of Elephantes, for their Kyng dothe kéepe tenne thousande of them for the warres▪ and setteth vpon euery Elephantes backe a Castell, whyche maye carrie eyghte or tenne men with Speares and Shields, or Bowes, or Crossebowes. He rehearsed that they toke the Elephantes in this manner, <hi>Plinie</hi> agreeth vnto the like. They let the tame Elephants females goe vnto the mountaynes, vntill suche time as the wilde bee acquainted with them, for the male commonly doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himselfe with one female, and when they haue once acquaintance, the female bringeth the wild, by little and little, grasing, vnto a small yard strongly walled, hauyng two dores, one to come in at, and another to goe out at. The female when she is in at the first gate, she goeth out at the seconde, and the male following hir, the two dores be locked againste him, and then hauing him within, by certayne loupe holes made for the purpose, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in to the number of a thousand men, euery one with his snare in his hande, and one of those men presenteth himselfe before the Elephant, which runneth, thinking to kill the man, and then all those men runne vnto the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, fastning those snares on his féete, and whē they be fastned, with great diligence, they do tye the snares vnto a great post, which is set there for that purpose, and they let him alone so thrée or four dayes, till he be more feeble, and after the space of fiftéene dayes, they giue him a little grasse, in the whiche time he wareth tame, and then they do tye him among other tame Elephants, and carrie him aboute the Citie, and in tenne dayes he becommeth as gentle as one of the others. Also he sayde, they did tame them in this other wise, that they had and dra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="142" facs="86"/>
and these the Kings do buy for their owne vse. Some are fedde with Rice, and Butter, and some with grasse. The wilde Elephantes féede vpon grasse, and vpon the trées of the fields. He that hathe charge of them, rul<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The Elephants haue so much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, that manye with their féete, pull away the Speares from their enimies, for that they shoulde not hurt those that be vpon their backes. The King rideth vpon a white Elephant, which hath a chayne of golde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, being long vnto his féete, set full of many precious stones. The men of this Countrey haue but one wife a péece. Both men and women of this Countrey pricke themselues, making diuers markes, and of diuers couloures, on theyr bodyes. They be all Idolaters, and assoone as they do rise in the morning, they looke into the Orient, holding their hāds togither, and worship. There is in that Countrey a certayne kinde of fruite, like vnto the Orenge, whiche they doe call <hi>Cyeno,</hi> full of iuice and swéetenesse. Also, there is a trée whiche they doe call <hi>Tall,</hi> whereon they do write, for in all <hi>India,</hi> except it bée in the Citie of <hi>Combahita,</hi> they doe vse no paper, and it beareth a fruite like vnto the Turnep, but they are greate and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der like vnto Gelly. It is pleasant in eating, but the ryne is more pleasant. There be in that Countrey daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Serpents, of sixe cubites in length, and as thicke as a man, hauing no féete. The people of that Country haue great delight in eating of those Serpēts rosted. Also they do eate a certayne redde Ante as bigge as a crabbe, estée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it much drest with Pepper. Also, there is a certaine Beast, hauing a head like vnto a Hogge, the tayle lyke vnto an Oxe, and a horne in his forehead, like vnto a V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicorne, but smaller by a cubite. He is couloure and bignesse like vnto the Elephante. He is an enimie to the Elephant. The vtter part of his hornes is good for medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines

They haue a mane and a tayle lyke vnto a Horse, but more hearie, and reacheth vnto their féete. The heares of their tailes be very fine, and like vnto feathers, and they be sold by weight, and therof they do make Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caderos or Table clothes, for the Altares of their Gods, or for to couer the Table of their King, or for to trimme them with gold and siluer, to couer y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> buttocks or breasts of their Horses, for beautyfulnesse, &amp; they estéeme thē for principall ornaments. Also, the Knightes hang of these heares fast by the yron of their Speares, in token among them of singular nobilite.</p>
      <p>Beyond the sayde <hi>Marcino,</hi> there is another Prouince more principall than the others, which is named <hi>Cataya,</hi>

In this Citie he founde Vines though they were few, for all <hi>India</hi> lacketh Vines and Wine, nor they make no wine of the Grapes. This Grape groweth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the trées, and after the Grape is cut, the first thing of all, if they do not sacrifice with it vnto their Gods, it is by and by auoyded out of their sight. Also, there be in this Countrey Pines, Aberrycocks, Chestnuttes, and Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, although they be small and gréene. Héere is whyte Sandales or Saunders, and Camphora, or Camphire.</p>
      <p>There is in <hi>India</hi> farre within, almost at the furthest end of the world, two Ilandes, and both of them are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Laua,</hi> the one is of two miles in length, and the other of thrée, towards the Orient, and they are knowen in the name, for the one is called the greate, and the other the lesse. And turning vnto the Sea, he went vnto them, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing distant from the mayne land a monethes sayling, and the one is a hundred miles distāt from the other. He was in these with his wife and children nine moneths, for in all his pilgrimage he had them euer with him. The dwellers in these Ilands are the most cruell and vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable people in the world. They eate Rattes, Cattes, Dogges, and other viler beastes. They estéeme it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to kill a man, and he that doth any crime, hathe no penaltie, and the debters be giuen to be as slaues vnto the creditors, and some debters will rather dye than serue, and take a Sword, and kill those that are weaker than they, till they find one that is of more strength than themselfe, who killeth them, &amp; then they carrie the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of that murtherer before the Iudge, and cause him to

pay the debtes of the debler. If any of them do buy a new Sword or knife, he proueth it vpon the body of the firste that he méeteth, and there is no penaltie for it. Those that come by looke vpon the wound, and prayse the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of him that did it, if it be a great wound. They take as many wiues as they list. They do vse much the game of Cockfighting, and they that bring them as well as the lokers on, lay wagers whiche Cocke shall ouercome, and winne the game. In <hi>Laua</hi> the great, there is a Fowle like vnto a Doue, which hath no féete, his feathers light, and a long tayle: he resteth alwayes on the trées, hys flesh is not eaten, the skinne and tayle are estéemed, for they do vse to weare them on their heads.</p>
      <p>Sayling fiftéene dayes beyond these two Ilandes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Orient, you come vnto two other Ilands, the one is named <hi>Sanday,</hi> where there is Nutmegges and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maxiga</hi> or Masticke.

The people of these two Ilandes are blacke, by reason of the greate heate. Beyond these Ilands there is a mayne Sea, but the contrary winds will not suffer men to trauell on it.</p>

They do delight muche to sée children, and for to sée them, they come where men be. Their heads when they be layde, séeme like to Celes heads, and when he lifteth vp his head, it séemeth bigger. It hath at the hinder partes a face like to a man and as though it were paynted of diuers couloures. They doe take them by inchantments, which the people vse muche there, and carrie them to be séene, and doe no hurt to anye body. Also, there is in this Prouince, and in the nexte ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning named <hi>Susynaria,</hi> another kind of Serpēts, which hath foure féete, and a long tayle lyke mastyes. They doe take them hunting, and eate them, for they doe no hurte, and are to eate as amongst vs the Hinde or wilde Goate. The people say they are good meate. Their Skinnes be of diuers couloures, and those people vse them for diuers couerings, for it is very fayre to behold. Also, there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Serpentes of a maruellous figure in that Countrey, of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> length of one cubite, with wings like vnto Battes. They haue seauen heads, ordinarily sette of the length of his bodye. They dwell among the trées, and are of a swifte flighte. The yare more venomous than the other, that onely with their breath they kill a man. Also, there be Cattes of the Mountayne, that flye, for they haue a small skinne from the backe vnto the bellie, ouer all theyr body and féete, whyche is gathered vp when they are still: and when they will flye, they spredde it, and moue it lyke wings, leaping from one trée vnto another. The Hunters do follow them, till they be wéerie with flying, that they fall downe, and so are taken. Also, there is in this Countrey a trée named <hi>Cachy,</hi> that of the troncheon

there groweth a fruite lyke vnto a Pyne, but it is so great, that a man can scarce beare it.

It hath within it two hundred and fiftie, or thrée hundred Apples, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Figges. They are of a pleasante tast, and are separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a very thinne rine. The hull within is like vnto the Chestnut in hardnesse and sauoure, and in like maner they are rosted. They are windie, so that if they be putte into the fire, except they be cut, they will start out. They do giue the vtter rine vnto the Oxen to eate. Sometimes they fynde this fruite vnder grounde in the rootes of the trées, and those be of a pleasanter tast, therefore they doe vse to presente them vnto the Kings and Nobles. The fruite within hath no rine. This trée is muche like vnto a great Figge trée: the leaues are like vnto the leaues of <hi>Platanos,</hi> or ragged. The wodde is like vnto Bore, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is hadde in estimation, and is vsed aboute manye things. Also, there is another fruite named <hi>Amba,</hi> verye gréene, like vnto a Walnut, but bigger than a Peache. The rine is bitter, and within, it hath the sauour of hony. They lay them in water before they ripe, and dresse them as we doe the gréene Olyues for to eate.</p>

Also hée didde demaunde a Cocke, and killed it, and drunke vp the bloude, and immediatelye hée demaunded of those of the Shippe, what they woulde haue that hée shoulde doe, and they demaunded that he shoulde gyue them wind, he promised to giue it them within thrée dayes, and suche, that they shoulde come vnto harborowe: and he shewed, setting his handes behinde, from whence the wind should come, and willed them to prepare for the strength that the winde woulde bring: and when he hadde thus saide, the manne fell downe as halfe deade, without anye knowlege or remembraunce of anye thing that he hadde saide, and in fewe dayes after they were sette in harborowe.

These Shippes are made with Chambers, after suche a sorte, that if one of them shoulde breake, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers maye goe and finish the voyage. Throughout al <hi>India</hi> they doe worshippe Idolles, and haue Churches
<pb n="156" facs="93"/>
muche like vnto oures, painted within with diuers pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, whiche they doe decke with floures at their feasts. They haue within Idolles of stone, and gold, of siluer, and of Iuorie, some of .60. foote in height. They haue among themselues diuers manners in worshipping, and sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing. When they enter into the Church, they wash them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in cleane water, and so they go in the morning, and in the afternoone, they go in lying along vpon the ground, lifting vppe their féete and handes, and so praye a whyle, then they doe kisse the grounde, and sense their Idolles with the smoake of swéete woodde. On this side of <hi>Gange</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> vse no belles, but in steade of them, they doe strike vppon a vessell of Copper, and with an other vessel they doe offer victualles vnto their Gods as the Gentiles did, and afterwarde doe imparte it to the poore, that they maye eate it.</p>
      <p>¶ In the Cittie whiche they name <hi>Cambayta</hi> the Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes preache vnto the people in presence of the Idoll their God, declaring howe they shoulde worshippe him, &amp; howe much it pleaseth their Gods, when they do kill themselues for their loue: and there stande in presence many that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to kill themselues for them. They haue a hoope of Iron aboute their neckes, the vtter parte of the hoope is rounde, and within, it is sharpe like vnto a Rasar: also they doe hang vnto the fore parte of the hoope down theyr breaste a chaine, and being sette downe, they fasten theyr féete vnto it, and béeyng thus, as the Prieste sayeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wordes, they stretch forth their legges; and lifte vp their heades, and thus with the sharpenesse of the hoope, cutte off their heades in sacrifice of their Idoll, yéelding vppe their liues. And they that kill themselues in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, are estéemed as Saints. In the Citie of <hi>Bizenegalia</hi> in certaine time of the yeare, they doe carry about the Cittie in procession their Idoll betwéene two cartes, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

Others there be, that for the better adorning of the carts, make holes throgh the sides of their bodies, putting a rope throughe it, and tye themselues vnto the carte, and so hanging dead in the procession, accompany theyr Idoll, thinking that they cannot doe greater worshippe nor sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto their Gods. And they make their solempnity thrée times in a yeare. In one time there gather togither all the menne and women, and people of all ages, washing themselues in the sea, or in a riuer, hauing all newe appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, doyng nothing else in thrée dayes but feaste, daunce, and sing.

In the thirde, they doe sette vppe poales like small mastes through all the stréetes, and from the toppe vnto the grounde, they doe hang very faire clothes, wroughte with golde, belonging vnto their Gods and painted, and on the topped of these poales, al the whole nine dayes that it endureth, they do sette a religious man that hathe a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne and méeke face, who suffereth all that paine for to receiue the grace of his God, and the people throwe vnto him Orrenges, Lemmons, and other like fruites, and he suffereth it all with patience There bée other thrée so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempne dayes, that they doe caste Saffron water vppon those that passe throughe the stréetes, and manye laughe at it.

daunces, and songs. They daunce rounde aboute as wée doe, following one after an other in order, and twoo of them carrying twoo painted wandes in their handes, and as they doe méete, they doe chaunge stickes or wandes. And <hi>Nicholas</hi> rehearseth, that this was a fayre sighte to beholde. They doe vse no Bathes, sauing the <hi>Indians</hi> beyonde <hi>Gange.</hi> The others doe washe themselues manye times of the daye with colde water: they haue scant of oile, and other fruites of ours, as Peaches, Peares, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Damsons, Apples, and of Grapes they haue but fewe, and (as aboue is rehearsed) onely in one place. And in <hi>Puditfetamas,</hi> a prouince, there groweth a certaine trée withoute fruite, it groweth thrée cubites aboue grounde, and they call it shamefulnesse, for when a man commeth vnto it, it incloseth the braunches, and when he goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it spreadeth abroade his braunches.</p>
      <p>¶ <hi>Birengalia</hi> is a Mountaine whiche standeth beyonde towards the Septentrion fiftéene dayes iorney. It is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed with many lakes, named <hi>Birenegalias,</hi> whiche are full of venomous beastes, and the mountaine standeth daungerous to bée entred, by reason of Serpentes. And thereon growe the Adamantes: and for that menne dare not goe vnto it, the pollicie of manne founde a way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to take the Adamantes, for there standeth adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto it an other mountaine, being a little higher, and in certaine times of the yeare menne goe vppe vnto the toppe of it, where they doe kill certaine Oxen that they carrye with them, and the péeces of fleshe being hotte and bloudy, with certaine Crossebowes for the purpose, doe shoote them vppon the toppe of that other mountaine, and with the fall, it cleaueth faste vnto the Adamantes, and then the Bitturs and Eagles that flye in the ayre, snatche vppe that fleshe with their clawes or tallants, and flye vnto other places, where they maye féede vppon it without feare of those Serpentes, and so the men finde

the stones that fall from the fleshe: they doe fynde wyth more ease the pretious stones, for they doe digge in sundrye places, where they vse to finde suche stone, so déepe, til they fynde water mingled wyth grauell, and then they doe take a syne for that purpose, and putte in of the grauell, and the water runneth out, and kéepe the stones that remaine behind, and after this sorte in al these parties they doe vse to finde them: and the Maisters that sette to séeke them, haue greate care that their seruauntes doe not steale of those stones, for they haue those that search all their apparell, yea, and so neare, that they leaue not vnsearched their priuie partes, to knowe if they haue hidden any.

         </gap>he yeare into twelue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths as we doe, and counte the moneths according to the twelue signes of the Elements. They accompte the yeare in diuers manners, and the moste parte doe recken it from August, for that in the time of <hi>Augustus Octauius Caesar</hi> there was an vniuersall peace throughoute all the world, and they recken from that time .1490. yeares. In some regions they haue no money, but vse in steade of money a certayne small stone whiche they name Cattes eye, and in some other places they do vse péeces of Iron like néedles, somewhat bigger. In other places they do vse the Kings name written in paper in steade of money. In some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces of <hi>India</hi> more within the lande, they doe vse <hi>Venice</hi> duckets of golde, and also other mony of two duchettes in one. Also they do vse money of siluer, and of copper, and in other places they doe make certaine péeces of golde, and vse them in steade of money.

There be among the <hi>Indians</hi> diuers languages. They haue gret abundaunce of slaues. The debtor that can not paye, they cause him to serue the creditor, &amp; he that is accused of any crime, there being no certaine witnesse againste him, is quitte by his oth: they vse thrée manner of othes. There commeth the partie before hys Idoll, and sweareth by that Idoll, that he is not faultie, and they haue readye a hotte burnyng Iron like vnto a fishe hooke, and cause hym that swore, to touch it with his tongue, and to licke it, and if it doe him no hurte, he is quitte. And others bring the partie before hys Idoll, and cause hym to take that same burning yron in his hande, and so to carry it certaine pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and if it hurt him not, he is quitte, but if it doe, he is guiltie. The thirde manner of swearing, whiche is moste vsed. is suche: They doe sette before his Idoll, a potte full of hote melted butter, and he that sweareth not to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, dippeth in two of his fingers into the butter, and so wrappeth them with a clowte, and sealeth it, that it shall not vnloose, and at thrée dayes ende they vndoe it, and if there be founde any signe of burning, hée is guiltie, if not, he is quytte. There is no pestilence in the <hi>Indias,</hi> nor yet other of the diseases that vse to trouble oure regions, and for this cause there is more Townes and people than is to be beléeued.

      <p>The things that of the byrde <hi>Phoenix</hi> be declared and written in verses by <hi>Latancio,</hi> séeme not to be fables, for the sayde <hi>Nicholas</hi> doeth say, that at the end of <hi>India,</hi> there is only one byrde named <hi>Seuienda,</hi> whose bil is like vnto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boge, or togither with many hoales, and when the time of his death commeth, he gathereth togither dry woodde into his neste, and sitting vpon it, he singeth so swéetely wyth his bill, that he delighteth and pleaseth muche those that heare him, and then flittering with his wings vppon the wood, there cōmeth fire, and he letteth hymselfe burne, &amp; then there commeth a worme out of his neste, and of hys ashes, and of it bréedeth the birde, vnto the likenesse of that byrdes byl. Those of that country made the Alnogue with the which they play very swéetly. And <hi>Nicholas</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling much of it, they tolde him of what the making of it procéeded. Also there is in the first <hi>India,</hi> in an Iland cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Saylana,</hi> a riuer named <hi>Arotanie,</hi> so full of fishe, that easily they maye take them vp with their handes, but as soone as a manne holdeth one of these fishes in his hande,
<pb n="162" facs="96"/>
there commeth vnto him a Feuar, and letting the fish go, the Feuar is gone from hym, the cause of it appeareth to be the nature of the fish, as among vs there is a fish which we call <hi>Torpedo,</hi> whych fish if a man do hold in his hand, it will be num, and grieue him: although the <hi>Indians</hi> saye, that it commeth by meanes of their Goddes, by a certaine tale that they do tell of it.</p>
      <p>AFter, for an information to the reader, kéeping y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> truth of the Historie, I did write those things rehearsed, as the sayd <hi>Nicholas</hi> gaue report, and then there came ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the high <hi>India,</hi> which standeth towardes Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentrion, or the North, and he came, sente vnto the Pope for to sée the things and manners of these parties, for in those parties they had fame, that in the Occident or west there was another worlde, being Christians. And this mā declared that neare vnto <hi>Cataya</hi> there was a kingdome, which indured twentie dayes iourney, the which king and people were Christians, but of the sect of the Nestorians. He declared that the Patriach of the Nestorians had sent him for to bring him tydings certaine from these parties. He rehearsed that they had bigger, &amp; more richer Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches than ours, being al vaulted, and that their Patriarch was very rich in golde and in siluer, that euery father of family did giue yearelye vnto him an ounce of siluer. I communed with this man, by an interpretet whych could the Turkish tong, and the Latin, and I demaunded of him by meanes of this, the wayes, &amp; townes, houses, customs, manners, and of other things that a man delighteth to heare, there was great difficultie to learne it, for lacke of the interpreter, and also of the <hi>Indian,</hi> but he affirmed the power of the great <hi>Cane,</hi> or Emperoure of al men, to be greate and mighty, for he had vnder him nyne mighty kings.</p>
      <p>
         <pb n="163" facs="96"/>Also he declared that he hadde trauelled many months through the high <hi>Scithia,</hi> is nowe <hi>Tartaria,</hi> and throughe <hi>Persia,</hi> and that finallye he came vnto the riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> from whence he entered into the sea, and sayled vnto <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>le,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Venice,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> He reported to haue séene manye Cities more fai<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>e than ours, both in publike edifications, and of Citizens, for he declared to haue séene many cities ten myles, and of twentie myles in compasse. And after that this man had spokē with <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth Pope of that name, he wēt from <hi>Florence</hi> for to sée <hi>Rome</hi> in deuotion: he demaunded neyther siluer nor gold, séeming, that he came not for gain, but only to fulfil the message of hym that sent him.</p>
      <p>IN the same time there came vnto the Pope certaine men from <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> in deuotion of the faith, with whō I had communication, by an interpreter, to knowe if they knew any thing of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> riuer of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and of his springing. Two of them gaue answere, that they were of a countrey being very neare vnt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> two welsprings, from whence the riuer <hi>Nilus</hi> procéedeth: when I hearde this, I coueted to knowe the things that of this matter the olde auntiente Phylosophers, namely <hi>Ptolomes,</hi> did write: firste of the fountaines of <hi>Nilus.</hi> It appeareth not that they knewe it, but only by coniecture, to appeare that they drew out some things of the Originall increase of the sayde riuer. And as these witnesses of sighte, did tell me of these and of others worthy to remayne in memorie, it séemed vnto me verye good to write them.</p>
      <p>They declared that the Riuer <hi>Nilus</hi> hadde his heade and Welspryng neare vnto the Region Equinoctiall at the foote of verye hyghe mountaynes, whyche are alwayes couered on the toppe with Mistes, from thrée welsprings, two of them standing 40. paces the one from
<pb n="164" facs="97"/>
the other, and in 500. paces they méete, and make the riuer so great, that no man may passe ouer but with boate. The thirde which is the biggest, standeth a thousand paces frō the other two, and he commeth into the riuer of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ten myles off. Also they sayde that more than 1000. riuers did enter into <hi>Nilus,</hi> and it increaseth so muche in those countryes, with the raine of March, April, and May, that it maketh <hi>Nilus</hi> to swell ouer so muche, that it made wonderfull great floudes. Also they declared that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Nilus</hi> was verye swéete and sauerie, before he ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth among the other Riuers, and it hath vertue to heale those that haue the leaprie and scabs, if they washe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in it. And beyonde the headsprings of <hi>Nilus</hi> fiftéene dayes iourney, there be verye fruitefull countries, ful of people, and well tilled, hauing very notable Cities, and also sayde that beyonde that countrey there was the sea, but they had not séene it, and that neare vnto the spring of <hi>Nilus</hi> there was a Citie, wherein they were borne, and it was fiue and twentie myles in compasse, full of people, and in the night had 1000. watches for to defende the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from daunger and alterations that might rise. This region is temperate, and delectable, and plentifull of alll thyngs, in so much as 3. times in the yere there springeth new grasse, and twice in the yeare it beareth corne. It hath abundaunce of broade and wine, although the most parte of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> vse (in steade of wine) barley sodden in water. They haue figges, Peaches, Orenges, and Cucumbers like vnto our Lemmons, Sytrons, and sauing Almonds. They haue al our kinde of fruites▪ Also they named diuers trées that they had, whiche we neuer sawe nor hearde of in our parties, and they are difficult to write, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>or that the interpreter could not altogither vnderstande the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue. But of one of those trées, I muste néedes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse, whiche is as thicke as a man maye compasse, and as highe as a man. It hath many rynes one
<pb n="165" facs="97"/>
within another, and betwéene those rines hath his fruite like vnto the Chestnut, and being ground, it becommeth meale, and of it they do make pleasant white bread, which they do vse in their bākets. The leafe of this trée is more than a cubit in breadth, and more than two cubits in length. They sayd also, that towardes the Ilande <hi>Meroe,</hi> the <hi>Nilus</hi> coulde not be sayled, by reason of the number of Rockes that were there, and that from <hi>Meroe</hi> vnto <hi>Egipt,</hi> it was naui<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>able, but they tarrie sixe moneths in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation, for that the riuer giueth manye turnes. Those that dwell in that Countrey, haue the face of the Sunne towardes the North, as we haue it towardes the South, and in March they haue it right ouer their heads. All <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia</hi> hath one manner of letters, although they haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers languages, according vnto the greatnesse of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces. Some of them that dwell in the regions towards the Sea coast, and in the hart of the <hi>India,</hi> there was very much Ginger, Cloues, Nutmegs, and Suger. Betwéene <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and <hi>Egipt</hi> there be desertes of .50. dayes iourney, and they trauell so farre, hauing with them prouision of meate and drinke vpon Cammels. It hath dangerous passages in many places, by reason of the wilde men that go naked in those deserts, like wild beastes riding vppon Cammels, whose flesh and milke they do eate. They doe robbe the Cammels and prouision that the trauellers ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, so that many dye for hunger, and for this cause there passe fewe that way vnto vs. The <hi>Ethiopians</hi> most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are of longer life than we, for many liue vntil .120. yeares, and .150. yeares, and in some places they liue tyll 200. yeares. It is a Countrey much inhabited, and neuer hath the plage, nor other infirmities, so with this, &amp; with their long liues, their multitude is much encreased. They haue diuers customes, according to the diuersitie of the Countrey. They haue no wooll, but weare linnen and silk both men and women. And in some places, the women

weare long traines, and a girdle of a spanne breade, trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with gold and precious stones. Some of them weare vpon their heads a Lawne, weaued with gold: and some weare their heare loose: and some wound vp in a lace han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging downe at their backes. They haue more plentye of gold and precious stones than we. The men vse to weare rings, and the women braselets wrought of gold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones. From Christmas vnto Lent they feast eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day, eating and daunsing. They do vse little Tables, so that two or thrée may sitte at one of them, and do couer them with table clothes as we do. They haue but one King, whiche is entituled King of Kings, after or vnder God, and they saye, he hath many Kings vnder him, and that they haue diuers kinds of beastes. The Oxen are crooke backed, like vnto Camels, with hornes of thrée cubites in length bending vpon their backes, so that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon one of their hornes they do carrie a Rundlet of wine. Their dogges are of the bignesse of our Asses, and there is some of them that may do more than a Lion, and hunt with them. They haue very great Elephants, and bring vp some of them for their pleasure &amp; for hostilitie, &amp; some for the warres. They bring them vp of yong ones, &amp; tame them, and then kill the old. Their téeth are of sixe cubites in length. Also, they do tame and bring vp Lions, and to shew them for a magnificēce and ostentation. Also, there is a kind of beastes of diuers couloures like vnto the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, but they haue not suche a tronke and snoute, they do call him Belus. They haue féete like vnto a Camell, and two very sharp hornes, each of a cubit in length, the one standeth in his forehead, and the other vpon his nose. Also, there is another beast somewhat lōger thā a Hare, but in all proportions like, whiche they name <hi>Zebet,</hi> and hath such a strong smell, that if at any time he rubbe himselfe againste any small trée, he leaueth behinde hym such a swéete sauour, that those that trauell and smell it, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

         </gap> Also they reported, that there is another kinde of Beast, of nine cubits in length, and sixe foote in height, hauyng clouen féete like vnto an Oxe. Their body is a cubit in compasse, and much like in haire vnto the Libard, headed like vnto a Camell, and hathe a necke of four cubites in length. His tayle is very thicke, and muche estéemed, for the women do worke with it, emb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>odering it with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stones, hanging them at their armes. They haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother wild beast, which they do take hunting, and he is to be eaten. He is as bigge as an Asse, striped with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loures redde and gréene, and hathe wreathed hornes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, of thrée cubites in length. Also, there is another much like vnto a Hare, with little hornes, and of coulour redde, whiche giueth a greate leape. There is another muche like vnto a Goate, with his hornes vpon his but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tockes more than two cubites pending, and for that the smoke of them healeth Feauers, they are solde for more than fortie Duckets a péece. There is another much like vnto this Beast, sauing that he hathe no hornes. His hayre is redde, hauing a necke of two cubites in length. There is another bodyed lyke vnto a Camell, and of the couloure of a Lybarde, hauing a necke of fire cubites in length. They sayd he had a head like vnto a Déere. Also they sayd they had a bird of the heigth from the ground of sixe cubites, small legges, féete like a Goose, the necke and visage like vnto a Henne. This bird flyeth little, but runneth faster than a Horse.</p>
      <p>Many other things they told me, whiche I leaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, for that I finde my selfe wéerie. And they sayd, that there were Serpents in the Desertes without féete, of fiftie cubits in length, hauing a Scorpions tayle, and swallow a whole Cau<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And in these things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most they did all agrée, and it séemed vnto me that they made no lie, séeing they had no cause why for to lye, and I thought good to write it, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> profit of those y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
