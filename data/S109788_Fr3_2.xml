      </gap>ce, which we next before &amp; immediatly in their order shewed off, what was their best and soueraigne goodnesse. For this is the close and wise working of Dame Nature, that the further and in degree the more high, she la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth in hirs to haue them reach to the chiefest perfection in whome are all things absolute, full and without any point of lacke or imperfection, she giueth to eche of them in thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> kinde a seuerall gift. And whereas all of them can not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, neyther is there in them equall condition, yet for the best she prouideth for them in that that may be: alwayes foreseing to auoyde impossibilitie. I mought here therefore set these two last Daughters, the plant and eke the brute Beast, the one from the other by this note and difference (for many men haue children alike, and yet they are knowne and haue their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence by one marke or other) First and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>most in mouing from place to place, with an appetite to repast themselues: and this is the chiefest, vsed and sought forth of Philosophers: the next in feeling and sense, perceiuing griefe and paine, good and euill. And herein and in these, they chiefely dissent. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the Plant is only portioned with the life vegetatiue, and therein in euery eche power fully &amp; aboundantly. This other last steppeth vp a Stayer higher, layth holde and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth another kinde of life in degree more Princely, and in force or large power most manifolde: for with this, it hath might to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ue, to haue lust or appetite: to haue and hunt after what it will, and to wander and straye therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will, neyther ought that to be reckned ought which A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxagoras and Empedocles, men partiall in this poynt reasoned: Whereas they spake of that other the Plant his prayse.

of Aristotle by sundrie and sufficient reasons whereof we entend not to speake: onely se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>his one reason chosen forth of the rest, that Aristotle vseth. If they haue sense and appetite, they muste needes haue feeling: if they haue feeling, they must needes haue organe, &amp; parts instrumentall for the maner of feeling. But in the Plant there is none such perceyued: Therefore with so little a tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>p they are cleane cast downe. Further some of them ad (but that which may be the more borne withal) that many of the kindes of Plants haue both Male and Female, As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>mpedocles and his like: of whome I demaund whether y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they haue coniunction yea or no? or whether they haue th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>als sayth Aristotle is that which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>y coniunc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>emale that which likewise doth euen so with another. But in this last they may be the more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uffered, for that Aristotle himselfe in the conclusion and winding vp of his former booke De Plantis, doth as it were distinguish those of the same kindes, although they haue a nighe resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and are taken of some for all one. And thus sayth he, you shall know the Male from the Female. The Male is of more spisse or tough braunches: of leafe and boughe, more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundaunt: of lesse humor or m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ysture than the Female: yet more forwarde in ripening. And hath his leafe and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ippes also di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>fering. The Female hath all these, but nothing like in nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ber, affection and qualitie. But we minde not thus to giue back or to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> speaking of liuing Creatures, my meaning is of brute Beastes, the worde restrayned and cut a little short.) First to go to their place where they accustome to liue, differ thus. For one part of them liueth vpon the earth, another in the Sea &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>rs, the thirde part in both▪ doubtfully: so that one while they keepe in the brode ayre: anotherwhile in the water, and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rth as the Crocodile. Those of the earth some of them haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> to go with: some creepe: some swim: some flie. The next diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>nce is noted and perceyued in their maner and kinde of liuing, as Aristotle witnesseth; in his bookes De animali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
<pb n="68" facs="77"/>
very often. Some sayth he, be as it were milde, hurtfull to no bodie, as the Bullock, the Goa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e, the poore and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ielye Sheepe: other of such fiercenesse, and so wilde that they can not be tamed, as the Tyger, the wilde Boare, and other of haughtie stomacke as the Lyon: othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> some of increadible might or strength, as is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>he Elephant, the Cammell, and such like: other after a sort subtile and why, working man much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and displeasure, as the craftie Fox, the deuouring Wolfe and so forth. Plinie as concerning this matter hath this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ion. All Beastes sayth he, or Creatures liuing, hath this difference: some be full of bloud, whereby they be long liued, as the Hart, the Hinde, the Roe, other are without bloud: but in stead thereof haue their naturall humor: as the Bee, the Waspe, the Betle, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lie. All which are of wrethed &amp; par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed bodie. Againe he sayth, some difference is in them for their foode: for that the most part to accoumpt of, of all maner Beastes, liue by flesh, and be called in Greeke Cinophagai: other are indifferent for that matter, and eate that, as other things, when they may come by it: as the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>gge, the fleeing Eagle, and the like. Some againe, which will none of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>: as for the most part all Foules of the Ayre, and Fishes of the Sea. Further, some be of good memorie, or retaine for a time in their head a good turne done to them or an euill as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Dog, the Lion, the Cammell: Other as forgetfull of such kinde of deseruing, and vnmindefull as the Ostrich, the Doue. And there is in some a certaine kinde of perceiueraunce and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudging or esteeming what is what (but the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>me spoken of vs by resemblance and vnproperly) which we may perceiue they haue through their care in bringing vp &amp; tendring their yong: as also in artificiall maner of building their Nest, in hunting and seeking after their pray, in remedying and curing woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: in espying what shall hurt them: And further in s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>me through foreknowledge and skill to prognosticate what shall afterwards happen by storme &amp; tempest: as is the Swallow by his departure, when colde and Winter begin to come in. As is the wilde Crane, which also sheweth vs through hir flight from place to place, wheras exceeding Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sts shall be: And there is not this onely in the Crane, laudable or prayse worthy, but that which requireth farre greater praise and long time to admiration. Aristotle sayth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hat he hath marked this that when the Cranes by companie, flie ouer the broad Sea (which is large, wide, and infinite) to continue in that their passage the better without rescue, and to endure to the ende, they vse this knack or practise. Their cōpanie then is brought
<pb facs="78"/>
into fiues, and so they flie two a breast, and the fift or odde Crane in maner of a persiue sterne, to make the other way in the Ayre, flieth all alone before, till he be wearie so doing: when he is wearie, another goeth and taketh vpon him his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and painetaking, and that other commeth to their place which be of breast, and in like sort doe all the other by course, till their iourney be at an end: and so their flight is like a Triangle, sharpe at the ende, and broade about, and easied therewithall by one another his helping. Againe (to leaue their entrailes and inward parts so to come by deuision) they are sayde to differ in outwarde attire and kinde of aray: for some haue haire for their vppe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Garment: some haue onely their bare skin: other haue feathers: other haue hide: other haue their skin full of prickles and briestles: and (to speake of their maner of defending themselues) som haue sting, some haue tuskes, some haue hornes: othersome helpe themselues by flyght and lightnesse of wings: and as for their voice, some haue soft voice: some as loud and shrill. The Cow saith Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle, is in voyce more loud than the mightie Bull. I coulde gather also differences in shewing how euerie part is placed both within and without, not all alike: moreouer, of their vse and purpose, of their affection also, of their settes and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in life: but I had rather (as they say lose the Hare) then to take such infinite paines as to hunt so farre for hir. I will therefore now make h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>yles going, in taking such paynes, would wearie vs: It is counted wisedome not to take to much vpon a man, neither more than he can well suffer.
