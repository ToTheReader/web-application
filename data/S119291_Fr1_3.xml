<pb facs="9"/>to cast away, (and the more if you haue a charge of Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for whom in nature you are obliged to prouide) but chiefly in your soules health, which aboue all temporall things in this World you are bound to preferre. <hi>For what doth it profit a man, if hee gaine the whole World, and sustaine the damage of his soule?</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.</note> Now if this <hi>new Oath</hi> bee truely an <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>temporall Allegiance, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by lawfull authoritie,</hi> (as this <hi>Treatise</hi> doth conuince it to bee) doubtlesse you incurre the danger of eternall damnation if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it, by disobeying and resisting the iust commandement of lawfull authoritie, and the Ordinance of Almightie God, from whom all power and authoritie doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. <hi>For he that resisteth power</hi>

   <p n="2">2. <hi>First</hi> therefore, it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you that are
<hi>Lay-men,</hi> to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine diligently this matter, and not to be led hoodwinkd into the pit both of spirituall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall miserie, especially by blinde and ignorant guides, who neither vnderstand, nor are desirous to know the true grounds of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Controuersie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can hardly bee drawne for the informing of your consciences to descend with you in particular to the examination of the lawfulnes, or vnlawfulnesse of euery Branch of this <hi>Oath,</hi> which many of them, (I speak with griefe, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Booke) haue not so much as euer read, but to cloake their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance vnder colour of Zeale and Deuotion, without any further examining, they only cry out to you in general termes, The
<hi>Church,</hi>
      <pb facs="10"/>the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Rocke</hi> is that, which good Catholikes ought to cleaue vnto; not knowing themselues, what authoritie is spirituall and due to the <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> and what authoritie is temporall and due to temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> and that the
<hi>Pope</hi> is not the <hi>Church,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the chiefe member thereof; and that the <hi>Popes</hi> opinion, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently his <hi>Declaratiue Breues,</hi> when they are grounded either vpon false suppositions, or else on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon his opinion, are not the <hi>Rocke,</hi> whereon Catholikes ought to build their eternall saluation; and <hi>lastly,</hi> not considering, that many times when <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> haue beene and shall bee in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, the <hi>Popes</hi> both haue bin, may lawfully bee, and also ought to bee resisted.

<hi>Kings</hi> were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by those <hi>Bishops,</hi> the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites in such an occasion would doe that which good Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and good
<hi>French-men</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the said King <hi>Philip,</hi> and
<hi>Lewis</hi> did in those times,
<pb facs="11"/>who defended their rights against those Popes,
<hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Iulius,</hi> without any irreuerence to the <hi>Sea Apostolike.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I beseech you, <hi>(Deare Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men)</hi> to take heed vpon what guides you relye for the directing of your soules in these important affaires, and remember that
<hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi> of our <hi>Sauiour,</hi>

      <hi>Blinde they are, and guides of the blinde. And if the blinde be guide to the blinde, both fall into the ditch.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="3">3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> you that are <hi>Priests,</hi> and haue taken vpon you to guide others in the way to saluation, and ought <hi>to be alwayes readie to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie euery one that asketh you a reason of that</hi> faith <hi>which is in you,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi>
3</note> if you thinke in your consciences the <hi>Oath</hi> to bee
<hi>lawfull, and ministred by good and full authoritie,</hi> you ought to take great heede, that your soules bee not defiled, nor
<pb facs="11"/>your consciences stayned with some worldly respect, and that neither hope of gaine or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor feare of want or disgrace keepe you backe from giuing war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to those, whom you are boūd to guide, direct, and instruct, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the danger, which they are like to fall into by resisting the Ordinance of God, if they refuse the
<hi>Oath,</hi> when it is tendred them by <hi>lawfull authoritie;</hi> lest that you foreseeing their danger, and not crying out to them to take heede, be not only partakers of their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall harme, but doe also coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to their temporall ruine, and so haue cause to rue your silence, and to cry out your selues when it is too late, <hi>Vae mihi quia tacui, Woe is mee because I haue held my peace.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Isa.</hi>
6.</note> But if perchance any of you, who in your consciences thinke the
<pb facs="12"/>
      <hi>Oath</hi> to be lawfull, <hi>should</hi> for some worldly respect, (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) cry out against the takers or approouers thereof, this were not only to sin most damnably against your owne consciences, but also in some sort against the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and to impugne that, which in your soules and consciences you thinke, and acknowledge to bee true, which how hardly it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen
<hi>either in this World, or the next,</hi>
      <note place="margin">

12.</note> our <hi>Sauiour</hi> himselfe doth expresly witnesse.</p>
   <p n="4">4. <hi>Lastly,</hi> those <hi>Priests</hi> that in their consciences thinke the <hi>Oath</hi> to be <hi>vnlawfull,</hi> and thereupon do not only giue warning to those, whom they haue taken vpon them to guide and direct, to take heede, and beware of the spirituall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which they thinke will arise by taking the same, but also in
<pb facs="12"/>their zeale do cry out against their Catholike Brethren, who either doe take the <hi>Oath,</hi> or thinke it to be lawfull, as
<hi>Apostates</hi> from the <hi>Catholike</hi> Faith and Religion, and disobedient children to the Pope and <hi>Church,</hi> (giuing the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to others to cry out against them, as <hi>Apostates</hi> from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Allegiance, and disobedient &amp; disloyall Subiects to their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Prince) it behoueth them most of all to looke to themselues, and, (according to the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which <hi>Card.

<pb facs="13"/>selues seeme pure, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to knowledge) bee not blind, and grounded vpon wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or culpable ignorance, like that, which the <hi>Iewes</hi> had in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying our <hi>Sauiour,</hi> and Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> (when he was <hi>Saul</hi>) in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting his Disciples, who thought thereby to doe <hi>God</hi> great seruice.</p>
   <p n="5">5. And truly if their <hi>Zeale</hi> were hurtfull to none but to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, they would doubtlesse be the more excusable; but conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how preiudiciall it is both to his <hi>Maiesties</hi> honour, and also to his temporall <hi>Soueraigntie,</hi> how scandalous it is to
<hi>Catholicke</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and how iniurious it is to their
<hi>Catholike</hi> brethren, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to themselues in vertue and learning (whom they seeke to disgrace, and to make odious to all
<pb facs="13"/>
      <hi>Catholickes,</hi> epecially to their benefactors and friends, and so by taking from them their good names and maintenance, to bring them into extreame want and miserie, and, as much as in them lyeth, into manifest desperation (for which they are one day to render a most strict account) they haue great cause to examine their consciences narrowly, and carefully to consider, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what assured grounds they can excuse themselues at the dreadfull day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for taking such scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, iniurious, and vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table courses, both against their
<hi>Soueraigne Prince,</hi> (whom next vnder God they are bound to honour and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey in temporals) and also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="14"/>their <hi>Catholicke</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who not onely are as learned and religious as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but also haue exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this important controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and all the danger both spirituall and temporall that dependeth thereon, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, if not farre more, then they themselues haue done.</p>
   <p n="6">6. To the end therefore that all of you, (my <hi>deare Countrimen</hi>) may examine your consciences in this poynt of the
<hi>Oath,</hi> more easily and eactly, and be more fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed therein, then you haue beene by <hi>I. E.</hi> the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi> of the

<pb facs="14"/>what goodly <hi>Instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions</hi> he hath giuen you) I haue out of <hi>Roger Widdringtons</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse doctrine and grounds col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this little <hi>Treatise,</hi> which for that it was finished this first day of the yeare, I am bould to present it to your Charities for a <hi>New-yeares-gift,</hi> as a small token of the great desire I haue both of your spirituall and temporall welfare. And my onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest is, that you will bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to read it, as I hope you will, it beeing neither so prolixe, but that in some few houres you may mane it ouer, nor so obscure, but that any man of meane ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie may vnderstand it, and after you haue read it, to iudge thereof accordingly. And if I shall heare, that you haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb facs="15"/>any benefit thereby, I shall thinke my paines exceeding well bestowed; but howsoeuer, I shall not thinke my labour lost by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing you this euident token of my loue: for that the loue and dutie I owe to my <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Countrie,</hi> to the
<hi>Catholicke</hi> Religion, and to you my deare <hi>Catholick</hi> brethren, and aboue all to <hi>God</hi> Almightie, the <hi>Author</hi> of all
