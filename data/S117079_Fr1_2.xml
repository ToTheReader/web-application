And for my part, this I dare assure thee, it agreeth in all poyntes, with the <hi>High Dutch Coppie,</hi> whence it was translated: first printed at VIENA in <hi>Austria,</hi> which for my better satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I caused to bee brought vnto mee, and diligently conferd them togither, before resolued Opinion, being no lesse scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous then any to giue furtherance to any matter, eyther of false or friuolous import, a thing neyther suting the state of these tymes, not sorting mine owne condition. Now for my opinion herein; The playnesse of the Style wherein it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

Vaine flourishes (such as nimble wits, might very easily haue inuested such a Subiect withall) is to me no small argument of the verity thereof: The prodigjes themselus also, iust as wel in matter as manner sorting the nature and disposition or these tymes, both touching their generation and forme, and apt representation of the Euents by them presignified.</p>

tast of contrarietie, that wee thinke they will neuer haue end, neyther fearing chaung, nor crediting any thing that may giue occasion of such doubt: not much vnlike the <hi>Isralites,</hi> (God in mercy a little differing the'xecution of his iudgmēts denounced by the Prophets <hi>Ieremy</hi> &amp; <hi>Ezekiel</hi>) growing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so constant conceipt of setled securitie, that they neyther credited vision, nor feared the event thereof: holding for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, that neyther was such visions of any effect, nor any such thing shoulde happen vnto them, or like those in the <hi>Apostles</hi> time, who because they saw neyther chaung, nor likelyhood of chaung of times, before or after them, could hardly entertaine the credit of such things as was spoken tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the misteries of mans redemption. But this is to abuse times bountie, &amp; the long suffering of the great God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
