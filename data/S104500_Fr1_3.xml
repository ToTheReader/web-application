   <p>SEing the scripture speaketh euidently of the generall defection

liuely described in the booke of the <hi>Reuelation:</hi> Of Antichristes begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">Reuel. 8.</note>
increace, exaltation, abolishing. How a great part of the trees &amp;
all greene grasse should be blasted, a great parte of the sea become
blood, and of the creatures that lyued therin dye, and a greate parte of
the shippes therof be destroied; the third parte of the riuers &amp; of the
fountaines of waters be torned into worm wood, and manie men die of
the bitternes therof.<note place="margin">Reuel. 9.</note> How that fallē apostatat Starre should open the

crowned armed Locustes that came out of the smoke of the pitte: and
of those innumerable warriours vpō those strange horses that destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such multitudes of men. How the Beast should get vnto him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
heades &amp; mo hornes,<note place="margin">Reuel. 13.</note> and vpō his hornes Crownes: how he should
be inthronised, receiue the Dragō his large power &amp; high Cōmission:
how he should warre with the Sainctes, and open his mouth into blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie
against God: how he should erect his Image, and gyue his
marke: how he should kill as manie as will not worship his image, and
suffer none to buye or sell, but such as receiue his marcke. How that
greate harlot that sate vpō manie waters, so gorgiously araied &amp; ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the mother of all the whoredomes &amp; abhominatiōs of the earth,
with that goulden cuppe full of abhominations &amp; filthines of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
in her hand,<note place="margin">Reuel. 17.</note> wherwith she made dronckē all the inhabitantes
of the earth, should sit vpon the Beast, and be made dronckē with the

Beast, vpon the greate riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and into the aire with the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar &amp; fearfull plagues denounsed &amp; to be executed herevpon. As also
how the greate <hi>Babilon</hi> should be discouered,<note place="margin">Reuel. 18.</note> forsaken, pleaded against,
condempned, consumed, fire cast vpon her &amp; all her wares, the greate
milstone vpon her &amp; al her childrē &amp; inhabitantes to presse her downe

vpon the white horse of his word, should warre against the Beast, and
<pb facs="6"/>
against the Kinges &amp; nations that were gathered togither by the false
Prophet into battell against <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; his armie, how he should smite the
heathē with the sharpe sword that issueth out of his mouth, rule them
with a rod of yron, and tread thē in the wine-presse of his fierce wrath:
how he should giue the flesh of all this people with their Kinges, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitanes
and mightie men as a praye to the fowles the vncleane spirites:
and how he should take the Beast, and with him the false Prophet that
wrought signes before him, wherein he deceiued them that receiued
the Beastes marck and worshipped his Image, and cast these both aliue
into that lake of fire burning in brimstone. Who now (if not such to

generall falling away from the gospel, this generall departure of the
true established Churches out of the inhabited, this vniuersall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; confusion of all estates, degrees, persons, callings, actions, both
in the Church &amp; commune welth, in this estate, in this defection, seeke
for or pleade for a true visible established Church, the true ministerie
of the gospel, true worship, ministration, sacraments, gouernment, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
Or who (that were not droncke and had all their senses bound &amp;
intoxicate with the whores cuppe) could affirme this cōfuse <hi>Babel,</hi> these
cages of vncleane birdes,<note place="margin">Reuel. 18.</note> these prisons of foule &amp; hatefull spirits, to be
the Spouse of <hi>Christ,</hi> the cōgregatiōs of the Sainctes, the true established
and rightly ordered Churches of <hi>Christ?</hi> Is it likely that these men haue
as yet read the whores misterie written in her forehead, or as yet know
what belongeth to the true established Church, worship, administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
sacraments, ordinances, gouernment of <hi>Christ?</hi> though they haue
in his Testament which is dayly read amongest them, an exact &amp; abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
parterne of al these things before their eies: And haue not in their
Churches anie one thing in their practise and proceedings, not one
pinne, naile, or hooke according to the true patterne: Yea, though they
heare the trompets of the Lord blowen against them, though they see
the viallz of the Lords wrath powred vpon them, and all their doings,
yet stop they their eares &amp; wincke with their eies, lest they should see
with their eies, and heare with theire eares and vnderstand with their
heartes, and be conuerted &amp; healed: And therfore are so farr from fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
place to repentance,<note place="margin">Reuel. 16. 2.</note> that they opē their mouthes into blasphemie
and railings; especially these men that haue the marcke of the Beaste,
vpon whome that euill &amp; malignant sore is fallen, as you dayly see and
heare in their bookes &amp; pulpets. And how well these gouernours, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners,
merchantmen, and all that trafique on this sea can endure the
borning of these their pleasant gainefull wares, how they waile, howle,
and crye out when this heauenly fire is cast out into their shippes: Let
the behauiour of these Bishopps their hierarchie and Priestes towards
the seruants of God, that speak against their Antichristiā proceadings,
shew, and how they bestir them to quench the burning of the harlot,
smiting &amp; rending <hi>Christs</hi> poore witnesses with tongue, tooth, and naile,
casting out of their mouthes a flood of raylings,<note place="margin">Reuel. 12. 15</note> reproches, sclanders,
<pb facs="6"/>
criminations against thē of poysoned bitters waters, corrupt doctrines,
blasphemous opinions, vnsufferable peruerting &amp; abusing the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to hide tollerat or defend the antichristian forgeries, abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
disorder &amp; enormities of their Church &amp; ministrie, that are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
&amp; condempned by the word of God in the mouthes of vs his
simple witnesses.</p>
   <p>Of this sort (amongst manie other such like) are two bookes noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
infamous, lately published by one <hi>George, Giffard,</hi> a Priest of their
orders, against certeine christians, whome he calleth <hi>Brownists, Donatiste.</hi>
In the one of these Bookes he laboureth to defend &amp; cleare the parish
assemblies of the Church of England, of such heinous crimes as the
said christians obiect against them, and forsake them for, witnessing &amp;
suffring in bandes &amp; persecution against the same vnder the handes
of those popish Prelats &amp; Romish Priestes. In the other Booke he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoreth
to recouer the blame he iustly suffred in the first for reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
sclandering, blaspheming, accusing these faithfull and innocent
christians, applijng himself to proue them <hi>Donatists</hi> by comparing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
them from poinct to poinct. Both which Bookes are here an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
and now at length published to the pervsing &amp; iudgment of al
men. Where they shal see how well he hath delyuered and acquitted
their Church, in the first: As also how iustly he hath proued his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
accusations, and blasphemies in the first &amp; second.</p>
   <p>The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ower principall transgressions wherwith we charge, and for
which we forsake these parish assemblies: Namely, the prophanenes,
wickednes, confusion of the people which are here receiued, reteined
&amp; nourished as members. The vnlawfullnes of their whole ministrie
which is imposed vpon them, reteined &amp; mainteined by them. The
superstition &amp; idolatrie of their publique worship in that deuised Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourgie
which is imposed vpon them. And the forgerie of their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
ecclesiasticall gouernment, to which al their Churches stand
subiect, are such and so apparant, as not only proue these parish assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
not to be true established Churches of <hi>Christ:</hi> But if it were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
(which can neuer be proued) that they somtimes had bene true
established Churches; yet these transgressions obstinatly stood in and
defended, are sufficient causes of our seperation from them in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
estate. For where such prophane cōfuse multit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>des without
anie exception, seperatiō, or choice, were all of them immediatly from
publique idolatrie at one instant receiued, or rather compelled to be
members of this Church in some Parish or other, where they inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
without anie due calling to the faith by the preaching of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
going before, or orderly ioyning togither in the faith, there being
no voluntarie or perticular confession of their owne faith and duties
made or required of anie; and last of all, no holy walking in the faith
found amongst them. Who can say that these Churches, consisting of
this people, were euer rightly gathered or built according to the rules
of <hi>Christs</hi> Testament? Or who can say that this people in this estate are
<pb facs="7"/>
the communion of Sainctes? Or who (without sacrilege) in this estate
can administer the holy things of God vnto, or in the same communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with this people? Likewise, where these parishes haue a false &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
ministerie imposed vpō them, who can say that they are the
true established Churches of <hi>Christ?</hi> to the building &amp; ministerie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Christ</hi> hath ordeined, instituted, and prescribed a certaine ministrie
vnto the worldes end: Or who (without sacrilege) may ioyne vnto, or
communicate with a false &amp; antichristian ministrie? <hi>Christ</hi> also hath gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto his Church perpetuall and alsufficient rules in his holy word
for the whole administratiō &amp; gouernmēt of his established churches,
to which they are bound, wherby they ought to buyld, proceede and
walke. Those Churches then that receiue an other Leitourgie, an
other foundation, other rules for their administration &amp; gouernment,
cannot be said the right and true established Churches of <hi>Christ.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may anie faithfull man ioyne vnto them in this administration &amp;
gouernment, without heynous impietie and denying the faith. The
more perticular proofe aswell of these Arguments as of these trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
insue hereafter in this treatise. These reasons all men may
see proue directly these Parish assemblies not to be the true established
Churches of <hi>Christ</hi> to which anie faithfull christian may ioyne himself
in this estate; especially, when all reformation vnto the rules of <hi>Christs</hi>
Testament is not only denied, but resisted, blasphemed, persecuted.</p>
   <p>How then are <hi>M. Giffardes</hi> eies bound and couered with the spirit of
slumber, that still dreameth of a true Church, ministrie, sacraments,
worship, gouernment in this estate; and will not be wakened by these
reasons, or anie thing that can be said or aledged against their vngodly
doings; though he can neither approue these his strong cōceiued ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
by the rules of Gods word, nor disproue these euident char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in the fower principall transgressiōs by vs aledged against their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
assemblies. Which yet he indeuoreth to put away &amp; shift off by
shameles sclanders &amp; opē vntruthes; gyuing out: That we condempne
a Church, for that wicked men come with the godly to the publique
exercises of religion: For that there are some vngodly men of the
church: For that there are some wantes in the calling of the Ministers,
and in the outward discipline: As also, some imperfections or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the worship, which are not fundamentall. The vntruth wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
our verie Propositions (though we should no furder answere) shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to his face: Where we charge, and the word of God condempneth
their assemblies, for that they consist of prophane multitudes neuer
orderly gathered vnto, or walking in the faith. There shall whilest the
Church consisteth of mortall men alwayes be wicked in the Church.
But <hi>Christ</hi> hath his fanne in his hand to make cleane his barne flore:
And hath gyuen power &amp; commandement to his Church to cast out
the wicked from amongest them. We acknowledge that the Prince
ought to compell al her subiects to the hearing Gods word in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
exercises of the Church: yet cannot the Prince compell anie to
<pb facs="7"/>
be a member of the Church, or the Church to receiue anie without
assurance by the publique profession of their owne faith, or to retaine
anie longer, then they continue &amp; walke orderly in the faith. Againe,
we condempne not their assemblies for some faltes in the calling of the
ministrie; but for hauing &amp; reteining a false &amp; antichristian ministrie
imposed vpon them: Such we here proue their whole ministrie to be
in <hi>Office, Entrance, &amp; Administration.</hi> In like maner, we forsake not their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
for some faltes in their gouernment or <hi>Discipline;</hi> but for stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
subiect to a popish and antichristian gouernment. And such we
here proue theirs to be in the officers, Courtes, proceadings. Neither
refreigne we their worship for some light imperfections (as he saith)
but because their worship is superstitious, deuised by men, idolatrous,
according to that patched popish portesse their seruice booke; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vnto which their sacraments and whole administration is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
&amp; not by the rules of <hi>Christs</hi> Testament. Such we here proue their
booke, worship and ministration to be?</p>
   <p>We also before set downe vnto him sondry popish, idolatrous, &amp; blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
abuses in their worship &amp; ministration: As their Idoll Lent,
Ember &amp; Eaue Fastes; their Idoll Feastes, popish &amp; Iewish Easter, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,
Christmasse &amp;c; their Idoll Ladie dayes, Sainctes dayes, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ing
their Sacramentes with such idolatrous &amp; Popish ceremonies
&amp; trinckets, the Font, signe of the Crosse, Gossips &amp;c: Their midwiues
baptisme, Confirmatiō: Their hous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ing the sick with the other sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt: Their Iuish &amp; Popish ceremonies, vestures &amp;c: Their Purificatiō,
Offertories, Crismes &amp;c: Their marijng, burijng, limiting or coniuring
the fieldes, made a parte of the publique worship, and of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Pastors of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
&amp;c. These abhominatiōs M. <hi>Giff.</hi> will at no hād haue called popish,
idolatrous or blasphemous: We impudently lye, &amp; vnsufferably sclan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in so faijng. He therfore indeuoreth to pourge them of all popish
&amp; superstitious opinions &amp; abuses, shewing how cleare the Church of
England is of the same. Yet will not <hi>M. Giff.</hi> be thought to plead for or
iustifie anie publique abuse of the Church, but only to plead against
the <hi>Brownists</hi> that speake worse of these things then they are: For these
are no fundamental errors, such as polute the worship, but only light
imperfections &amp;c. Well, we will refer the discussing of the nature of
them how heinous they are, vnto their due place. Only here we would
know of <hi>M. Giff.</hi> what foundation these things themselues haue in the
word of God, and what warrant he can there shew for them. If he can
iustifie them by the word of God, then verely our offences are no lesse
then he hath said, that blame them to be idolatrous, popish, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.
But if these trumperies haue no foundation or commandemēt
in Gods word, but are the deuises of men; then we would know whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
God requireth or accepteth such worship at their hādes? And whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being made the publique worship of God and administration of
their Church, they be not idolatrie? And then how they may offer, or
<pb facs="8"/>
the faithfull be constrayned to such idolatrie, to such worship, as God
neither requireth non accepteth. And with what conscience he can,
or how he dare stand a minister of that Leitourgie and worship, which
the cannot approue by the word of God, and which he would not be
thought to allowe of, the abuses therof being so manifest &amp; odious in
his owne eies. Especially now with what conscience he can thus blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
&amp; condempne vs for refreining that worship which he cannot
approue, and doth not alowe: Or how he can so earnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ly inueigh
against those most forward and zealous hearers, who though they will
heare their sermons, yet withdraw from the booke seruice, for the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and euills they see therin. This <hi>M. Giff.</hi> in the Epistle to his second
booke, saith, is a more grieuous sinne then they suppose. In deed, if
the poore soules knew what they did or ought to doo in refreining the
publique false worship of the Church, they would and could haue no
spirituall communion with those ministers or people that still exercise
and will not be withdrawen from the same false worship, which they
condempne &amp; forsake; nor yet would or might they heare their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sermons that are ioyned &amp; conformed to the same idolatries and
abuses. But to the matter; vntill <hi>M. Giff.</hi> can proue by the word of God
this publique worship and administration according to their seruice
booke in those poinctes wherin we blame them, there is no cause he
should exercise it himself, allure others thervnto, or condempne vs for
refreigning the same as we are commanded of God in as manie places
as true worship is inioyned, and false worship forbidden. In all this
then he but bewraieth his owne shame &amp; hipocrisie in condempning
&amp; blaspheming vs for doing the will of God, in aluring others to false
worship &amp; idolatrie; and in doing that himself for filthie lucre &amp; feare
of the world, which he for shame of the world dare not alow, neither
can iustifie. Yea, &amp; whatsoeuer he colourably pretendeth &amp; aledgeth
in his second Booke to couer &amp; excuse the shame &amp; infamie of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
yet is he become an earnest pleader for all the corruptions and
abuses of his Church, not granting vnto vs anie one of the abuses we
reproue to be vnlawfull &amp; vngodly, lest we should thervpon vrge him
to haue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same left &amp; refreined (though not publiquely put downe &amp;
reformed as he accuseth) by the faithfull: and so they should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned
for the practise, and we iustified for the refreining these
things. Therfore he is driuen to plead for, mitigat, excuse, to tollerate
with his vttermost shiftes &amp; cauills all these abhominatiōs whatsoeuer.
Which yet are so heinous and of so high a nature, as no pretexts of the
Princes or churches power, of ceremonies of things indifferent, no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions
of substance &amp; forme, of fundamental and not fundamental
errors &amp; corruptions &amp;c: can hide, but the are found heinous trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
of the law of God, detestable abuses of the worship of God.
And he in practising and pleading for them is found but as the Dogge
reto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

Yea, he is yet furder driuen, openly to iustifie the ministrie and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of these Arch &amp; Lord Bishops and their hierarchie to be of <hi>Christ</hi>
against which he erewhile also amongest the rest of that faction was an
earnest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>utor to the Parliamēt to haue them vtterly remoued out of the
Church and abolished, their Offices, Ministrie, Courtes, Gouernment,
which could not be done without most heinous impietie, open barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
&amp; violence to the Church and vnto <hi>Christ</hi> himself, if they had bene
of <hi>Christ,</hi> as he now pretendeth. Againe if they were not of <hi>Christ</hi> but of
Antichrist (as they all of that sect then vpon certeine knowledge and
assurance affirmed) how, and with what conscience could the <hi>Reformists</hi>
themselues submit vnto their decrees, power &amp; gouernment, receiue
their ministrie of them, exercise their ministrie vnder them, sweare &amp;
performe their canonical obedience vnto them? Let <hi>M. Giff.</hi> with all his
cōning reconcile this in truth &amp; good conscience; howsoeuer he hath
reconciled himself to that apostatical throne, from which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted:
And in testimonie of his vnfeined fidelitie and in hope of some
promotion, hath written these blasphemous bookes in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

shall neuer be able to hide or excuse his open cōtrarietie, perfidie, apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie,
yea that which yet is more fearefull, his open restreint, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
and despight of that truth which he sometimes gladly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged

which al should fal to be the ground with their Lords the Bishops

   <p>Neither staieth <hi>M. Giff.</hi> himself here in the defence of this present wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
Leitourgie, Hierarchie, Courtes &amp; their procedings, ministrie, and
their administration, but yet is dryuen for the defence of all these, to
iustifie the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (euen in their greatest &amp; deepest aposta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ie)
to be the true visible established Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> to haue the true seale
of the Couenant &amp;c. And in deed this it standeth him vpon to proue,
seing their whole ministrie were immediatly deriued &amp; receiued from
their mother of <hi>Rome,</hi> as also their whole gouernment, Courtes &amp;c: and
no smal parte of their worship &amp; ministration togither with the whole
people, Parishes &amp; Synagogs as they now stand. He wanteth not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
proues to bring this abought: As that the <hi>Apostasie</hi> should arise, and
Antichrist sit in the Church of God. Yea he proueth both the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; of <hi>England</hi> at once by the schisme of <hi>Israell,</hi> the apostasie of <hi>Iuda</hi>
&amp;c: which yet in those estates were pronounced Churches by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetts.
He proueth them within the Couenant by the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
<pb facs="9"/>
where the promise is made to the thousand generation.
As also by the greatest corruptions and faltes that he can anie where
reade, of the primatiue Churches. These miserable reasons &amp; exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are the maine pillers &amp; ground-worckes of al their buildings, and
his writings; which being pulled downe, their whole frame falleth to
the ground at once, and is irreparable. For this I refer the Reader to
their due place in the second <hi>Transgression,</hi> where they are largely refuted
&amp; answered.</p>
   <p>An other pitifull reason he bringe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>h in his Proeme to the Reader, of
an humane bodie cōsisting of maimed or deformed members: Which
yet so long as life remaineth in it, is said an humane bodie. So the
Church, though it cōsist of mained &amp; deformed members, yet whilest
it hath the life, viz. true faith in CHRIST in it, yt is to be held a true
Church. I will not here stand to shew how vntowardly he hath drawē
this comparison beyond the Apostles scope &amp; proportion <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. Nor
yet how manie errors &amp; inconveniences would insue of such racking
of Allegories. Only to his reason we answere; that if in his first Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
he meane by deformed members, such as haue not their right &amp;
true shape y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> God hath appoincted to humane members, but a strange
&amp; diuerse forme;<note place="margin">Reuel. 13.</note> as the feet of a Beare, the mouth &amp; teeth of a Lion,
though it haue the face of a man,<note place="margin">Reuel. 9.</note> the haire o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> a woman &amp;c: then hold
we it not a naturall,<note place="margin">Reuel. 17.</note> but a monstrous bodie. So we say, that to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
body of <hi>Christ</hi> may no monstrous deformed strange members be
ioyned, but only such members vnto the publique ministrie as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. Neither may that heauenly edifice be built of any other
the lyuing, holy, precious stones 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. or be built in anie other forme,
then that <hi>Christ</hi> hath prescribed, and the maister builders left vnto vs in
his Testament 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. They that misbuild the Temple of God, destroy
yt: And they that destroy the Temple of God, them shall God destroy.
Now then to his inference of instance. We denie this body of their
Church to consist of these true members spoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. Neither of
those liuing precious stones 1 <hi>Peter.</hi> 2. Neither to be built according to
the true Apostolike patterne 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. But to consist of those monstrous
members <hi>Reuel. 9. &amp; Reuel.</hi> 13. and of those prophane multitudes <hi>Reuel. 17.
18.</hi> Remayning in confusion &amp; disorder <hi>Reuel.</hi> 18. 2. And therfore not
to be held the heauenly body of <hi>Christ,</hi> but that monstrous body of that
Beast: Not that holy Spouse of <hi>Christ,</hi> but that adulterous harlot: Not
that compact Citie, that heauenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but that confuse <hi>Babilō.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to that faith &amp; life of the Church he speaketh of; we confesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,

vs, that no sinne or sinnes in anie Church or Christian can disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null
the Couenant, where this true faith is found. But this we say, that

them by the word of God, as they smite, persecute and blaspheme with
all hostilitie and reproch those that but shew and reproue their sinnes.
How then should they be thought to haue this true faith, this true life
in them? But the faith of their Church remaineth to be furder exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
&amp; discussed in this Booke, whither I refer for furder triall.</p>
   <p>And now if this verbal faith &amp; confession of iustification by CHRIST,
only make a Church &amp; a Christian (though they erre &amp; transgresse in
manie, yea in anie other thing) as the life doth make a man &amp;c, how
may we, that professe this faith &amp; make this confession, be by M. <hi>Giffard</hi>
accused, pronounced, cōdemned, divulged as damnable <hi>Heretikes, Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ismaticks &amp;c?</hi> Shall this faith giue life vnto them, and not vnto vs?
Or will he slay them that <hi>Christ</hi> gyueth life vnto? And that before anie
due conviction of anie one error or transgression deseruing these hard
censures &amp; sentences. May he not euill accuse vs of rash, furious, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
dealing, that thus vncharitably accuseth, condempneth, smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
before anie triall? Yea, that thus presumptuously runneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and forestalleth the iudgment of their owne Church, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
&amp; divulging vs damnable heretikes &amp; schismatickes, before their
Church had detected, convinced &amp; reiected vs for anie one errot. As
to the heresies he accuseth vs of, <hi>Namely,</hi> to hould an <hi>

in this life &amp; immunitie frō sinne &amp; from the superior powers y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
God hath set ouer vs. When he shall be able to shew by anie one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in our writings, or but necessarily to infer from the same, that we
hould these heresies: Let vs then be held such, and M. <hi>Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>ard</hi> no accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
and sclanderer. But if the contrarie appeare in all our writings and
doings, then is it euident that he hath most maliciouslie sclandered
vs, to bring vs in hatred with our souereigne <hi>Queene</hi> &amp; the whole Land.
We may euill be accused to hould the error of perfectiō, for blaming
their Church for such heynous transgressions. Or of Anabaptisticall
freedō, for not being subiect to their antichristian yoake. Or for vsing
the 4 &amp; 5 <hi>Chap.</hi> of the Epistle to the <hi>Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>

vngodly traditions. These causes &amp; scriptures wil not beare vp M. G.
his malicious suspicions &amp; chardges. Neither if we held these detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
heresies, could our sinns or errors either excuse or lessen these trās<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
of theirs. It is a bad foundation to build his credit vpon the
ruines of other mens; especially by such detraction &amp; sclander.</p>
   <p>The Schisme he chargeth vs with, hath as litle ground or colour of
truth. We willed him long since to proue these Parish Assemblies in
this estate true &amp; established Churches, and then we would shew him
how free we are of schisme. We depart not from anie part of the truth,
<pb facs="10"/>
or from anie that will walke holily &amp; orderly in the same. The cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
of our seperation from these Parish assemblies we haue shewed to be
such as proue them no true established Churches of <hi>Christ,</hi> or such
where the faithfull may abide with anie promise or comfort. In sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
from them then we haue not rent our selues from the Church
or body of <hi>Christ,</hi> but rather seperated the Church from them: and
obeyed the commandement of God that calleth vs out from emongst
them. Againe whilest M. GIFF. standeth so much vpon the name of a
Church, and giueth the same to the Romish <hi>Sy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">

how will he escape himselfe, or cleare the Church of England
from the blot of Schisme, for seperating and withdrawing from the
Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Anie excuse that he can make or deuise, wil cleare vs
as wel as theselues. Let him looke therfore to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> measure he meateth,
lest it be measured vnto him againe with the same, not ōly in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

      </gap>ame ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
with much greater aduantage then he hath vs: In asmuch as
he confesseth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the true established Church of <hi>Christ,</hi>
with the true ministri and true seale of the Couenant &amp;c: And in that
they still reteine the same ministrie, Gouernment, Courtes, Officers,

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tes vsed
&amp; left in this Land, as the <hi>Douatists,</hi> did. Wheras we on the contrarie do
not seperate for the same causes, neither doo iustifie or reteine the same
ministrie, worship, Leitourgie, Officers, Ordinances, Gouernment, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
Synagogs, that they vse &amp;c, as the <hi>Donatists</hi> did. Neither do we
hold such errors concerning the Magistrates or ministrie &amp;c, as the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists</hi>
did, as is here more perticularly shewed in a peculiar treatise, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I refer. Only here obseruing, how the malicious man still (by the
iust iudgment of God) falleth into the same pitte, which he digged for
the innocent.</p>
   <p>For whilest he would accuse vs to derogate from the Princes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
in not allowing her to make lawes for the Church: And greatly to

antichristian enormities &amp; abuses of their church; and distaineth her
name and honor therwith (for the reformation wherof, this hipocrit
somtimes stood a zealous sutor to the Parliamēt:) Yea, he now maketh
his Prince an opposite aduersarie vnto <hi>Christ,</hi> one that will not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished,
or be obedient to Gods word. If these abuses he then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of were iust or tollerable, how could he sue to haue them abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished;
and that by a positiue lawe? If they be contrarie to the word
of God, how then can he now obey them, or blame vs for refusing to

obey them? The Lord deliuer our Souereign <hi>Que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

such impostors as these false Prophers are, that are faithful nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to God nor her, but most dangerouslie seduce &amp; highly abuse her
gracious disposition, which hath euer bene inclinable to anie truth of
God that hath bene sincerely shewed vnto her. It is no shame, neither
anie new thing, but a most high honor and praise for godly Princes to
redresse things that are amisse, when they are shewed by Gods word:
Neither it is anie iniurie to the Prince, whē the faithful witnesse against
and refreigne anie thing that is contrarie to Gods word: Or dishonor
to the Prince to amend the same, how long soeuer the abuse hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
as this Accuser and Flatterer suggesteth. The rest of whose cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations &amp; accusations against vs, our indeuours and proceadings, I
deferr to answere vntill we come to the Articles. Yet now, that the
groundworke and true causes of all his bitter invectiues and grieuous
charges against vs may appeare to all men; we haue here set downe in
print the originall and whole former passage betwixt vs and him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
these poinctes in cōtrouersie: That the Reader may the better
discerne and iudge of these our present writings: And also see what
cause ther was giuen him thus to accuse, reproch, and blaspheme vs as
heretickes, Schismatickes, disobedient and iniurious to Princes, <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>ists, Brownists,</hi> with infinite vile and reprochfull obiectiues,
wherwith his treasurie is stored. If in those writings appeare no such
matter, thē we protest, that (to our knowledg) we neuer gaue him cause
thus to accuse and blaspheme vs, he being a man altogether vnknowē
by person vnto vs, and neuer so much as seene, spoken vnto, or medled
with by vs the writers of these things, otherwise, then by those writings
here insuing; whervnto also we were prouoked by himself, who would
needs take vpon him this quarrell. Which how christianly and sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he hath handled and performed, let him of his owne mouth be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
euen by euerie sentence of his Bookes, which are referced with
most grieuous and inaudible raylings; not so much as speaking of
vs in anie place therof without some hard, cruell, and dispightfull
words and bitter reuilings and cursings. All which in our innocencie,
as the sparow and swallow by flying, we shal escape: And hauing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
discouered his spirit, easely passe ouer without regarding or answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the same: Turning also from his person as much as may be, as
from a most vnreasonable and vnhonest man, with whome we would
be loath to haue furder to doo: Fixing our eies wholye vpon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
set before vs: Indeuoring to make proofe and euident demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these charges, for which we forsake their assemblies, and haue
all this time suffred vnder their tyrannous handes: As also, to cleare
our profession and proceadings herein of such calumniations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches,
as this our malignant aduersarie defameth them with. And
this in all breuitie, truth, and good conscience, as so variable and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
a matter wil permit. Wherin if in anie poinct we deale obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>urely
&amp; insufficiently (for as the man is such is his strength) we desire that the
<pb facs="11"/>
truth may not suffer preiudice therby: But that the learned and wise
Reader wil rather confirme &amp; repaire our weake or loose reasons: yea,
by our insufficiencie be prouoked euen in zeale &amp; loue of the truth to
handle it more exactly: Wherin we shall gladly gyue place, and much
reioyce. But if in anie thing we be found to depart from the truth, we
desire to be louingly reduced, yet condingly reproued and censured,
vowing (through Gods grace) neuer to resist anie truth that shal at any
time be shewed vs, neither to resfuse to be reformed. The lesse faltes,
as the errors in the writing or print, we shall desire the Reader charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to construe &amp; correct. And if ther be found or rather abound anie
imperfect or redundant sentences, let those be imputed chiefly to the
want of better skill in the writers, and partly to their decayed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to the inconveniencie of the place, the continual tossings &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiles,
searches &amp; riflings, and no peace or meanes giuen vs either to
write, or reuise that we had written. To conclude, we beseach and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
the Reader, not to be withdrawen from the truth by anie fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived
opinion either of our tenuitie of giftes and base estate, or of
the excellencie and multitude of our aduersaries, for that were dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to themselues: But rather diligently to ponder their owne wayes
&amp; the issues therof, and where they finde themselues to erre, speedely
to retorne to the truth without cunctation or excuse; that so they may
finde peace and assurance to their owne soules. Which grace we
euen wish to our greatest enimies, and shall not cease
to pray, that God may thus blesse
our indeuoures.</p>
