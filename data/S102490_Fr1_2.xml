   <head>TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE <hi>CHARLES;</hi> PRINCE OF GREAT BRITAINE, DVKE of Cornewall, Earle of Chester, Sonne and Heire apparant to the most Excellent and Illustrious Monarch, IAMES, by Gods great mercy, King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>ESVS Christ, the supreme King of Kings, and of all Lords transcendent Lord and Soueraigne Ruler, crowne your Highnesse with all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings from the heauens aboue, and from the earth beneath; that after a long and glorious life in this world, you may for euer and euer put on the Stole of immortall felicity in the world to come.</p>
   <p>The honour and dignity of Potentates and
<pb facs="3"/> great Gouernours (most gratious Prince) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth neither in the largenesse of their Empire, the riches of their Treasure, the abundance of Reuenew, the multitude of Subiects, the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of Armies, the strength of Cities, Castles, Palaces or Guards: but in this is euery Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, if they which delight in Thrones and Scepters, embrace wisedome, that heauenly and diuine wisedome, which was the light vnto the feete,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> and the Lanthorne vnto the pathes of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid;</hi> euen true Religion, the sincere seruice of God.</p>
   <p>The sweete and Evangelicall Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> therefore declareth, that to vphold Religion, and to defend the Gospell, is the principall end for which all Gouernours and Magistrates were ordained. <hi>Kings</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall bee thy nursing Fathers,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Esay 49.23.</note>
      <hi>and Queenes shall be thy nursing Mothers.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And this indeed is the chiefest reason why vnto Kings, Princes, and great Rulers common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the trauailes and labours of the pen, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in defence of Religion, are commended; not, that by their power men do expect to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from slanderous and poysoned tongues (which Kings and Princes themselues cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid) but that vnto them which sit at the Sterne of gouernement, the knowledge of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
<pb facs="3"/> in Religion should bee brought, to the end, that false worship being extirped, true Religion may be vpheld, and the right feare of God esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished vpon the earth.</p>
   <p>Hauing finished therefore this poore Orphan labour of mine, begunne not without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and approbation of that thrice-noble Prince, <hi>Henry,</hi> your Hignesse late dearest and most worthy brother; I thought it my duty to present it vnto your Grace, both in respect of that excellent knowledge of heauenly things, to which, euen in this your tender age you haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: as also for that vnder his hopefull aspect, it first tooke life and began to grow.</p>
   <p>Surely, I cannot tell to whom rather the knowledge of this cause should appertaine, then to your most excellent Highnesse: whom God (I hope) hath ordained, after a long period of the glorious and happy raigne of your august and gratious father, to sway the Scepter of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Kingdom, which therefore the hellish brood of Locusts, Iesuites, and Seminaries do so much labour to bring backe againe vnto the Romish seruitude; not, that either they care for our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, or that they dislike the doctrine of our Church, but for that this fertile Iland hath yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded such large reuenew, and copious prouent
<pb facs="4"/> vnto the vnsatiable vultures of that Court.</p>
   <p>And it is worthy obseruation, that as neither Religion, nor zeale of the truth hath set these brands on fire to the deuastation &amp; combustion of Christendome; so no lenity nor mercy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth to appease their gall: for otherwise, how could they breake out into such treasons and slanders against the most sacred person of our Tres-noble King? then whom, the Sunne neuer saw a Prince more mercifull, nor more clement; in so much that I should presume to haue said, that his pittie and compassion had beene more then the safety of his State could well endure: sauing that my Lord the King is euen an Angell of God discerning both good and bad.<note place="margin">2.

   <p>I speak not this to exasperate your Highnesse more then is conuenient: neither do I with <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kius</hi> declaime how lawfull it is to put Heretickes to death,<note place="margin">Eck trac. de Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burend.
