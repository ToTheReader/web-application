   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was neuer any thing by the wit of man so well deuised, or so sure established, which in continuance of time hath not bin corrupted: as among other things, it may plainly appeare by the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayers in the Church, commonly called Diuine Seruice. The first originall and ground whereof, if a man woulde search out by the ancient Fathers, hee shall find that the same was not ordained but of a good purpose, and for a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of godlinesse. For they soor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the matter, that all the whole Bible (or the greatest part thereof) should be read ouer once euery yeere, entending thereby that the Clergie, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such as were ministers of the Congregation, should (by often reading and meditation of Gods word) be stirred vp to godlinesse themselues, and be more able to exhort other by wholesome doctrine, and to confute them that were aduersarics to the trueth. And further, that the people (by dayly hearing of holy Scripture read in the Church) should continually profite more &amp; more in the knowledge of God, and be the more inslamed with the loue of his true religion. But these many yeres passed, this godly and decent order of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers hath bene so altered, broken, &amp; neglected, by planting in vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine stories, Legends, Responds, Verses, vaine Repetitions, Cōmemorations, and Synodalles, that commonly when any booke of the Bible was begun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore three or foure chapters were read out, all the rest were vnread. And in this sort the booke of Esay was begun in Aduent, and the booke of Genesis in Septuagesima: but they were onely begun, and neuer read through. After like sort were other bookes of holy Scripture vsed. And moreouer, whereas Saint Paul would haue such language spoken to the people in the Church, as they might vnderstand, and haue profit by hearing the same: the seruice in this Church of England, these many yeres, hath bin read in Latine to the people, which they vnderstood not: so that they haue heard with their cares only, and their heart, spirit, and mind haue not bene edif;ied thereby. And furthermore, not with slanding that the ancient Fathers haue deuided the Psalmes into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen portions, wherof euery one was called a Nocturne: now of late time a few of them haue bene dayly sayd, and oft repeated, and the rest vtterly omitted. Moreouer, the number and hardnesse of the rules called the Pie, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisold changings of the seruice, was the cause, that to turne the booke onely was so hard and intricate a matter, that many times there was more businesse to find out what should be read, then to reade it when it was found out.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>These in conueniences therefore considered, here is set foorth such an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, where by the same shall be redressed. And for a readinesse in this matter hereis drawen out a Kalender for that purpose, which is plaine and easie to be vnderstanded, wherein (so much as may bee) the reading of holy Scriptures is so set forth, that all things shalbe done in order, without breaking one piece there of from an other. For this cause be cut off Anthemes, Responds, Inuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and such like things, as did breake the continuall course of the reading of the Scripture. Yet because there is no remedie, but that of necessitie there must bee some rules, therefore certaine rules are here set foorth, which as they bee sewe in number, so they be plaine and easie to be vnderstanded. So that here you haue an order for prayer (as touching the reading of holy Scripture) much agreeable to the mind and purpose of the olde fathers, and a great deale more profitable and commodious then that which of late was vsed. It is more profitable, because here are left out many things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some be vntrue some vncertaine, some vaine and superstitious, and is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined nothing to be read, but the very pure word of God, the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or that which is euidently grounded vpon the same, and that in such a language and order, as is most easie and plaine for the vnderstanding both of the readers and hearers. It is also more commodious, both for the shortnesse thereof, and for the plainnesse of the order, and for that the rules be fewe and casie. Furthermore by this order the Curates shall neede none other bookes for their publike seruice, but this booke and the Bible. By the meanes wherof, the people shall not bee at so great charges for bookes, as in times past they haue bene.</p>
   <p>And where here to fore there hath bene great diuersitie in saying &amp; singing in Churches within this Realme, some following Salisbury vse, some Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford vse, and somc the vse of Bangor, some of Yorke, some of Lincolne: Now from henceforth all the whole Realme shall haue but one vse. And if any will iudge this way more painefull, because that all things must be read vpon the booke, where as before, by the reason of so often repetition they could say ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things by heart: if those men will weigh their labour, with the prosire and knowledge which dayly they shall obtaine by reading vpon the booke, they will not refuse the payne, in consideration of the great profite that shall ensue thereof.</p>
   <p>And forasmuch as nothing can almost be so plainely set forth, but doubts mary life in the vse and practising of the same. To appease all such diuersity (if any arise) and for the resolution of all doubts concerning the maner how to vnderstand do, and execute the things contained in this Booke: The parties that so doubt, or diuersly take any thing, shall alway resort to the Bishop of the Diocesse, who by his diseretion shall rake order for the quieting and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing of the same, so that the same order be not contrary to any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this booke. And if the Bishop of the Diocesse be in any doubt, then he may send for the resolution thereof vnto the Archbishop.</p>
   <p>Though it be appointed in the afore written Presace, that all things shall beread and sung in the Church in the English tongue, to the ende that the Congregation may be thereby edisied: yet it is not meant, but when men say
<pb facs="6"/>
Morning &amp; Euening prayer priuately, they may say the same in any language that they themselues doe vnderstand.</p>
   <p>And all Priests and Deacons shall be bound to say dayly the Morning and Euening prayer, either priuately or openly, except they be let by preaching, studying of diuinity, or by some other vrgent cause.</p>
   <p>And the Curate that ministreth in euery parish Church or Chappel being at home, and not being otherwise reasonably letted, shall say the same in the Parish Church or Chappell where he ministreth, and shall toll a bell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, a conuenient time before he begin, that such as be disposed, may come to heare Gods word, and to pray with him.</p>
