In the ende of which Sermon, he shall set forth and declare the briefe notes of the confession of the wicked purpose concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of late by Doctor Parry, to haue murdered the Queenes Maiestie, animated therevnto by the Pope and his Cardinals, as you maie see it set downe here following. Last of all he shall saie the praier here prescribed for that purpose, and desire the people to lift vp their harts to God together with him. After the praier, there shall be songe or said the xxj. Psalme, or some other Psalme to the like effect.</p>
