   <p>WHereas the testimonies of learned Philosophers and Physicians have given suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent assurance, that the Infusion of the <hi>Antimoniall Cup</hi> is an <hi>Ʋniversall</hi> and <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Medicine,</hi> and that the Experiments of Honourable &amp; worthy Persons have confirmed the same to be a wholsome and Prevalent Medicine against many dangerous and desperate Diseases, as by their severall Certificats may appeare: And that (without unthankfulnes to the alone Giver of all good gifts, Injurie to the Common wealth, and offence against Christian charity) it may not be concealed: my humble suit therefore is, to all (to whom these presents shall come) that they would be pleased to peruse the Authorities by me alledged in my booke called the <hi>Ʋniversall Medicine,</hi> and to afford me their friendly assistance for the better communication and declaration thereof for the health and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit of mankind. And if any receive harme by the use thereof (following the directions of my booke) or if I report fraudulently of the <hi>Medicinall vertues</hi> thereof, let it be required at my hands both in this life and in that to come.</p>
   <p>The Antimoniall Cups herein mentioned are made and sold by <hi>Iohn Evans</hi> Minister of Gods word dwelling in Gunpowder-Alley neere fetter lane.</p>
