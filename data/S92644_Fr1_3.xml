   <head>❧ <hi>Iohn Gardiner vnto <hi>all the litle French Church</hi> of Strasburg, assembled together</hi> for the Gospell, in the name of <hi>Iesus Christ: grace, peace and mercie of</hi> the Father through Iesus Christe our Lorde, onely Sauior and redéemer, in the vertue of the holy Spirite, be geuen vnto you eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. <hi>Amen.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I consider the</hi> cleare lightes, the great ingenyous and sharpe wittes, which the Lorde in our time hath placed in his Church (déerely beloued brethren and welbeloued in Iesus Christe) who neuer cease day nor night to aduaunce the glorye of God, and to promote the kingdome of Iesus Christe his sonne, aswell by their wordes, as writing, of whome I am not worthy to be a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. I am ashamed and feare lest I be iudged raish to put my hand to the pen after them, and chiefly for to entreat of
<pb facs="6"/> thinges so litle and common, the which they haue entreated of in theyr Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chismes from the beginning. But the holy desire of you and of manye other good brethren, who hauing heard open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reading of this litle Treatise, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly requiring to be pertakers haue incited, yea constrained mee to do it, with the great desire that I haue of the aduauncement of the glory of God and of the health of all my brethren: Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God would haue al the world to come vnto the knowledg of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> trueth,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> and by that meanes to be saued. I know also that for the building of the Lordes tabernacle made by <hi>Moyses,</hi>
      <note place="margin">S. Ierom. Exo. 25.</note> euery one brought that he had, some golde and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, others precious stones, others lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloth, goates and buckes skinnes, others wood, and common stones, and all of it was set a worke: So I estéeme, for the building of this house of the Lorde,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. Ephe. 4.</note> which is his Church, euery one may and ought to bring that y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he hath, some more, some lesse, according to the tallentes which the Lorde of the house hath geuen them, I wil content my self to carry litle common stones for this
<pb facs="6"/> building, and do hope that the Master worke men will not reiect my seruice, nor my litle stones, so that they be fitte for the building (as I hope they shalbe, God ayding me.<note place="margin">Math. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. Luke. 21.</note>) The poore wydowe which did put into the box but two litle peeces of siluer, was not reiected nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised of the Lorde, but was as much praysed as the great ritch men which gaue a great deale more then she. All that being well considered hath mooued me to set forth this litle treatise in this tyme chiefly, in which the Lorde hath the siue in his hand to sifte, examine, and repurge his Church, in which it should be verye good (in my iudgment) that euerye mans fayth should be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, and chieflye of those which make profession of the Gospell, for to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as are the Doctors and Minist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the word, that the false Prophets and Hypocrites which doo bowe theyr shoulders and leane theyr eares vnto false papisticall doctrine of Antechriste should be knowne, driued and chased a way from the good &amp; faythful. For that cause I am contēt, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> my faith, in which I will lyue and dye thorow the grace
<pb facs="7"/> of the Lord be knowen of al the world.</p>
   <p>Now this litle Treatise shall haue much neede of a second which shal geue the reason of that that this here confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, for it is one thing to confesse the fayth, and another to geue a reason of the fayth. To confesse the fayth, that is purely, symply, and clearely, to say, and confesse with hart and mouth, or by writing that that one beléeueth of God and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>is word. But to geue a reason of the fayth is to prooue and openly to shew by teres of the holy scripture, and manifest reasons groūded in the same, what one beléeueth, and wherfore one beléeueth, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Peter. 3.</note> the Apostle commaundeth. The which I haue made in tymes past, in the time of the faires, (as you haue heard and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood) in declaring that confession by Articles, for to geue some lytle taste of the Gospell vnto the straingers which came hether, and to make them to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, what is our faith and religiō in which we wil liue and dye, and that we are not heretickes, seditious nor blasphemers (as many do estéeme vs to be) but faithfull and true Christians,
<pb facs="7"/> hauing and receyuing one onely Iesus Christ for our Lord, Sauiour, Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and Aduocate, beleeuing &amp; hoping in him only, and not in any other, for which also we wil venter and ieopard not onely our externall goods, but also our bodyes vnto the last droppe of our bloud.<note place="margin">Mat. 10.16 Mark. 8. Luke. 9.17.</note> Knowing that whosoeuer shall loose his life for the loue of him, shall fynde it, and he that will kéepe it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing and forsaking him, he shall loose it eternally. This hath beene my marke and principall end, all that time there, in which I had not (nor haue yet at this present) the leisure to collect and put in wryting all the probation argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; reasons, which I haue vsed as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel of the holy scriptures as of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciēt fathers for to yeeld a reason of my faith, &amp; to shew the truth of the articles therof therein contained. But if y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lord do geue vs good peace, and keepe vs yet stil in this place (as I hope y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he will do thorowe his mercy, although we haue not merited it) I promise to geue vnto you y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> second treatise correspondāt vnto this here, in which I wil geue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> reason of my faith, as in this I wil declare and
<pb facs="8"/> confesse (with the helpe of the Lord (the verity of all these Articles which are in number an hundreth, aswell by the word of God, as by the writings of the auncient Fathers, according to my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle faculty &amp; the grace which the Lord shall geue me, and then I will content my self that I haue liued in this world. In the meane time deere brethren, I praye you to receyue and take in good part this litle gifte and present, of the hand of your lawful brother and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friend, hoping to receiue a greater. I assure you that the onely word of the Lord is the fayre and large garden of pleasure, within which I putting my selfe, haue gathered these goodly swéete smelling flowers, and made this fayre garlande of triumphe, for to put it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heads of the true faithfull Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians (such as now are.) And I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken nothing from the sinke, puddle and takes of <hi>Luiterim,</hi> nor from other such like papisticall doctrines, Antechristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and inuentions of men. For out of such sinkes puddles and infections such flowers spring not forth, but rather thornes bryers and thystles for to fede
<pb facs="8"/> and crowne the Asses of Antechriste.</p>
   <p>I may boldlye saye, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this litle Treatise, but that I can shew and prooue it by the worde of God, the which I haue folowed and not the diuers opinions of men: For I haue not sworne in any mans word, but in that same of Iesus Christe, vpon which my fayth is builded, and not vpon the opinion of men: therfore I haue spoken here and written freelye that which I féele in my harte, without hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard vnto any other then vnto my on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord and Master Iesus Christe.</p>
   <p>This may serue at all tymes for a paterne &amp; rule of the confession of faith, to all those which wyll declare them selues to be of the number of our assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly following the holye custome &amp; most allowable, of this litle Church, that all those which will perticipate or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with vs in the holye table of the Lorde, firste of all ought to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like confession of their fayth, that is to saye: to declare before the assembly the fayth and knowledge, which the Lorde hath geuen vnto them of the word and Gospell of his sonne Iesus Christ, that
<pb facs="9"/> they may be knowen and manyfested vnto all the congregation, to be of the number of the faithfull and true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, worthy to perticipat of the giftes, graces and benefits of the Lord with the brethren. As also of late vnder the lawe all straungers which would communicate or perticipate the pascall Lambe with the people of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,<note place="margin">Exo. 12.</note> ought first to renounce all Idolatry to receiue circumcision, &amp; to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of all the lawe, and religion of God, geuen by <hi>Moyses,</hi> promising to liue and walk in the same all the daies of their life: And by that meanes were admitted to the Passeouer, to eate and communicate with the other, and not otherwise.<note place="margin">Exo. 12.</note> As it is written in the booke of the lawe. Truly it is more to perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipat in the holy table of the Lord (that is to say in the holy Sacrament of the Supper) thē to eat the pascall Lambe: for somuch as the cleerenesse is more then the shadow,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. Collos. 2.</note> and the verity more then the figure: For the lawe was but the shadow and figure of the verity, the which we haue present before vs. If thē there were vnder the law obserued
<pb facs="9"/> and kept such discipline in the Churche of God, among the faithfull, how much more ought it to be obserued vnder the verety in the shéepfold of Iesus Christ, which is his Church?<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. Exo. 20. 1. Pet. 5. Math. 7.15</note> who commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the shepheardes thereof to knowe the sheepe, and call them by their name, and diligently to consider theyr estate, lest they should geue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> childrens bread vnto dogs, and the pearles vnto hogs. Then as <hi>Moyses</hi> the seruaunt of God did not admit vnto the Passeouer anye straungers, before they firste declared their faith: so the good &amp; faythfull eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical pastor, ought not to admit (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my aduise, saued alwayes a better iudgement) vnto the holy table any straungers, whose fayth is vnto him vnknowē, but to endeuor him self firste to knowe their fayth and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by all meanes priuately and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly, if he cannot publikelye before the Churche and Congregation, that he maye witnesse of theyr fayth before all the brethren: And by that meanes to admytte them with the other.</p>
   <p>This pollycye and lowable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplyne, was kepte and obserued in
<pb facs="10"/> this our litle Church (as you knowe) from the beginning, vnto this daye: The Lorde thorowe his grace, graunt that it may long continue, to the praise of his name: For by the same many ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt are taught, in the rudimentes of the Christian faith: And there know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is alwaies augmented, and there is none of vs but receiueth great profit. To this then this litle Treatise maye well serue for a patterne and rule (as it is sayd) for the young ones, simple and ignoraunt, who maye take what they thinke good and leaue the rest for to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd prolixity: therfore I haue deuided and distinguished it by Articles. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, this Confession is deuided in to foure principall poyntes: In the first I shew what I beleeue of the holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, chiefly of the eternall Father and of the thinges made by him, of the first creation of man, and of his fall: In the second what I beléeue of the Sonne which is the second person, and of the thinges by him made, chiefly of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring and restoring of man: In the third, what I beléeue of the holy ghost, which is the thirde person of the holye
<pb facs="10"/> Trynitie by whom man (made by the Father, and restored by the Sonne) is mayntained and kept in his being: In the fourth, what I beléeue of the holy Catholike Church, and of the thinges concerning the same. That doon, I shew and declare the great frutes proceeding and comming from that fayth, whiche are thrée in number, as you may see to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the ende: And all of it is made after the order of the simbole or creede, which we call commonly the Apostles creede, which hath bene receiued at all tymes without any contraduction in the Catholike Church. And let no man maruaile, although I multiplye these Articles vnto an hundreth, although that the Créede containeth but twelue: For euery one of the twelue, contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth other twelue and more. Doo then as the honnye Bées, who of all flowers doo gather profit: By that meanes you shall augment more and more in fayth and knowledg of the Lord, &amp; in charity and loue towardes your neyghbours, for therein dependeth all the lawe and the Prophets. I beséeche that good God and celestiall father which hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="11"/> you from the tirraunye of Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christe, and hath drawne you from darknesse, error and ignorance, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your inward eyes, declaring him selfe vnto you by his Gospell, that it would please him to augment alwaies his giftes, graces and benedictions in you, to direct and keepe you by his holy spirite. Vnto eternall life, in the name of his sonne Iesus Christe our Lord and one-Sauiour. <hi>Amen.</hi>
