   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>CHristian Reader, you haue heere before your eyes, some labours of that faithfull seruaunt of Christ, Ma. <hi>George Estey.</hi> Such as haue knowne him (if the feare of God be within their breasts) will both bewaile his immature death, and also take in good worth, euen these fruits of his happy life. Wee may graunt with griefe, that if the Author had longer liued, these works might deserue to haue beene the better loued, and if hee had published, they must needs haue been thoroughly polished: Neuerthelesse, let vs rather thankfully make vse of what Gods mercy hath left, then discontentedly remember what Gods anger hath denyed. There is no cause why thou shouldest blame my poore endeauour, seeing there hath not beene wanting on my part, either the iudgement of graue men to counsell me, or the importunitie of friends to call vpon me, or mine own fidelitie to discharge mee, for and in the imparting of these things vnto thee. Neither will there be cause (I trust) to blame the workes, so be it there be not wanting on thy part iudgement, wisedome, and patience, soundly to weigh all things, wisely to interpret some things, slightly, or with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meditation to read nothing. And so I am sure, wee may finde in these pithy and concise writings, plentifull matter of singuler instruction. Somewhat hath beene heeretofore published by others, but with much deprauation in diuers places, and sore against my will to whom the originall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies were committed: also in this impression, something is kept backe by authoritie, as namely the proofe of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors iudgement, touching Christes discention into hell. Let me giue further notice, that the beginning of the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Gospell vnto the 6 verse of the 1 of Iohn, I was faine to supply out of the Authors notes in Latine, which
<pb facs="3"/>he penned first, beeing wanting in the English copie of his second penning. I thought this course very necessary, that seeing so good a work wanting an end, by reason of the too too soone end of the Authour (if it had pleased God) yet it might haue some beginning, as also that the method and order of that which followeth might be perceiued. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the beginning of the Creed mentioneth, is not to be vnderstood of that which is set before it, but of the course in preaching. Finally, the Epistle dedicatorie of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors owne making, though priuatly sent in his life time with a written copie, yet because I found them together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his owne originall writings, and hauing permission by will to publish these his works, I thought it meete not to suppresse so thankfull, so deserued, and so elegant a dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thus (Christian Reader) I commend thee &amp; thy labour in these workes, vnto the blessing of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie.</p>
