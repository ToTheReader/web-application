   <head>To the Right worthy Knight Sir <hi>Maurice Ahbot,</hi> Gouernour of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Company of Merchants, trading to the <hi>East Indies;</hi> and the rest of that renowmed Society.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing of late yeeres addicted my selfe, especially amongst other Studies, to a more curious search and inquisition <hi>of this glorious and wondrous workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the World, (whereof the one moity is in a maner vnknowne to the other)</hi> endeauouring to giue my selfe some satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, by all such <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Discoueries</hi> as I could procure, of those Conntreys least knowne vnto vs; whether described by our Countreymen or by other forraine Trauellers▪ I became so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the following <hi>Relation of Cochin-China by an Italian Iesuite,</hi> (who as it seemeth had beene resident there some yeeres) that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued


<pb facs="3"/>
the description hee maketh of the Countrey, and the Commodities thereof, would not onely giue some contentment to the curiosity of others; but might also happely be vsefull to our Countreymen that trade and traffique in those Easterne parts: If not to open a traffique to <hi>China</hi> it selfe, on which it confineth; yet at the least to giue occasion of further enquiry and discouery; whether the Commodities of the Countrey be such as are preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the accesse of all Strangers so freely inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as is heere insinuated.</p>
   <p>I am not ignorant that your trading into these remote parts of the <hi>East Indies</hi> hath had many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers, especially of the ignorant and weaker sort; who suppose the Treasure of the Realme to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted thereby, in regard that they haue heard of much Money carried thither as well as other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and some late disasterous euents and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: as if it were no good husbandry to cast seed into the ground, because we are not alwayes assured to haue a happy Haruest. But this must not make any wise man impatient in his expectation of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter successe; which commonly commeth by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant continuance of all so well grounded procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. For (the case hauing beene well canuased and euery obiection discussed) your experience


<pb facs="3"/>
hath taught, and your remonstrance to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath manifested; <hi>that as the publike profit by forraine Trade, is the only meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we gaine Treasure, (for Mines wee haue none which doe afford it) So the remotest traffique is alwayes most beneficiall to the publike Stocke; and the Trade to the</hi> East In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <hi>doth farre excell all others.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I shall not need to enter into particulars, how many <hi>braue Ships</hi> are by this Trade yeerely buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, rigged and furnished; how many <hi>good Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners</hi> made and imployed; how many <hi>Artificers</hi> and handicrafts men set on worke; how many <hi>idle persons are taught to be seruiceable Sea-men;</hi> how our <hi>Enemies</hi> are affronted, and our <hi>Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> counter poised, which with many other obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatious haue beene by sundry of your selues very euidently declared.</p>
   <p>I will onely conclude, that seeing it is so many wayes apparent, that the <hi>Kings Customes</hi> are so much by your trading into these remotest regions increased; <hi>His Fame</hi> thereby spread into <hi>Persia, India, Iapan, China, Iaua,</hi> and euen to the ends of the world dispersed; His whole Realme and Kingdome thereby so much strengthened, safegar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and enriched; with the Renowme Honour and


<pb facs="4"/>
reputation thereof so much raised end enlarged. I could wish, that as the remote Nauigation publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the <hi>Venetian Rhamusius,</hi> awakened the Industry of <hi>M<seg rend="sup">•.</seg> Hakluyt,</hi> and happely of <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r.</seg> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas</hi> after him, to their diligent gatherings of the most remarkeable Voyages of our Nation: so some other able person (of which our Countrey hath good store) were encouraged and stirred vp, to continue such Collections: Yet not onely to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording the exploits of our owne Nation; but also to collect and publish what they find worth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding amongst Forreiners, that may any way be seruiceable for the instruction of ours.</p>
   <p>To such end this <hi>Relation</hi> is addressed vnto you, that if you find ought that may be vsefull there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, you may make your benefit thereof; (as it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth others of our neighbour Nations haue in some sort sought and attempted) or at least by your owne farther experience, controll and rectifie their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings: To which purpose I cast this poore Mite into your rich Treasury; and remaine,</p>
