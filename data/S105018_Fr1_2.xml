      <l>THat you may see (great King) you haue not done</l>
      <l>A worke in which your glory shall not liue,</l>
      <l>In sauing me: the course which I haue runne,</l>
      <l>Behold, deciphred, here to you I giue.</l>
      <l>In which I doe so punctually set forth</l>
      <l>Euen in the liueliest colours what I know</l>
      <l>Of those base wayes: that who so has of worth</l>
      <l>The meanest sparke, will scorne the like to doe.</l>
      <l>I haue not only charactred this ill,</l>
      <l>But Actors to; that the least iudging eye</l>
      <l>Those Locusts, which your Land with trouble fill,</l>
      <l>May, in their chief'st disguises, them discrie.</l>
      <l>So that in sauing me, you haue destroy'd,</l>
      <l>O Heauen knowes what; a crew of those vild things,</l>
      <l>By whom your better people were anoy'd,</l>
      <l>Whose liues may now speake seruice to their Kings.</l>
      <l>And for my selfe, let my Detractors call,</l>
      <l>This course a seruile one, and to my shame</l>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <l>Say I haue rip'd, the bowels vp of all,</l>
      <l>And to preserue my life, haue lost my fame</l>
      <l>By such detections; but (great Sir) you know,</l>
      <l>Your bountie, without article or tie,</l>
      <l>My forfeit life so freely did bestow,</l>
      <l>You bad, it was obey'd, I did not die.</l>
      <l>This then I pay to you a double debt,</l>
      <l>First, to that grace preseru'd me,</l>
      <l>Next that borne dutie I must not forget which is yours:</l>
      <l>The subiect ow's to Princes, and their powers.</l>
      <l>The last made greater by the first: engage</l>
      <l>Both life and dutie in a two-fold band;</l>
      <l>Which may produce vnto succeeding age</l>
      <l>Storiet worth my redemption; which may stand,</l>
      <l>With the faire memories of men: so plac'd,</l>
      <l>The times may blesse your mercy; by whose grace</l>
      <l>This shame and ills of mine are quite defac'd,</l>
      <l>When vertue shall succeed in vice his place:</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>So that what after good my life shall bring,</l>
      <l>Must needs be call'd the blessing of my King.</l>
