      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, that which <hi>Suetoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> reports concerning <hi>Caligula,</hi> that hee had wont to say, that he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing so much in his nature as impudencie and obstinacie, may truly be verified of certaine refractorie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in this age of ours, who professing the same faith and religion which we do, and calling thēselues Protestants, yet cease not stiflie to maintaine some certaine errours, though they be neuer so clearely conuinced, and to slander their brethren and religion, though they iustifie and explaine themselues neuer so apparantly: and that which is yet a greater signe of impudencie and obstinacie, the more they are perswaded and exhorted by all louing and brotherlie meanes to vnitie and amitie, the more they rage, and spit out the venome of their mallice against the perswaders. This vncharitable dealing as it appeareth in most of the writings of those who call themselues <hi>Luthers</hi> disciples. So in none more then in their proceedings against the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Prince <hi>Fredericke</hi> Elector his Church: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>ouersaries, notwithstandiag their disagreement in
<pb facs="8"/>
some points: and laboured also to winne them to peace by all louing and kind protestations: yet diuers of a more turbulent nature amongst them, haue not spared to exagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate that booke, and accuse the writers thereof of fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent dealing both in deliuering some, and concealing other of their doctrines: and in a word, to condemne them more then euer they did before: for which cause those godly men of the Prince Electors Church, were constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to write this second booke, called, <hi>A full Declaration of their faith and ceremonies:</hi> that they might stop the mouthes of their malicious aduersaries, and shew to the world that they hold no such damnable errours as they impute vnto them.</p>
   <p>My purpose is not commend this small vollume vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee for it will commend it selfe, if thou please to peruse it with an indifferent eie: my intent is onely to shew thee how vsefull it may be to the Church of God. The ends of the first writing of it were these; first, that the world might know what they hold concerning the matter of religion, and how sound their faith is in all fundamentall points thereof. Secondly, that the mouthes of their aduersaries the rigid Lutherans might be stopped, who cease not mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously to lay vnto their charges strange and blasphemous doctrines, which they neuer thought nor taught. And thirdly, that all men might perceiue, how those that falsely call themselues <hi>Luthers</hi> disciples, doe swarue more from <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion then these doe, except in one thing onelie which is the doctrine of the sacrament: for albeit <hi>Luther</hi> spake many things in the beat of contention, which might seeme to afford some ground to their opinions, yet when that heate was cooled, and his speeches proceeded from
<pb facs="8"/>
better aduisement, hee is so farre from patronizing such paradoxes, that none is more contrary vnto them then himselfe is: these were ends of the first writing this booke.</p>
   <p>And as for the translating, it wanteth not lawful and commendable vses: for, first we may here see, what cause we haue to blesse God for the religeous care of our dread so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, in matching his only daughter a princesse peere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, with a Prince of that soundnesse in religion as the Prince Elector is: thereby discouering his singular loue to the truth, and his vpright heart to God: when as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther masses of treasure nor height of honour did so much preponder at in his royall heart, as did true religion, and the aduancement of the Gospel, and the glory of God. What is to marry in the Lord, if this be not? and what can be a truer token of a religious heart then this is? policie, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth to strengthen states and kingdomes by conioyning them together by marriages. And in this respect not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religion is often not regarded, but euen natures law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, as experience sheweth in many places of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and especially in the house of <hi>Austria.</hi> But our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeous Soueraigne esteeming it no policie but vanitie, which is not grounded vpon the feare of God, the roote of true wisdome, hath preferred true religion aboue all; and laboured to strengthen himselfe rather in the Lord, then in the world. Albeit there be neuer the lesse no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that happie match, either in honour, he being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from Kings and Emperours, and the principall Elector Emperiall. Or in wealth and power, his dominion being both great and large, able to answere his stoutest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in the face, if need should require, or in gifts of nature, of which this whole land, and especially Cambridge graced
<pb facs="9"/>
by his highnesse presence are eye, and eare, and heart wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses: notwithstanding, religion was his Maiesties chiefe motiue: and so being, it giueth vs all his subiects that feare God, cause both to praise God for his Maiesties happy raign ouer vs, and to lay downe our liues and goods at his feet to giue him contentment: and to pray to God with earnest deuotion for the continuing of his life and raigne. As also to hope that as his Maiesty hath begun this first happy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his royall issue in the Lord, so hee will not swarue from the said rule in the second, of him who is the breath of our nostrels, and the only radiant starre of our horrison.</p>
   <p>Secondly, this Treatise may serue to aduertise vs that we are not alone in the profession of our faith, nor doe sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our selues from other reformed Churches: but ioyne the hands of fellowship and friendship with the Churches of Germany; yea of France, the Low-Countries, Denmark and all other reformed Churches of the world, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they differ from vs in some ceremonies; yet in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of faith, we runne all one way, and mind one thing. And touching Ceremonies, being nothing but externall accidents and ornaments of religion, that they are not so obstinately maintained by any of vs, as if the life of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should consist therein: or that we are not ready to alter and change the fashion of them if necessitie, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of charitie or scandall should so require. And as for the difference betwixt the Lutherans and Caluinists, that they are not so great nor so many as our aduersaries would make them, and as the world take them to bee: excepting onely a few strange positions broched &amp; defended by some of a more rough and bitter spirit of that sect; who as they swarne from the standert of their Captaine <hi>Luther,</hi> so are
<pb facs="9"/>
condemned of their owne pewfellowes, to whom God hath vouchsafed a more mild and peaceable heart. This is plainely discouered in this booke; and not onely this, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so with what spirit of meekenesse these good men, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this booke, are inspired, who being reuiled, scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and contumeliously railed vpon, by those rough and rigid false disciples of <hi>Luther,</hi> reuiled not againe, but after the example of Christ referre the righting of their wrongs to him that is the rightfull Iudge of heauen and earth: and by all gentle and louing perswasions labour to winne them to the truth.</p>
   <p>Lastly, it may stand vp as a bulwarke, against the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious slanders of our rancored aduersaries the Iesuites, and other of the Romish crew, and this as in many pointes, so especially in these two: that the Protestant Church for want of a vissible Iudge indued with infallibillety of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and impossibilitie of erring is rent and torne in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into so many sectes, as there are particular Churches, and almost persons. And that we, if not professedly, yet by consequents, hold this damnable doctrine, that God is the author of sinne: both which slanders are so clearely dispel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this tract, that none can choose but subscribe to the same, who is not either mufled with ignorance, or blinded with mallice. For touching the first, here they may see, how though we be disioyned by distance of peace, yet we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord together in the vnitie of one truth, and that all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences amongst vs, are almost onely in such matters, as concerne not the life of religion, but the exteriour shape and garment thereof. And this by the guidance of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible head <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and his blessed spirit of truth, in better and in a more excellent maner, then they by their
<pb facs="10"/>
visible Iudge the pretended vicar of <hi>Christ</hi> vpon earth. And touching the second, that neither directly wee teach, nor indirectly may bee deduced from our doctrines, that God is the author of sinne, is so euidently and sincerely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered in this booke, as none that readeth the same with aduisement can but account our aduersaries notorious cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniaters to lay so soule a crime to our charges vpon so sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ground; but no maruell, seeing slandering and lying is one of the chiefe pillars of their kingdome. These bee the profitable vses, that may be made of this booke, Now the God of all mercie direct all our thoughts, words and works, to the aduancement of his glorie, and the edification of his Church. And thus commending this booke to thy fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptance, I commend thee to the grace of <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
