   <l>IF such as toylesome trauayle take to <hi>Indie</hi> farre for gold,</l>
   <l>And passe along the surging seas, amids the blustering cold,</l>
   <l>Deserue such guerdon for their hyre, such prayses for their paine,</l>
   <l>Though they bring naught but worldly wealth, to maintaine priuate gaine,</l>
   <l>Which with great danger gotten is, and fostered with such feare,</l>
   <l>As clogs the minde with pensiue thoughts, with griefes and carking care:</l>
   <l>Then great is his desert by due, who with his painfull toyle,</l>
   <l>Hath vndergone this trauaile great, and brought from forraine soyle,</l>
   <l>Such pearles of price, such choice receipts, as plentie here we finde,</l>
   <l>To comfort soule and bodie both, and purge the troubled minde</l>
   <l>From noysome humours, which doe breede such passions in the heart</l>
   <l>Of those, who therewith poisoned are: and doth the same impart</l>
   <l>To each man freely for his good: encreasing thus the wealth</l>
   <l>Of them, who wish for quiet rest, and thirst for heauenly health.</l>
   <l>These fruitfull labours then of thine, the vertuous will commend,</l>
   <l>And with their tongues will thankefull be: and so adue my Friend.</l>
