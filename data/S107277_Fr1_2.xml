   <head>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>I Thinke it good gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, here in the begynnyng to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish thee of certaine wordes &amp; kyndes of speaches, which I do vse sometyme in this myne aunswere to the late By<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shop of Winchesters book, least in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakyng, thou doe as it were stumble at them.</p>
   <p>First this word <hi>(Sacrament</hi>) I doe sometymes vse (as it is many tymes taken among writers and holy Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours) for the Sacramentall bread,<note place="margin">Sacrament.</note> water, or wine, as when they say, that <hi>Sacramentum est sacrae rei signum,</hi> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is the signe of an holy thyng. But where I vse to speake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes (as the old Authors do) that Christ is in the Sacramentes, I mean the same as they did vnderstand the matter, that is to say, not of Christes carnall presence in the outward Sacrament, but sometymes of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall presence. And sometyme by this word <hi>(Sacrament)</hi> I meane the whole ministration and receiuyng of the Sacramētes, either of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, or of the Lordes Supper, and so the old writers many tymes doe say, that Christ and the holy Ghost be present in the Sacramentes, not meanyng by that maner of speach, that Christ and the holy Ghost be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the water, bread, or wine (which be onely the outward visible Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes (but that in the due ministration of the Sacramentes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to Christes ordinaunce and institution, Christ and his holy spirite be truely and in deede present by their mightie and sanctifiyng power, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and grace, in all them that worthely receiue the same.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, when I say and repeat many tymes in my book, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the body of Christ is present in them that worthely receaue the Sacrament,<note place="margin">Christes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiuer.</note> least any man should mystake my woordes, and thinke that I meane, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Christ be not corporally in the outward visible signes, yet hee is corporally in the persons that duely receiue them, this is to aduertise the Reader, that I meane no such thyng, but my meanyng is, that the force, the grace, the vertue and benefite of Christes body that was Crucified for vs, and of his bloud that was shed for vs, be really, and effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with all them that duely receaue the Sacramentes, but all this I vnderstand of his spirituall presence, of the which he sayth, I will be with you vntill the worldes ende. And wheresoeuer two or three be gathered together in my name, there am I in the myddest of them.<note place="margin">Math. 6. Math. 18.</note> And hee that eateth my fleshe and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in him. Nor no more truely is he corporally or really present in the due ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lordes Supper,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> than hee is in the due ministration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme: That is to say, in both spiritually by grace. And wheresoeuer in the Scripture it is sayd that Christ, God or the holy Ghost is in any man, the same is vnderstand spiritually by grace.</p>
   <p>The thyrd thyng to admonish the Reader of is this, that when I name
<pb facs="3"/>
Doctour Stephen Gardiner Byshop of Winchester,<note place="margin">The naming of the late Bishop of Winchester.</note> I meane not that he is so now, but forasmuch as he was Byshop of Winchester at the tyme when he wrote his booke agaynst me, therfore I aunswere his booke as written by the Byshop of Winchester, whiche els needed greatly none aunswere for any great learnyng or substaunce of matter that is in it.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">The reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Chryst should proue no Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of the bread and wine.</note>The last admonition to the Reader is this, where the sayd late Byshop thinketh that he hath sufficiently proued Transubstantiation, (that is to say, that the substaunce of bread and wine can not be in the Sacrament, if the body and bloud of Christ were there) bycause two bodyes can not be togethers in one place, although the truth be, that in the Sacrament of Christes bodye, there is corporallye but the substaunce of bread onelye, and in the Sacrament of the bloud, the substaunce of wine onelye, yet how farre hee is deceiued, and doth vary from the doctrine of other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, and also from the principles of Philosophy (whiche he taketh for the foundation of his doctrine in this point) the Reader hereby may ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue. For if we speake of Gods power, the Papistes affirme, that by Gods power, two bodyes may be together in one place, and then why may not Christes bloud be with the wyne in the cup, and his fleshe in the same place where the substaunce of the bread is? And if we consider the cause wherfore two bodyes can not be together in one place by the rules of nature, it shall euidently appeare, that the body of Christ may rather be in one place with the substaunce of the bread, thē with the accidents ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and so likewise his bloud with the wine. For the naturall cause wherfore two bodyes can not be together in one place (as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers say) is their accidentes, their bignes, and thicknes, and not their substaunces. And then by the very order of nature it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth more y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> body of Christ should be present w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes of bread, and his bloud with the accidentes of wyne, then with the substaunces either of bread or wyne. This shall suffice for the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to the Reader, ioynyng thereto the Preface in my first booke, whiche is this:</p>
