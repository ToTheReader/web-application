And therefore I haue made bold hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to present it vnto your Honourable protection, and noble admission, to doe your selfe its first service; that from this hill of SION, unto the valleyes of the same; the streams therof running downe, as a riuer of still waters, may refresh, and make glad the City of GOD.</p>
