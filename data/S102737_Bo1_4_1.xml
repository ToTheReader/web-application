      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all the treatises sent ouer within
these twentie yeares from the Papists,
there is none in which appeareth lesse
learning and modesty, nor greater ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance
and impudencie, then in this
one Booke of Martiall. Who, as he
tearmeth him selfe a Bacheler of Lawe, so more like a
wrangling petty fogger in the Lawe, then a sober Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in Diuinitie, doth in a manner nothing else, but
cauil, quarel, and scolde. Which as it were an easie
matter to wype away with a sharpe answere, for him
that would bestowe his time therein: so I thinke it
for my parte neither needefull nor profitable. The
memory of that godly learned man Maister Doctor
Calfhill whome he abuseth, is written in the Booke of
the righteous, and shall not be afraide of any slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
reporte. Omitting therefore all friuolous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
I will onely endeuour to answere that whiche
hath in it any shewe of reason or argument to defende
the idolatry of the Papistes.</p>
   <p>In which matter also, as many thinges are the same
which are already satisfied in my confutation of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
Sanders Booke of Images: so I will referre the
reader to those Chapters of that treatise, where he shal
<pb n="123" facs="64"/>
finde y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> which I hope shal suffice, for the ouerthrowe of
Idolatry. This reply, as the first treatise, is diuided into
ten articles, all which in order I will set downe, with
such titles, as he giueth vnto them. But first I must
say a fewe wordes concerning his request made to
the Bishop of London, and the rest of the superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes
of the newe Church, as it pleaseth him to call
them, and his preface to the reader. His request is, that
the Bishops should certifie him by some pamphlete
in printe, whether 61. articles which he hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
out of Maister Calfhils booke, be the receyued
and approoued doctrine of the newe Churche of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
able to be iustified by the worde of God, and the
Fathers, and Councels within sixe hundreth yeares
after Christ? How wise a man he is, in making this
request, I leaue to reasonable men to iudge.</p>
   <p>And touching the articles themselues, I aunswere,
that some of them be such, as the Church of England
doth holde and openly professe, as that Latine seruice,
Monkish vowes, the communion in one kinde, &amp;c. are
contrary to Gods worde, the other be particular affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiōs
of Maister Calfhil, which in such sense as he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
them, may be iustified for true, and yet perteyne
not to the whole Church to mainteine and defende, as
whether Helaena were superstitious in seeking y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> crosse
at Ierusalem, whether Dionyse and Fabian were the
one suspected, the other infamed, &amp;c. beside that a
great number of them be so rent from the whole sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
whereof they were partes, that they reteyne
not the meaning of the author, but serue to shewe the
impudencie of the cauiller. As that the counsels of
Christe in his Gospel, be ordinances of the Deuill, the
prayers of Christians a sacrifice of the deuill, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Elibeus was a generall councell, &amp;c. Wherfore
I will leaue this fond request, with all the rayling that
followeth there vppon, and come to the preface, to the
Reader. First he findeth himselfe greatly greeued, that
not only ancient fathers are by M. Calfhil discredited,
<pb n="123" facs="64"/>
but also the holy crosse is likened to a gallowes, &amp;c.
which moued him to follow Salomons counsell, &amp; to
answer a foole according to his folly. After this he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vpon him to cōfute M. Calfhils preface, in which
he proueth, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> no images should be in churches to any
vse of religion, because God forbiddeth them, Exo. 20.
&amp; Leuit. 19 in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> first table of religion. His reply stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
only vpon those common foolishe distinctions of
Idols &amp; Images, of Latria &amp; Doulia, which are han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
more at large &amp; with greater shewe of learning
by D Sander in his booke of Images. Cap. 5. 6. 7. 8. whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I refer y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> reader for answer. Likewise, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> discourse
which he maketh, to proue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> an image of Christ is not
a lying image, is answered in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same booke, Cap. 7.
The authoritie of Epiphanius, he deferreth to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> 5. article. To Irenaeus he answereth, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he
only reporteth, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the Gnostike heretikes had y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> image
of Iesus, but reproueth not y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> fact. But he reproued
them only because they placed the image of Christ w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
the images of Plato, Pithagoras, &amp;c. vsed them as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
Gentyles do. This were in deed a pretie exception for
a brabling lawyer to take: but a student in diuinitie
should vnderstand that Irenaeus in y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> book &amp; Chapter
li. 1. Ca. 24. declareth no fact of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> heretiks y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> was good,
but his declaration is a reproof. And so it is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that whole booke conteining 35. Chapters.</p>
   <p>But he chargeth M. Calfhill for falsifying Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,
in sayng, that he alloweth M. Varro affirming
<hi>that religion is moste pure without images,</hi> first quarre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at the quotation, which by errour of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is <hi>de ciuitate Dei, lib. 4. Cap.</hi> 3. where it should be <hi>Cap.</hi>
31. a meete quarrell for such a lawyer: secondly
shewing that the Latine is <hi>Castius obseruari sine simula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chris
religionem, that religion woulde haue beene more pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kept without Idols or fayned Images:</hi> as though there
be anye Images but fayned, and the worde <hi>Imago,</hi>
euen in their owne Latine translation of the Bible,
is indifferently taken for <hi>Idolum</hi> and <hi>simulachrum,</hi>
      <pb n="124" facs="65"/>
and that in many places, Deut. 4. ver. 16. 4. Reg. 11. ver.
18, Sapient Cap. 13. &amp; 14. Esai. 40. ver. 18. &amp; 44. ver. 13.
Ezec. 7. vers. 20 where <hi>imagines &amp; simulachra</hi> are both
placed together Ezech. 16. Ca. 17. Amos. 5. ver. 23. wher
he sayeth, <hi>Imaginem idolorum,</hi> the image of your Idols:
and many other places declare, that this counterfait
distinction was not obserued, no not of the Latine
interpreter. As for his other logicall quiddity, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he pleaseth him selfe not a little, that <hi>religio non sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit
magis &amp; minus,</hi> sheweth that eyther his lawe is
better then his Logike, or else both are not worth a
strawe.</p>
   <p>Further he chargeth M. Calfehill for adding words
which are not founde in Augustine, <hi>where images are
placed in temples, in honourable sublimitie, &amp;c.</hi> These wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
are founde in the <hi>Ep. 49 ad Deogratias: Cum hiis lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantur
sedibus, honorabili sublimitate, vt a praecantibus atque
immolantib{us} attendantur,</hi> when they are placed in these
seates, in honourable sublimitie, that they are looked
vpon by them that praye and offer, &amp;c. But Martiall
looked onely to the quotation, Ps. 36. &amp;113. Yet doeth
not M. Calfhill rehearse the wordes, but the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Augustine, from which he doth nothing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
except Martiall will cauill at the wordes, images
in temples, where Augustine sayeth: <hi>Idola hiis sedibus,</hi>
Idoles in these seates, speaking of temples, in which
images were placed. But he speaketh (saith Martiall)
in the Psalmes, against the images of the heathen, and
not of the Christians. Then reade what he writeth
<hi>De moribus ecclesiae Catholicae, lib. 1. Cap. 34. &amp; de consensu
Euangelist. lib. 1. Cap.</hi> 10. where you shall finde his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of such images, as were made of Christians, to
be all one with those of the Gentiles. The iudgement
of other doctours, whome he nameth, you shall finde
aunswered in the 14. or 13. Chapter of Master Sanders
booke of Images. That the Iewes had no images in
their temple, he sayth, it is a Iewish and Turkish rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to proue that we should haue none. Much like y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      <pb n="125" facs="65"/>
priest that would not beleeue in Christe, if he knewe
that he were a Iewe. So wise he is, to compare the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
of the wicked Turkes, with the obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the lawe by the godly Iewes. Nay, hee is yet
more eloquent, and sheweth that the Protestantes are
like the Turkes, in condemning of images, in allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
marriage after deuorce, &amp;c. as though we might
not acknowledge one God, lest we should be like the
Turkes and Iewes, nor honour vertue, nor dispraise
vice, because they do so, nor obey magistrates, nor
eat and drinke, because the Turkes and Iewes doe so.
O deepe learning of a lawyer diuine.</p>
   <p>That Images do not teach, he sayeth it is a position
more boldly aduouched, then wisely proued, &amp; then
quoteth Gregorie, Ep. 9. lib. 9. &amp;c. but he is deceiued, if
he thinke we holde, that images teach not: for we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
with the Prophet Abacuc, that they teache lyes,
Cap. 2. ver. 18. &amp; vanitie, Ier. 10. ver. 8.</p>
   <p>As for the story of Amadis the Goldsmith, and the
Epistle of Eleutherius fetched out of the guild hall in
London, as M. Calfhill maketh no great accompt of
them, so I passe them ouer, although Martiall would
haue men thinke, they be the strongest arguments the
Protestants haue, against the superstition of the crosse
and the vsurped tyrannie of the Pope.</p>
   <p>Finally, the excuse he maketh of his railing, by M.
Calfhils example, how honest it is, I referre to wise
men to consider. If M. Calfhill had passed the bondes
of modestie, it were small praise in Martiall to follow
him, yea, to passe him. But if M. Calfhill (as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ay thinke) hath not greatly exceeded in
termes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eate against Martials person, whatsoeuer
he hath spoken against his heresies, the continuall
scorning, both of M. Calfhils name and his person,
vsed so often in euery leafe of his reply, in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all reasonable persons, will cause Martiall to
be taken for a lawlesse wrangler, rather then a sober
and Christian lawyer.</p>
