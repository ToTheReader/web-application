      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD Reader, after that I had yeelded to the publishing of mine owne poore meditations vpon <hi>1. COR. 11.23.</hi> there came to my hands in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, this ensuing trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, written some yeeres since by a godly &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pastor, for the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his owne people,
<pb facs="79"/>
in the worthie receiuing of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, at what time hee was first called vnto them. In the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usall whereof, I being in my selfe well perswaded of the fulnesse and perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitie of that doctrine of Preparation, which it propoundeth to intreat of, the orderlie method of euerie part thereof, the plaine and familiar han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling of the matter, and that it did supplie many
<pb facs="79"/>
needfull points of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that are wanting in mine owne Treatise, I was earnest with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to giue mee leaue to publish the same, and to adioin it as an ornament and helpe vnto mine; which with much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie at length I haue obtained; though in the hard and vniust conceit he intertaineth of it, hee suffers, it in this sort as you see to, come abroad as a Childe of the Earth,
<pb facs="80"/>
without any mention of his name from whom it is descended.</p>
   <p>For the spirituall good that thou shalt receiue thereby, blesse the Lord; and pray for the Author, that God would restore him again to that former libertie in his Church, which heeretofore, to the glorie of God, and the comfort of many a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian soule, hee hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioied.</p>
