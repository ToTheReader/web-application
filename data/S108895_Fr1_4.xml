   <head>THE PROLOGVE TO THE <hi>CHRISTIAN READER.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>IKE AS the tastes and iudgementes of writers haue bin diuerse (good Christian Reader) euen so the matters and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherof they haue treated, haue bin also diuers. Some there haue bin, which being affectionated vnto the beauty of eloquence, haue imployed themselues to frame a perfect Orator, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him from his childhood, and leading him through all the steps and degrees of that facultie, vntill they haue brought him vnto the highest perfection of the same. Others haue indeuoured after the like sort to forme a perfect Prince, others a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, others a Courtiour. And thus hath each one trauailed to extoll and aduance that thing with his penne which hee moste esteemed. Now of this are wee right well
<pb n="30" facs="16"/> assured, that among all the thinges of this world, there is nothing of greater price &amp; estimation, nothing more excellent &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, than a perfect Christian. The which as he is ordained vnto a supernaturall end, so the life which hee liueth is also superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall: for which cause hee is called of the Holy Fathers a heauenly man, or an earthly angell. Wherefore sith that our faculties (which are so much inferiour to this facultie, as their end is inferiour to the end of this) haue had writers which with so great dilligence haue set forth whatsoeuer seemed necessarie vnto the perfection of them, euen from the first beginning vntill the latter ending, how much more conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient were it that the like diligence shuld not bee wanting in this heauenly professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the which as it is of higher dignitie thā all other professions, so is it a harder mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to apprehend it exactly, and therefore hath more need to bee set forth and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of. Now this is the thing (good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader) which I haue so many yeares desired: to wit, to see some booke that should treat particularly how to forme a perfect Christian, &amp; that might containe a briefe some of all such things as doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto the profession of this heauē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="33" facs="16"/> life. For like as good Artificers doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to haue all such tooles and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as belong to their occupation, and as those that studie any Arte or Science doe seeke to haue some booke wherein is contained whatsoeuer concerneth that sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that hauing ech thing set in order to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one place, their memory might the lesse be distracted, euen some thought it was very requisite to doe the like in this profession, which is the Arte of Artes, and Science of Sciences: to the ende that all such as desire to serue almighty God (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this commoditie readie framed to their hands) might very easlie finde out an instruction and light, to direct their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and that the Ghostly Fathers, &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Preachers, which are zealous of the Christian common weale, might also haue without any great charge whether to referre their ghostly children, and hearers, and such as come vnto them for counsell, to vnderstand whatsoeuer belongeth to their profession.</p>
   <p>I knowe this right well that there want not for this purpose at this daie a number of books which doe conteine verie sound and Catholique doctrine: howbeit for the greater part of thē they do attend to some
<pb n="34" facs="17"/> one particuler matter and will not binde them selues to treate in a small volume of all such matters as doe concerne a perfect christian life. And albeit that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Catechismes (which are sommes or abridgements of the Christian Doctrine) doe treat of euerie thinge that appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the same, yet for so much as these haue respecte to declare the substance of thinges, and such as belong to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing thereof, the doctrine of such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techismes apperteineth rather to specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to practise: I meane hereby, that such doctrine tendeth rather to giue light to the vnderstanding than to moue the will vnto the exercise &amp; vse of vertue.</p>
   <p>Now for this cause I haue determined with the grace of god and helpe of the writings of the Holy Fathers, who in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers partes of their writinges haue hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all these argumentes, together out of them all this booke, wherin is treated of al these matters.<note place="margin">What the intention of the Author is in this booke.</note> In which booke I meane to forme a perfecte christian, trayning him throughout the passages and exercises of this life, euen frō the beginning of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion vntil he come vnto the end of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And in doing this I make account that I take it in hand so rough, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought,
<pb n="35" facs="17"/> as if one should hewe it downe in the wood with his boughes and barke, and should beginne to labour vpon it by litle and litle vntill he bring it vnto his due perfection. For the performance wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of, in the firste treatise<note place="margin">The first Treatise.</note> I set before him paradise, and hell, and the greate bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites which doe accompanie vertue: and withall the boūden dutie he oweth to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the same, that by this meane he may be induced to make a firme determination with him selfe to forsake sin, and returne vnto the seruice of his Lord, and creator. Afterwardes presupposing this resolute determination in him, forsomuch as the entrie vnto this waie is by the Sacrament of pennance, I teach him in the second treatise<note place="margin">The second Treatise.</note> after what sort he ought to do pē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for his sins: wher are set forth many considerations, and praiers, that serue to moue him to an earnest sorow and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring of the sins &amp; offences of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life. And there is also an instruction to teach him how to confesse him selfe of them, and how to satisfie almyghty God with due satisfaction. After confession, ther followeth the receuing of the most blessed sacrament of the Aulter, &amp; so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth immediatly the third treatise,<note place="margin">The third Treatise.</note> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="36" facs="18"/> he is taught after what sort he ought to prepare himselfe to communicate worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and what things are requisite thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, with prayers also which are to be said both before and after hee hath receaued the most blessed Sacrament. When hee hath receaued these SACRAMENTES, it followeth forth with that he doe amend his life: and therefore I haue adioyned the fourth treatise,<note place="margin">The fourth Treatise.</note> which handleth the same matter: And forsomuch as there be some Christians that content them-selues with dooing only that which is of necessitie to be done for their saluation: &amp; some others also that will passe more forward, &amp; walke to perfection, (the which persons not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contented with the charge of the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, will lay moreouer vpon thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues another charge of such thinges as are taught in the gospell by way of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell only,) therfore I haue set forth in that treatise two rules of good life, the one is commō for the first sort, the other is strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more spirituall for the other sorte. And because no man can eyther beginne or perseuer in good life without the helpe of the grace of God, the which is obtained by meanes of prayer, therefore I haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the instructions &amp; rules of
<pb n="37" facs="18"/> good life treated of praier. Now whereas there bee two kindes of prayer, the one which is pronounced with the voice, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>vocall prayer:</hi> the other which is conceaued in the minde, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>mentall prayer:</hi> of the first I haue treated in the fifth treatise,<note place="margin">The fifth treatise.</note> where are set out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Vocall prayers seruing for diuers pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and vses of a Christian mans life: and there are also declared the conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to a good prayer: but of the second kinde, which is <hi>mentall prayer,</hi> I haue hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the sixt treatise,<note place="margin">The sixth treatise.</note> where I treate onely of the matter of this kind of prayer, which is the consideration of the principall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the life of our Sauiour Christ, &amp; of the benifits of Almighty God: For as touching the rest that appertaineth to this argument, we haue already treated in our <hi>booke of prayer and meditation.</hi> After all this there remayneth nothing els but to arriue vnto perfection, (the which consisteth in the loue of God)<note place="margin">The perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a christian consisteth in the loue of God.</note> and of this I haue treated in the seauenth and last treatise,<note place="margin">The seauēth Treatise.</note> wherein all such things are declared as serue to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this supreame vertue, as those also which doe hinder it. And there be more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer set forth certaine considerations, and praiers, wherein he ought to exercise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="38" facs="19"/> for the obtaining of the same vertue.</p>
   <p>This is now Christian reader the course of all the Christian life, deuided into theise seauen iourneis, whereunto may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced whatsoeuer this heauenly philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie teacheth vs.</p>
   <p>And for somuch as the foure first treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses do conteine doctrine cōcering things that ought to be done, and the other three that followe doe serue rather for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of praier, and of the loue of god, (the which be such thinges as a man ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to haue in his handes) I thought it good therefore to deuide this whole book into two volumes: to the ende that euerie man might alwaies carry with him in hys bosome the second volume without anie great burden, being so necessarie as it is for all times and places, and because all these matters are treated here briefly: it seemed to me very conuenient to call this booke a MEMORIALT,<note place="margin">Why this booke is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall.</note> as wherein a man vseth to write such thinges as hee hath to doe in a briefe sort. And yet the briefenes of this booke is not such, but that it containeth all such thinges as seeme necessarie for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the same.</p>
   <p>True it is, that the matter of this booke is very copious and plentifull, wherein
<pb n="39" facs="19"/> there be many thinges to be said, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worthy to bee committed to writing, but these many remaine for other writers. And yet in case it shall please Almightie God to prolong a little while the time of my life, (which so swiftly runneth away in post, I may thē handle more at large some parts of this booke, especially the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to good life, and the rules of good life, and the treatise of the loue of God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the treatise of the life of our Sauiour Christ. And albeit, the thing wee pretend here to doe, (which is to forme a perfect Christian) bee properly the worke of the holy ghost, yet neuerthelesse like as grace excludeth not our trauaile &amp; indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie, but must rather of necessity concurre therewith, euen so the inward instruction of Almighty God excludeth not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teaching of men,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>verse.</hi> 12. <hi>Malac.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.</note> but doth of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie require the same. The which office particularly appertaineth vnto the Priests and Pastours of the Catholicke Church, vnto whome Almighty God referreth vs, that they should teache and informe vs in his law. And therefore among the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vestiments of the high Priestes, there was one that was called the <hi>Rationall,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rationall.</note> (the which was put vppon his breast) wherein
<pb n="40" facs="20"/> were written these wordes, <hi>Doctrina, &amp; Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas: doctrine &amp; truth:</hi> the which two things should be in the breast of Aaron,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Leuit.</hi> 8.8.</note> to the end that from thence, as from a principall fountaine they might bee deriued vnto all the others. And this is so principall an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that Moyses reserued it only for him selfe,<note place="margin">

      </note> because thou hast cast away the science and knowledge of thy law, I will also cast thee away, that thou shalt serue me no more in the office of Priesthood, and for a most grieuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment Almighty God threatned them by hys Prophet Esay these kinde of scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, saying: that by reason of their great sinnes, <hi>he would punish them with a strange and terrible punishment, which should bee, that the
<pb n="41" facs="20"/> wisedome of the wise should perish, and the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the sagest among the people should bee obscured.</hi> Now as the want of knowledge in the superiours is here delared to be one of the greatest scourges &amp; terriblest plagues of God: euen so also in the want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the inferiours, no lesse plague and punishment of God:<note place="margin">The light of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And that this is the cause thereof, all the holy Scriptures doe clearely witnesse vnto vs. Almighty God sayth by the Prophet Esay: <hi>This people is not wise,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Esa.</hi> 27.21</note>
      <hi>and therefore hee that created them shall not take pitty vppon them, neyther shall hee that formed them pardon them.</hi> And in an other place. <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>was my people made captiue,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Esay.</hi> 5.13</note>
      <hi>because they had no knowledge, and their nobles died for hunger, and the multitude of them perished for thirste.</hi> The very same is confirmed by the Prophet Baruche, saying: that the cause of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity of the children of Israel,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Baruche.</hi> 3 <hi>Verse</hi> 12.</note> and of their wandring through the lands of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, was <hi>for that they had forsaken the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="42" facs="21"/> of wisedome.</hi> And vnto this very cause he attributeth the commendation of the Giants, saying: that <hi>because they had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they perished through their ignorance.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Baruc.</hi> 3.28</note> For remedy whereof S. Paul writeth vnto the Colossians,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Clo.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 16</note> that the word and doctrine of Christ, should bee plentifully preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and that one should teach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and admonish them of such things as they ought to doe. Wherfore sith there is no office (be it neuer so base) but that it needeth some rules and preceptes to haue it well and rightly discharged, how much more need hath this office, being the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of all other offices, which is to knowe how to please and serue almighty God, to obtaine the kingdome of heauen, and to preuaile against the forces &amp; wily deceites of our enemie the diuell? How shall a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnlearned man vnderstand how much this matter importeth him,<note place="margin">How neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary this booke is.</note> if there bee not laide before him the promises and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of almighty God, and the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits also for which hee is bound to serue him? How shall he know how to confesse his sinnes perfectly, if he be not instructed in the parts of the sacrament of Pennance, and how hee ought to behaue himselfe in euery one of them? How shall he bee sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
<pb n="43" facs="21"/> and repentant for his sins, if there be not delared vnto him the reasons and causes that should moue him to be sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them? How shall he communicate and receaue the moste blessed Sacrament worthely, to the comfort and profit of his soule, if he be not taught those things that belong thereunto? How shall hee knowe which way to order hys life, to obtaine vertues, and to eschew vices, if hee know not the meanes whereby he ought to seek for the one, to resist the other, and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the temptations and snares of the enemie? How shall hee make any prayer that shall be fruitfull vnto him, &amp; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with such conditions, and vertues: as be required thereunto, if hee haue not some instructiō to teach him how to pray? How shall hee obtaine the loue of God, if he know not the meanes wherby it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the impediments and lets that doe hinder him from it, and the exercises wherein he ought to exercise himselfe for the obtayning thereof? Of all this light we stand in great need for all these thinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, sithence wee bring them not with vs from our mothers wombe, but wee are rather borne in such wise, that we may wel be figured by that man in the Gospel, who

   <p>And although it be the office of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Preachers to cure this blindnes with the light of Gods word: yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding these be not euery where to be foūd, neyther doe all Preachers treat of these so necessary matters, nor yet can they vvell (speaking generally) descend to such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities, as this morall doctrine requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.

      <note place="margin">A notable Historie of the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Courtier.</note>
      <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> telleth, that a certeine gentleman of Aphrike called <hi>Poticianus</hi> comming one daie to visite him, told him of the wounderfull reportes that went throughout the world of the blessed holie man Saint Anthonie: And saide moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that in an Euening when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was in the Citie of Treuers, occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the beholding of certaine pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like games that were there shewed, hee with three other Gentlemen of the Court his familiar friendes, went abroade to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace themselues in the fieldes, and two of them went a little a side vnto a Monkes Cell, and finding there a booke wherein was written the life of Saint <hi>Anthonie,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Hereby ye may see what profit commeth by reading of Saints liues.</note> one of them began to read it, and beholde in a a moment he felt his hart so inkindled with a holy loue, &amp; mooued with such a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="47" facs="23"/> shame, that beeing in a great agonie with himselfe, he said vnto his other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. Deare friend, tell me I pray thee, what is that we go about to obtaine by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing all this our trauaile and industrie? What doe we seeke after? To what ende doe we turmoile our selues so many yeres, fighting in so many Skirmishes, and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy battels? Is it possible that wee shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to any greater dignity in the Court, than to be in the Emperours fauour? And admit that wee doe at the length attaine thereunto, is there any thing in that state of life that is not very fickle, &amp; dangerous? And yet to come to so perrillous a state, by how many other perrils must wee passe by the vvay? But if I will indeuour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the friendship of Almighty God, I may haue it forth with without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay. When hee had spoken these wordes, beeing greatly troubled with the considerations of framing a new kinde of life, he cast his eyes very often vppon the booke, and read forward therein, and by reading, was altogether inwardly so chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that hee resolued fully with himselfe to forsake all worldly thinges, as soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it plainly appeared. For afterwardes when he had made an end of reading, and
<pb n="48" facs="24"/> feeling in his hart diuers and sundry vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment motions, at the length with a great sigh hee said vnto his companion.</p>
   <p>Now am I at reste and quietnes. I haue determined vtterlye to forsake all our Courtly hopes; and to giue my selfe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto the seruice of Almighty God, and to remaine from henceforth in this place. If thou (my deare friend) be not minded to follow me, yet of curtesie I beseech thee goe not about to hinder me therein. The other Courtier answered, that hee coulde not forsake him, neyther would he faile to keep him company, considering that there was hope thereby of so great reward. And so these two Courtly Gentlemen began to reare vp a spirituall building with charges enough, to wit, with forsaking all thinges of this world, and only to follow Christ, &amp; that which is no lesse to bee maruailed at, both these two Courtiers had their espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to whome they were affienced in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, who so soone as they vnderstood ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, consecrated themselues vnto God, and made a vow of chastitie. This History S. Augustine telleth, and this example was of so great efficacie vnto himselfe, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the recitall thereof being meruailously mooued therewith, hee cryed out vnto a hard
<pb n="49" facs="24"/> certaine familiar friend of his saying: what doe wee? What is this vvhich thou haste heard. The ignorant rise vp, and steale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way heauen from vs, and wee with all our great learning and knowledge, goe vp and downe drowned in flesh and blood. And being in this alteration, and inward griefe, the holy man Saint Augustine saith, that he went into a garden, which he had neare vnto that place, where hee caste himselfe downe vnderneath a figge tree, and with much weeping, and trouble of minde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to cry out, saying.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 6.</note> And thou O Lord how long? how long wilt thou bee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with me? shall thine anger neuer haue an end?<note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 87.</note> Remember not O Lord our olde iniquities! And hee repeated very often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time these wordes: how long O Lorde! how long! To morrow, and why not euen now out of hand? Wherefore shall not mine vncleannesse haue an end this day? And in saying these words with great bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse of minde, hee heard a voice that said: Take, read: take, read. And with that he saieth that hee rose vp to take a Holie booke, that lay by him to read therevpon. For hee had heard tell of the same S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony, how he hearing the Ghospell read, which saith.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.2</note>
      <hi>Vade &amp; vinde omnia que ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,

      <hi>&amp; habebis thesaurum in caelo, &amp; veni sequere me.</hi> That is to say: <hi>goe thy way, and sell all that thou haste, and giue it to the poore, and thou shalt haue a treasure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and come and follow me:</hi> was forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to forsake all thinges of the world, and to follow Christ.<note place="margin">The cōuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of saint Augustine.</note>
      <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> then beeing mooued with this example, but rather with the voice which he had heard, saith that he tooke the booke, and began to read in it. And almighty God powred there so great a light of grace into him, that he forsooke all that euer he had in the world, and gaue himselfe wholly vnto the seruice of Almighty God. All this Saint Augustine writeth in his eight booke of Confessions: whereby yee may see how many notable conuersions euen of famous holy men haue had their first beginning by reading of holy bookes. As here ye see the conuersion of those friendes of Potiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, and the conuersion of blessed S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, and the conuersion of the same S. Anthonie, vnto the which also might be ioyned many other conuersions, as well of such as are past, as of such as bee presentlie aliue at this day: the which had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the very same cause. But I leaue the rehearsall of these for breuities
<pb n="51" facs="25"/> sake. For vndoubtedly the misteries which the Christian religion setteth forth vnto men are such, &amp; so great, and of such force to moue their hearts, that I meruaile no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, if they make so great changes and alterations in such persons, as do with attention consider them. And this read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of holy bookes helpeth not only to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake such as are a sleepe in sinne, (as yee haue seene here before, (but also to keepe such as are already awaked from sleeping And therefore the word of God is called in all the holy Scriptures bread, or foode,<note place="margin">The word of God is called bread or food.</note> because it sustaineth and preserueth our soules in the spirituall life,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Deu</hi> 8. <hi>ve.</hi> 3 <hi>Sap.</hi> 16.26. <hi>Hie.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.4.</note> as the materiall bread sustaineth our bodies in the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life.</p>
   <p>And albeit that this spirituall food hath beene at all times very necessary (as the breade of our life) yet is it much more needfull now in these our corrupt dayes. For in old time in the Primitiue Church, the Priestes and Curates were so feruent and carefull in preaching of the worde of God, that that might suffice to preserue &amp; increase the faithful people in vertue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other reading: but now alas, the Priestes, and euen such as haue cure of soules, doe beleeue that they are bound to
<pb n="52" facs="26"/> nothing els, but onely to minister the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and to say a Masse at their time appointed, &amp; herewith they content them selues for the moste part in villages, and townes,<note place="margin">Both townes and Citties haue in this our corrupt age to many lewd bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: but the Author complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the great wante of good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Preachers.</note> yea, and in some populous Citties also. Wherefore the greater the want is that we haue at this daie in this behalfe, the greater neede wee haue to supplie the want of good Catholicke Pastors and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, with good and deuout bookes.</p>
   <p>Take therefore good Christian reader, this small present, the which may in a little volume, and with a small charge supply in part this defect. For it may serue thee for a Preacher, to exhort thee vnto good life, for an instruction, to teach thee howe to lead a good life: for a confessionall, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct thee, how thou oughtest to confesse thy sinnes, and to make due preparation, when thou intendest to communicate, and receaue the most blessed Sacrament of the Aultar: It may serue also for a booke of deuotion, wherein thou mayest exercise thy selfe in praier, &amp; it giueth thee moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer abundance of matter for meditation: in which pointes are comprehended the some of Christian Philosophie. And if this Memoriall be worthy of commendation, it is for that it containeth matters so vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall,
<pb n="53" facs="26"/> that it treateth of all such thinges as doe appertaine to all Christians whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be, aswell to the beginners, as to those that haue proceeded further in the spirituall life, and are come to some perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And if the fruit that shall be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hereof, shalbe so great as my diligence and trauile hath bin in gathering all these matters together, &amp; in setting them forth in so plaine and easie a stile, to prouoke the appetites of such as are weake (vnto whom sometimes I direct my speech) I shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all my labour and paines to be very well employed. For so much as no bodily labor can be so great, that it may counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with the least profit that ariseth in spirituall thinges.</p>
