   <head>¶TO
THE MOST HIGH
and mightie Prince our King
and fouereigne, Don Iohn, the
third of that name, king
of Portingale, and of
the Algarues,
&amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath séemed to me so straunge and
waightie a thing (most high &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Prince our king and Souereigne)
to vndertake to write of the most
worthy and valyaunt acts which the
<hi>Portingales</hi> haue enterprised in the
discouery and conquest of the <hi>Indias,</hi>
that oftentimes I thought to giue
ouer and relinquish the same, but as the attempt and dooing
thereof was principally taken in hande for the glorye of
Almightye God, and to conuert those barbarous Nations
to the Christian Faith, and the great honour of your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
wherein God gaue them (by his Omnipotent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
fauour and mercye (such fortunate successe in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuing
of those famous actes, without whose great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
it coulde neuer haue béene performed or brought
to passe. And therefore doe hope and altogether comfort
my selfe with the ayde and assistaunce of his diuine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in publishing the same by writing, yéelding the
glorie thereof onely to his celestiall Godhead, and the
<pb facs="4"/>
praise terestriall vnto your excellent highnesse, and to
that famous and most happie king, <hi>Don Manuel</hi> your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And although the same be well knowne and spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
ouer all the worlde, yet it cannot be so perfectlye
published vnlesse it bée set forth in writing. For by this
meanes the memorie thereof will indure for euer, because
that the writings will alwayes shew the same to bée pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
Like as it doth continue those actes of the Gréeks, and
of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the which long since is past so many
yeares. And therefore they lyke wise men, perceiuing the
same to be true, did trauaile all that was possible to leaue
the memorie thereof by writing, and noting that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
of the same did consist much in the eloquence of
the writer, did therefore choose such excellent learned men
as those were that wrote the same, béeing thereto aided
with much fauour and helpe, of others that were nothing
inferior vnto theyr own, &amp; possible were far greater, but for
that the same did not remaine in writing, there is no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
thereof, euen as those of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
of the <hi>Persians,</hi> of the <hi>Affricans</hi> against the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
of the <hi>Sweuians</hi> against <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Moores in the recouerye of their Countrey of
<hi>Spayne.</hi> Principallye of those inuincible and holye
Kinges of <hi>Portingale</hi> your auncestours, the King <hi>Don
Alonso Henriques,</hi> the King <hi>Don Sancho</hi> his sonne, the
King <hi>Don Alonso,</hi> the which did gettte the Kingdome
of <hi>Portingale,</hi> and of the <hi>Algarues,</hi> in the which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
there was wonderfull greate actes done, and that
by force of Armes. Of all the which almost there hath
remayned no memorie of that there shoulde haue béene,
yea, those matters of the <hi>Indyas,</hi> the which was done
but yesterdaye, there is no man that hath the same in
memorye more then foure personnes, so that if they had
dyed, all the same hadde ended with them, the which
woulde haue béene imputed to theyr greate shame and
rebuke.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
And I hauing a regarde, and partlye a remorse to sée this
losse, did therefore determine my selfe to note of those no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
actes, the which your subiects hath done in the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
and Conquest of the <hi>Indias,</hi> of whose valiauntnesse
there is none of theyr progenitours of any age or antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
that euer did excéede them, no, nor yet were equall
with them. For leauing a side the Conquest of the <hi>Semy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
of <hi>Cyro, Pirhus,</hi> and of other barbarous, all (the
which was nothing in comparison of this) and take amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
them also that great <hi>Alexander</hi> the which was so fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and wondred at throughout all the world, since that the
<hi>Indias</hi> is frequented by the <hi>Portingales:</hi> theyr dooings are
no more meruailed at, then a dead Lyon in respect of one
aliue, for the Conquest of <hi>Alexander</hi> was all by lande,
and against people that were smallie accustomed or tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the feates of warres, hée alwayes going in his roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
person, but this of the <hi>Indias</hi> was done by sea, and that
by your Captaines, béeing vpon the same a whole yeare,
and eight monethes, and at the least sixe monethes, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
or néere any coast, but by the bottomelesse and great
Ocean Sea, and departing from the lymites of the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
and bearing sayle alwayes towarde the Cape <hi>De
las Playas,</hi> or such lyke, without discouering or séeing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other thing, but onelye the heauens and water, going
round about all the Spheare, a matter neuer before at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
by anye mortall man, nor yet almost imagined
by anye, to put the same in practise, and they hauing past
greate hunger, thirst and other infirmityes, besides that
euerye day with those furious stormes and raines, in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
a thousand times of their liues. And as I say, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
past those feares and daungerous troubles by sea, yet
after theyr arriual into the <hi>Indias,</hi> found thēselues in great
and cruell battells, (not with men that did sight onely with
their Bowes, Arrowes, and Speares,) as they didde in
<hi>Alexanders</hi> time, but with such as were stout &amp; of a hauty
stomacke, and with men that were experienced in the wars,
<pb facs="5"/>
of the which kinde of people there is not onely in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi>
but as farre as we can vnderstand, there is of the like
in <hi>Asia,</hi> and besides theyr accustomed weapons (the which
are many and good) yet they haue Ordinaunce, Calée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
and many fire-workes more plentie then the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingales</hi>
had, so that the power of these men was alwaies
so greate, that the force of king <hi>Poro</hi> with whome <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
did fight, was not comparable, yet notwithstanding
the <hi>Portingales</hi> did giue them continually the ouerthrow,
although theyr strength was but small, yet they neuer left
the warres, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did. And leauing off to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
of the Gréekes and of theyr actes, and now to come
to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who with theyr huge armye, and with
theyr greate Fléete, the which séemed to couer the whole
Sea, thought to conquest the whole worlde, yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
durst aduenture by Sea further then the redde Sea,
neyther yet the greatest of their famous victoryes, did or
was euer lyke vnto the least of those battayles that was
done by our men in the <hi>Indyas,</hi> in the which it is so well
knowne, most inuincible Prince, the greate prosperitye of
the King your Father and you, so that without moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of your selfe out of your pallaice, was discouered and
conquered by your Captaines, the which neuer Princes
could by themselues conquere or discouer, so that there
was neuer Conquest of the Barbarous, nor of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
nor of the <hi>Latynists,</hi> the which was of lyke difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
as this hath béene, neyther yet Kinges nor Captaines,
of none of all these Nations, was so equall in force nor
yet in valyauntnesse as those of your Father, and of yours,
the which is manifestly declared by the discourse of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie
following.</p>
   <p>And touching theyr greate actes which they dydde
worthelye fulfill and bring to passe, wée must verelye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue
that it was Gods good will and pleasure, that
those Barbarous, béeing discouered with theyr vaine
Idolls, and with the false sect of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> shoulde ioyne
<pb facs="5"/>
themselues with the Catholike faith, and to be as it wer in
one Corall, and vnder one Pastour or Shepheard, as at
this present the great multitude that héereby are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
to the Christian Religion, is a manifest testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
and witnesse thereof. After which great exploytes,
your Highnes gaue commandement that the Christian doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of the Brotherhood of the company of Iesus should be
there instructed &amp; taught them, of the which your Highnesse
hath had so speciall a care like a most godlye and Christian
Prince, that not onely you were the first that commaunded
the same to be brought from <hi>Rome,</hi> for that they might bée
the better instructed in all their Kingdomes, but also doeth
maintaine vpon your owne charges in this holy companye
the multitudes that doeth daylye submit themselues to the
same. As we doe sée in the sumptuous Colledge of <hi>Coim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro,</hi>
where to ennoble and augment the honor of your king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
you haue erected and founded an Vniuersitie: where,
with the charges that is daylye done there, and with your
countenaunce together, it is hoped, that the same may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
amongst the florishing Vniuersities of all <hi>Europe:</hi>
whereas there is maintained also vpon your charges manye
Colledges of the order of poore begging Friers, and others
of like profession, for like as the reformation that was there
made was profitable to them all: so he commaunded, that
there should be many Diuines for to declare the Euangely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
law, which your Highnes is not onely at this charges
with religious men, but also with temporall men, for as
there is many of your subiects that doth defend y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> state Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike
or Common welth, and doth inlarge the same with
their armour, so ther are others that doth beautifie the same
with learning. These heroycall vertues of your Highnesse
being so well knowen vnto me, forsomuch as this Booke,
besides others that I haue made, hath some tast or kindred
of learning, doth incourage me the more to set them foorth,
for that as I say, there may remaine a perpetuall memorye
of so notable actes as so many Gentlemen and Knights of
<pb facs="6"/>
the <hi>Portingales</hi> your subiects hath done, the which hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited
me very much, my being in the <hi>Indias,</hi> where I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled
with my Father, who by your Highnes commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
was sent thether to serue as a Iudge. And for that
I spent all my youth in learning, and gaue my selfe greatly
in reading of auncient Histories, and hauing séene and read
a great part thereof, did then immediately procure to know
and with all diligence did my best indeauour to vnderstand
what had bene done in the Discouerie of the <hi>Indias,</hi> and in
the Conquest of the same, by the <hi>Portingales,</hi> with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
as aforesayde, which was to make the same knowen,
and common to all men: by meanes whereof, and through
the instructions of sundry Gentlemen and Captaines, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things came to my knowledge, by such persons as were
then and there present, as well in the counsayle for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision
for that which should be done, as also in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof, and otherwise by many letters and pamphlets,
the which were written by men of great credite, and lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
examined as sufficient witnesses for better credite of
the worke. Moreouer, I did not onely vse this dilygence in
the <hi>Indias,</hi> but after my comming to <hi>Portingale</hi> didde the
lyke. For as those matters the which I meant to write
of, were many and of sundrye orders, so it was necessarye
to enforme my selfe of the same by manye: and beside that
those that gaue me this instructions wer sworn, yet I was
licensed to present them as witnesses. There were of them
that I sought in the most part of <hi>Portingale:</hi> for what with
the great trauell of my person, and expences of my goodes,
for that they were seperated in sundry parts, and in this I
haue spent the most part of my lyfe, forsomuch as this was
my onely recreation, hauing ioyned together all these infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
since my being in the Vniuersitie of <hi>Coimbro,</hi> in
your Highnes seruice, at such time as I found my selfe not
occupied with the executing of my office, with great trouble
(not onely of the body, but also of the spirite) made an end
of this Booke with others, the which I doe humbly offer
<pb facs="6"/>
vnto your Highnes, whome God (after manye and most
fortunate yeares, remayning in your place
the Prince) take and receiue you
from the senurie of the
earth, vnto the ioyes
of heauen.</p>
