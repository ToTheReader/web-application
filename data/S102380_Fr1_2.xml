   <p>Alas most gracious reuerente Lordes and maysters, if ye vse the seruyse, or hear the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyse of false crafty flatterers, ye shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyth be so blynded that ye can neyther per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue by your selues, nor beleue when as ye be playnely and faythfully tolde, that manye of your owne doynges, commyng of mans freyltye, do tend muche vnto the displeasure of God, dyshonour of the kynge, and dyscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyt of your selues, beyng moste contrarye to that reuerent zele and faythful loue towards God, the kyng, and the cōmen wealth, which zeleand loue god of hys goodnes hath graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in your hartes, and the deuyll by mannes freyl dedes couered in sylence or colored with prayse of flatterers, laboreth to deface, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert and destroye.</p>
   <p>As God whyche searcheth the secretes of mans hart, doth beare me recorde, I do sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and thynke that you dooe so louyng lye drede God, reuerence the kyng, and regarde this realme, &amp; your owne honors, that beyng charged wyth the ouersight and prouision of castels, holdes, and fortes, made and kept for the safegarde of thys realme, ye coulde not wyttyngly be hyred to sell one of them vnto

the kynges ennemyes, for al the treasures in the world. And yet beyng craftelye deceyued wyth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>attery, ye vse a daungerous practyse in very many of them.</p>
   <p>Forther be some of them sclenderly assau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at certayne tymes of feble enemyes: and other continuallye beseged eyther wyth open forse or craftye conueyaunce of fearce, cruel, and perylous enemies. And now crafty flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers whych haue once serued for theyr wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in tyme and place of the sclender assalte, doo afterwardes requyre and perswade you for that seruyse to geue them the spoyle of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holdes remayning continuallye in more daunger Truly Frenchmen and Scottes be but feble ennemyes, and at certayne tymes do sclenderly assalt castels, towers, and such maner of holdes: The deuyl seking lyke a ro ryng Lyon, whom he may deuoure, nyghte &amp; day, wynter and sommer, wyth a wonderful forse of wycked spirites, doth euer besyege by shopryckes, shyres, townes, and parishes.</p>
   <p>Yf these places be not wel furnished with stout and true soldiers of bothe the sortes (I meane both officers in ciuyle polycy, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Prelates in Ecclesiasticall ministery) or if those souldyers be vnprouided of necessary liuyngs and dewe wages, then must the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

nedes peryshe and be destroyed for theyr owne synnes, and the bloud of theyr bodyes and soules requyred at your handes, whyche be charged and trusted of both God, and the king to prouide souldiers to those places, and also wages and liuinges to mayntayne those soldyers continually.</p>
   <p>How be it now manye personages, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyces, offyces, and fees be sold vnto couetous brybers for money, whych seke nothyng but the vantage of extorcion, robbry and spoyle, and fewe of them be freely giuen vnto faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ministers &amp; officers for their woorthynes, whych could and would by diligent doynge of their dutie, gouerne, instruct and cheryshe goddes people, the kynges subiectes.</p>
   <p>And therefore nowe the most part of men lackyng teachers &amp; rulers, do without griefe of conscience, or feare of punishment, abuse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thynge vnto the ruine and destruccion, whyche God hath ordayned vnto the vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng &amp; increase of a christiā commune welth.</p>
   <p>As for example, now bying and sellyng is not vsed as a prouision for good cheape and great plenty, but made the most occasyon of dearth and scarsitie. Wealth and wyt be not ryghtly vsed vnto a common confortable pro fyt, but shamefully abused vnto a wycked pri

Many offyces with authoritie be not duely disposed vnto faithful worthy men nor to dooe good vnto other, but vnlawfullye bought and solde amongest couetous, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men, to get gaynes vnto theim selues.
