      <salute>Much honored Sir,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had (though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many modest reluctations, first, from within) obteyned leave of my selfe, to make those thoughts, which have already, in some part, passed, in a transient sound, by the eares of some, legible, in a larger Volume, by the eyes of many; I could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke
<pb facs="3"/>
mee of a Nobler Patronage, than from your selfe; a worthy, not more highly placed upon the <hi>[hill]</hi> of deserved Eminence; then (as your Name proclaimes you in your conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, and devout practices) a most accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and exemplary <hi>[Saint.]</hi>
   </p>
   <p>My engagements to that<note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Mr.</hi> Peter Tayler.</note> good friend (whom I have have not lost, only seene to be sent before me to his heaven) whose decease gave an hint unto these slender, yet (as my hope is) usefull meditations, were such; as that, methought, I could not suffer my respects to yeeld up with him, on a suddain, their last Ghost; nor one grave to swallow both his corpse, and memory: I tooke therefore this cue of opportunity, as, to testifie my respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to him, and to those surviving, who most neerely related to him, so withall, to leave some publique monument of all gratitude (most worthy Sir) to you; not more endeared unto him dissolved, in his life time, than rich in many favors to my selfe; which were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more Noble, and of higher value, for that, they utterly transcended all deserving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in me: should I attempt on this occasion,
<pb facs="3"/>
to blazon the armes of your eximious worth, resplendent in a Coate, (whose crest must needs be glory) embellished by so various graces, (which, like the [<note n="a" place="margin">
         <hi>Can.</hi> 1.11.</note> golden] borders of the Spouse, [overlaid] with [silver,] having the [best] sides [inwards,] in a close integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; set you beyond the reach of flattery, or the shocke of envy;) alas! the best Heraldry of mine eloquence would here be posed; and in so copious, and full a theam my oratory quite languish under the povertie of but-apt expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: give me leave then to admire, what I am not able by mine insufficient quill, to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie enough in you: Let this suffice; your verie Name so well resembled in your<note n="b" place="margin">Conveniunt rebus [nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na] saepesius.</note> actions hath made you a perfect Mirror to the West: Lord! what a blessed prospect is it? thus to view greatnesse, and goodnesse, as righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and peace, to<note n="c" place="margin">

         <hi>Psal.</hi> 132.13, 14.</note> together, upon one Sion! Goe on, Noble Sir, to credit your Countrey, (the love whereof is like the orient rayes of the brightest Taper of the Firmament, universally display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon you) by your worthy undertakings:
<pb facs="4"/>
persist couragiously to be, not more a promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than (as you have long beene) a<note n="e" place="margin">

         <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.9.</note> receive you (out of a troublesome and stormy world) by the armes of his mercy: Continue still to make your House a Temple, where the dayly incense of Devotion ascends up as a rich perfume (sweetened by the<note n="i" place="margin">
         <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3, 4.</note> Angell of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence) unto Heaven; and where each tongue to me seemed as a severall Organ, to sound out Gods praises. Be not<note n="k" place="margin">

         <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6.</note>

   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>This poore piece of my Labours, (in the Lords great<note n="q" place="margin">

   <p>The Sermon was, at first indeed, in Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, but as that<note n="r" place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 18.44, 45.</note> little Cloud, like to a mans hand, seene by <hi>Elijahs</hi> servant from the top of Mount <hi>Carmel;</hi> but it's now swollen, and womb'd-out into a bigger one; from whence, if but some few drops distill, to refresh the Lords<note n="s" place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.9.</note> inheritance, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in that good God of mine, who hath thus farre<note n="t" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12.</note> enabled me, after my<note n="u" place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 12 3.</note> measure, for his weighty service.</p>
   <p>Nothing remaines, but that I earnestly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the full blessings of Gods both hands to be powred upon you; and, with you, upon your vertuous Consort and Familie; and that the<note n="x" place="margin">
         <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20, 21.</note> God of peace, who brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from the dead our Lord <hi>JESUS,</hi> that great Shepherd or the Sheepe, through the blood of the everlasting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,

make you perfect in every good work, to doe his will; working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight; through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory, for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
