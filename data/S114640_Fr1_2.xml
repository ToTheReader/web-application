These were the itching humors of <hi>Euah</hi> lineally descended to vs, who thought not Paradise spacious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for her habitation, nor the dainties of <hi>Eden</hi> sweet enough for her taste, nor that presence of God good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for her companie. But where the superscription of <hi>Holinesse to the Lord</hi> is engrauen on the head, and the perswasion of <hi>godlinesse to be gaine</hi> is engrafted in the heart, there the lust of the world, and the dust of the world shal be shuffled together as paires and pearles of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall account and continuance. For let the glorie of a Christian be neuer so eminent, it is not greater then <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons;</hi> nor yet
<hi>Salomons</hi> so great as the <hi>Lillies:</hi> let the arme of the wicked be neuer so mightie, it is not stronger then <hi>Pharaohs;</hi> and yet <hi>Pharaohs</hi> inferior to the course of waters: let the power of his command be neuer so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, it is not larger then

Whether then we peruse the steps of the Saints, or the state of vnrepentant sinners, wee see their liues equally bound vp with the cords of corruption, though vnequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matched in the ioy at their separation; the one falling away like a flower transplanted to a better soile: the other rushing vpon the rocke of Gods wrath, either shameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deiected with the terror of iudgement while they liue, or else fearefully entangled with the sense of torme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

And though like warie shipmen wee prouide for this crazie barke, which is the bodie,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.25.</note> yet must wee not permit immoderate care like a mercilesse canker to eate through our bones. But the way to ballance our selues euen, and not to stray beyond our tether, is to captiuate our thoughts thus farre, as to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the world but as a cradle, wherein we are rocked, till we aspire to some age and growth in Christ: our desires but as dreames wherewith we are deluded, till we attaine to some taste of Gods loue in Christ: this life but as a race
<pb facs="5"/>wherein we are wearied and perplexed till wee can reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer some sight of Christ; and this body but as a prison, wherein our soules lie shakled vnder the hope of being blessed in the death of Christ.

Now there being but two impediments to this perswasion and tranquillitie of spirit,<note place="margin">

And when the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of this feare hath taken such hold of our flesh, as we thinke our selues smitten in displeasure, and the tree of our hope to bee torne downe in wrath, wee then wrastle with sinne as if the steps of our strength were restrained, and looke vpon death as the Iailer, that commits vs to the graue as a dungeon. Hobeit euen in this doth the Lord reach forth a most approued cordiall to remoue the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our hearts; for hauing accesse into his sanctuary through the vnion &amp; communion we haue with Christ, the vncleanues of our birth being wiped away in the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of his nature, our transgression remoued in his innocency, our rebellion discharged in his obedience, and the vtmost farthing paid in his sufferings; and hauing the image of God we lost in <hi>Adam</hi> not renewed onely, but a fairer and deeper stamp thereof engrauen and set vpon vs,
<pb facs="6"/>it being not now in our power to listen any more to the counsel of the flesh, Christ bearing our names before him as his brest-plate, and our bodies with him as members whereof he is head; and hauing this written in the tables of our heart by the finger of no forgerer, but of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter was sent from heauen, and testified by ourselues in the pietie of our religion and purity of conuersation, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting saluation before vs as a binding benefite, euen to the losse of our souls to venture for the Lords glory:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.33.</note> we may in a Christian resolution giue challenge at the gates of hell, that nothing can be charged vpon vs as a debt, and therefore nothing can light vpon vs as a punishment. Wherefore if the Lord doe cast his cloudy countenance vpon vs, it is that we should watch against the weaknesse of the flesh,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.41.</note> which is then readiest to sleepe when tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is nearest: and yet if the streame of temptation cary vs into some sin, &amp; from thence we slip into some shame, in his compassion he cureth vs, and yet in kindnesse doth correct vs. If he mingle our bread with care, and lodge vs in the bed of darknes &amp; discomfort, it is to weane vs from the flesh pots of Egypt, and to aduance vs in the way to Canaan; yet being driuen to any strait or exigent in this wildernes, rather then we shall want it shall raine Manna,<note place="margin">Exod. 26.4. &amp; 27.6.</note> &amp; rather then we shall thirst the rocke shal yeeld vs water: yea though the wicked be like the bramble, who in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their shadow dare chalenge to be kings ouer the trees of the forrest, and our selues like sheepe,<note place="margin">Iudg. 9.15.</note> who in sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity grazing vpon the mountaines, are either fleeced of the shearer when we are growne in wooll, or snatched vp by the butcher when we are growen in flesh: yet when death hath made vs both euen with the earth, the graue shal be to vs a fold till our shepheard come, and to them a shambles till the destroier of their soules shall haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

<pb facs="8"/>whom chiefly I haue set my byas, that ye will be pleased to be no seuere examiners, but mild perusers of these pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and that affection may somewhat mediate with your iudgements, to censure not as ye see, but as I meane; I haue aduentured the hazard to be reproued of others, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on assured confidence to bee accepted of you. And though many may happely balke the alley, and not lend their eye to behold the iarres betweene the flesh and the spirit, vpon opinion that my selfe haue leaped beyond my last, in striuing to bring this boat to land, which the owner neuer meant should see the shore: yet when I considered the word of God to be like the raine,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.7. Mark. 11.13.</note> and the hearts of men like the earth, that if the tree answer not her fruite, her leaues will not protect her from the fire: that he shall come short in his account of faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note> that maketh no conscience of hearing; and that if the voice of the Preacher perish in the ayre or in the eare, it shall quicken againe to question with vs for our negligence; I was not ashamed to humble my selfe to others view, that by the mercy seene on me, who haue beene thus farre led into the secrets of God,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.13.</note> they may be likewise encouraged to presse within the border of the mount, when the horne of saluation shall be blowen.</p>
   <p>For it is a miserie and madnesse to imagine the labour of a Christian to be mued vp within the wales of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, or that men are so straitned in their vocations, as that they may not looke aside to a sermon: or that because the theese was saued on the gallowes,<note place="margin">Luk. 23.43.</note> therefore heauen may bee wonne with a wet finger: or that since the workers for an houre,<note place="margin">Mat.
20.9.</note> had the penny with them that bore the paine and heate of the day: therefore it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to come as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did to Christ by night.<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.2.</note> Nay, we must know, that as the promise of mercie is equall to
<pb facs="9"/>all, so the prayer and practise for mercie must be the same in all; that we are no longer within the compasse of the Lords protection,<note place="margin">Psal. 91 11.</note> then wee walke in feare within the bounds of his direction; that if religion be not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in our callings, scarcitie or discontent will bee as mothes in our blessings; and that if presumption misleade vs to pledge only a pang of deuotion for a sacrifice when the pleasure of our daies be past, iudgement shall but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite vs, if either death do strangle vs before we speake, or the wrath of God rebound vpon vs when wee haue wept our fill. For it standeth not with the Lords honour to be shaken off so oft when he would lodge with vs,<note place="margin">Ier. 32.33.</note> nor with our duties to runne away so fast, when wee should turne to him: but that at length iustice must arise to preserue the maiestie of his mercy, so much abased, and so long abused, which we haue sensibly felt, the stripes being yet seene in our streets, and may feare heereafter to bee more fierce,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 24.14.</note> by how much the sword of the enemie sharpened to destruction, doth exceed the correcting hand of God tempered with compassion.</p>
   <p>The Lord graunt this short setting of his face against vs, may haste vs to haue peace with him, that hath the ends of the world subiect to his power, and the plagues of the world restrainable at his will: so shall wee bee preserued from the venime, and ransomed from the violence of them that seeke our soules, and either still praise him in the land of the liuing,<note place="margin">Psal. 56.13.</note> or eternally dwell with him in the habitation of his Saints: which God grant may bee your portions, and the inheritance of your posterity. <hi>Amen.</hi>
