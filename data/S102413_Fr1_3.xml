But, so it fell out, that, now, aboue thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene years a-goe, the perverse Sedulitie, of seducing <hi>Priests,</hi> and the foolish Insolencie, of ignoran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

Which to doe, I was induced by his Intreatie, though much agaynst myne owne Disposition. Who, as I loue, and commend the accurate Inquisition, and clearing of <hi>Trueth,</hi> by calme, and Christian Conference, and sober, and sedulous Indagation: So, from myne Heart, I ever abborred all litigious Contestation, in what-so-ever Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but, most of all, in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> And yet, such is the miserable mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap of our tyme, or rather, of mad Humours in our-time, that nothing is so bitterly, and with so great Heat, Passion, and damnable spyte, debated, as are poyntes of <hi>Divinitie.</hi> And, this intemperie, hath so farre, in common, taken all myndes, as that all Christianitie, is now turned in odious, and humourous <hi>Disputation:</hi> and all, both Men and Women, will be, for-sooth, of a partie; all-be-it most part of them so ignorant, as they know neyther what they holde, or what they impugne: no more vnderstāding what they speake of, than doe <hi>Pyo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

Yet, they are incessantlie holde, to mooue Questions of <hi>Religion:</hi> who, beeing posed agayne, can not answere to the simple questions of the Childrens <hi>Catechisme.</hi> Thus, be at of <hi>Disputation,</hi> hath not onlie cooled, but even, all-most, extinguished all <hi>Devotion:</hi> and, not only breedeth Stryfe; but even, all-where, breaketh out to more vngodlinesse.

Now, as for these Reasons, I (having my service then assigned me in those Quarters, where this Folli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap> brake foorth) was at that tyme stirred to wryte this <hi>Treatise,</hi> and, even then, to giue out some one, or two, Manuscripts there-of; where-by to calme, some-what, those insolent Insulters; and, to confirme godlie, though weake, Mynds: and, it having, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie, in some measure, wrought that effect then: I, there-vpon, did cast it by hand, as, in myne owne Estimation, no more vsefull, or to be regarded. But, whyle now agayne, our Adversaries, of late, (through too great indulgence, and connivence granted them) haue risen to greater insolencie than before, and, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie, repone to vs, not onlie the same Matter, but, al-so, in the same manner, shameleslie, and senseleslie, still blazing, al-where abroad, this their <hi>Proper Ballad,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap> if never anie thing had beene sayd there-vnto: divers well affected Brethren, (knowing that I had a Copie there-of by me) dealt instantlie with me, that this <hi>Treatise</hi> might be put to the <hi>PRESSE.</hi> For whose satisfaction, I haue given way to the <hi>Printing</hi> of it: wishing, heartilie, it may both please thee, and be profitable vnto thee, and all honest Hearts, seeking, in singlenesse, for Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and stablishment in <hi>Trueth:</hi> and praying <hi>GOD,</hi> that all of vs may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouslie studie, not so much to Ydle, and vnprofitable Wranglings, as both to learne ourselues, and to teach others, that Doctrine, which is according to godlinesse▪ <hi>Fare-well.</hi>
