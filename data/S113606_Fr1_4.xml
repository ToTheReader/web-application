Or The godly counsaile of a gentle-woman not long since deceased, left behind her for her children : containing many good exhortations, and godly admonitions, profitable for all parents to leaue as a legacy to their children, but especially for those who by reason of their young yeeres stand most in need of instruction.

   <head>Counsell to my Children.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>MY Sonnes, the readers of this book,</l>
      <l>I doe you not intreate</l>
      <l>To beare with each misplaced word,</l>
      <l>for why, my paine's as great</l>
      <l>To write this little booke to you</l>
      <l>(the world may thinke indeed)</l>
      <l>As it will be at any time</l>
      <l>for you the same to read.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But this I much and oft desire,</l>
      <l>that you would doe for mee,</l>
      <l>To gather hony of each flowre,</l>
      <l>as doth the labourous Bee.</l>
      <l>Shee lookes not who did place the Plant,</l>
      <l>nor how the flowre did grow,</l>
      <l>VVhether so stately vp aloft,</l>
      <l>or neere the ground below.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But where she findes it, there she workes,</l>
      <l>and gets the wholsome food,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="9"/>And beares it home, and layes it vp,</l>
      <l>to doe her Country good,</l>
      <l>And for to serue her selfe at need</l>
      <l>when winter doth begin:</l>
      <l>VVhen storm and tempest is without,</l>
      <l>then she doth find within.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>A sweet and pleasant wholsome food,</l>
      <l>a house to keepe her warme,</l>
      <l>A place where softly she may rest,</l>
      <l>and be kept from all harme.</l>
      <l>Except the Bee that idle is,</l>
      <l>and seekes too soone for rest,</l>
      <l>Before she filled hath her house,</l>
      <l>whereby her state is blest.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And then as she did rest too soone,</l>
      <l>too soone she sorrow knowes:</l>
      <l>VVhen stormes and tempests are without,</l>
      <l>then she her selfe beshrowes.</l>
      <l>She looketh out and seeth death,</l>
      <l>ready her to deuoure:</l>
      <l>Then doth she wish that she had got</l>
      <l>more of the wholsome flowre.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>For why, within, her store is spent,</l>
      <l>before the winter's past.</l>
      <l>And she by no meanes can endure</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="9"/>the stormy winters blast.</l>
      <l>Shee looketh out, and seeth death,</l>
      <l>and findes no lesse within,</l>
      <l>Then too too late for to repent,</l>
      <l>you see she doth begin.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Therefore see you noridle be,</l>
      <l>this I would haue you know,</l>
      <l>Be sure still that the ground be good,</l>
      <l>whereout the Plant doth grow:</l>
      <l>Then gather well and lose no time,</l>
      <l>take heed now you doe see,</l>
      <l>Lest you be vnprouided found,</l>
      <l>as was the idle Bee.</l>
