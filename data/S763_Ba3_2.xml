      <head>The Answer upon my Quadrant.</head>

      <p>IF I circumvented not the said <hi>Author,</hi> nor that in a loving manner he opened his intent unto me by assisting of me in the making of my <hi>Horizontall Quadrant;</hi> Then to make his assertion good, it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be in the other <hi>Instrument,</hi> which I produced and published, to wit, that of my <hi>Mathematicall Ring</hi> (that is, how I might compose
<pb facs="61"/> or make the same) but concerning this latter Projection of the <hi>Ring</hi> or any thing to that effect, <hi>in a loving manner then, or at any time, or otherwise that he discovered his intent unto me,</hi> it can hardly bee col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected (certaine circumstances seriously weighed, and considered) The whole ground of which being from as weake a principle, <hi>to open the way unto me for the making of my Ring,</hi> as the sight of a <hi>Letter</hi> to shew me the making of my <hi>Quadrant;</hi> for about <hi>Alhalontide</hi> 1630. (as our <hi>Authors</hi> reporteth) was the time he was <hi>circumvented,</hi> and then <hi>his intent in a loving manner (as before) he opened unto me,</hi> which particularly I will dismantle in the very naked truth: for, wee being walking together some few weekes before <hi>Christmas,</hi> upon <hi>Fishstreet hill,</hi> we discoursed upon sundry things <hi>Mathematicall,</hi> both <hi>Theoricall</hi> and <hi>Practicall,</hi> and of the excellent inventions and helpes that in these dayes were produced, amongst which I was not a little taken with that of the <hi>Logarythmes,</hi> commending greatly the ingenuitie of Mr. <hi>Gunter</hi> in the <hi>Projection,</hi> and inventing of his <hi>Ruler,</hi> in the lines of proportion, extracted from these <hi>Logarythmes</hi> for ordinary <hi>Practicall uses;</hi> He replyed unto me (in these very words) What will you say to an <hi>Invention</hi> that I have, which in a lesse extent of the <hi>Compasses</hi> shall worke truer then that of Mr. <hi>Gunters Ruler,</hi> I asked him then of what forme it was, he answered with some pause (which no doubt argued his suspition of mee that I might conceive it) that it was <hi>Archingwise,</hi> but now hee sayes that hee told mee then, it was <hi>Circular</hi> (but were I put to my oath to avoid the guilt of Conscience, I would conclude in the former.) At which immediatly I answered, I had the like my selfe, and so we discoursed not a word more touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that subject: all which sundry times ingenuously according to the very truth the said supposed <hi>Author</hi> hath acknowledged before divers persons, who doe and will testifie the same: Then after my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming home I sent him a sight of my <hi>Proiection</hi> drawne in <hi>Pastboard:</hi> Now admit I had not the <hi>Invention</hi> of my <hi>Ring</hi> before I discoursed with the supposed <hi>Author</hi> thereof, it was not so facil for mee or any other <hi>(to an eye not partiall)</hi> to raise and compose so complete, and absolute an <hi>Instrument</hi> from so small a principle, or glimpse of light, but was knowne unto me, (as I have produced it) long before that time, and being now published as it is, the composure of it seemes most facil, (as all inventions doe, once knowne) that I have much wondred with my selfe, that Mr. <hi>Gunter</hi> or some other produced it not so to the world as now it is, seeing it was so easie, and caries with it such an excellency, above that which is in the <hi>Lineary forme,</hi> for in a
<pb facs="62"/>
         <hi>Circle</hi> it is naturall, &amp; perfect, in a line defective &amp; imperfect: But he, or they, perhaps saw it not, though their sight I confesse (no wise to dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their worth) might penitrate further in other things; but gifts may not be attributed to naturall ingenuitie, but to God the giver of them, who disposeth where his goodnesse pleaseth. And who knowes to the contrary but many private men in this <hi>kingdome,</hi> or elsewhere, might have this <hi>Invention</hi> long before my selfe, or he that now chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth it, seeing the gifts of God in his donations, to severall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, are oftentimes in one and the same thing, and if God bestowes his <hi>Talents</hi> on us, we ought to communicate them to others, which not to doe, is to hide them in a Napkin, and who so concealeth them are not free from some reprehension: our <hi>Author</hi> may answer for himselfe, who reporteth now that hee had the Invention for more then twelve <hi>yeares</hi> past, but put it not to use, which in a sense was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious both to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> if hee saw the copious, and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous use of it then, as now hee doth; to mee and to many others it hath seemed strange, that he should hide such an excellencie, so long in obscuritie; But it is supposed, that hee had then but a glimpse of its performance (untill I writ upon it, by opening the <hi>Cabenet,</hi> and shewing its treasure to the world) and so regarded it not then as a Iewell, but since. But when I had a sight of it, which was in <hi>February</hi> 1629. (as I specified in my Epistle) I could not conceale it longer, envying my selfe, that others did not tast of that which I found to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with it so delightfull &amp; pleasant a taste, knowing that as the <hi>Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rythmes</hi> (as a <hi>Iewell</hi>) that did excell all Inventions that ever went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, so this kind of Projection, as the daughter springing from so noble a <hi>Mother,</hi> was the rarest <hi>Instrumentall Gemme,</hi> that ever Art in all preceeding <hi>Ages</hi> did afford: which in its production heretofore lay obscure, but now being published how cleare doth it seeme to bee in its composure, and if it were so easie at the first to produce (as some account it) why did not some one all this while since the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of it (being now more then two <hi>yeares</hi> past) inlarge that Invention, or deliver others in that nature of their owne, being easier to adde unto an Invention, now being divulged, then to deliver its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall? But hitherto it hath seemed difficult, many having attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and endeavoured, but have fayled in their ends, howsoever I know not what some private mens industry hath produced by way of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation to that invention of my <hi>Ring,</hi> or the <hi>Logarythmes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Circular:</hi> At the <hi>Conclusion of my Booke</hi> I gave a sufficient and perspicuous direction, and invitation thereto, that so by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb facs="62"/> labours, and the other there intended, the way might be made faire, and the Ice broken that they might wade the easier: and so produce at last something for a publike use by Augmentation to this Invention, at which I shall much rejoyce, rather then any wise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie: But I have as yet all this while demurred in my pretended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and being often times by sundry men importuned, according as I have promised, to inlarge that Invention, seeing none as yet hath done any thing therein, I have now at last therefore for their benefit, &amp; others, to a publike view delivered what is mine owne to that end: and that by sundry wayes, and how easy doth the inlargement of that <hi>Invention</hi> now also seeme to be, being now produced. With the like facility did I compose long agoe my <hi>Helicall line of Roots</hi> which affords five places accuratly, by an inspection of the eye onely, which being not as yet divulged to a common view may to some seeme difficult for its composure: The secrets and intentions of the mind, how closely are they lodged in the breast, and who can search the heart, that from a word barely delivered the whole may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; therefore, it was not easy for me to know the <hi>Authors</hi> intent in his project by a bare word, had not God long before opened the way unto me, how this projection, or Invention might be composed; what meanes then these words; that <hi>in a loving confidence the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor discovered his intent unto me?</hi> is it not to give a faire flourish up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a untrue <hi>subject,</hi> to delude, if not to possesse <hi>Men</hi> with a falsitie, to detract from another his good name; besides the barrennesse of the word we will a little consider the straightnesse of time, in the original, for the producing of the <hi>Booke,</hi> and <hi>Invention,</hi> as is challenged by the <hi>Author</hi> to be about <hi>Alholantide,</hi> 1630. &amp; that then <hi>his loving intent to me he opened, and so was circumvented;</hi> I will put my cause into the hands of any indisterent <hi>Iudge</hi> to censure of it, that having had no other direction, or light from the said <hi>Author</hi> then formerly is speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, (for more hee dares not avouch with a cleare conscience) how could I from it so easily forme my <hi>Projection:</hi> Mr. <hi>Gunters Ruler,</hi> as some thinke, was a furtherence to me, but it was rather a hinderance, for his <hi>line of Numbers</hi> was as impertinent for me to follow, as such a double composure in the projection was superfluous, therefore such a bare verball (as before) or <hi>Instrumentall</hi> dictate was not used, or could be sufficient to compose so high a worke: but it was from a long intentive precogitation of many <hi>yeares</hi> with my selfe, how the <hi>Logarythmes</hi> in the <hi>Tables</hi> might be so compacted, that all <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> in these <hi>Tables</hi> should bee proportionall one unto another, and according to a divers, and variable proportion assigned; which to
<pb facs="63"/> effect I found at the first very difficult, and could not conceive how otherwise it might bee done, but either by fitting of <hi>Tables</hi> to all proportions, which so to doe would not onely be too great for <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but also breede confusion; or it must be from some graduated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of these <hi>numbers Instrumentally,</hi> so that by motion numbers might be mooved one unto another; and for expedition of which I found no figure more apt then a <hi>Circle,</hi> and on that my <hi>Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fixed,</hi> and there I rested, and so (as my few houres could permit me) I made severall projections, that the senses might see the effect of it in a perfect beauty, which the intellect saw before but in obscurity: about which how often was I afterwards interrupted in my desires to looke further into the <hi>mysteries</hi> that lay open in that new <hi>Invention,</hi> having not scarce an houre in a day, and sometimes not two houres in a weeke of serious <hi>privacie</hi> (by reason of my calling) to sport my selfe in operation thereon (for it seemed so to me then as a recreation, as all new <hi>Inventions</hi> at the first doe to any that invents them) It was many <hi>moneths</hi> therefore before I made tryall of it, in the generall uses that it might bee put unto, in matters of <hi>Arithmeticke,</hi> for common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, and to the measuring of <hi>Plaines</hi> and <hi>Solids,</hi> but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how it might be applyed to the doctrine of Plaine, and <hi>Sphericall Triangles,</hi> in <hi>Astronomicall Calculations, Nauticall practices,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rologicall</hi> conclusions, all which in every particular I practised on it at such times as convenience would permit mee; And having for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>moneths</hi> thus satiated my selfe, and fed my fancie upon its <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall contemplation,</hi> and its <hi>Practicall operation,</hi> though often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I found many Rubs and impediments in the <hi>Practise,</hi> in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this instrumentall Invention at the first so generally and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously as I did; And it cannot bee denyed of any, that the wayes of new Inventions lies not so obvious, or so easie, to bee discovered with such celerity, as a long premeditation might produce; I was desirous therefore to make the world participate thereof also; Therefore at severall times, having but a little time at anytime, by little and little did I compose and produce a method pleasing to mine owne fancie; doing one weeke such a peece, another weeke another, and so going on untill I had runne through the whole parts of <hi>Arithmeticke,</hi> in the <hi>Goalden Rule</hi> direct, and indirect, in <hi>division</hi> and in <hi>multiplication,</hi> applying all these to manifold uses in <hi>combination of Numbers,</hi> to <hi>common affayres,</hi> in <hi>fortification,</hi> to <hi>mensuration,</hi> and <hi>fractionall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> then I applyed the <hi>Instrument</hi> to the finding of numbers in <hi>continuall proportion,</hi> in finding of meane <hi>Proportionalls,</hi> and the
<pb facs="63"/> extracting of <hi>Rootes,</hi> I laboured further to make the <hi>Instrument</hi> more complete that it might worke all usefull proportions touching <hi>Interest,</hi> or valuation of <hi>Leases:</hi> and last of all I applyed the <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the <hi>Circles</hi> of <hi>Sines,</hi> and <hi>Tangents,</hi> to some uses of <hi>Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> in the finding of the <hi>Declination of the Sunne,</hi> and its <hi>ascention</hi> through all <hi>Latitudes;</hi> These things I drew up in a Booke at severall times aforesaid, as a part of the practises that I made upon it: And it was a task sufficient for a man that had cōmand of his <hi>houres,</hi> by allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them soly to that end, in as long a time as was betweene <hi>Alhalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide</hi> &amp; <hi>Christmas,</hi> in the opening of the way of that new <hi>Invention,</hi> &amp; by applying of it so, (to use for a publike view) rather then by one that was commanded by them, especially at that time and all the <hi>Tearmes</hi> before: for how few are the <hi>houres</hi> that a man of any imployment gets to set upon a new <hi>method</hi> for a new <hi>Invention</hi> at such a time, I leave to any indifferent eye to judge; and it would have beene so much the more harsher, and difficult to have it so suddainly produced, had it beene then at <hi>Alhalantide</hi> but onely conceated, and agitated on, but it was premeditated on long before, as is aforesaid, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a <hi>new yeares gift</hi> for the <hi>King,</hi> which accordingly I gave him on <hi>new yeares day,</hi> though a fortnight, or three weekes before <hi>Christmas,</hi> his Ma<seg rend="sup">tie</seg> received from mee a Scheme of the <hi>Projection</hi> in <hi>Pastboard,</hi> with a manuscript of the <hi>Booke</hi> which is now published, agreeable to it in every tittle, (the <hi>Epistle</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) a <hi>Copy</hi> of which was then at the <hi>Presse:</hi> and was <hi>Printed</hi> foure dayes before <hi>new yeares day,</hi> 1630. <hi>Now</hi> that all these <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and many Transcripts that were drawne, with the doubts and hinderances that did arise in the fitting of these things, could bee made, so ordered, and produced in so little a time, as the scattering of a few <hi>houres</hi> as betweene <hi>Alhalantide</hi> and a moneth before <hi>Christmas,</hi> I leave to the <hi>Iudicious Reader</hi> to censure: I broke the <hi>Ice,</hi> and made the way facil for another that came behinde mee; yet if hee tooke a <hi>yeare</hi> and more to meditate and write upon my endeavours after my publication (thereby not to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that hee wanted time, but takes liberty enough if not too much, to the losse of time) as long a time, halfe of it, or a quarter of that time, may by a <hi>Charitable boone</hi> be granted mee. Which consideration of time, will easily also cleare mee from the imputation of the <hi>Authors loose assertion,</hi> that hee was Circumvented by mee, nor that in a loving confidence he opened his intent unto me. Yet in the last place I will hasten
<pb facs="64"/> to vindicate his untrue declaration before the <hi>Courts of justice;</hi> if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution be not speedily made, where true <hi>witnesses</hi> shall bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and that which is now but in agitation I will bring to action, and prove that before <hi>Alholantide</hi> or very neare that time, my <hi>Invention</hi> was produced to a publike view; therefore it was very injurious in the <hi>Author</hi> to possesse the world with so an untrue <hi>asperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> upon a bare <hi>supposition,</hi> in that I should have the <hi>Invention</hi> frō him, and that in a louing manner he opened his intent unto mee, and was <hi>Circumvented,</hi> as before, whose assuming disposition hath not onely bin busie to take from me my good name, &amp; labours by this his loose <hi>aspertion,</hi> but hath also endevoured (by too rigid and generall a censure sparing none in some sence) to bring all in a common disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in their <hi>Callings,</hi> therefore,</p>

         </gap>, as, what is meant by such, or such names; what are such, and such tearmes, and therefore the beginning of a <hi>mans knowledge</hi> even in the use of an <hi>Instrument,</hi> is first founded on <hi>doctrinal preceps,</hi> and these precepts may be conceived all along in its use: and are so farre from being exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they doe necessarily <hi>concomitate</hi> &amp; are contained therein: the <hi>practicke</hi> being better understood by the <hi>doctrinall part,</hi> and this later explained by the <hi>Instrumentall,</hi> making precepts obvious unto sense, and the <hi>Theory</hi> going along with the <hi>Instrument,</hi> better in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and inlightning the understanding, &amp;c. <hi>vis vnita fortior,</hi> so as if that in <hi>Phylosophy</hi> bee true, <hi>Nihil est intellectu quod non prius fuit in sensu,</hi> and things the more they be objected to the sense, are more fully represented to the <hi>understanding,</hi> then it must needes follow that a doctrinall proposition laid first open to the <hi>eye,</hi> and <hi>sense,</hi> and well perceived enters more easily the dore being opened, then if the intellect by the strength of its active sense, should eliciate, or screw out the meaning by a long exeogitated operations; Its not therefore requisite unto all <hi>Capacities,</hi> to have <hi>Instrument</hi> severed from <hi>science,</hi>

To begin with <hi>Instrument</hi> is unprofitable for the <hi>Teacher,</hi> though advantagious to the <hi>learner,</hi> (if his ends be but to know some uses upon an <hi>Instrument,</hi> as it is with many) for it is easier for a man to learne more usefull <hi>Practise</hi> upon some <hi>Instrument</hi> in one houres <hi>Instruction,</hi> then to know the cause in 20. houres of some <hi>Instrumentall operation:</hi> and yet there are many <hi>Instruments</hi> almost as facil in their <hi>demonstration</hi> as in their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Which kind of beginning to teach, or usuall proceeding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is not as vulgar <hi>Teachers use,</hi> but is as indirect in the <hi>Method as false in the assertion</hi> (if they may possibly avoid it) for that were to teach against their owne <hi>profit,</hi> and the <hi>dignitie of learning;</hi> Yet that any <hi>Teachers of Mathematicks</hi> should be so nice as to deny the use of <hi>Instrument,</hi> to such <hi>Gent.</hi> or others, who perhaps desire the <hi>Theory</hi> to
