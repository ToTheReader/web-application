   <head>Humfrey Crowch <hi>To the Author Master</hi> Randulph Mayres.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>TO thee brave <hi>Mayres</hi> whose spirit's not confin'd</l>
      <l>Within the limits of a cowards minde,</l>
      <l>For as the Elements of fire and water,</l>
      <l>When as they meet do strive which shall be greater,</l>
      <l>So feare and valour in a souldiers brest,</l>
      <l>Do strive in volentars, and some thats prest,</l>
      <l>But like a flash of lightning valour did</l>
      <l>Put life in thee, when feare struck others dead,</l>
      <l>In a good cause valour made thee resolu'd,</l>
      <l>To venter forth which made thee be extold,</l>
      <l>And what thy youth perform'd in field and town,</l>
      <l>Now crowns thy age with honour and renown,</l>
      <l>To try the worst of ills thou tookst a pride,</l>
      <l>As this Book shews which cannot be denide,</l>
      <l>Hard lodging, hunger, cold, could not displant thee,</l>
      <l>Nor yet grim death himself could ever daunt thee,</l>
      <l>When cowards fled, and some that staid prov'd base,</l>
      <l>Thou stout didst brave King <hi>Hunger</hi> to his face,</l>
      <l>Thy daring heart did clime the <hi>Alps</hi> so high,</l>
      <l>Not high enough for thee, I grieve that I</l>
      <l>Want matter to extoll thee as I should,</l>
      <l>Whose name deserveth to be writ in gold.</l>
      <l>The losing of <hi>Breda</hi> is thy relating,</l>
      <l>The Ile of <hi>Ree</hi> which set the <hi>French</hi> a prating:</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="7"/>
That though our men were beaten from that coast,</l>
      <l>Thou shew'st the <hi>French</hi> have no great cause to</l>
      <l>And since to talk of wars is thy delight:</l>
      <l>All the <hi>Bohemian</hi> wars thou dost recite, boast,</l>
      <l>Thou being an eye-witnesse of these things,</l>
      <l>The news unto thy native Country brings.</l>
      <l>Rest (worthy man) from all thy pains and toyles,</l>
      <l>For age, we know, the stoutest souldier foyles.</l>
