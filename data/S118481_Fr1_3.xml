      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost gracious Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie I offer to your learned censure, the fruits of my labour, the first fruits whereof, as likewise of my dutiful disposition seuen yeeres before your Maiesties comming, as mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers of my deuoted affection, I sent into <hi>Scotland</hi> to meet with
<pb facs="3"/> you, as it were a farre of: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I presented you with a Booke at my waiting vpon you in your late progresse: And now againe, in time of Parliament, and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node, the time of representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all our Church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth I haue presumed of the like gracious acceptance, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my selfe that nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth amisse to you of scholastical exercise, that tendeth to <hi>vnion,</hi> or to nourishing a fellowship and <hi>communion</hi> in Ecclesiasticall or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill affaires. It remaineth that I giue, dedicate, and addict my selfe and all my studies to your Highnesse seruice: I resume often into my hands your <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> and weighing the ponderous sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb facs="3"/> of that Booke, I finde none to import more good to the Church, then that golden sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or rather incomparably more precious then all the golde of Ophyr, in the 41. page of that Booke: parity <hi>the mother of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and enimy to vnitie, which is the mother of order:</hi> That is, parity in the Church once established in the gouernement Ecclesiasticall, will draw on paritie in the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or ciuill estate. The conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof hath occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lead me into this discourse, as I thinke not vnrequisit at this time, in which parity is so much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded: Your Maiestie knoweth by particular experience who they are that hate all eminencie of
<pb facs="4"/> gifts, and praeeminency of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and mislike (vnlesse it be in themselues all gouernment and superioririe, who they are that would aequall the Scepter of their Presbyterie, or rather aduance it aboue the Scepter of Princes, who they are that haue filled all the world full of needlesse contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies, called all things in quaesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the church discipline, frō the highest Cherubins, to the lowest pin of the tabernacle, who they are which reproch all iurisdiction of Bishops, though it be the very same that was in the time of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the great, <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and other godly Princes times, and contemne all degrees of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities &amp; other digniteis of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall
<pb facs="4"/> Churches: who they are that would take away all plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and maintenance of learned men, and reduce all inaequalities to an aequalitie, and are professed enemies to the Hierarchy of the Church, and would bring all to popularitie, or Democracy, and afterwards to Anarchie, if their designes might take effect and place. Looke what pleasure or paines they take of the faction in demolition of churches, whether it be by hand, or hand-writing, so much or a great deale more, my delectation &amp; trauel is according to my small talent, for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and vpholding of the fabrique of the same. Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie as a Christian <hi>Atlas</hi> must
<pb facs="5"/> beare the whole frame, wee of your clergy as supporters. Most matters are wel calmed with your good moderation (if no after tempest doth arise) as my hope is and praier to almightie God for the perpetuitie of the peace of Gods Church, and for your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties and your royall issues happie preseruation.
