   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>GENTLE Reader, by the little experience that I haue in matter of disputation against Protestants, I find the Prouerb to be verifyed, which sayth: That <hi>Aristotles</hi> Asse is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, then <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself is able to proue. For the most ignorant companion that euer hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a cudgell in schoole, makes a shew to be some tale and iollie fellow, all the while the skilfull Fencer, suffers and wills his young schollar to lay at his Master, he in the meane tyme lying only at his locke, and defending himselfe, and not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending his vnskillfull schollar. But when this Maister, begins to let flye at this ignorant fellow, and to teach him the Art, as well to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as to offend others, alas, how doe the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by laugh at this poore apprentice? To see him who seemed some-body a little before, to be now no-body, and to be knockt and rapt, how, and where his Master listes?</p>
   <p>The very like is to be sayd, of the combate or
<pb n="130" facs="66"/>Controuersy in Religion, where let Protestantes alone, still to stricke, obiect, and lay loade at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, one would thinke (I wosse) that there were some matter in them: For in opposing the Reall presence, Purgatory, Images, Prayers to Saints, Rayling at the Pope, and the like, you would thinke them to be some iollie fellowes, but alas, turne the offenciue weapon towardes him, lay at him a little, and do but teach this bould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of others, to defend himself, all the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders burst out in laughter, and the poore schollar proues so vnskillfull, that the blowes he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue vpon his buckler, he beareth them off with his head and shoulders, and is knockt and rapt, euery where, where the Fencer listes. For euen so Protestantes seeme to shew some small skill, in offending vs, and our Religion, but being put to defend their owne, alas, what poore Fencers doe they proue? Let the Reader be but an indifferent behoulder of this ensuing combate, and I assure him he cannot looke on, but he shall laugh for his labour.</p>
