                 <title>A briefe dissection of Germaines affliction : with warre, pestilence, and famine; and other deducable miseries, lachrimable to speak of; more lamentable to partake of. Sent as a (friendly) monitor to England, warning her to beware of, (generally) ingratitude, and security as also (particularly) other greevous sinnes, the weight whereof Germany hath a long time felt, and at this present doth (and England may feare to) feele. Written from approv'd intelligence, by M. Parker</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader should this insuing discourse happen to be reade (or heard) by the most adamantine heart in the world; (I perswade my selfe) it would (like Goats blood) dissolve it. For here in this small volume is briefly disected (or ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomized) the largest subject of misery that the lanthorne of time ever shewed to the world. It is a lamentable tragedy; so lamentable, that the like, all precedent times were ignorant of. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many is the Stage; the Actors are mercilesse extortioners, bloody homicides, luxurious ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishers, sacrilegious robbers, (and spoylers) of Churches and other holy places Canibalian man-eaters, and their attendants. And because no play is held compleat unlesse some womens parts be in it; behold here are Virgins ravished and murthered; women eating their owne children: nay, one woman devouring another. The Scenes are Warre, Famine, and Pestilence, with other

Women likewise that have beheld their loving husbands, some miserably tortured to death; others shamefully abused, and even gelt in their (enforced) presence; others have had their noses and eares cut off to make hat-bands for the deriding tormentors. Now loving Countrymen heare me, this hath long beene (and yet is) the case of afflicted Germany, that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may be our owne case, let us pitty hers, and leave off those sinnes which have drawne these plagues upon her, though we (by Gods mercy) are yet spared, that still we may, and that our merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lord will continue his blessings, (health, peace and plenty) among us, is the daily prayer of</p>
