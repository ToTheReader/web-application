   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Llen the Author of the Popish challenge (as it is now confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) and of the Booke of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, as he alwayes acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, finding mine answere to both these treatises, so well grounded vpon the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, and testimonies of the most ancient writers, that albeit he might quarell at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bie matters, yet he was not able to auoyd the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of mine arguments, and answeres: determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to aduenture his credite, in publishing any replie vnder his owne name, and therefore turned ouer the businesse to one Bristowe, whose impudence being approued in his Motiues, and demaundes, was thought more meete to take so desperate a cause in hand. Bristowe himselfe on the otherside, perceiuing that it was impossible for him to make any shewe of replie, that might satisfie any meane witte, if hee should followe me orderly and directly, from point to point, as I haue followed Allen, durst not once vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake that lawfull course of replying, which I haue alwayes obserued in answering, but by confounding of many diuers matters together, hath sought to bring a great mist vpon the cause, vnder which hee might rather hide then defende his master Allen, and he himselfe like a pretie man, nowe and then start out and giue a perilous blowe, and so retyre into
<pb facs="3"/>
his cloude againe. For this purpose it was not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him, leauing all order of replying, to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the confutation of two books of myne, of most diuerse matters, in one of his, but that the confusion might bee greater, and the light of trueth appeare much lesser, he must defende two more of his owne. So that hauing nowe iumbled together no lesse then sixe treatises in one, two of Allens, two of mine, and two of his owne, he thinketh himselfe so well armed with darkenes and confusion, that if he cannot haue a conquest, yet he may be sure to haue a starting hole to hide himselfe in. And first he findeth great fault that his motiues and demaunds (which most men for the great follie shewed in thē dispised) were not first answered: dreming that my books should neuer haue beene put in print, but to make a shewe of answere to his motiues and demaunds. But how vainely he ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, mine answere printed, to those wodden workes of his, doth plainely discouer. Of like vanitie and more impudence it is, that hee affirmeth constantly, that I was faigne to set foorth those bookes without priuiledge (albeit I say the one was authorized) distinguishing betweene priuiledge and authoritie, wherein I know not what the peeuish quareller mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. For this I am sure, that both those bookes, had such approbation and license to be printed, as al bookes concerning religion ought to haue, by the Queenes iniunctions, which I call &amp; count a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent authorizing. Concerning priuileging, I suppose Bristowe cauelleth, because he knoweth not what the name of a priuiledge signifieth, for which I will
<pb facs="3"/>
remit him to some lawyer to learne. But where I affirmed, that my booke was authorised two yeares before it was imprinted, he douteth whether he may beleeue my bare word, because I write in the same, <hi>We beleue that the Catholike Church hath no cheefe gouernour vpon earth, but Christ, vnto whom all power is giuen in heauen &amp; in earth.</hi> But I pray thee Bristow, what doth this hinder thee to beleeue me vpon my bare word? Thou demandest a question in the margent, What if the Church were in England onely, or one were King of all Countries, sometime where it is? I might, according to Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons aduise, answere thee according to thy folly, &amp; deferre my resolution vntill either the Church be in England only: or that one were King of all Countries where it is. But lest thou shouldst thinke thy selfwise in thy folish question, I answere, that if either of both those cases should come to passe, which are both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible: Christ should stil reteine his office and power that he hath in heauen and earth, and that one King of England, or of many coūtries, should haue no more authoritie ouer the Church, then the Queene of England now hath ouer that portion of the Church, that is in England, or ouer all those portions that are in other her seuerall dominions.</p>
   <p>But whereas Bristow saith, my former booke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth only by permissiō to make a shew of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what for a time, &amp; if after it chaunce of some Papist to be dasht out of countenance, then the shame to be no mans but onely Fulkes: I wish the gentle reader to consider two thinges. First, that he will charge no
<pb facs="4"/>
man with the shame of mine errors, if any he can proue, but me onely, as in deede there is no reason that any man should beare the blame of my folly, but my selfe, &amp; least of al the church of God. Secōdly that by quarelling at the want of priuiledge and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of my writinges, he acknowledgeth this his owne booke of reply, to lacke neither priuiledge nor authoritie, so that if I not onely dash it out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, but also shewe it to be voyde of wisdome, learning and trueth, the shame shall not be priuate to Bristow alone, but cōmon to all the popish faction beyond the sea, &amp; on this side the same, by whose cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent it seemeth to be penned and set foorth. Bristows reply is conteined in 13. Chapters, to euery of which, and to euery part of them, as they are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by himselfe, I will answere in order, that they which liste to conferre my Reioynder with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, may see I seeke not by confusion to couer any fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood, but by orderly proceeding to bring the trueth to light.</p>
