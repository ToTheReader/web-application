Wherfore it is once ageyne ouerseene and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rused, that the same may be at length correspondent to the actours mind and very profitable for the reader, bycause this boke doth teche mani thinges that we be bounde to learne and knowe one peyne of euerlastinge death. As the lawes of God sheweth how we maye knowe to kepe his commaundementes and to knowe the remedyes to withstande deadely sinne, there be many men and women thynketh them selfe wyse, and knoweth and learneth many thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges, but that they be bounde to lerne and knowe, that they knowe not. ¶As fyrst the x. commaundementes of God, and the v. commaundementes of the Churche, that euery creature that purpose to be saued shuld lerne and knowe and haue them as perfytely as their Pater noster, you people, howe wyl you confesse you, and if ye breke any of the x. commaundementes, and you know not them. ¶ Truely there is but fewe that knoweth them, ther fore ye that do not know them to your deligence to learne them, for ye be bounde to lerne them, aswell as to lerne your Pater noster. ¶For howe can you keepe our Lordes commaundementes and ye knowe them not. And ye be bounde to breke not one of them on peyne of dampnation, for and if thou breake one thou brekest all. Offende the lawe in one point, and offende in all. For and thou breke one thou doest not Gods byddyng, for he byddeth thee breke none.
