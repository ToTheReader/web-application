   <head>TO HENRY MY DEAREST SONNE, AND NATVRAL SVCCESSOVR.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VHom-to can so rightly appertaine</hi> this Booke of instructions to a Prince in all the points of his calling, aswell ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, as a Christian towards God; as particular, as a King towards his people? Whom-to, I say, can it so iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appertaine, as vnto you my dearest Sonne? Since J the authour thereof, as your naturall Father, must be carefull for your godly and vertuous education, as my eldest Sonne, and the first fruits of Gods blessing towards mee in my posteritie: and as a King must ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously prouide for your trayning vp in all the points of a Kings Office; since yee are my naturall and lawfull successour therein: that being rightly informed hereby, of the waight of your burthen, ye may in time beginne to consider, that being borne to be a king, ye are rather borne to <hi>onus,</hi> then <hi>honos:</hi> not excelling all your people so farre in ranke and honour, as in daily care and hazardous paines-taking, for the dutifull administration of that great office, that God hath laide vpon your shoulders. Laying so a just sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie and proportion, betwixt the height of your honourable place, and the heauie waight of your great charge: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
<pb n="139" facs="91"/>in case of failing, which God forbid, of the sadnesse of your fall, according to the proportion of that height. J haue therefore for the greater ease to your memory, and that yee may at the first, cast vp any part that yee haue to doe with, deuided this Treatise in three parts. The first teacheth you your duetie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God as a Christian: the next, your duetie in your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as a King: and the third informeth you how to behaue your selfe in indifferent things, which of them-selues are neither right nor wrong, but according as they are rightly or wrong vsed; and yet will serue according to your behauiour therein, to augment or empaire your fame and authoritie at the handes of your people. Receiue and welcome this Booke then, as a faithfull Praeceptour and counsellour vnto you: which, because my affaires will not permit mee euer to bee present with you, J ordaine to bee a resident faithfull admonisher of you: And because the houre of death is vncertaine to mee, as vnto all flesh, J leaue it as my Testament and latter will vnto you. Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you in the presence of GOD, and by the fatherly authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie J haue ouer you, that yee keepe it euer with you, as carefully, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did the <hi>Iliads</hi> of <hi>Homer.</hi> Yee will finde it a iust and impartiall counsellour; neither flattering you in any vice, nor importuning you at vnmeete times. Jt will not come vn-called, neither speake vnspeered at: and yet conferring with it when yee are at quiet, yee shall say with <hi>Scipio,</hi> that yee are <hi>nunquam minûs solus, quàm cum solus.</hi> To conclude then, J charge you, as euer yee thinke to deserue my Fatherly blessing, to follow and put in practise, as farre as lyeth in you, the praecepts hereafter following. And if yee follow the contrary course, I take the Great GOD to record, that this Booke shall one day bee a witnesse betwixt mee and you; and shall procure to bee ratified in Heauen, the curse that in that case here I giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. For I protest before that Great GOD, I had rather not bee a Father, and childlesse, then bee a Father of wicked chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But hoping, yea, euen promising vnto my selfe, that GOD, who in his great blessing sent you vnto mee; shall in the
<pb n="140" facs="92"/>same blessing, as hee hath giuen mee a Sonne; so make him a good and a godly Sonne; not repenting him of his Mercie shewed vnto mee, I end, with my earnest prayer to GOD, to worke effectually into you, the fruites of that blessing, which here from my heart I bestow vpon you.</p>
