      <l>WHo loues his child, in tēder yeres doth labor him to train</l>

      <l>Sometime he doth rebuke his faults, and sometime doth exhort</l>
      <l>Him fatherly and prayseth him in good and godly sort,</l>
      <l>He warneth him, and forceth him, to doe those things be due,</l>
      <l>And those things that vndecent be, he willeth to eschue,</l>
      <l>That when to riper yeres his sonne and louing child shal grow,</l>
      <l>He may then reap the sedes of groūd, that he in youth did plow,</l>
      <l>Euen the rewardes of al his paine, which is an inward ioy,</l>
      <l>To see his childe imbracing grace, with vices sore annoy.</l>
      <l>What more delite can parent haue, than when he doth espie,</l>
      <l>His children following vertues steps, and wayes of pietie,</l>
      <l>To be among the noblest men, discent by lineall line</l>
      <l>Estemed, and to beare the bell, in grace because they shine?</l>
      <l>Aboundant ioyes do fill the hart of such when at they die,</l>
      <l>When in their sonnes their vertues rare yplanted they espie,</l>
      <l>That though the fates haue losde the threde of their desired life,</l>

Oh pampring fare doth harme, and hurt a tender minde,</l>

      <l>Set him to schole in tender yeres, commit him to his booke,</l>
