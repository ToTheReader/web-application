   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F euer there were a time (Right Honourable) wherein Gods Ministers should crie aloude,<note place="margin">Esa. 58.1.</note> and lift vp their voice like a trumpet, to tell the people of their transgressions, and the house of <hi>Iacob</hi> of their sinnes; then surelie it is now in these our daies, and in this our land. For howsoeuer the light of the Gospell hath for manie yeeres clearelie shined among vs, shewing vnto vs the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, in which we walking may attaine vnto hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, and the manifold by-paths of error and sinne, to the end we may auoid them; and though we haue had Gods faithfull Ministers, sometimes piping vnto vs the sweete tunes of the Gospell, to allure vs vnto holie obedience; and sometimes thundring out the dreadfull sound of Gods fearefull iudgements due to
<pb facs="3"/>sinne, to restraine vs from running on in wicked courses; yet there is little reformation and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but rather we are growne from ill to worse, and waxe euerie day more secure and sensuall in our sins. And because men haue not imbraced and loued Gods truth, nor submitted themselues to bee ruled with this scepter of his kingdome; therfore many are giuen vp of God to their own filthie lusts, and to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate minde, and through the hardnesse of their hearts, all the meanes of their conuersion and saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on become not only vneffectuall and vnprofitable, but rather cause them to bee more obdurate in their sinnes. The resplendent light of the Gospell doth make them more blind, so as they goe groping in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance euen at noone daies; the sound of the word, and loud cries of Gods Ministers in their eares calling them to repentance, doe make them more deafe to all instruction and admonition; the comfortable beames of Gods gracious promises shining vpon their hearts, doe not supple and soften them, but rather make them more hard and obdurate; and as the Apostle speaketh,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.16.</note> the word of God, which in it own nature is the sauor of life vnto life, becommeth vnto them the sauour of death to their deeper condemnation. And as this is the state of all the who haue sold themselues to worke wickednesse, and lie frozen in the dregs of their sinnes; so euen the better sort who haue giuen their names vnto Christ, haue been so intoxicated with the sweete cups of prosperitie, and through long rest, peace, and plentie haue so rusted in their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that it is to be feared, they will not recouer their ancient puritie and brightnesse, vntill the file of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with an heauie hand hath come often ouer
<pb facs="3"/>them. But neither the crying sinnes of those who are notoriouslie wicked, nor yet the grosse corruptions of such as make profession of religion, doe cause the state of our land to bee so dangerous and almost des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, as the nice wantonnesse of sinne, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it impatient of the least touch; for howsoeuer it is in it selfe of the most slauish nature, yet is it so back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in these times with the numerous multitude of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and so countenanced and befriended by men of best qualitie, and greatest power, that it is growne to be a matter farre more dangerous to reprooue sin then to commit it, especiallie when it is cunninglie acted, and plainelie reprehended. Gods spirituall Chirurgions may indeede in these times make as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie corrasiues as they will, but if they loue their peace and life, they must take heed that they doe not apply them; for patients wounded with the sores of sinne, when they admit them to the cure, hold the dagger of reuenge in their hands, readie to stab them, if they but touch them to the quicke. And therefore needs must these impatient patients fester in their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the verie death of bodie and soule, seeing they will by no meanes indure to haue their wounds sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. Neuerthelesse all this must not daunt and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage those whom the Lord hath called to the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Ministerie, from the performing of their dutie, but the more dangerous and desperate their state is who are committed to their charge, the more earnest and diligent should they shew themselues in seeking their preseruation. For they ought to preferre the spirituall health of those who are by God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their cure, before their owne temporarie life; and being appointed the Lords watchmen, the
<pb facs="4"/>more securely the people sleepe in sinne, the louder must they crie till they haue awakened them, when they see Gods iudgements approching and readie to seaze vpon them:<note place="margin">Ezech. 33.7.8.</note> otherwise the people shall die in their sinnes, but their blood shall be required at the watchmens hands. The consideration of which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the intire loue which I beare to my deare countrie, hath made me willing, whom the Lord hath vouchsafed this great and excellent calling, to beate down, as much as in me lieth, foure capitall sins of this land, prophane Swearing, beastly Drūkennes, filthie Whordome, and corrupting Bribery; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are so odious and abominable in Gods sight, that they make our whole countrie liable to his wrath, and to stand indangered to the fearefullest of his iudgements; and also because I perceiue that they are not in the wane, but in the increase; and that like fretting cankers, they spread further and further in the body of our State; so that if those members which are alreadie infected bee not either cured by Gods Ministers, or cut off by his lawfull Magistrates, it is to be feared that these sores of sinne will grow despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and past hope of any cure. The which my poore labours I desired should offer themselues vnto the publicke view vnder the safe-guard of you honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble patronage, being mooued thereunto both by mine owne loue, and your fitnesse: my loue towards your Honours, being chiefely grounded vpon your loue towards God, and to his true religion, shewed both in your holy profession and Christian practise, hath imboldned me to leaue vnto the world this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall testimonie of your worth, and my good-will; and maketh me beleeue, that these my workes shrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="4"/>vnder your names shal find with you kind accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, not vpon presumption of their worth, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the nature of loue to cause a man hopefully to expect for correspondencie of affection in them whom it loueth, though there be almost no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in desert. Neither could I find fitter patrons for treatises of this nature; for who are more fit then the vertues and religious to defend and countenance such discourses as tend to the vpholding and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of vertue and pietie, and to the suppressing and beating down of vice and wickednesse? and who are more able to daunt the courages of the vicious and malicious, which are daily ready to wreck their spight vpon those who inueigh against their darling sinnes, then they, whose vertuous disposition is both graced and strengthened with honour and eminencie of place, and also with the gracious fauour of our dread Soueraigne? As therefore I haue respectiuelie dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated these my labours vnto your Honours, so accept them with your wonted kindnesse, and vouchsafe them at your leasured your perusall, and me your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable fauours; so shall I bee more and more bound to pray vnto the Lord, that he will grant vnto your Honors a daily increase of grace and true honor in this world, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glorie and happines in the world to come.</p>
