   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL AND RELIGIOVS Magistrates, Christian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and other Inhabitants of the Citie of NORWICH, <hi>sauing-health in</hi> IESVS CHRIST.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and right deare to me in the Lord, J ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously acknowledge, that when J did obserue the
<pb facs="4"/> publike testimonie that God gaue to the word of his Grace, in the Sermon following, euidenced not onely by your religious attention therunto, with gracious aspect, and long continued patience in hearing mee, for the space almost of two houres; but also by the generall, and thankefull recognition of the same, by many, very many, of
<pb facs="4"/> sundrie sorts, in your Citie, I did (as was meet) hereat much reioyce in spirit before the Lord, gaue him the glorie, and blessed you, in praying for you.</p>
   <p>The next day going forth into the streets of your Citie, to see and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute some of my friends, I found (vpon discourse) that many were desirous to inioy the seruice of my
<pb facs="5"/> Pen vpon this subiect, for their further vse: wherewith when J had acquainted some of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place, and amongst others, that learned, and graue Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Doctor <hi>Suckling,</hi> Deane of <hi>Norwich,</hi> who hauing beene him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a hearer of me, did (I beleeue) euen out of his feeling, and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, assure mee, that
<pb facs="5"/> herein J might doe good seruice to God, and to his people.</p>
   <p>Vpon these and other Christian incouragemēts I said in my heart, Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this thing seemeth to come of the Lord, whose J am, and whom I serue in the Gospell of his Sonne, who also best knowes what to doe with me, and my seruice. So J did (and indeed durst
<pb facs="6"/> not but) consent, at least to trie what herein the Lord would be pleased to doe by mee, for you. Whereupon J returning home, did surueigh my written Meditations, and Notes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by recouered some losses of memorie, recollected my spirits, and put on hard for God and his people: and by the helpe of his holy grace finished
<pb facs="6"/> thus this little Frame, and Jmpression of the publike <hi>Seale of the Churches safetie.</hi> And when this weake concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my barren brest was brought to light, by the hand of a publike professed Midwife, J meane, the Printer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring well, that as J stood for Father, and therefore tooke vpon me to giue it a Name, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb facs="7"/> to the nature of the Matter subiect, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that you were to me herein in stead of publik Witnesses; J hereupon eft-soones resolued, that it was no lesse reasonable then religious for mee, when I had done with it what J would, &amp; could, to return it home againe vnto you; that so you might take it as your owne, possesse it, patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
<pb facs="7"/> it, and imploy it in your seruice, as you shuld thinke fit. Welcome then in gracious loue (Thou louing &amp; truly religious Citie of <hi>Norwich</hi>) this written Monument, and real Euidence of my true loue, respect, and thankefulnesse to thee, &amp; thine, in Iesus Christ: and let this be (as God hath appointed it) some weake meanes to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb facs="8"/> thy Memorie, and Honor vnto Posteritie.</p>
   <p>And now, my holy Brethren,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.1.</note> partakers of the heauenly vocation, giue me leaue vpon this occasion, to speake a good word vnto you, from the Lord our good God, in Jesus Christ. Seeing the Lord of Heauen and Earth hath in speciall mercy seated your free and faithfull Citie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="8"/> the pale of this English Paradise, and in the same doth still betrust and honor you with the vnspeakable treasure of his heauenly Truth, and holy Ordinances, and that in the hand of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny able, and faithfull Ministers of Jesus Christ, whom hee hath sent, and set as blessings to your Citie, euen as the celestiall Light &amp; Salt
<pb facs="9"/> of the same: seeing also that you doe happily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy, and sway the Sword of ciuill Gouernement, and vnder the same are blessed with Health, Peace, Plentie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfortable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of life, and estate: And finally, seeing the Lord Iehouah, the great Patrone and Protector of this our English Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, hath also made you,
<pb facs="9"/> and your Citie glorious, by great deliuerances (both in generall, and in special) from extreme dangers of vtter desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and namely, in that your singular preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the rage and ruines of <hi>Kets</hi> Campe, (and whiles you liue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, propagate the memorie thereof vnto your posteritie, by a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious obseruation of the
<pb facs="10"/> time, matter, and mercy of <hi>GOD</hi> towards you therein.) Also in your, and our late admirable freedome from the fierie effects of that hellish, Popish powder-treason: Let all these gracious &amp; ample euidences of Gods fauor, and fatherly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence to you, &amp; yours, affect, inlarge, and settle your Christian soules so deeply in the true faith,
<pb facs="10"/> feare, and loue of God, as may cause you to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound more and more in euery good word, and worke appertayning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; and therein giue God the glory due to his Name, send in daily vnto him Tributs of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; Presents of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, both in priuate, and publike. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, liuing and dying, giue his holy Ministers,
<pb facs="11"/> and faithfull People, that liue with you, iust cause daily to blesse you in praying for you: which verily, vpon tryall, will prooue not the weakest way to build vp your Houses, your Honour, and Happinesse, both in Earth and Heauen.</p>
   <p>But lest I should seeme ouer-bold, or busie with you (my good Brethren &amp; Fathers) who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb facs="11"/> do aboūd with good Monitors, and doe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily carry the best about you in your owne brests, I will here seasonably su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spend my officious Pen, &amp; conclude with praier to God on your behalfe; That it would please his holy Maiestie aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to blesse vnto you, and yours, all the means and helps of holinesse (and this amongst the
<pb facs="12"/> rest) which you do inioy, vntill that good worke of his Grace, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in you, shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for the praise of his glorious rich Grace in Iesus Christ, In whom J shall willingly rest</p>
