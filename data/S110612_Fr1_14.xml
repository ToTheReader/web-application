   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Usicke</hi> in ancient times, was held in as great <hi>Estimation, Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> by the <hi>Best vnderstandings</hi> and <hi>Noblest Bloods,</hi> as any <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Liberall</hi> whatsoeuer. The <hi>Graue Philosophers</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted it an <hi>Inuention</hi> of the <hi>Gods,</hi> which they had bestowed on <hi>Men,</hi> to make them <hi>better conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,</hi> then bare <hi>Nature</hi> affoorded: And the <hi>Wise Grecians</hi> therefore educated their children in <hi>it,</hi> that by meanes of <hi>it,</hi> they might <hi>temper</hi> their mindes, and fully settle therein, the <hi>Vertues</hi> of <hi>Modestie and Honesty:</hi> and, (in a word) <hi>all of worth</hi> euer held it, a very <hi>Direct</hi> and <hi>Necessary</hi> course, for the best <hi>Institution of Life,</hi> and <hi>Correction of ill manners.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The <hi>Causes</hi> then of that <hi>Disrepute, and ouer lowe Estimation,</hi> which <hi>Musicke</hi> in these dayes, (for the most part) sustaines, and whether they proceed from <hi>Corruptions of Nature,</hi> or <hi>Art,</hi> or both, as long since I began to meruaile at, so had I now vttered some obseruations thereabout, had not counsaile, and discretion perswaded me a while for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exact suruay.</p>
   <p>I had then (amidst other things) vnfolded on the one side, both the <hi>Naturall,</hi> and also the <hi>Politick Affector</hi> and
<pb facs="12"/>
      <hi>Entert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>yner</hi> of our <hi>Art,</hi> and on the other side, the strange <hi>imbecillity of our Professors,</hi> a great part of them <hi>Profest Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>sters,</hi> able (they will vndertake) fully to teach both <hi>precepts</hi> and <hi>Practise</hi> of our <hi>Art,</hi> in one poore yeare, (or lesse if you will:) and yet (spoken it shall be without offence) the most of them, not well vnderstanding the very <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Sound,</hi> or the <hi>Difference</hi> of <hi>P. operties,</hi> the <hi>Distinction</hi> of <hi>Tones,</hi> the <hi>Diuision</hi> of <hi>Numbers and Measures,</hi> the <hi>inaequalitie</hi> of <hi>Proportions,</hi> nay, scarse Defining the nature of that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,</hi> Maisters whereof they professe themselues to be.</p>
   <p>I had likewise poynted at some other abuses, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and suffered by <hi>Musicks Professors,</hi> as well in <hi>Ecclesiasticke as Common Seruice,</hi> whereby the one, findes his Due Right empay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed; &amp; the other, his Estimation; and both, their Abilities.</p>
   <p>As for those common kinde <hi>Practitioners,</hi> (truly ycleped <hi>Minstrells,</hi> though our City makes <hi>Musitians</hi> of them) who making account forsooth to doe the <hi>Art</hi> Honour, now in these daies of the ill opinion, and small credit it beares, haue (fairely) brought it downe from a cheife <hi>Liberall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> to the basest almost of <hi>Mechanick Functions:</hi> I make no question, but in good time it may returne vpon their owne necks, and their Desert be rewarded, as Statute in that case hath already (most worthily) prouided.</p>
   <p>Besides, I suppose I should hardly haue omitted the Beleefe (whereof I finde some <hi>Aery</hi> or <hi>Instrumentall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers</hi> and <hi>Practitioners</hi> to be) concerning certaine Vices, which their Ignorance is perswaded, our <hi>Art</hi> receiues helpe by, how disagreeing soeuer, both to <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>eason,</hi> which is the soule of all <hi>Arts.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And then for amends of all, I should at last, haue affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded somewhat in the generall precepts, both of <hi>Plaine,</hi> and <hi>Measurable Musick,</hi> in the many <hi>Diuersities,</hi> which the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Compositions</hi> giue vs, from the very <hi>originall</hi> of them, to
<pb facs="12"/>
that <hi>excellencie,</hi> wherein the <hi>Art</hi> is now to be found, and in divers other particulars tending to the same effect.</p>
   <p>But now in the meane time, let the <hi>Affector</hi> shew his <hi>Disposition,</hi> and the <hi>Professor</hi> his <hi>Art,</hi> to both whome I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that when e're I proceed in it, I will be free and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall, as Rule and Reason onely giues me, laying my Obseruations, and so desiring (if it may be) the restitution of our Science, to Due, and ancient Honour.</p>
   <p>And till then (if at all they loue the <hi>Art</hi>) they shall well accept of my good will, and (with me) take in good worth, these <hi>various Sprightfull, Delightfull Harmonies,</hi> which now I bring them. Their <hi>Composure</hi> I dare warrant, 'tis not onely of <hi>Ayre,</hi> made for some small tickling of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sence alone, but a great deale more solide, and sweetly vnited to <hi>Number, Measures,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Ditty.</hi> The earnest affections which a man hath, in the vse of such <hi>Recreations</hi> as they are made for, are so fully exprest in them, for <hi>Tact, Prolation,</hi> and <hi>Diminution,</hi> that not onely the <hi>Ignorant</hi> Eare must needs be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with them, for their <hi>Variety</hi> of <hi>sweet Stray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>es,</hi> and the <hi>Humorous Fantastick</hi> eare satisfied, in the <hi>Iocundity</hi> of their many <hi>Changes,</hi> but also the <hi>Iudicious</hi> hearer will finde that in them, which passes the <hi>Outward</hi> sence, &amp; strikes a <hi>rare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of Passion</hi> vpon the <hi>Mind</hi> it selfe, that attends them.</p>
   <p>I will take so much <hi>Iudgement</hi> vpon me, as to affirme, I finde a <hi>great</hi> part of them so, though (without any tryall) the very <hi>Naming</hi> of those <hi>two Worthies</hi> in their <hi>Art, and Times,</hi> (and especially in these <hi>kinds</hi>) who first <hi>Composed</hi> that part I now speake of, is warrant inough for such a Beleefe of them Maister <hi>Edward Pearce</hi> the first, sometimes Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Children of Saint <hi>Paules</hi> in London, and there my Maister, a man of singular eminency in <hi>his Profession,</hi> both in the <hi>Educating</hi> of <hi>Children</hi> for the ordering of the <hi>Voyce</hi> so, as the <hi>Quality</hi> might afterward <hi>credit</hi> him and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre</hi>
      <pb facs="13"/>
them: And also in those his <hi>Compositions</hi> to the Lute, whereof, the world enioyes many, (as from the <hi>Maister</hi> of that Instrument) together with his skilfull In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions for other Instruments too, as his fruits can beare him witnesse.</p>
   <p>The second I name, as partner in this worke, is Maister <hi>Iohn Bennet,</hi> a Gentleman admirable for all kindes of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posures,</hi> either <hi>in Art, or Ayre, Simple or Mixt,</hi> of what Nature soeuer. I can easily beleeue he had som what more then <hi>Art,</hi> euen some <hi>Naturall instinct</hi> or <hi>Better Inspiration,</hi> by which, in all his workes, the very <hi>life</hi> of that <hi>Passion,</hi> which the <hi>Ditty</hi> sounded, is so truely exprest, as if he had measured it alone by his owne Soule, and inuented no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Harmony,</hi> then his owne sensible feeling in that <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> did affoord him.</p>
   <p>As for this little worke, and the Diuersities therein, they appertayne all, to the common <hi>Recreations</hi> that men take, and therein vtter that Passion which men discouer in the vse of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
