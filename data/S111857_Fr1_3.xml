   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou Eye of</hi> Europe, <hi>the Soule, the Heart, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of all thy neighbours;</hi> France, <hi>Mother of curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and our ancient friend:</hi> Suffer, that (with a voice of Brasse) I may make heard through all the Corners of the earth, &amp; euen to those worldes which yet are furthest off, cry out to that <hi>Iacobine</hi> Monke, and that <hi>Proselite</hi> PELLITIER, <hi>Do no euil at al vnto my King.</hi> For so cryed out the Sonne of <hi>Croesus,</hi> dumbe all his life time before, vntill hee saw the sword drawne to wound his father. If the childe for the Father, why not then the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect for his Prince? Their loue ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or equall, &amp; (in semblable actions) alike also ought to bee their duties, because the people are helde to be the Princes Children.
<pb facs="5"/>For I see, that these two audacious and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous <hi>Phaetons,</hi> do labour by their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering answeres (as with a <hi>Delphian</hi> sword) to open the bosome or breast of MY KING, to strike at his heart with a deadly stab, and to giue him the lie more couertly, then <hi>Tortus</hi> (to his shame) hath doone, coueting to impresse lies and falsities in the soules of euery one.</p>
   <p>Their painted speeches and goodly prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations, makes my haire stand vp as affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, pales my countenance, smites my hart, &amp; teares open my lippes, to entreat you (good <hi>Frenchmen</hi>) to credite them no further, then <hi>Our King</hi> hath done. Hee alwayes deriueth sound iudgement from words, &amp; by the verie mouing of the toong he knoweth the harts of them that make such Orations to him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in beholding their books, he hath saide with God, <hi>Hilabijs me honorant, cor autē eorum longe est a me. These men honor me with their lips, but their harts are far off from me.</hi> In like maner there is nothing more daungerous then the teeth of a Serpent hid vnder greene hearbes, and the throat of a wolfe, hauing on a sheeps
<pb facs="5"/>habit. Wo be to them that cal euill good, and good euill; that make darknesse light, and light darknesse, and that call bitternesse sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and sweetnesse bitternes. Wo be to you <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisies, Hypocrites,</hi> for you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe both sea and land, to the end, to make one <hi>Proselite:</hi> and when he is made, you yeild him vp as the Sonne of Hell, doouble worse then your selues.</p>
   <p>What impudence was it in a cloistred Priest, &amp; in a priuat person, to shew himselfe in open field, to cope with a great and powerful king, when Kinges haue beene at all times without Peere, and free from fight, except it were with others kings? Honor is not to be had, but by an equal: &amp; <hi>Alexander,</hi> being desirous to win the prize, in the course of the <hi>Olimpian</hi> games, demanded continually: <hi>Is there any kings that runne?</hi> The like may our King very well que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: <hi>Is there any Kings that answere?</hi> Jt is to them to whom his Maiesty hath directed his aduertisement, and it is to them only to make answere.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Monarkes, Kings, Princes,</hi> and <hi>Potentates</hi> of <hi>Christendome,</hi> where are your Prouost Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shals
<pb facs="6"/>then? Where are your <hi>Lictours</hi> and <hi>Sergeants,</hi> to seize on these saucy gamesters? Where are your Lawes and Edicts, to punish these proud presumers, that durst set footing within your Lists, to steppe before you in so faire a Race or Carriere? Stirre <hi>Magistrates,</hi> lay hold on these base Hackny-runners, in so braue a fight, and do you beat downe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence of these rash headed <hi>Athletes,</hi> or male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part Champions. There lackes Tortures for <hi>Tortus,</hi> to breake the bridles of such silly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked soules, and bolster their crazed braines a little better; to the end, to make <hi>Coeffeteau</hi> confesse, and <hi>Pelletier</hi> professe the truth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, according to the rule of truth it selfe.</p>
   <p>These prooues, are to bee vanquished with other Reasons, then those whereby they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to refute them, else it wil neuer be done. Heresy findeth daily something to re-say, and to confound Paper withall: some meanes to saue himselfe either by flight, or obstinacy of opinion, because he wil neuer confesse his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, much lesse deliuer vp his Armes. Euen so the <hi>Pharisies</hi> and the <hi>Saduces,</hi> being beaten
<pb facs="6"/>downe by the mouth Diuine, would yet sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly exalt themselues again, without confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing either their fal, or the offence. So <hi>Pericles,</hi> throwne headlong downe, and euen almost buried in the dust, would yet perswade the whole Theater, that he deserued to be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. So that <hi>Hippomachus</hi> (of whome <hi>Plinie</hi> speaketh) and the other of the <hi>Acolians,</hi> would needs be proclaimed victorious conquerors, after they had breathed forth theirs soules vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their enemies feete. And so this <hi>Antaeus,</hi> and his companions, already stifled in the gripes of our <hi>Christian Hercules,</hi> would faine perswade the worlde, that being themselues vanquished, yet they stand vp still as vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers. All such brablings and contentious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, doe but whet on Choller, and harden bad spirits, as being more apt to moue sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and disobedience, then to affoorde anie fruitfull edifying.</p>
   <p>Let then their shamelesse fore-heads bee circkled with Crownes, such as the Romains vsed in their <hi>Consull</hi> festiuals, for their <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Monsters, rather then any answeare bee
<pb facs="7"/>made vnto them, except it be by the hand of <hi>Thomas Dury,</hi> our Maister <hi>Guillaume.</hi> Let the Laurell wreaths be wrung out of their hands, to impale the victorious head of our IAMES, truely <hi>Triumphant,</hi> ouer <hi>Pagan Idolatrie,</hi> and <hi>Popish Heresie,</hi> which is the subiect of this my present labour, and the whole desseign of this discourse, as appeareth in the Frontispice of the main building. Thus are <hi>His Trophees</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and limmed (through by an vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Pensill) in his victories, deriued from the writing of his Royall Aduertisement.</p>
   <p>This is the full ayme of mine intention <hi>(Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious French-men)</hi> and that which I desire to shew vnto you <hi>(Deare Children of Heauen)</hi> to the end, that you may not suffer your selues to bee perswaded in the contrarie, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing Language, subtle Arguings, Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stries, and captious arguments of this Doctor Diuinity-destroyer, and the discoursing <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiaste,</hi> least of wise French-men, you becom with them, mad and insensed <hi>Galathians.</hi> The very written book it selfe doth furnish vs with strength sufficient, to vanquish and conuince
<pb facs="7"/>all the answerers of the worlde, and their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers; not turning any one leafe of his book, but it deliuereth many most expresse Texts of the holy Scriptures, as many goodly places out of the holy fathers, as many Canons of the chiefest Counsellers, with many rich &amp; strong arguments, and al set downe by his Maiesty.</p>
   <p>It is to you <hi>(Generous French-men)</hi> that I speake this, and to whom I desire to make it manifest: for though the speaking, or willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to make it knowne to you of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, should be but in me as lost labor, yet must J needs speake it againe, beeing no more but what you know, what you haue seene, and what hath bin published. So many mouthes are as so many Trumpets of his greatnesse in great <hi>Brittaine;</hi> so many hearts, they are as so many Temples of his vertues; and so many soules, are as many Vowes and Sacrifices to his faire name. Among them, J am but as one voice, yet now driuen to the vniuersall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort of the whol worlds voices. For if my voice could bee vnderstoode from the East to the West, from the North to the South: nay, if it could pierce from this low center of the earth
<pb facs="8"/>to the highest circumference of the Jmperiall heauen: I would cal al Noble Spirits to com, to see Idolatry subdued, and Heresie vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and I would entreate them, to beeleue that which I say vnto you, for an assured ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whereof Heauen, Earth, Men, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, are faithfull and vnreprooueable witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. My words do sauour rather of the salt of a pure affection, then the Oyle of supple flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; My penne shal neuer be <hi>Ioabs</hi> Dagger, to stab <hi>Abner</hi> backward: My life is innocent, my heart Christian, My tongue to Scottish, &amp; he is too good and wise a King, to bee flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any.</p>
   <p>But to accommodate my selfe to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of these insolents, who haue made <hi>French</hi> answeres to a <hi>Latine.</hi> Booke, I shall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to expresse my conceite of their Idiome, and imitate (as wel as I can) the steppes of our <hi>French Orators.</hi> Wherein I will loose no time for excusing my selfe, either for my harsh and vnelegant language, fearing the reply (in el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der time) made by <hi>Cato</hi> vnto the Historian <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="8"/>
   <p>The courteous and Charitable <hi>Frenchman,</hi> in considering the good and free will, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I march on in this matter, and for his instruction; will amiably correct the Errours of my Penne and the Presse, which manie (in like fauour) haue amended in our Language. In this affaire, their blowes do touch vs, their Iests and Sportes do inuite vs, their Reasons do driue vs, and their daily desires ought to mooue vs.</p>
   <p>But if any base and creeping soule, if anie deiected spirite, or if some Monke or Priest shall recreate his leysure by this writing, and purge his salt soule of those foule slaunders, breathed foorth with so many wry mouthes, &amp; apish faces, with such bending the browes, and snuffes in the nose, and which (no doubt) he will vse in reading this worke: One Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell braunch of MY KING (onely) shall bee my Warrant, from the sparkeling flashes of such false fires, and his glorious Name shall serue me as the Shield of <hi>Minerua,</hi> against all their impoysoned Arrowes of <hi>Nessus</hi> and <hi>Philocteres.</hi> Let euery <hi>Momus, Zoylus,</hi> and all
<pb facs="9"/>insenced Censurers examine this little Booke Letter by letter; let them measure the Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, weigh the Words, controule the points and Virgulers; let them peruse the Periods, count the Pages, and turne ouer the leaues: I will protest onely for my Apology, that I haue taken the Rule, Squire, Plummet, and compasse in forming it, only to enform them in a solid truth.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, cruell apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, bristle not vppe your haires against mee; affrighted horrours, seeke not to shake my soule anie more; panicke terrours, leaue my heart at large, and my tongue at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie; to the end, that I may bidde them; <hi>Go out, go out of Babylon flye from behind her, Be not ouerthrowne in her iniquities. But publish this with a loude voyce, as a Song of Tryumph, and speake it vnto the vtmost part of
<pb facs="9"/>the Earth:</hi> THE ETERNALL HATH RRDEEMED HIS SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VANT IAMES.</p>
   <closer>
      <salute>
         <hi>Farewell then France.</hi> My well beloued, and take this for thy present, and the guift of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</salute>
