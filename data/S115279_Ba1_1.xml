      <hi>THus have I presented you with a large scene of late severall examples of Gods judgements upon Sabbath-breakers, and such</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">So the Statute of 1.

To which I might annexmany ancient Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents of like nature which I pretermit, onley one excepted, which is remarkable.</hi> In the yeare of our Lord 1583. in the famous Metropolis of this our Land, the City of London, two Citizens the one leaving his wife, the other her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and committing adultery together on the Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, it pleased God to strike them dead with fire from heaven, whilst they were in in the very act of uncleannes, their bodies being left dead in the place halfe burnt up, sending out a most loathsome savour, for a spectacle of Gods avenging justice unto others, to teach them both to shun the sin of adultery and of Sabbath-breaking too, <hi>and to take heed how they commit any sin or wickednesse at any time and especially on Gods sacred day, or how they follow daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, may-games, morisdaunces, ales, and such lascivious pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,</hi>

themselves to be gorgeous and gay, they rest in excesse and superfluity, in gluttony and drunkennesse (as they <hi>doe at wakes, Ales, and May-poles</hi>) like ratts and swine, they rest in brawling and rayling, in quarrelling and fighting, they rest in wantonnes (<hi>and what else is dauncing, moris-dauncing, maygaming &amp;c.</hi>) into-ish talking, in filthy fleshlines, so that it doth too evidently appeare, that God is more disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and the devill better served on Sunday, then upon all the dayes of the weeke besides. And I assure you, that the beasts that are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to rest on the Sunday, honour God better then this kind of people, for they offend not God, they breake not their holy dayes. Wherefore, O ye people of God, lay your hands upon your hearts, repent and amend this grievous and dangerous wickednesse, stand in awe of the commandement of God, gladly followe the example of God himselfe, be not disobedient to the godly order of Christs Church used and kept from the Apostles times untill this day, feare the displeasure and just plagues of Allmighty God if ye be negligent, and forbeare not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring and travailing on the <note n="*" place="margin">See the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily 8. times styles the Lords day and the 3. homily of rebellion twice.</note> SABBATH DAY, and doe not resort together to celebrate and magnifie Gods blessed name in quiet holinesse and godly reverence. <hi>I shall conclude all with the words of the Councell of</hi> Paris under Lewis and Lotharius. <hi>Anno 829. li. 1. c. 50. &amp;. li. 3. c. 5. &amp; 19. Multa alia terribilia judicia &amp;c.</hi> Many other terrible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have bene, and hetherto are, whereby is declared how much God is offended with the dishonour of this day. Wherefore the Imperiall highnesse is specially to be implored of the <note n="‡" place="margin">Note.</note> Preists, that this power ordained of God for the honour and reverence of so great a day, may put a feare into all men, least none of what condiō soever


<pb n="41" facs="26"/>
presume on this holy and venerable day to use these and the likesports, dauncings and leapings hereafter, because while they doe these things, they both darken the glory of Christianity, and give occasion to the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of Christs name the more to dishonour him.</p>
   <p>We require also, and earnestly intreat, that in the observation of the Lords day, as we have a longe time beseeched you, you use due care that unlesse great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity constraine you, free your selves on that day, as much as may be from worldly cares and sollicitousnesse. And that which becometh the honour of so great a day, that both you your selves doe it, and by your example doe teach and compell yours to doe it.</p>
   <p>We wholsomly admonish all faithfull people, that they give due honour and reverence to the Lords day, because the dishonour of this day doth both much swarue and abhorre from Christian religion, and doth without doubt procure the perill of soules to the violaters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; <hi>And with that of the</hi> Councell of Burges, <hi>an. 1582. apud Bachellum Decreta Ecclesiae Gall. l. 4. Tit. 7. c. 21.</hi> All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Lords dayes and holy dayes are instituted only for this purpose, that faithfull Christians abstaining from externall and gainfull works, might more freely and with greater piety give themselves to divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and to the meditation of the infinite benefits of Gods goodnesse towards mankinde, and so being WHOLLY taken up with the wholsome duties of religion, should diligently beware as <hi>Ignatius</hi> admonisheth the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that they should not abuse holy dayes with any disgrace or injuries, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in our times, it preposterously and usually comes to passe, that both solemne and religious


<pb n="42" facs="27"/>
dayes are not only spent in transacting, unlawfull and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular businesse, but likewise in luxury, lasciviousnesse, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited sports and pastimes Revells, and the exercising of other wickednesses, whereupon it is not to be doubted, that for the greatest part, so many calamities wherewith we are so long since consumed are justly inflicted on us by God, who is incensed against us by so great wickednes. To appease whose present anger and likewise to avert his greater indignation hanging over our heads: we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all Parish Priests of our Province, that they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and seriously admonish the people, that on Lords dayes they not only keepe themselves from all prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited works, but likewise that they be <hi>ex animo</hi> cordially and religiously, present at all sacred misteries of the Church, and at the preaching of Gods word, and that they pretermit not the works of piety in releiving the poore, comforting the afflicted, and in doing other pious things, wherein Christian profession and charity do most of all shine forth. And we exhort all Magistrates accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their and our duety, as farre as possibly we may, that they would take care, that those holy and solemne dayes should be holily and piously celebrated, this being principally in their power, and belonging to their charge. Neither verily can any manner of Governing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, be better or more praise worthy then that which gives the first place and care to divine worship and religion.</p>
