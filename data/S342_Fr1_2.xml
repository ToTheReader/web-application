                 <title>A most excellent and profitable dialogue, of the powerfull iustifying faith : shewing what it is to beleeue in God, and what wonders are wrought by the power of beliefe, be it worldly or diuine; and what things do hinder beliefe. Also how a man may hate himselfe, and by faith forsake himselfe, and kill the deeds of the flesh. The effect of the talke is this: that he which beleeueth in God, and in his son Iesus Christ, is able by the power of that beliefe, to mortifie his flesh, with the lusts thereof, through the holy Ghost, and to serue God in spirit and truth.

   <head>TO THE CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, amongst the multitude of books both written and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that be at this day spread abroade in the world, I lighted vpon this little Treatise of Faith: wherein perceiuing a matter handled, so necessary &amp; needfull to be read and knowne of all men, especially in these dangerous (if not desperate) daies, wherin iniquity haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the vpper hand: and men are growne so blinde, that they striue more about the chaffe,
<pb facs="3"/>
then for the pure wheate corne it selfe, and content themselues to feede rather on the leaues then on the fruit of the fig tree; that is, more to talke of an imagined faith, then to know, haue, and enioy in themselues, the true, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull, and liuing faith,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 1.11. Rom. 6.2.4. Prou. 15.</note> which is a daily dying to sin, &amp; rising to righteousnesse. Seeing the same, I say, a worke so necessary to bee knowne of all men, I thought it good, being also perswaded thereto by many that haue found great benefite by it, to be a means for the printing of it; that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer haue any zeale or desire to know the true faith, and to haue it with the fruites thereof effectually in himselfe, as is said
<pb facs="3"/>
he may view himselfe in this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pithy Treatise of the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful faith. The title with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors name was torne out before it came to my hands: but whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was the Writer, the matter will shew from whence it came. And so the almighty God which liueth euerlastingly, plant his true feare and faith in our hearts,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.1. Gal. 5.6.</note> that being iustified by this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful faith that worketh through loue, we may haue peace with God, through Iesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
