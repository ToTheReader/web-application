   <p>For my part Right Honorable, some-what
in this booke, as heretofore in other treatises
I haue done, and by Gods assistance and the
lawfull fauour of my Superiours, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
to the displaying of her filthines more
and more to the world. For wel I see, which
that most Reuerend Father and blessed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
<hi>Maister Latimer</hi> did long since obserue,
that th'impudencie of this whore is excce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great and intolerable, and therefore,


<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>where occasion shall be giuen she is to
be gauled and spurgauled too</hi>
      <note n="i" place="margin">M Latimer his last wordes in his confer. with B. Ridley bout the Lords Supper.</note>, seeing
no better she will prooue. That which I looke
for at her handes, is but mortal hatred, for
my labour. For so do harlots requite such as of
good-wil, laie open vnto them their vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that they may amend.</p>
   <p>And surely as in some thinges aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
so otherwise me-thinkes she doth nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
resemble the brothels and harlots of the
world, &amp; therfore diuinelie by Gods spirite is
entituled the whore of Babylon. For harlots, if
they loue you, and you will not with like loue
answere them againe, they will hate you as
<hi>Putiphars</hi> wife did <hi>Ioseph</hi>
      <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 39. v. 7. 8. &amp;c.</note>, and those

right hand tooke the crowne of the kings head
and put it on her owne, and strooke the King
with her left hand; Leaue them once, &amp; giue
your selfe to lead an honest life, either solelie or
in holie wedlocke, and they will pursue you
with malice euen vnto the death, as the late
murther of <hi>Abel Bourne</hi> is memorable<note n="q" place="margin">Viewe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pmples.</note>, to
this purpose.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
So this whore of Babylon, if you loue her
not againe, she louing you, she wil hate you euen
vnto the death; If you loue her, she will abuse
you, &amp; that too shamefully; If you praeferring
a Godlie life agreeable to Gods holy word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her wicked companie, and cast her of, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will pacifie her till she see your blood.</p>
   <p>Of <hi>England</hi> this whore would be loued, but
<hi>England</hi> will bee chaste still with <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
and <hi>Susanna:</hi> and therefore <hi>England</hi> is
extremely hated. <hi>Spaine</hi> loueth this whore,
and <hi>Spaine</hi> is abused, shee sitteth on the
Kinges right hand, shee taketh his Crowne
with her right hand, &amp; puts it on her owne
hed, and with her left hand she strikes him
on the face; hee gapeth and gazeth on her,
poore soule; if shee laugh at him, hee laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and if shee be angrie with him, he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
till shee bee reconciled: yea hee will
not spare his owne bloud to enioy her loue<note n="r" place="margin">Apologie of the Pr. of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range.</note>.
<hi>France</hi> leaft her companie, what say I, leaft?
he onely cast a friendlie countenance towardes
the lambes wife, and her faithful seruantes,
&amp; she was inflamed with iealousie forthwith,
she could not be pleased, she feared he would
cast her of, or not feed her malicious humor,
and therefore a brother of that brothel house
