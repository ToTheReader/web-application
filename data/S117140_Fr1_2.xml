   <head>To the gentle Reader.</head>
   <p>IT may be, gentle Reader, that the basenesse of the Title, wil cause a contempt of this Booke, as the homely shape of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> tables without, made men thinke, they had bene of no better forme within. But as they, being vnfolded, were found very faire: So per aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vnder so plain a cloke,
<pb facs="3"/>
thou shalt see suche stuffe, as may content thy minde. I remember that when the <hi>Florentines</hi> sēt an embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the king of <hi>Naples</hi> who behaued himselfe very wisely, the King did aske what maner a man he was in his coūtrey, and when it was tolde him that he was an Apothecary: If the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, (quoth the king) be so wyse and learned in <hi>Florence,</hi> what be their
<pb facs="3"/>
Physitians? If I shall shew thee, that the setter forth of this treatise was a tailer of <hi>Florence,</hi> thou maist vse the kings curtesie, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the booke the better, for if tailers be so wel giuen ther, what be they that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse lerning? A Couper was the occasiō why he toke pain this way: which Couper of a plaine man, had a good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural discourse, and as some men when they be olde, will
<pb facs="4"/>
talke sometime with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: so the talke that olde Iust the Couper hadde with himself, when he coulde not slepe, did minister matter to the maker of this presente booke: who by other occasion hath made diuers other to his cōmendatiō, in the <hi>Tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane</hi> tong. I finde that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion may doe muche. For had not I had once a man, that vsed often to talk with him self, and a felow, whose
<pb facs="4"/>
name was Iust, as it might wel be, I had no more remē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the talk of father Iust of <hi>Florence,</hi> which I red when I was ther, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght no more of. But as <hi>Iohn Baptista Gellie,</hi> for so is the Tailer called, and for his wisedom, chief of the vulgar vniuersitie of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> when I was ther, did publish these communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Iust the Couper, and his Soule, Gathered by one
<pb facs="5"/>
sir <hi>Byndo</hi> his nephew, and a Notarie. So I haue for a passing of the time, caused the same to be put in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, that my Countrey men may see how learning may appere in all sortes of men, and they deserue praise whē they will vse it well. And so (o Reader,) maist thou vse thy pleasure, and doe as thou shalt thinke good.</p>
