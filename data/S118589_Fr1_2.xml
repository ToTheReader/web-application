   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing at the length as well out of mine owne manifold labours, charge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, as also out of the learned and industrious practises of sundrie my well affected friends vnto the chimical and spagirical arte, obtained many rare and excellent medicines for the health of mans body, whereof I haue here g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uen some taste, reseruing a further satisfaction for those who vpon iust occasion shall at any time hereafter require the same. I haue now presumed out of the fulnesse of my affection towards my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and well deseruing place and countrey, to present and offer the best and most approoued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, which by my 17. yeeres practise, I haue gotten either out of mine own workehouse, or from other mens Laboritories, which haue spent some time in Pellicanes, circling glasses and furnesses both calcining and reuerbaratorie, &amp;c. and such like as well as my selfe. Hoping, that those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who in great kindnesse haue conferred both their receipts and cures vpon me, will not be offended though I shall rashly publish the
<pb facs="3"/>
names of some of their patients togither with mine owne, which they had happily purposed to reserue onely for their priuate remembrances. I am heere also to craue pardon of the patients them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, whose names (for the better credit of the medicines, and comfort of others that shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to fall into the like diseases) I haue aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to disclose: My offence herein I hope will be the more tolerable, because my ende and scope is charitable, ayming principally at the health of man, without the which no honour, no wealth nor any other worldly pleasure can giue any true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Herein I haue also had a speciall and honest care not to nominate any, whose infirmitie might worke either disgrace or reproch to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; neither can I iustly be taxed with a vaine-glorious &amp; vaunting humor in blazing out these cures by a Printers proclamation, saying in all Christian humilitie, I challenge no part of the glorie to my selfe, but acknowledge as I ought, that <hi>omnis salus à Domino:</hi> and likewise for that in cases either of death or torment vnto men as these are, I thinke there can be no meanes so generall or so sudden, but they will come farre short of their desires, that haue cause to vse them.</p>
   <p>Neither am I singular in this course, for men of great iudgment▪ and learning haue heretofore also made publike obseruation of their cures,
<pb facs="3"/>
and diuers of mine owne countreymen haue long since commended their speciall labours in this kinde to the world: As that painfull practizer <hi>I. Hester,</hi> who Printed a large Catalogue of his oyles and waters, vnder many strange and stately names: and <hi>Giles</hi> that anncient Chimist, who hauing blowne away his wealth in the smoake of Alchimie, did yet at the length light vpon a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samum which remaineth to be solde at this day, commended for many rare &amp; excellent vses. The credit of <hi>Moyses</hi> diet-drinke lasted a long time, and was generally vsed in the scab of <hi>Venus.</hi> And an other auncient and skilful distiller of my name doth at this present make great profit of that his excellent <hi>aqua bezoartica,</hi> with the which I dare boldly compare (be it spoken without offence) my <hi>aqua comfortans stomachū</hi> for the strengthning of any weake stomacke. Neither can I forget that full and foule-mouthed physitian D. <hi>Burcot</hi> who solde his generall purging drinke so many yeeres togither for 10. groats the quart <hi>beshite</hi> the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle (for so he vsually pronoūced the word <hi>beside.)</hi> These and many more instances in this kinde I could produce, to prooue my selfe to be no Author of nouelties. But what need I so much to insist vpon examples, seeing the medicines thēselues are such as were first deriued from the sacred closet of nature, and are now long since ratified and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="4"/>
with that sure and autentique seale of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. We see that Indian weede Tabacco, hath now found out both learned &amp; honorable patrons, being first made known by publike impression, and afterward by continuall practise euen vntill this daie: and without all respect of age, sex, comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, method or other circumstance. And why should not English simples truely and chimically prepared by English Artists haue also their free allowance, and be made familiar with English bo: dies? I rest then gentle Reader in the expectation of thy fauour, whose infirmities I pitie, and whose recouerie I desire and hope to performe. I will sell nothing, but that which I dare and will take my selfe in the same disease, for which it is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And for thy better safetie and satisfaction, I haue here contained my selfe wholy within ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and vegetable medicines, wherewith I will at all times (God willing) bereadie to furnish thee▪ at reasonable rates, out of my shop in Sheere lane neere Temple barre, faithfully and workmanlie drawne without all sophistication or adustion.</p>
