   <head>TO THE TRVELY-ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMAN, and worthy Deseruer of all Mens Loues, <hi>Master</hi> ENDYMION PORTER.</head>
   <p>SIR:</p>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you aske why, from the heapes of Men, I picke out you onely to bee that</hi> Murus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haeneus, <hi>which must defend mee, let me tell you (what you know already,) that Bookes are like the</hi> Hungarians <hi>in</hi> Paules, <hi>who haue a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge to holde out their</hi> Turkish <hi>History for any one to reade. They beg nothing, the Texted Past-bord talkes all; and if nothing be giuen, nothing is spoken, but God knowes what they thinke. If you are angry, that I thrust into your hands a Subiect of this Nature; O good Sir, take me thus far into your pardon; that it was impossible for me to beget a Better: For, the Bed on which seuen years I lay Dreaming, was filled with thornes instead of fethers, my pillow a rugged flint, my Chamberfellowes (sorrowes that day and night kept me company) the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or worse than the very Infernall Furies. Besides, I</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>herein imitate the most Courtly Reuellings; for if Lords be in the Grand Masque, in the Antimasque are Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: So in these of mine, though the Diuell bee in the one, God is in the other; nay in Both. What I send you, may perhaps seeme bitter, yet is it wholesome; your best Physicke is not a Iulep; sweete sawces leaue rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bodies. There is a</hi> Hell <hi>named in our Creede, and a</hi> Heauen, <hi>and the</hi> Hell <hi>comes before: If we looke not into the first, we shall neuer liue in the last. Our tossing vp and downe (here) is the Sea, but the land of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels is our Shoare. Sayle so long as we can beare vp, through Honors, Riches, Pleasures, and all the sensuall Billowes of the World: yet there is one Harbour to put in at, and safely to arriue (There) is all the Hardnesse, all the Happinesse. Bookes are Pilots in such voyages: would mine were but one point of the Compasse, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man to steere well by I doe not thinke, but euen those Courtiers, who are most taken with the glittering of Pallaces, doe from those glorious Enter-viewes, masques, tilt-triumphs, &amp; such like, (with which their eyes are so often banqueted) reade sometimes excellēt lectures to their soules, by a comparatiue laying those transitory Ones, and those immortall beauties of heauen together. The very Roofes of kings Courts, do almost draw vs vp</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>to such a contemplation: For when the Pauements of such Places are at the best but Marble, yet the vpper seelings are like Firmaments of Starres: There you see the golden Embosments, and curious Enchainings: The true brauery is aboue.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>An excellent Dinner was that in</hi> France, <hi>when the King and Queen sáte at Table, and with them,</hi> Thomas Aquinas <hi>and</hi> Bonauentura <hi>(the two great Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.) whilst the others were feeding, one of these cast an earnest and fixed eye vpon the beauty of the Queene: at which the King wondring, asked, why hee did so? O (quoth he) if the great Worke-maister, out of a peece of clay, can mould and fashion so admirable a creature as your Queen is; I am rapt into an astonishable amazmēt, to thinke, how glorious those Bodyes are, who are Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers attending vpon his Maiesticall Throne. If I hold the Pen longer in my hand, I shall fall asleepe againe: But howsoeuer I wake, or haue mine eyes closed,—Irest</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Euer ready to do you seruice,</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Tho. Dekker.</hi>
