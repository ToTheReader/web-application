      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S in materiall build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the skil of those Workemen is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, who can cunningly frame the singular parts, and so beautifie &amp; set them forth, as that they may bee pleasant to the eye, and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for vse; as they that can make faire Walls and Windowes, a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Frontispice and comely Roofe; but they are most praise-worthy, who can well contriue the whole plot, lay a good and sure Foundation, and in due proportion can frame out and set vp the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palls and chiefe parts which sustayne and beare all the rest: so in the spirituall Edifice, they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily to be commended, who skilfully handle par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular points of Diuinitie in their Learned and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb facs="3"/> Tractates, whereby the iudgement of the Reader is thorowly informed in those diuine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and the heart and will inclined to draw them into holy vse; but, yet none deserue better of the Church of God, nor ought rather to haue their names registred with red Letters in the Kalender of the worthiest Saints, then they who in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings or Sermons, doe skilfully contriue the whole building or body of Diuinitie in a wel-framed plot, lay a sound and sure foundation, and thereupon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the chiefe Principles and most substantial parts which are the strength and stay of all the rest. For if the iudgement bee once thorowly informed in these mayne points; then is it able to deduce from them innumerable particular Conclusions for spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall information and direction in the well-orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our liues in all singular actions; then may wee with profit and without perill of falling into pernicious errours, reade the holy Scriptures, when we are able to interpret them according to these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Canons and Rules; then may we heare the Word preached with vnderstanding, and trie the spirits of those who preach vnto vs whether they bee of God or no, when wee haue skill to examine their Doctrines according to this Analogie of Faith, and can trie them by this neuer-deceiuing Touchstone, whether they bee pure metall, or but reprobate siluer, and counterfait coyne. Then shall we be more strongly armed against all assaults of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and aduersaries to the Truth, false Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and subtill Heretikes, and be better able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that Veritie which we professe, and conuince
<pb facs="3"/> them of their errours and lyes; then (wanting this helpe) if we should spend our whole time in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Controuersies, and euen dimme our eyes, and tyre our braynes in the perusing and studying of Polemicall discourses. For, these many grounds of Truth doe yeeld from them such a cleere light, that they do not only appeare in their owne bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but also discouer the blacknesse of errour, and from one Principle well vnderstood, wee inferre the falshood of innumerable contrarie Conclusions: whereof it is, that we shall very rarely obserue any well-grounded in the fundamentall points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to fall into the snares of subtill Seducers: whereas contrariwise wee may commonly see, that those who are ignorant of them, though neuer so sharpe-sighted in curious speculations, doe become an easie prey, and are quickly catched in the nets of their Sophistrie. In which respects it were much to bee wished, that both Ministers would bee more frequent and diligent in laying these grounds in their Teaching and Writing; and also that the people would receyue this more solid and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall foode with a better appetite. The which of both is too much neglected, because how soeuer these grounds are most necessarie, yet they doe not make so glorious a shew as other points lesse sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall, because like a sure foundation they are plaine and vnpolished; whereas the other being beautifully garnished with wit and eloquence, doe delight the sense, and more pleasingly worke vpon the heart and affections. And yet we must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to Gods glorie, who hath giuen these gifts to
<pb facs="4"/> men, and grace to vse them, that there haue not beene wanting in these latter times many famous Worthies, who haue happily laboured in this kind, and with great soundnesse and perspicuitie haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered and cleered these mayne points by their speaking and writing. Among which (Christian Reader) I commend vnto thee the Author of this Booke, as deseruing iustly to be ranked among the best, both for Method and Matter, sound handling of the chiefe points of Christian Religion, and for cleering by the way diuers hard places of holy Scripture. All which hee performeth in this worke with such learning, iudgement, and pietie, that had he herein respected the prayses of men, hee might well haue graced his Name with his Worke, euen as his Worke would haue beene graced by his Name, and not as one ashamed of so beautifull an off-spring haue suffered it to come abroad into the World as an Orphan, the Father still liuing, onely vnder the name of an vnworthy God-father. The which I write not to commend the Author, who as he is farre aboue my prayses in the high pitch of his owne worth; so doth he not desire, but rather shunneth them; and, as to the willing, an iniurie is no iniurie; so, an officious dutie is no benefit, but a kind of wrong, where (the partie nilling) it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and obtruded. Nor yet doe I prayse the worke for the Workers sake, which, though it commeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad without the Fathers name, yet will, I doubt not, in short time bee famous in it owne name and excellencie; but that I may with the weake thread of my censure draw thee to peruse it; and so will it
<pb facs="4"/> sufficiently commend it selfe, and giue there iust cause of praysing God for stirring vp such Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Glorie and thy good. The Lord make this and all other the godly labours of his faithfull Seruants, effectuall for magnifying of his great Name, and the further <hi>
