that as none are more familiar with God
then godly Kings: so no treatises can be
more welcome to godly kings, then such
as may draw them into greatest familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
with God. And I doubt not but
that your Highnes hauing hitherto had
<pb facs="4"/>
your heart's desires giuen you, because
you haue delighted in the Lord, wil here
after, if it be possible, much more delight
in the Lord, that he may yet giue you
more desires of your heart. Nay I am so
farre from doubting of this, that I dare
be hold to conclude with the Psalmist.</p>
         <p>The King shall reioyce in thy
strength,<note place="margin">Psal. 21. 1.</note> O Lord: exceeding glad
shall he be of thy saluation.</p>
         <p>Thou hast giuen him his hearts
desire: and hast not denied him the
request of his lippes.</p>
         <p>For thou shalt preuent him with
the blessings of goodnes: and shalt
set a crowne of pure gold vpon his
head.</p>
         <p>His honour is great in thy saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
glorie and great worship shalt
thou lay vpon him.</p>
         <p>For thou shalt giue him euerlasting
felicitie: and make him glad with the
ioy of thy countenance.</p>
         <p>
            <pb facs="4"/>
And why? Because the King put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his trust in the Lord: and in the
mercie of the most High he shall not
miscarie.</p>
