   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He many tokens of that inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, which by your fauour (right Honorable) I haue in your fauour, hath thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened me in this little Treatise to manifest my due acknowledgement of your Lordships loue towards me, but much more vnto the truth of Christ, which doth ennoble you both in the sight of Angels and of men. <note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 2.</note>
      <hi>Not many nobles,</hi> saith the Apostle, (but he addeth) <hi>according vnto the flesh;</hi> that we should not wonder at this defect, but deplore it: for we know that the Spirit of Christ which called the faithfull of Thessalonica <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 17. 11.</note>
      <hi>noble,</hi> because of their diligent studie in the sacred Scriptures, and zealous inquisition of the truth of the Gospell, doth teach vs to esteeme of all such as the off-spring of right Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which issueth not from <hi>generation</hi> but from <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation;</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
the praise and glorie whereof is <hi>not of men, but of God.</hi> My speciall intendment in this dedication (right Honorable) was to giue your Lordship notice what kinde of conflicts I am daily to expect, seeing that after the assault of a <hi>Moderator,</hi> and a <hi>Mitigator,</hi> now one <hi>T. H.</hi> a <hi>Motioner</hi> is sent to insult vpon me, vnder a pretence of charging me with falsifications. But how farre my disposition hath bene from this wickednesse, I haue presumed to appeale vnto your Honours experience. What my desert is, the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his particulars will best discouer, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre vnto the equanimity of your Lordships censure; submitting my selfe either vnto the abalienation of your Honorable fauour, or else your further approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of me, according as I shalbe found in these points innocent or obnoxious. Our Lord Iesus preserue your Honour vnto the glorie of his sauing grace.</p>
