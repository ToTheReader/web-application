   <p> This I have written in briefe to helpe all such as can but only Adde and Substract in whole
numbers, which if any cannot doe, if they please to repaire to my house in Queen-street, I
will teach them so much Arithmetick in halfe an houre.</p>
   <p>And for all such as desire to be more then ordinarily instructed in the Mathematicks; Let
them repaire unto me, and I shal (God willing) give them such satisfaction in all the rules
of Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, both in whole Numbers and Fractions, with the extractions of roots, the rule of
Coffe or Algebra, with such extraordinary briefe rules for exchange, interest, valueing of
Lands, Leases, Rents, Annuities, and Purchases, and with a briefer way for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting up of
Tower bills for gold or silver, then hath hitherto been taught by any. As also by a new
invention of mine to teach wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or children above 10 yeares of age, to cast up any ordinary
question of the rule of 3. or practice, in whole numbers, and with Fractions in a few houres.</p>
   <p>There also may any be instructed in Geometry and Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, by practice and
demonstration, with the use of severall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments for surv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ying of Lands, and plotting
the same sundry wayes, and taking of heights and distances by severall instruments, with
the use of both the Globes, the projection of the Sphere in plaine by scale and compasse,
and the doctrine of right lyned and spherificall Triangles, with the application thereof in
dial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, navigation and fortification, after a briefer way then is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant by any writer of
these times, with the use of the Ephemeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and other secret inventions to be taught in
private.</p>
   <p>There also may you have particular rules and scales for measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of glasse, board,
wainscot, plastering, tyling, brickworke, stone, or ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
