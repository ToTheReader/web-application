      <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which was graced with your audience, in preaching, with your thanks, when prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, be pleased now to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with your noble Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage in print; which is a kind of preaching too, that, as<note n="a" place="margin">2 Sam. 18.23.</note>

      <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that were for his bed otherwise too short) to reach it self unto the hands, and eyes of those good Catholike Christians, unto whose ears my voice, had it bin Stentorian, or as a<note n="d" place="margin">Mar. 3.17.</note> Boanerges, could not come: To preach by the pen, which in the expression of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens

I may seeme perchance by this to light a candle to the Sun, and to cast my spoonfull into that vast Ocean of knowledge, which we (though sitting upon the very lees and dregs of time for Atheisme and ill practice, which with bleeding hearts we view abroad, and wonder at) have lived to see make up that prophesie of great Daniel, who foretold it should

[is] the worst of fellowship, till it be quite extinct; but as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith even of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monest gift of the Spirit, that its bestowed, not for ostentation of the haver, but for to<note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.7.</note> profit withall the whole Church; Why should I be shie to pay, though but my<note n="g" place="margin">Eccles. 1.7.</note> rivulet, as in tribute to this Ocean; and to improve, though but my (one) talent, to the best advantage of my Lord and Master Christ, who

I would not therefore with the Spider weave this web to thrust it to a corner, but with the Silk-worme rather spinne my thread so that it might help to cloath at least some younger children of the Church.

I must expect (having thus hoised up my saile to steare amaine) some sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, some whistlings of your windy spirits, that like to summer flies will blow corruption on the sweetest of provision: Wee are fallen into those times wherein all Sermons are most sure of censure, most of all unsure of practice; so that when our Sermon is ended, wee can hardly say our Sermon is done; wee heare more often of our owne good voices, elocution, memorie, then of our hearers holy doings: My hope is not so high as to please all, nor my intention so factiously sordid, as to displease any; yet I cannot but suspect the worst, for that whereas I hitherto (mine<note n="o" place="margin">Anno

<pb facs="5"/> in our Church of England; whose names are now all noted in my margin, which I could not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my preaching, lest I should have lost my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in so large quotations. Honoured Sir, amidst the many dangers it is like to meete with, vouchsafe to patronize this my first publick Theologicall Essay by your countenancing of it: I shall [so] lesse feare either the spleen or gall of any Reader. One <hi>Plato,</hi> saith<note n="p" place="margin">
         <hi>Marcil. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin. in vita Platonis.</hi> Unus Plato plus est quàm Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensis populus.</note>
      <hi>Marcilius,</hi> is worth all Athens else; one pearle out-vies a thousand pebles; one such <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> so acute an <hi>Aristarchus</hi> of all learning (who approves) beares down before him, like an Indian Hurraca, all the sullen opposition of the whole droves of Momus.</p>
   <p>Should I here take occasion to blazon your so many excellent graces, which be like the Spouses flock of sheep which came up from the washing, even-shorne, each one being, not like the Pelican in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, alone, but every one bearing<note n="a" place="margin">
         <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.2.</note> twinnes, and none is barren among them: Should I pen-down in this Epistle that those which are in others rare, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, are in you but ordinarie and common, I should but make that legible by your owne, which hath long since been visible to the eies of others that have truly known you. But though your various graces (as being all links of one and the same chain) might well claime
<pb facs="5"/> as those in the<note n="b" place="margin">Scholiast. in Thucyd.</note> Lacedaemonian army, a priviledge all of them to be Captaines, and to lead; yet that which is, as Davids Tachmonite, the<note n="c" place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.8.</note> chiefe among these Captaines, and which, as King <hi>Lemuels</hi> vertuous daughter, doth<note n="d" place="margin">
         <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.29.</note> excell the rest, is your humble and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Patience: This is that bulwarke which as a<note n="c" place="margin">
         <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.25.</note> rocke returnes the billowes of malevolence in froth, and makes the shafts of the meagrest envie to bee split in vaine: This is that which doth, and shall preserve you, as <hi>Alpheus,</hi> still untainted by the washings of the bitterest<note n="f" place="margin">Sic tibi cùm fluctus subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labêre Sica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos, Doris amara suam non intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat undam. <hi>Virg. Eclog.</hi> 10.</note>
      <hi>Doris,</hi> till you salute at last the limpid <hi>Arethusa,</hi> and sweet fountaine of all blisse. I will assure you, noble Sir, as the great Doctour of the Gentiles told his endeared Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, my heart is much<note n="g" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.</note> enlarged towards you, and my respectfull thoughts be most voluminous, though now my quill (much like mine oratorie, too jejune and dry) hath thus epitomized my expressions in a line or two.</p>
   <p>But I perceive, as Jordan above his bankes, the measure of my affection hath over-swoln the bounds of an Epistle: What remaines now, but that I must implore the favours of Heaven on you, and that you may still persist to beautifie the seat you sit in, to credit the West, and to adorne the Gospell: Mee,
<pb facs="6"/> both your selfe, and your so rarely vertuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort, (a genuine branch of a most holy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout stocke) shall ever have, though your meanest friend, yet one that hath resolved to print himselfe</p>
