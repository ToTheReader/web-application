         <p>FRom the beginninge of the worlde, to thys tyme of the byrth of our sauiour Christ, the studious younge man Thomas Lanquet, not without great laboure and diligence, broughte hys Chronicle. Whose enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, and the honest affection, that he therein declared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde his countrey, I thinke worthye memorye. For if he might haue gon through as he begō, and wel brought forwarde the same: vndoubtedly it woulde greatly haue delighted theim that take pleasure to reade the notable and famous thinges done longe before our tyme. For he hathe briefely set foorthe the gestes and actes of forayne and straunge countreis, and therwith iuigned the hysto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie of this realme of Englande, after the opinion of most writers, euen from the firste arriuing of Brutus, in such wyse, that a diligent reader maye gather, the variable state and condicion of all countreis and nacions at all ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes. But deathe (whiche spareth no man, ne can bee es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed) brake his course, and (as it were) trypped hym in the myddes of hys rase, that he coulde not atteyne to the marke, wherat he ranne. Wherfore, lest they that de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>syre the profitable knowlege of histories, should be desti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuted of so great a commoditee: and lest the fruites of so diligent a labour shoulde lye hydde, and tourne to the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyte of no man: At the instance of certaine of my nyghest frendes, whose requestes (the matter so standing) I could not well denie: I haue taken vpon me to fynishe this cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, although in dede. I greatly dispaired, that I shulde be able to accomplishe the same. But when I considered, firste, though it were an harde matter, yet might it be o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uercomen with labour: than, howe profitable the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise should bee for me, to reade and peruse so many good auctours, as were necessary for the performaunce of the same: Thirdly, howe honeste a labour it was, so to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy

Wherfore you (gentyll reader) shall take well in worthe this my boldenesse, and perswade youre selfe (as the trouthe is) that I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to this excercise, rather of good wille▪ to profytte my natural countrey, and to do pleasure to other men, than for any fame or aduauncemēt, that I hoped might come to me therby. And if I se, ye take it well in gree, vndough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tedly you shal encourage me hereafter, to goo in hande, with some exercise, that shal perchaunce tourne to more profytte, and pleasure, of theim whiche be desirous of ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nest knowlege.</p>

For the souldiours being as than in Pannonie, raised a greate sedicion, &amp; in their rage beatte &amp; murdered diuers of their tribunes &amp; other officers, which cōmocion after much peines was lastly quyeted by Drusus the sonne of Tiberius. In like maner, &amp; for like causes, was great trouble &amp; vnquietnes in the hoste that lay in Germanie. At which time, whan Germanicus their captaine, exhorteth them to quietnes, the souldiours obstinately refused the empire of Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, &amp; profered to make him their emperour, but Germa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nicus wolde rather haue slaine him selfe, with hys owne weapen, thē by such vnlawful meanes, to obteine the im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>periall auctoritee: And moreouer, the commons of the ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tee of Rome, &amp; diuers of the nobles also, hauing in their hertes (as it were) a naturall hatred towarde the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, or highe power of Cesars: diuised and imagined with theim selfes, diuerslye, howe to extinguishe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial auctoritee, &amp; bring the citee to her pristinate for me

Tyberius wyth suche craft and dissimulacion handeled the matter, that he not onely obteyned the imperiall auctoritee, but also seemed to take it vpon him against his will.</p>
   <p>There was at this time no notable warre, sauinge that the Romaines made fierce warre vpon the Germaines, rather to reuenge the infamy: that. Q.

   <p>Philip buylded Paniada aboute the well of Iordaine, and named it Cesaria. He erected also Bethsayda nye to the riuer Genasar, &amp; gaue it to name Iulia Omonima. Germanicus Cesar, the Romaine capitaine, nye to the wood Cesia, vainquished and slue the Germaines, called Marsi.</p>
