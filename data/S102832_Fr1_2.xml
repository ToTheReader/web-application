   <p>Worthy Sir! Accept in good part this poore oblation of my deepe Affection, then which fauour, when I weigh my worth, I can wish no more; when I remember you, I do hope no lesse. I preached these cursory meditations at your appointment, in the time of your great Imploiments (being the very worthy high Sherife of Norfolke) and then they found good acceptance; and the Lord chief Iustice, the Oracle of the Assises, graced them with approbation, requiring a copy of them for priuate deuotion, which here I publish (perswaded by many) to posteritie: So crauing a fauourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and acceptation of this plaine, and perfunctory labour, with my hearty prayers to God, to make your pathes eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way prosperous, To blesse your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, your religious Lady, and hopefull progenie with health, and happinesse on earth, and with a glorified life in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, I euer rest</p>
