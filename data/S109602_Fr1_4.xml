   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is written (gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader,) that in the beginning, in the dayes of Seth the sonne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, the people first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan<note place="margin">Genesis. 4.</note> to inuocate and call on the name of God, which is to saye, by deuout Prayer they did require and aske all things of him, praysed him, trusted in him, and gaue to him the honour and worship that belonged vnto him.</p>
   <p>And this maner of praying, was vsed among the Fathers from Noe, vnto the comming of Christe: And they did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent &amp; vse the same as a special meane and way to craue of God, his mercy, hys grace and his assistance.</p>
   <p>By Prayer also they did set forthe the glory of God, appeased hys wrathe and displeasure, and rendred hym thanckes for his benefites receyued. Christe oure Sauioure after his comming taught it<note place="margin">Math. 6. 7. Iohn. 16.</note> also, as a moste necessary and cōfortable doctrine, wherby we might craue of hys
<pb facs="4"/>
heauenly Father, not onely all thyngs necessary and needefull for vs (as appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in hys Prayer taught to hys Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) but also forgiuenesse of sinnes, to the attainement of eternall Lyfe. And therefore maye we well saye, that as the vse thereof is worthye prayse, so is the want therof to be lamented. For where as Prayer is not frequented, there God is not called vppon for hys grace and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, neyther is he thancked for hys gracious benefites, the free gyfte of hys mercy is not desired, neyther is the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible punishement of hys iustice feared.</p>
   <p>Right well therefore may we in this our age (wherein sinne so much aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and the ordinarye vse and time and place of Prayer so muche neglected) la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the lack of the vse thereof in all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, wyth the loose lyfe of men, whiche is so frayle, so weake, so peruerse of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and so prone to euill, that almoste none in manner sheweth in liuing to feare God. Who is afrayde to offende hym? or who refrayneth to blaspheme hys holye name? who seeketh to subdue
<pb facs="4"/>
the fleshe to the Spirit? yea rather who seeketh not to lay the brydle. of liberty at length, freely and without staye to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe sinne, the cause whereof is (as I haue sayd) the want of true and vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned calling on God in deuout Prayer: For by it is wrought in vs, the hate of sinne, and by it is driuen from vs, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasions that might prouoke the wrath of God vpon vs. And therefore it may be called oure speedy messanger or trusty Embassadour, which doth obtain<note place="margin">1. Kings. 2.</note> for vs a gratyous audience before the Maiestie of God, presenting to him the fruites of our contrite hearts.</p>
   <p>But who may not now trowest thou (Gentle Reader) rightlye saye to the world, as Ionas sayd to the Niniuetes: There is yet forty dayes, and the world<note place="margin">Luke. 11</note> shall be destroyed.</p>
   <p>The Niniuetes, as sone as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had proclaimed distruction to come on them for their sinne, they immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the first crying of him, with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and feare turned to God, beleued him, feared his iustice, confessed their
<pb facs="5"/>
sinnes, and with penitent hearts craued hys mercye. But thou, O Englande, whome it hath pleased God to call, not by the mouth of one man, as he did the Niniuets, but he hath called thee by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other and sundrye meanes: as first by giuing thee a moste vertuous &amp; graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Queene, who for hir worshipping of God and setting forth hys name and glorye, maye be compared wyth Iosiah king of Iuda: for hir vertues, pollicie, &amp; wysedome, with Iudeth: &amp; for the cares toward hir peopte, with humble Hester.</p>
   <p>He hath not (as I saye) called thee, by thys hys good gifte of so mercifull and gracious a Queene, but also hath called thee by the Preachers of hys Worde, by death and famine, otherwise by fyre frō Heauen, by motion of warre, and lastly by mortallitie of Pestilence, yet nothing (O Englande) doest thou regarde hys calling: wherefore to thee it may be said, the more he seeketh thee the more thou shunnest him, the more he loueth thee the lesse thou regardest him, the more thou needest him the lesse thou thinkest
<pb facs="5"/>
on him: so that by thy great vnkindnesse God is compelled to say vnto thee, as hee sayd to the Israelites: I am ouerweried with bearing and long suffring of thy wycked and sinfull liuing. If thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doe desire to be free from the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plagues and threatnings of GOD, thou must lyke a true Niniuete, wyth a broken and penitent heart, call on God wyth continuall Prayer, crauing of him hys mercy, grace and assistaunce, which if thou aske wyth a sure Fayth, he wyll graunt it thee. And therefore when thou doest praye, thou muste (after the minde of the Apostle) aske with a stedfast faith,<note place="margin">Iames. 1.</note> not wauering nor doubtfull, and thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest shall be graunted thee. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that asketh as he ought, receiueth: and hee seeketh well that seeketh wyth continuall desire: and he knocketh well which dothe prouoke Gods goodnesse to heare him, as did the Woman of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanie, vnto whome Christe sayde, after hir peticion made: O Woman great<note place="margin">Math. 15.</note> is thy Fayth, be it vnto thee euen as thou hast desired.
<pb facs="6"/>
Thus (gentle Reader) if thou loue thy health, if thou long to be acceptable to God, if thou desire to be sure from the grennes of the Diuell, from the stormes of thys Worlde, from the way of thine ennimies, if thou couet to be happye at the laste, let no daye passe thee, but that thou once at the leaste doe present thy selfe to GOD by Prayer: And falling downe before hym wyth an humble af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte of deuout minde (not from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of the lippes onely, but oute of the inwardenesse of the heart,) cry with the Prophet: O Lorde, the offences of my Youthe and mine ignoraunce, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member<note place="margin">Psalme. 25.</note> thou not: but after thy mercye and goodnesse O Lorde remember thou me. And thus the holye spirite that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thee, and eke thine owne necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, shall euery houre put thee in minde what thou shalt praye for, and what you shall desire of God.</p>
   <p>Who therefore that will persist and continue in Prayer, shall not onely bee vnto God dailye more and more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and acceptable, but shall also dailye
<pb facs="6"/>
proceede further and further from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to vertue, and shall be made lyke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heauenly and Angelicall mindes, which daily behold the presence of God. And because all the felicitie of the soule, standeth in the cleere beholding of the fruition of God, and for that our felicity shall be euerlasting wyth him, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and saye with the Prophet: Thou shalt (O Lorde) fyll vs full of gladnesse wyth thee, whiche is no more but that our felicitie is fulfilled in the seyng and beholding of God and our nature in Christ, sitting in heauen on the right hande of his Father, so that our rewarde is, that we may beholde God and Iesus Christ hys sonne, whome he hath sent: to the which rewarde he bring vs that sitteth there and prayeth for vs, Amen.</p>
