      <hi>To the right honorable, and</hi> my very good Lord, the Lord Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Dudley, Earle of Leycester, Baron of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigh, Knight of the most noble order of the Garter, Master of the Queenes Maiesties Horses, and one of her Graces most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable priuie Councell: Io.

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing willing (Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, and my very good Lorde) in the sight of all the worlde, to leaue some pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique testimonie of my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duetie &amp; vnfaigned good will towardes your Honor: I thought I coulde no better way performe it, then by dedicating these poore labours of mine to be shrowded and harboured vnder your good and fauourable protection. And albeit I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that my translation is not worthie such a Patrone, yet this I must needes say, that the worke it selfe, both in respect of the Aucthour that wrote it, and also of the matter, is worthy not onely of your Honors defence, but also of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of all noble men, yea of the greatest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the world, if they wil answere their calling, and holde of God to maintaine his Church and trueth, and will set greatest price vpon thinges that are most precious. For concerning the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
<pb facs="3"/>though I be not acquainted with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yet this is sufficient, that I knowe him by his vertue, and by this excellent worke: who as he is a Gentleman of a noble house, and employed in waightie affaires, which sufficiently commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his credite and wisedome to the worlde, so, which is a thing to be marueiled at, amiddest all his businesse, whilest he lay here, he set forth this notable treatise, wherein he hath shewed such learning and reading, with iudgement and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to the Church of God, as I knowe not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from a man of his place any hath euer bene more learnedly and piththily published, and that more may make to the edifying of the Church of God, and confuting the aduersarie. The Lorde send many such Ambassadours, that euermore their policie may be guided by diuinitie. And thus much both for the person and the worke. Nowe touching the translation. In very deede, I haue therein studied to be plaine &amp; simple, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping my selfe to mine Aucthour, both in wordes and meaning, so farre foorth as the proprietie of the tongue woulde suffer me. Wherefore (good my Lorde) I most humbly beseech your Honor to accept this my humble and bounden duetie: and as by your Honor I dedicate it to the Church of England, so I humbly craue that it may be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: for hereunto is your Honor called of God, and therefore hath he giuen you your aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that you shoulde maintaine his Church, loue his religion, set your selfe against Poperie, and liue and die to his glorie. He hath honored you, that you shoulde honor him, and hath set you vp,
<pb facs="3"/>that you shoulde maintaine him. And wholly to trust in him, and to liue to him, is a stay that can neuer faile, neither in this worlde, nor in the worlde to come. All other things shall faile, for all flesh is grasse, and the glorie of man is as the flower of the fielde: but God is euerlasting, his worde is euerlasting, and they that are begotten to him by the immortall seede of his worde, shall liue for euer. And this life beginneth and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in vs, as we growe and encrease in the true knowledge of God, to the encreasing of our faith, and working in vs, as the seale of our adoption, that true sanctification, that maketh vs to liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by righteousnesse, purely to worship him according to his worde: and with brotherly loue deuoyde of all hypocrysie, from a pure heart to loue our neighbours. This (my Lord) is true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whereunto as God in great mercie hath called your Honor, so goe cherefully forwarde: beware of this vaine worlde, and of that vaine trust that wicked men are wont to put in it. Leane not vpon it, but stoppe your eares against the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunting and fawning whisperings of hollowe harted Papists, and dissolute professors: for there can be no greater trespasse against the Lord, then to leane vpon Assyria, to rest in the strength of Egypt, to goe downe into Ethiopia. Cursed is that man that putteth his trust in man, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth flesh his arme, he shalbe like the heath that groweth in the wildernesse: but contrariwise, he that trusteth in the Lord, mercie shall embrace him on euery side, he shall neuer be confounded, he shalbe as Mount Sion, and shall neuer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued:
<pb facs="4"/>For the Lord is his secrete place, and is with him, therefore who can be against him? what is a mans bowe? what are his legges? what is the swiftnesse of Horses, or the strength of an hoaste, or the fauour of all the princes of the worlde in comparison of God, in whom is onely the assurance of that euerlasting inheritance? It is the God of Iacob that must be our defence, our strong tower and rocke, the Chariot and horsemen of Israel, the testimonie of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and fauour, that onely can make vs glad. Wherefore, againe and againe I most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseech your Honor, beware of the vaine trust &amp; confidence of men in men, and in things that are lesse worth then men. And as God hath in mercie bestowed vpon your Honor great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, so pray that you may haue a discerning spirite, that the deceyueable glorie of your pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie and high aucthoritie, make you not forget your greatest duetie: that you may shine in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes Church to the benefite of the whole body, defending Christ his poore members, to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of your power, and punishing all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries: that Agag, vpon whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen sentence, may not be spared, nor good Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie buffeted: that Michee may be preferred, yea though there be foure hundred false prophets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. O (my Lorde) God asketh this at your Honors hands, and this Church of England craues it, that his ministerie may be mainteyned, his trueth may be preserued and continued, the poore people may be taught and enstructed, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked heretikes may be confuted and abondoned,
<pb facs="4"/>which (alas) encrease and growe to infinite nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers dayly amongst vs. For where through impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie men may professe what they lyst, and no tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and examination is had, according to God his worde: there is it any maruell if Papists, Arrians, Anabaptists, Libertines, and other heretikes of al sortes doe dayly multiphe and encrease? Wil they not creepe in there, where they may haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test rest and quietnesse? Who seeth not that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the preaching of the Gospel of Christ so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres, amiddest the great peace and blessings God in mercie hath bestowed vpon vs, because we haue bene negligent to answere our callings, to put in practise that we haue learned, with bringing foorth the fruites of faith and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, and making conscience of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the Papists, those enemies of God, and of her royall Maiestie, are nowe more in nomber, more obstinate and frowarde, more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious, then they were at her Maiesties most ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; happie entrance to her scepter &amp; crowne? Did not many more goe to Church, &amp; shew their conformitie (as they call it) sixteene yeres agoe, then nowe? And whereto may all this be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but to impunitie, for that they haue beene winked at, fauoured, and spared? which with what meaning soeuer it hath bene done, yet how they haue profited thereby, al the worlde may see, and their treasonable practises may sufficiently wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And surely, had not the only hand of God, in mercie bene our defence against them, they had long ere this put vs to our shifts, if not preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against vs. And though they haue bene from
<pb facs="5"/>time to time confuted by such learned and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble workes as this is, against which they are not able once to hisse with any colour of reason: though they haue bene (I say) courteously and gently entreated, yet are they neuer the better, but the worse, onely like frogges that keepe a great crooking, and sturre against the light of the Sunne: so do they against the glorious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable beames of Christ his Gospel. Seeing therefore they will not be satisfied with trueth, but abuse the mercifull lenitie of their gratious Souereigne, it is more then high time (my Lord) that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lords discipline be restored, &amp; that their spreading poyson be restrained, least it be to the hazard, not onely of the Church of God amongst vs, which can not thriue amiddest such pestilent and cōbersome weedes, but euē to the endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (which the Lord of glory turne from vs) this florishing common weale, and her Maiesties most royall person, crowne and dignitie. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, I am sure, for your wisdome and great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which you haue had this long time, can not but knowe what dangers their cursed practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as Cocatrises, haue brought foorth and hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. Their holy league of Trident, for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of all Christians, what lamentable effectes it hath wrought in Fraunce, Spaine, Flaunders, and diuers partes in Germanie, as also in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and euen in Englande amongst our selues, and amiddest our owne bowels, I neede not to declare. What hath thrust forth vnto vs from our English fugitiues such pestiferous and traiterous bookes, defacing Gods holy trueth, the Queene
<pb facs="5"/>her royall Maiestie, many of her honorable Councell, and sundry of her louing and faithfull subiects, but the hope of bringing that to passe, which that holy league had before determined? Haue they not discharged (if their discharge might haue beene credited) her highnesse sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects from their loyaltie and obedience to her Maiestie their naturall prince? haue not their Bulles pronounced her Maiestie to be no lawfull Queene, whom God hath placed ouer vs? haue not their attempts beene the seede of rebellion, and caused many to practise her Graces destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Let the rebellion in the North speake for them, and seale the trueth hereof. Let Felton, Story, Madder, Wodhouse, and one Maine late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed in Deuonshire (amongst whose pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers mention was made of certaine hallowed graines, to be giuen to timeseruing Papists, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kēs for a Passeouer, in the day of our general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, when we should haue bene al slaine and murthered) beare witnesse. I say nothing of their diuinations for their golden day, of their sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, witchcrafts, charmes, and conferences they haue had with the deuill their great master, least I shoulde be to tedious to your Honor: onely let this witnesse their loyaltie and fidelitie to their naturall prince, that to haue their superstitious idolatrie and cursed religion, their pompeous glorie and proud Hierarchie, they woulde haue her Maiesties life, and aduenture not onely their bodies, goodes and lands, but euen their soules, to bring about their malitious purposes.
