   <head>To him-selfe, G. W. wisheth
all hapinesse.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou <hi>(euen my selfe)</hi> whome
next <hi>God,</hi> my <hi>Prince,</hi> and
<hi>Country</hi> I am most enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
vnto; It is not vnlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
but some will wonder,
why, contrary to the
worlds custome, I haue
made choyse of thy Patronage for this
booke, rather then the protection of such
whose mightinesse might seeme better able
to defend it; especially considering such a
<hi>Gigantick</hi> troupe of aduersaries haue ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themselues against the <hi>Truth,</hi> that one
of them <hi>Goliah</hi>-like dares raile vpon a whole
hoast of <hi>Israel.</hi> It may be (I say) some will
wonder, and some scoffe at mee for it; for
which cause (though to answer them with
<hi>sic volo</hi> had been sufficient: yet to shew I will
not like our <hi>Great ones</hi> stand so much vpon
<pb facs="3"/>
my authority as to make my <hi>VVill</hi> my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>)
I heere let you know why, and for what
causes I haue done it; the first is this: I
could not amongst all men finde any man,
in my opinion, so fitting for this purpose,
but either my <hi>Worke</hi> was vnworthy, or too
worthie his Patronage. Secondly, it is
said; <hi>Obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit:</hi>
and I doubting my free speech would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make a <hi>Diapason,</hi> pleasing to the eare of
a common <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> thought it best to hold
my tong, or speake to my selfe, whose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
I am better acquainted with.
Thirdly, seeing I know but what men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
and not what they are; I had rather
indure the <hi>Kites</hi> tyranny, then with <hi>Aesops</hi>
Doues make the Sparrow-hauke my <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion.</hi>
Fourthly, if I haue spoken <hi>Truth</hi> it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to defend it selfe; if not, who-ere be my
Patron, it is I must answere for it. Fiftly, for
asmuch as I know my owne minde best; I
purpose, if need be, to become my own <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate.</hi>
Sixtly, for my owne sake I first made
it, and therefore certaine I am I my selfe
haue most right vnto it. But seauently, and
lastly (which is indeed the principal <hi>Reason</hi>) I
<pb facs="3"/>
haue made this <hi>Dedication</hi> to thee, poore
<hi>world</hi>-despised <hi>Selfe;</hi> euen to put thee in
minde, (seeing thou hast here boldly begun
to bid defiance to the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and vpon iust
causes quarrelled with the <hi>World</hi>) that thou
take heed to thine owne words, and not
through basenes of minde or vntowardnes
of <hi>Fortune</hi> (to thy euerlasting disgrace)
faintly giue ouer so noble a <hi>Combate;</hi> If euer
aduersitie (as tis like enough) oppresse thee,
yet remember thy owne sayings, and in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight
of outward <hi>Destinies</hi> haue a care to
keepe an vndeiected heart still free for <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi>
Or on the contrary, if euer (as tis vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely)
vnexpected <hi>Prosperity</hi> bee cast vpon
thee, then look to thy selfe, take to thee this
poore booke of thine, wherein thou shalt
see the dangers of it, and be, perhaps, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
staid from many a perilous enterprise,
which that estate might else driue thee
into. Reade it, weekely, daily, yea and
howerly toe: what though it bee thine
owne? thou knowest mans nature to
bee so vncertaine, and prone to forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
euen in the best things, that thou
canst not haue too many <hi>Memorandums.</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
The wisest fall, and therefore euery day was
<hi>Philip</hi> desirous to bee remembred that hee
was a <hi>Man;</hi> thou thinkest I know, still to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
what thou art, I desire in some things
thou maist, but vnlesse thou labour it with
diligent watchfulnesse ouer <hi>affection,</hi> it is at
least much to be doubted, if not altogether
to bee despaired of; thou hast seene many
by an alteration in their estate beene so <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosed,</hi>
as if they were not the same
men, nor of that <hi>Nation.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Nay remember it, thou thy selfe, and that
but vpon a bare hope, or imagination of
some preferment, hast bin puffed vp and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
aboue measure: consider now then
how much more thou hadst beene so and
what had become of thee if God had not
by dashing those hopes called thee to thy
selfe againe? Alas! if hee had answered thy
<hi>ambitious</hi> expectations to thy desire, thou
hadst bin by this time past recouerie and
not thought of this; but delighted in <hi>villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
bin ouer-mastered by <hi>passion,</hi> rusht into
all <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>presumption;</hi> yet neuer felt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
danger, till it were too late to preuent it▪
Thou hast oft wisht thou hadst bin borne to
<pb facs="4"/>
the like means that others are, which might
it haue beene so, now thou seest thou
shouldst hardly, or neuer, haue come to the
knowledge of those things, that are now
showne thee. Tis true, thou hast lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be crost in thy preferments, but thou
seest since that it might haue been thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
if it had not beene so, and maist per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
thy selfe, whether it be now or neuer,
it will be to thy good. For tell me, hast thou
not often felt, euen when thou wert busiest
to preuent them; <hi>fond loue, ambition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
couetousnesse</hi> and such like <hi>Passions</hi>
then to inuade thee? Hast thou perceiued
it I say? How much more then would
they haue beene ready to assaile thee, when
quite forgetting them, thou hadst wholly
addicted thy self to the things of this <hi>world?</hi>
Let mee aduise my <hi>deare-selfe</hi> then, to make
vse of this thine owne worke, it will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to thee then all the <hi>world:</hi> for this good
it may do thee, and to this end I made both
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t and the <hi>Dedication</hi> thereof to thee, that if
euer hereafter the temptations of the <hi>world,</hi>
the <hi>flesh</hi> &amp; the <hi>diuel,</hi> or any occasion should
make thee to forget this mind that thou art
<pb facs="5"/>
now in: or so blind thy vnderstanding
thou shouldst not perceiue thy owne and
the <hi>Worlds</hi> follies as thou now dost; That
if thou shouldst be in that miserable state as
many are, to haue no feeling of thy danger:
that if thou shouldst bee wofully flattered
and haue no friend that dares, or loues
thee so well to put thee in mind of thy
transgressions.</p>
   <p>Then I haue ordained this to shew
thee what once thou wert, to touch thee
againe with the feeling of thy miseries,
and to bee vnto thee that true <hi>Friend,</hi>
which, free from all faigned inuention,
shal plainely tell thee, what perhaps should
else haue neuer beene brought againe to
thy remembrance. Looke then that for
thy owne sake thou respect this, how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to others it may seeme a trifle. Bee
carefull of thy actions, for seeing thou
knowest the dangerous <hi>Passions</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
<hi>Man</hi> is subiect, hast showne his <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
layed open his <hi>Weakenesse,</hi> and sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taxed his <hi>Presumptions:</hi> If now thou
shouldest wilfully runne thy selfe into
the same euilles, the <hi>vvorld</hi> would vpraid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="5"/>
thee, this <hi>Booke,</hi> yea thy <hi>Conscience</hi> accuse
thee, God and good-men hate thee, thy
fault be more odious and in-excusable, thy
<hi>iudgement</hi> more seuere, and which is worst,
thy punishment most intollerable; I say
seeke therefore (if for no other cause) so to
carry thy selfe, that at least thou maist
haue a good conscience before God, for
<hi>Si Deus tecum quis contrate,</hi> but if now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
made the <hi>World</hi> thine enemie, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thy selfe to the malice thereof, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
so many <hi>Legions</hi> of foes without thee,
thou shouldest also, by thy negligence,
suffer the inuincible fortresse of a sound
<hi>Conscience</hi> to be crazed within thee, the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>

that is alway watching such aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
would quickly possesse it with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull
troupe of <hi>Horrors, Feares,</hi> and
<hi>Desperations,</hi> that without <hi>Gods</hi> miraculous
assistance thou wouldest grow wholly past
either comfort or recouery.</p>
   <p>For all the <hi>World</hi> cannot defend thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thy <hi>Conscience,</hi> but <hi>that</hi> beeing with
hee, thou maist preuaile against all the
<hi>World.</hi> Beware then, doe not like the <hi>Zibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb facs="6"/>
and be thy selfe a stinking vermine, but
let this thy owne worke bee first confirmed
by thy life and conuersation, yea let it be a

         </gap>i erit aliis
quanti tibi fuerit,</hi> but if not, I say if the
<hi>World</hi> mis-esteeme either it or thee, yet doe
not thou therefore esteeme the lesse either
of thy booke or of thy selfe, but rather let
them know</p>
   <l>That thou hast learned, still thy care, shalbe,</l>
   <l>A rush for him, that cares a straw for thee.</l>
   <p>But now, though for these and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<hi>Reasons,</hi> I haue to thee my <hi>Owne-selfe</hi>
committed the <hi>protection,</hi> and made the
<hi>Dedication</hi> of this booke, yet my meaning
is not that thou shouldst keepe it wholly to
thine owne vse; But rather seeing it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to giue, (though none will giue
thee any thing) I haue bestowne this o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>

thee, that if thou canst in this corrupted

      </gap>
thou art perswaded will gratifie, or but
thinke well of thy honest endeauours, thou

thy labours and expences. But this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure

thee to; be they neuer so great yet flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
