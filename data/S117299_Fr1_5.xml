   <head>THE AVTHOVR OF THIS WORKE, to the Pious Reader.</head>
   <p>NO one euer was conuersant amongst Histories, and the liues of men, who at diuers times haue flourished for sanctity in the Cartholick Church, but by reading might discouer, that the Dinine Prouidence, so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as it vouchsafed to the world any Saint, or man of vpright example, did for the most part prouide some one of his acquaintance, &amp; familiar friends who, moued out of some heauenly instinct, should set forth his life &amp; manners. To wit, least that▪ wheras their liues being as a rule to direct ours, and point out vnto vs the str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>it way to B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>atitude (much more certainely then either bookes or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons) the fame of them might end togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their death; but rather to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good &amp; document of posterity, should flourish euen in succeeding ages. Now for so much as the monumentall actes of those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men famous for sanctity of life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though replenished with all exemplar ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues (as being further remote from our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice &amp; vnderstanding) are not, in the minds of many men, of that validity, as of right they should be, and moue for the most part rather admiration then desire of imitation; whereupon some haue not feared now and then to affirme, that it is impossible for any one, now to arriue to that degree of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb facs="7"/>
vertue, which those ancient men attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so happily vnto, as if, forsooth, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of time, the vigour of mindes, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall assistance should be rebated. For this cause therfore, not without the speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God do there daily spring vp in the Church (which is adorned like a faire garden) some men like so many fresh plants and flowers, who aspire towards heauen with a certaine exact manner of life; questionlesse to the intent that we may clearly vnderstand, that the hand of our Lord is not shortned, &amp; that we may as well now, as in times past be conuersant in worshipping God with offices of perfect sanctity.</p>
   <p>Amongst these was <hi>B. Aloysius Gonzaga,</hi> in our memory, a young man neuer celebrated with prayses answerable to his excellency, who in that space of 23. yeares and 3. moneths which he liued, shined in so much innocency of life, and proceeded so far in the practice of vertue, that into as many as knew him he strooke admiration, and into diuers that were his familiar friendes, a loue to imitate his example. To the intent that they who knew him not whilst he was liuing, should not be destitute of his so remarkable presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, God in his behalfe as he is wont to doe, moued the mindes of many, to note and set downe in writing those thinges which they were giuen to vnderstand of his life. For to omit, that his comming to religion is compendiously set downe in the Annuall
<pb facs="8"/>
letters of the Society of IESVS of the yeare 2585. committed to print, where discourse is made of the Roman House of probation: &amp; that in the life of <hi>Eleonora Archduchesse</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> &amp; <hi>Duchesse</hi> of <hi>Mantua</hi> a most eminent woman, which is likewise published in print, vpon occasion, his said entrance into reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and departure out of this life, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commendably made mention of. He that did principally set forth in writing the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Aloysius, was Hieronymas Platus,</hi> the authour of that worke intituled, <hi>de Dignitate Cardinalis, ad Fratrem,</hi> and in like manner of that other, <hi>De bono status Religiosi,</hi> a man of rare guiftes both naturall and diuine, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially endued with an excellent iudgment and prudence, and with singular piety and Religion. He, when as at that time he gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Nouices at <hi>Rome</hi> in the House of the Professed of the Society of IESVS, who are sent thither to assist at Masse, to which place <hi>Aloysius</hi> being as yet but a Nouice, repaired, on a tyme required of him, that he would orderly recount vnto him the whole course of his life, his purpose of imbracing religion, and finally all those benefits which he receaued from Almighty God, whilst he liued as yet, in the liberty of the world. Which truly, for so much as they seemed vnto him to proceed after a singular and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together an vnusuall manner, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then from a certaine peculiar grace and fauour of God, the young man being gone
<pb facs="8"/>
from him, he briefly set downe all those pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in writing.</p>
   <p>Next vnto this man, I my selfe began to write his life at <hi>Rome,</hi> whilst he yet liued. For wheras in the Romane Colledge I was daily familiar, and in a manner inward with him, and perceaued that all who both heard and beheld his words, and manners, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to piety, no otherwise then men are wont to be who with a mind rightly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and a desire to profit, read the actes of Saints, I was of an opinion, that the examples of his sanctity, would worke the same effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall operation with strangers, if they did but once entertaine a knowledge of him. Therfore out of a peculiar instinct (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) of God, out of a desire to render a cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity to very many, I determined to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to writing his life. And this my resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>F. Hieronymus Platus,</hi> with whome I did communicate the same, did not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue, but also that he might encourage me therunto, deliuered me that his writing, which hitherto he had concealed. Therfore making vse of this help, and adding those things which I either obserued my selfe, or heard from others, almost two yeares before he departed out of this life, I so set downe his affaires, that notwithstanding, least the same might come to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>are, I acquainted very few therwith. We being bereft of <hi>Aloysius, Robert Bellarmine,</hi> who is now Cardinall, and had with great contentment of mind perused
<pb facs="9"/>
that my former part of his life, was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stat with me, to adde therūto the things that were d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ne in the two last yeares of his life, which were yet wanting. But for so much as at that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> was busied with other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hauing gathered great plenty of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges togeather, I deliuered all to <hi>F. John Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>ino,</hi> who about that time had come out of <hi>Sicily</hi> to write the Annales of the Society, that at least he might finish that which I had beg in, or might vse them as should seeme best vnto him. He, although he had neuer knowne <hi>Aloysius,</hi> notwithstanding so soone as he vnde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>ood, that he shined with so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular fame of sanctity in the Romane Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, thinking it a thing not to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> deferred, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ers in his Annales, did in a particular volume write his life. And that other life of <hi>Aloysius</hi> hath bene frequent in the hands of men.</p>
   <p>But because for the most part, those things vpon which we insist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d in our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, were a great part of them, by a certaine holy subt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>lty, extra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ed frō the young mans owne mouth, who out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>is loue to humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty so related his owne affaires, that many of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e cutoff, many he extenuated, very many he concealed, we entertained a desire more exactly to informe our selues, adding the certaine notes, of times, places, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Therfore wheras we had laid for intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with many at <hi>Mantua, Castilion,</hi> and other places, so great plenty and variety of
<pb facs="9"/>
matter was giuen in, that we thought good to begin, and write againe, the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. In the meane while <hi>Ʋa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>trino</hi> before this businesse was dispatched, departed out of this life. But our most Reuerend <hi>F. Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Aquauiua</hi> the Generall of the Society of IESVS, for so much as he had an earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, that the life of a young man of so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable sanctity, adorned with the docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of such singular example should come to light, he commaunded me a new to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the composing and finishing of this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. Verily, I tooke vnto me this taske, as imposed vpon me from heauen, and to the intent that I might more fully informe my selfe of all things, I first tooke my iourny to <hi>Florence,</hi> where for the space of diuers dayes I particularly enquired after this yoūg mans whole course of life, of <hi>Francis Turcius,</hi> who at this day gouerneth the family of <hi>Iohn Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices</hi> a most illustrious man. For he when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loysius</hi> was borne, liued in the Court of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by whome he was afterward made tutour of his childhood, and ouerseer of his manners, and belonged vnto him for the space of eight yeares, til he entred into the Nouiship of the Society, wherupon he accompanied him in all his iournies, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer departing from him, was very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the whole life of the young man. From <hi>Florence</hi> I passed into <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> and after I came to <hi>Castilion;</hi> the dominion wherof belonged vnto <hi>Aloysius,</hi> I carefully
<pb facs="10"/>
enquired all things of the young mans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a most Illustrious woman, and in like manner of all his kindred, and of as many as in his former course of life had serued him; and to the intent that they might be of so much the more authority, by permission from the Bishop, I gaue order that there should be a legall Inquisition made into his life an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> manners, and therof two very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall instruments to be drawne. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I receaued many monuments written of him out of <hi>Spayne</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> restimonies like wise and authorities after a solemne mā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner registred in the presence of diuers Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesias<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 span">

And finally I be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ooke my selfe to write at <hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>scia,</hi> where I might haue commodity s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eedily to be certified from <hi>Castilion,</hi> which is neare vnto it, of those things that I had any doubt of. From these registred tables of those witnesses, and writers, I haue taken all these things, which I relate. And I do heere professe, that I haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ecounted nothing of the vertues of this
<pb facs="10"/>
blessed seruant of God, which may not be auerred vpon the oaths of graue witnesses, wherof those Reuerend and Religious men herafter cited, giue testimony. The inward vertues of his mind I had vnderstanding of, from that Illustrious <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine,</hi> from that writing of <hi>Hieronymus Platus,</hi> from the questioning of diuers of his Superiours, from his Ghostly Fathers; to conclude from those that familiarly, either diued into or otherwise directed the inward dispositions of his mind.</p>
   <p>Those which are more manifest, &amp; which fell out before his entrance into Religion, I learned from the relation of <hi>Francis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>nza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Mantua,</hi> a most Reuerend and Illustrious man, and also by that his owne hand-writing, which he likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by oath; from <hi>Prosperus Gonzaga</hi> a most Illustrious man. who was his God-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Baptisme, and conuersing afterward much with him, knew many things; and in particuler from his mother, Tutour, Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine, and Seruants, who from his first childhood were in his seruice, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him in his iournies which he tooke into many Countries; the testimonies of all which are registred in authenticall Records.</p>
   <p>Of these thinges, gētle Reader, I would not haue thee ignorat, not to boast of my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, but to giue thee to vnderstand, that these thinges which I would haue to find <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>redit with thee, are written faythfully, as
<pb facs="11"/>
best becometh a History.</p>
   <p>I haue made vse of a plaine and familiar stile, set forth with no arte, or Rhetoricall Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>fication. My narration is not tied to certaine heads, but that you may easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>y, where, and at what age, he did euery thing. It orderly setteth downe the yong mans yeares, and the places of his aboad, in which respect, although sometimes it was requisite to iterate some of them, in which he vsed to conuerse, notwithstanding I am of an opinion that many will be delighted therewithall.</p>
   <p>My History is deuided into three Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. The First comprehendeth his life which he lead in the world, til he tooke vpon him the Institute of religion. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond his religious life euen til his death. The third, those things which by him were done after his happy departure out of this world. It may seeme vnto some, not to stand with the <hi>decorum</hi> of a History, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e to descend to the relation of certaine small matters, as of set-purpose I do, in my second booke. But for so much as my intention was to help by these my endeauours, mens piety and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and that I did not vndertake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the life and manners of any magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Emperour, or excellent Statist, but those of a Religious man, which may seeme worthy of imitation, the prayse wherof is either obscured, or increased with the least mutation of any addition; induced by the
<pb facs="11"/>
example of many, who haue obserued the same in relating the acts of Saints, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the aduise of some graue and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men; I will of purpose prosecute those thinges, which although vnto many they may seeme small, yet therin will appeare a certayne excellency, and perfection of his sanctity.</p>
   <p>This aduertisment I thought good to giue, least any one might impute it to rashnesse. If there shall be found any errour in my relatiō, I would haue it attributed vnto my selfe. If any thing rightly performed, that it should be ascribed to God, whom I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech, that he would vouchsafe vs his grace, to imitate the admirable actes of this Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed young man, and to obtaine that felicity which we belieue he doth now enioy in heauen.</p>
   <p>And thou, most holy and most <hi>B. Aloysius,</hi> who in those fortunate mansions of heauen reapest the rewards of thy labours, and in that bright mirrour of the Diuinity, (in which thou beholdest that of our affaires, which it is his pleasure thou shouldest) seest my imperfection, vouchsafe me thy pardon, for so much as with my poore stile I haue vilified thy almost diuine vertues: &amp; calling to mind that thy propense charity wherwith whilst thou liuedst, thou didst imbrace me, pray for me to our Lord, that I may in such religious sort order my life heere, that rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon thy help and patr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap>, it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
<pb facs="12"/>
me at the last, when it shall so seeme good vnto Almighty God, to enioy togeather with thee, that euerlasting Blisse, and Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. <hi>Amen.</hi>
