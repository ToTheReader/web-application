   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou hast here gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, brought home vnto thee the haruest of my long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, with little labour or cost vnto thy selfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou mayest plainely according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of euery Soyle, learne how to plant such profits as naturally our Country hath, and will afoord for the profit of thy selfe and Countrey. First, how to plant Wood, and how to breed Cattell to a greater number, yeerely to thy great gaine, as shall plainely be proued. Jn the second, the profit of plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fruit trees in Hedges or Orchards, as of Apples, Wardens and Peares; being no strange nouelties, although by want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie
<pb facs="5"/> they are made strange vnto vs, by our buying them from foraine Countries at a deare rate, by our slouth and negligence; whereas by the blessing of God, the very soyle of our Hedges is such, as they would yeeld great plentie, without hindring any other profit, and may bee gained with lesse cost and labour, then any other commoditie in this Kingdome whatsoeuer, as shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be proued. Jn the third, the maner how to breede Fowle and Pullen, by a secure plot from stealing, and from vermine. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how by a speedy meanes to destroy all kind of Vermine, especially the feathered kind, with a neere estimation what is yere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroyed by Vermin and Pidgeons, both in Corne and other things. By means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not onely Corne, but especially other victuals is brought and doth continue at too deere a rate, for the poore Artificer and Labouring man; by which dearth, too oft
<pb facs="5"/> ariseth discontents, and mutinies among the common sort, as appeared of late by a grieuance taken onely of the dearth of Corne, in Warwickeshire, Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire and other places, about which time the minds of many were molested: whereupon J tooke the first occasion to imploy my Studie and trauell in this businesse, hoping by Gods helpe to preuent such inconueniencies, as too oft doth spring out of the desperate tree of want. Whereupon good Reader, it insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that by the obseruing of these small di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, thou mayest performe some part of the cause of thy creation, by giuing glorie to thy Creator, honour, pleasure, and profit to thy King, Countrey, and to thy selfe also, by feeling and relieuing thy Christian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wants, and by a charitable industrie, thou mayest raise meanes to disburthen them of all their grieuances present and to
<pb facs="6"/> come, and in the end, by the mercie of our good God, thou mayest bee partaker of his louing promises in the Gospell, <hi>Come you blessed of my Father, &amp;c.</hi> The which J craue for Iesus Christ his sake.</p>
