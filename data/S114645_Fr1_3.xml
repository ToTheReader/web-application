      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have received many encouragements (by Friends that have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used these Collections) to render them to the publicke, which cannot bee done without

your Lordships approbation and permission to the Presse. The Catalogues of the great officers in <hi>France</hi> (long since printed) have offorded much contentment and do worthily preserve the memory of such as merited in those places and their qualities. And as I have no other but the same end in the publishing of these. So I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my selfe with an humble hope that it will give no discontentment. The incouragements your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath conferred up on the office of Armes in generall &amp; my selfe in particular with a bountifull hand may give your Lordship just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to expect some fruite of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours: If these may passe in that estimate, but for blossomes it will

be more then they demerite. And if your Lordship shall conceive them worthy to bee communicated to the world, I most humbly crave leave that they may passe under Dedication to your Lordship, which grace and favour will give them life and acceptation, and very much incourage and comfort</p>
