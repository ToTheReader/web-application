Though they be in deede bare toyes of small effecte, yet take them as chearefull as Lewes once King of Fraunce, accepted the hartie gift of a poore man, but a rude present for a Prince, being only a slender Radish roote, which he yet (conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring not the value of the root but the good will of the geuer rooted in his hart) highly estemed before all other costly iuels. So if small gifts en crease a good opinion and a good opinion aug menteth loue, and loue by proofe establisheth freindship, and doth ratifie the same, I doubt not then, but that this signe and small gift, or rathe simple shift shalbe an occasion to ratifie that good will of yours with, my entent is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to requite if I might, or remember as I can, or at the least wise not to treade it vnder foote as I will not, to shew such ingratitude,
