   <head>¶THE AVTHOVR TO THE Gentle Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y vvelbeloued in Christ, I haue made ready for thy reading a number of rare inuentions pend vpon the Ethimologie of the names, of diuers vvorthy personnages inhabiting the gentle natured countrey and Coūtie of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: A place planted with an infinite number of Gentlemen being of great vvorship, vvho in all their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiours in euery respect, may welbe to many countreyes a spectacle, or Mirrour for many vvorshipfull vertues, as dutie to her Maiestie, obeyng the lavves, keeping good hospitalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, louing and cherishing their seruaunts and poore tenants, vsing liberalitie to all men: being of nature lovvly, friendly, and familiar, vvithout any loftie proude stately vvordes or countenaunce to their inferiours, dayly and hourely feeding, and clothyng the poore people that vvant and craue for Christes sake. What shall I say there is no countrey compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the same, concerning the vertues aforesayd. If Rada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthus, and Pryapus, did not corrupt some of them vvith their vgly vices. But as the best and most diligent husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can not vveede his Corne so cleane hovv precise soeuer he be, but some vvedes, as thystles, brackens or brambles vvill spring vp among the fayrest and most ranckest corne of the vvhole fielde: euen so among many vertues it euer hath bene seene, and euer shalbe that some vices secretly shall lurke in some one corner or other according to the old saying, vvho liues vvithout a fault, or vvhat commoditie is vvithout his discommoditie? vvhiche argueth that Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyre is not onely for these vices to blamed more then the rest of our Natiue Countrey: Wherefore they are not alone
<pb facs="4"/>
to be condemned: But vvishing all to be reformed▪ I beseech thee gentle Reader to beare in mynde his sayings, that vvrit vpon the earth vvith his finger: and cast no more stones, at this gentle Countrey, then thou vvould haue throvven at thy selfe: vvishing the vvordes vvhiche shall flee out of thy mouth, to be fethered vvith such indifferencie, as both thou, and they may be thankefully receiued among all their vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships and theirs, with the rest of the inhabitaunce of the same foyle. For if necessitie should constraine thee to make triall of the good Nature of this Countrey, thou vvouldest not onely finde my reportes to be of troth, but also thou thy selfe shouldest haue iust occasion to speake more in their deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued commendations and prayse then I haue done: vvhiche I leaue to thy gentle iudgement, requesting thee to take in good part these sundry inuentions lately sleeped out of my penne, vvherein I haue Poetically set dovvne diuers fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, vvhiche shall (I trust) be profitable to euery Reader, that vvill indiffrently iudge vppon the sense, if hee haue knovvledge to vnderstand me, accordyng to my good and faythfull meaning to my Coūtrey: But in these dayes not any thing is more disdained then the trauell of the true meaning subiect, to vvrite against a vvorldlyng an Vsurer, a Papist, a Boasting Thrazo, an Extortioner, a Tel-tale, a Pick-thanke, a Clavvbacke, a Periured person, a Tirant to his Countrey, or a Traytor, to her Maiesties Royall person, is so secretly disdayned, and so enuiously noted of some vvicked vvret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that by one meanes or other hee shall not escape an euill displeasure, not a little to his great detriment and losses, but commonly to his vtter confusion, all the vvhiche daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (gentle Reader) doe not daunt my mynde at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause my penne to staye one droppe of incke from pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng the prayse of the vertuous, or tellyng the troth to the Tyraunt, by familiar examples of the other euill disposed persons as a caueat to vvarne the vvicked, and to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the godly to persiste in vertue, vvhiche I beseech the almightie that vve may all seeke the path of perfite righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
<pb facs="4"/>
desiring to pray for peace, and to insue the same. To honour and dread God, obey our soueraigne and gratious Lady the Queenes Maiestie and her lavves, and finally one to loue another. Thus vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing thee and all thine, no vvorsse then my selfe I cease.</p>
