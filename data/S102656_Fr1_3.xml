   <p>CHristian Reader, It was the saying of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wisest Prince that ever raigned. <hi>Withhold not good from them to</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 23.</note>
      <hi>whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to doe it;</hi> and them I take to bee the owners of any good, that stand in need of the same; few or none there be, to whom direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may not bee profitable in their demeanure, but to some more then to others; therefore as the <hi>Almanacks</hi> of <hi>Prognosticators</hi> are written espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for the climate wherein they dwell, so my publishing this discourse is, chiefly for my owne countries sake: for amongst the manifold causes of the augmentation and increase of sin
<pb facs="7"/> though it he not so seriously advised and thought vpon, yet doubtlesse the want of discountenancing and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king sinne, is one reason, why it flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth so much in the most: and in regard there is one kinde of people, who offend by connivency and silence when they see sin committed. I haue endeavoured to put some life &amp; zeal into them, by stirring them vp to this duty: also beholding on the other side a strange extreame, namely a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of people too industrious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous in reprouing others, who are rough and tetricall spirits, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is not in every point as precise as themselues, they account them as dogs and swine, men of vncleane and prophane dispositions, vnworthy any account or countenance; yet these men for want of wisdome &amp; discretion in their behaviour, doe more mischiefe through a rash vnadvisednesse and want of gouerment then they can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by reprehensions; therefore I
<pb facs="7"/> haue performed the best I can, that <note place="margin">
         <hi>Iudg.</hi> 14. 14.</note> like <hi>Sampsons</hi> riddle, out of these devourers and <hi>Lyons,</hi> I might bring forth that which may be for meat &amp; sweetnesse in the discovery of this point. Wherein I haue laid downe 1. What it is to reproue sin. <hi>2<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>,</hi> How or after what maner we must doe it. <hi>3<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>,</hi> I haue vrged the duty it selfe by way of instruction &amp; reproofe. <hi>4<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>,</hi> Is set downe Arguments or Motiues therevnto. Many there are that haue briefly discoursed vpon this subiect, and I must needs confesse, my pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath constrained me to glean some bundles ofeares, which I haue found seattered here and there, in the fields of some of them. For which I hope no wise and indicious reader will thinke the worse of my paines: for as the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders web is not to bee esteemed the more because it is wouen out of her owne bowels; so neither is the hony of the <hi>Bee</hi> the lesse set by, because it is suckt from divers flowers. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb facs="8"/> it finde acceptance, I haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to offer this poore mite of my penurie, amongst the <hi>Talents,</hi> which others out of their plenty haue cast into the offerings of God; yea whilst many worthy and learned men lay vp their <hi>Talents</hi> in obscuritie. I haue rather chosen to put my little to employment, for the benefit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then in a sullen disdaine to hord vp much for myselfe. I confesse my first studies vpon this point, and this impotent worke, like the Cripple at the poole of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> had kept its owne couch till death, had not some <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 5.</note>
      <hi>Angell</hi> troubled the water, and put it in, to make it goe abroad; and the rather, because I knewe my selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit &amp; vnworthy to handle this point being not so apt to giue, or receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction as I should. Take this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as a token of what I desire, and shall strine to he, not what I am: if thou canst get any good by mee, blesse God, and I will follow thee so fast as I
<pb facs="8"/> can. But least I should make my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting like the Citie of <hi>Mindus,</hi> with a faire and large gate, and the edifice but poore and little, I leaue both it and thee to the blessing of him, who alone giues increase of grace to all our good endeavours.</p>
