      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Treatise was first written
in French by an ancient Knight
of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Philip de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, in the first chapter of his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, maketh mention of Olyuer de La Marche, to haue been a great cause of the warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene king Lewes the .xi. and the Count of Charoloys, afterwardes called Charles the hardy, which sheweth that he was a man of no small honour and dignitie.</note> called <hi>Olyuer de La
Marche,</hi> a man, that both in matter
of warre and peace, bare great sway
with <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
and after him lykewise with <hi>Duke
Charles,</hi> his sonne, whom in all his warres he neuer
abandoned, and was lastly with him at the vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
battayle of <hi>Nancy</hi> in the yeere. 1476. where, by
the Duke of <hi>Lorayne</hi> and the <hi>Swyssers,</hi> he was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen
and slayne. After this, he had great charge and
authoritie vnder his daughter, the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> sole
inheritrix of all the Dukes great estates and Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who maryed <hi>Maximilian</hi> Archduke of <hi>Austria,</hi>
afterwardes elected Emperour: to whom, leauing two
chyldren, a sonne and a daughter, she dyed shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
some say of the fall from a Horse: But this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
who bestought to know the trueth, sayth, that
it was through the inwarde conceyte of an excessiue
sorow: But once, such was the greefe that he concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of her death, and of the two other before named
Princes, vnder whom he had been brought vp, that
he retyred himselfe from administration of great
matters, to a quiet lyfe: and in his solitarinesse compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
this Treatise. It hath been since translated into
sundry Languages, and among the rest, by <hi>Don Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando
de Acunia</hi> into Spanysh verse, and dedicated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth: whose translation
I do here folow, because I coulde neuer yet lyght on
any of the French originals.</p>
   <p>It seemeth that the <hi>Spanyarde</hi> in some places much
<pb facs="5"/>
altered the Authors meaning, adding &amp; taking away,
according to his owne fancy, and fitnes of the tyme in
which he translated it, as both by the sequele of this
discourse appeareth, as also by his Epistle to the
Emperour, which I haue here prefixed.</p>
   <p>Some perchaunce may blame me, of hauing done
the Author whom I folow wrong, by translating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an vneloquent barren Prose, his excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyte,
expressed in such heroicall Verse, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with so many fayre Tables &amp; purtraictes, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylously
delighting with the varietie of the one, and
the sweetnesse of the other, both the eare and the eye
of the reader. To this I answere, with the confession
of my fault, that it is true, and withall, that this matter
being for the most part allegoricall, had in deede been
farre better to haue been handled in verse. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
I doubt not, but those that do more esteeme
substance then shadowes, wyll lyke neuer the worse
of the matter, for being delyuered in a playne speach:
Neyther had mine Authour, yf he were alyue, any
great cause to be angry with me, seeing I haue besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
an Englysh habite vpon him, such as it is, though
it be no way comparable to the beautie of that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he was in his owne countrey language attyred.</p>
   <p>As for new fangled &amp; fickle conceyted heads, that
whensoeuer they reade any thing, neuer go farther
then the rynde, my sliking of euery thing, how vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
matter soeuer it conteyne, that thundreth not
into their eares with a lofty tempest of words, I would
earnestly request them, and that more in regarde of
their owne reputation, then in defence of this poore
Treatise (whose harmlesse innocencie shalbe a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
shielde agaynst whatsoeuer calumniation) to
<pb facs="5"/>
forbeare to censure amysse thereof: for though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
the basenesse of the style, &amp; the shallownesse
of the inuention, yeelde no harmonie to delight their
delicate eares, yet it woulde be moderately iudged of,
in regarde that it conteyneth nothing but most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
and moouing examples of great pietie, laying
open to our eyes the vaine and deceitfull instabilitie
of this most wretched and miserable worlde: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
teacheth nothyng more, then how to lyue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously,
and dye blessedly. Besides, it maketh hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
mention of sundy excellent Princes: some of
which, though long agon deceassed, yet such was their
noblenesse, and pietie, that their names are styll en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned
of the worlde in all honor and reuerence.
Others yet lyuing, who through the inestimable bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
wherewith God and nature hath adorned them,
are of all the worlde most worthyly honored with
admirable applause. As for me (lyke a well mounted
Cowarde in a skyrmish, that relyeth more vpon the
goodnes of his Horse, then his owne valour: So) I
hope the worthynesse of my Author, and the zelous
integritie of his discourse, shall, how faynt soeuer I
finde myne owne desert, be able to free me from the
reprehension of those that are wyse and well iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whom I chiefly desire to please, and to whose
censure I wyllyngly submit my selfe, and this poore
Pamphlet.</p>
