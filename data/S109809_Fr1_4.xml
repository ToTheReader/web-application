   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a Prouerbe</hi> amongst the Grekes of no smal antiquitie, welbeloued in our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ, that <hi>if in euils any good may be founde, the same must be sifted oute.</hi> A godly lesson surely, and very profitable to be obserued in this so great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worlde: Whereby it is very plainly set out vnto vs, how we oughte of all things to make our greatest aduauntage, not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishely discouraged with all fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde blastes, nor cowardly yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any crooked and ouerth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warte assaulte, but taking the world as God sendeth it, to lerne dayly the experience of godly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and by all meanes to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> oportunitie of well doing.
<pb facs="7"/> Therefore whether we be afflicted in body or goods, we are taught by this Prouerbe to take holde of some godly lesson: or if the loue of our deare fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des be any matier of discomforte to vs, we are willed to consider with our selues, whether this euill be so incommodious, that no goodnesse may grow out of the same: or if cloked falsehood and hypocrisie haue deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blinded vs, and led vs away, we are warned to loke well about vs, to see what cōmoditic mighte arise ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Or finally whatsoeuer heauinesse or mischaunce shoulde touche vs, we are charged to enter into a discrete &amp; sober meditation, whether in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect we might learne to be the better for the same. If any sweetenesse may be piked out of that that is soure, we must not by and by refuse, &amp; cast away either the nutkirnell for the huske, or the corne for the chaffe, or the rose for the prickes that growe about it: but
<pb facs="8"/> waying all thinges with indifferent balaunce, we muste picke oute suche mattier as may alwayes stande vs in good steede, and with great skill and aduisement make our choyse.</p>
   <p>Wherein the great wisedome and Prouidence (shall I say, or else also y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> exceding mercy of almightie god?) as in all other thinges notably, so in this poynt wonderfully is discouered. Who as he whippeth vs many &amp; sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times with the rod of his sharpe correction, to the intent our sluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse might be wakned, &amp; our vnstaied life &amp; conuersation mighte be bridled with the yoke of discipline: so neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, least we should be to muche discouraged, there is no inconueniēce that euer befalleth to vs so great, nor no calamitie that besetteth vs so des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and voyde of comforte, but that alwayes there is annexed to it some one thing or other, that auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, and assuageth and mollifieth
<pb facs="8"/> our griefe. Wherof it commeth, that although muche bitternesse be founde in the lyfe of man, and all things goe not alwayes as oure heartes desire: yet by reason of this temperature, wherwith al things naturally be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, to the wise and godly there is nothing that seemeth intolerable, yea there is nothing that turneth them not to muche good.</p>
   <p>Whiche truely is not auouched of my parte as any idle inuention of mine owne brayne, but the same is playnely testifyed by the open scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Gods worde, and by manifest examples proued true. For first tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> recorde of holy scripture, who hath not often heard to his great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation the comfortable saying of the Prophet Dauid, affirming that the very lighte shineth in the middest of the darknesse to them that be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and feare God? Whereby his meaning is nothing else, but that
<pb facs="9"/> to such as be vpright, and keepe them selues vnspotted of worldly blemishe (as by S. Iames admonition we are taught and informed by true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giō) <note place="margin">Iacob. 1.</note> God sheweth him selfe amiable often tymes, when with the cloudes of dispayre they seeme in maner to be ouerwhelmed. And S. Paule shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> at the same marke, saith playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that to them which loue God, all thinges generally frame to a good ende, be they neuer so comberously bestadde, or so roughly and daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously assayled.</p>
   <p>The same, if all authoritie were set aside, as in a cleare myrrour, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented and shewed vnto vs in the dayly experience of the worlde. Of the stories of the sacred Byble so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly knowen and talked of, what neede I to make long rehearsall? Wherein we see howe maruellously, contrary to al mens reason and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation god hath wrought for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
<pb facs="9"/> of his elect: bringing eftesones (as we haue sayde) the lighte out of the middest of the darkenesse, and vsing suche straunge meanes for thy preseruation, as surely in our carnall imagination would rather haue ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their vndoing.</p>
   <p>Who would euer haue thoughte, that Iosephes bondage of his rule and lordeship, or his greeuous impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment of his so honorable prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, woulde haue ministred so great occasion? Not they surely that dyd persecute hym: who contrarywyse were vtterly of this minde, that there could not be possibly a more speedie way to his destruction. Yet God so hampered his enimies, and so brake them of their malicious myndes, that not onely it was vayne, and voyde, whatsoeuer they diuelishly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tepted, but also ouerthrowing them in their owne deuises, he made them the very instrumentes that shoulde
<pb facs="10"/> bring Ioseph to honour. The infante Moses, when in a panyer that was made of rushes, he was caste downe into a ryuer, was he not in all mens iudgemente paste hope for euer to haue escaped? Yet God so wrought in the childs greatest extremitie, that not onely he escaped in that heauy case, but by Pharaoes owne daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that chaunced by Gods appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to passe by, he was brought vp, and fostred as hir owne sonne. The same is declared manyfestly by that which God did for the Israelites, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourning at their gret peril in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, by the history of Iudith and Hester, and other mo. Wherby we see clerely without doubt, how true that answere was, which god made to S. Paule: <hi>Virtus mea in infirmitate perficitur .i.</hi> my power is wroght in mans weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <note place="margin">2. Corinth. 12.</note> or, then is my valiauntnesse and strengthe moste put in practise, when men shewe themselues to be at the
<pb facs="10"/> weakest.</p>
   <p>Neuerthelesse if any man here make exception, saying, that God doth not alwayes exalte those, whom he hath humbled, or by the way of pouertie call menne to riches, or sende them worldly prosperitie whome he hath afflicted with his heauy hande: if we speake of this naughtie world, where wickednesse for the moste parte bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth swaye, here in deede I graunte well, the godly are not alwayes so aduaunced.</p>
   <p>Yet this dare I boldly say, that god neuer suffereth them so heauily and intollerably to be oppressed, but that in the middest of all their euils he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out some way for them to release their smarte. So that euen in their deepest miseries and calamities they may either espie out some lighte of comforte, or else also take some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage by the same, that mighte serue them very agreably to some
<pb facs="11"/> godly purposes. For we reade not in deede of our father Abraham, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his fleing out of his natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, when he had set him selfe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully agaynst many mishappes and mischaunces, he became by and by a great Lord, like Ioseph. But yet we reade notwithstanding, that bothe when he was in greate daunger by his wyues occasion, and also after hir discesse, in his greate anguishe and heauynesse, and in all other his manyfolde and moste bitter troubles, God styll was presente with hym in suche sorte, and so eased hym, and relieued hym at hys neede, that he bare all thinges peaceably wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute grutching, setting all worldely vanities at nought, in respecte of the lyfe to come.</p>
   <p>We reade not of king Dauid, that Princely prophet, that he neuer felte in mind and body any greefe and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that might disquiete him. Nay
<pb facs="11"/> contrarywise, we learne God so pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him often tymes, that he was welnigh wasted with starke anguish and woe. Yet God was euer so farre of from forsaking him, that guyding him with the lighte of his holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, he gaue him wisedome and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie to picke good oute of euill.</p>
   <p>Whervpon he confesseth in his Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that the very rodde and staffe, which he was beaten with, were his comforte, and that God humbled him and brought him lowe, not to dryue him to wanhope and dispayre of hys goodnesse, but to teache him his ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces, and his statutes.</p>
   <p>I passe ouer the Apostles of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chryst: who many times per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted by the Iewishe Synagogue, did not alwayes escape their handes without all maner of harme. And yet whatsoeuer it was that they suffred, there was nothing that coulde caste them vnder the feete. Yea it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="12"/> of them in playne wordes, that when they were checked and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before the Iewishe magistrates, and highe Priestes, <hi>they departed from their presence with ioy and gladnesse, that</hi>
      <note place="margin">Actes. 5.</note>
      <hi>they were accepted as worthy to suffer any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes for the name of Chryst.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Neither will I say any thing of the blessed Martyres, whose greate pacience and constancie had neuer so famously come to lyghte, if perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Tyrauntes hadde bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued.</p>
   <p>With one onely example of <hi>Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus Boetius</hi> I wyll staye, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye meeselfe. Hee beeyng (as wee reade) a ryghte worthy, wyse and graue Senatoure, and one that had so well deserued of the common weale, as no one of the Romayne Senatoures coulde doo more, was neuerthelesse vppon displeasure of the Emperoure Theodorike, eyther bycause he had seemed ouer-earnest
<pb facs="12"/> in maynteyning agaynste hym the Senates honoure, or else (as some thynke) bycause he shewed him selfe zelouse in impugning the secte of the Arrians, (vnto whose faction the sayde Emperoure was thoughte to bee enclyned,) was not onely depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from hys highe estate, but also withoute any regarde hadde to his former merites, was fyrst outlawed, and banyshed, and afterwardes in his absence, withoute hauing any aduocate to pleade hys cause (Oh vnwoorthy and vnseemely dealing) was adiudged to dye by the same Senate, whome before so zealously he hadde supported. Neuerthelesse he was so farre off from murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring agaynst GOD, or too vnpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlye bearing thys vnkyndenesse, that he hath lefte behinde him a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry godly and learned monument of his Christianly affected minde.</p>
   <p>So well coulde he vse hys aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb facs="13"/> not onely for hys owne aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but also to the greate furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of the posteritie that shoulde come after.</p>
   <p>I for my parte muste in deede of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie confesse, that I am no wyse to be compared with any of these, not onely in none other thing, but also (God be thāked) touching either pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie or aduersitie. Who as I neuer had great wealthe, wherein I gyue place to many both better lerned, and more worthy: so surely neuer hitherto hath any such worldly inconuenience chaunced vnto me, wherof I greatly made accounte.</p>
   <p>But yet as in an vnlike case, this (as meseemeth) fell not out farre vnlike, which hapned to me soone after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sōmer this last yere. Who first flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Oxforde, where I was in daunger, to the citie of London for my refuge, vpon hope to haue founde there some stay, was yet afterwards
<pb facs="13"/> by reason of charges which grew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond mine expectatiō, forced to think of some other place. And thincking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligētly of the mater, to trauel straight downe to my frends, both I thought it no way to be any greate ease, their dwelling being so far of: and also (as I wel considered) my cōming in that hote time of the plague, mighte seme neither void of danger nor suspition. Therfore, for want of a better chifte, I concluded to retourne to Oxforde: nothing doubting by Goddes helpe, amongst other which remained there as well as I, to prouide wel inoughe for meselfe. But sodainly not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my comming backe, (see I praye you, what matter I had of discorage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) my neighboure hard by me, fell sicke of the Pestilence. Here I remē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred one of <hi>Virgils</hi> verses, who saythe in one of his Ecloges these wordes.</p>
   <q>
      <l>
         <hi>VVhen fired is thy neighboures wall,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Surely thy daunger is not small.</hi>
      </l>
   </q>
   <pb facs="14"/>
   <p>Therefore my minde gaue me, that it was nowe highe time for mee to stirre, and by and by (as the phrase is) I remoued away spedily with bag &amp; baggage: not only content in this case, but also verye well apaide of a lodging somwhat simpler than mine other was. Thether therfore I fled, and there, as I mighte, I tooke my rest. Anone after, woorde came vnto me, that my laundresse also, whiche washed my clothes, had her house vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited in like manner. Wherewithall if I shoulde say, I was neuer a whitte moued, I dare say, I shoulde hardly be beleeued of a greate meinie. Howe muche more might I haue bene trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, hearing the belles knolling both day and night, for such as but the day before hadde bene mery, lustie, and in good liking? yea and seing also daily and hourely whole housholdes going with corpses by my windowe side?</p>
   <p>But God alwayes be thanked, and
<pb facs="14"/> praised for it, althoughe my bodye in deede was in some daunger: yet my minde nathelesse was not much brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght out of quiete. Who as I soughte not deathe wilfully, which I studied by all honest meanes to auoide: so yet notwithstanding my delighte in the worlde was not so greate, but that hartily I could haue yeelded to Gods calling. In the meane time seeing it pleased God to deliuer me (as it wer) out of the Dragons mouthe: I thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght it my duty to embrace (as it wer) that light, whiche seemed more than halfe in darkenesse to be offered &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to me, and amōgst those euils, and great perils, wherewith I was then assailed, to see whether I coulde pike out any good.</p>
   <p>Whereuppon hauing aduised me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, I sawe forthwith redy at mine elboe, pen, inke, and paper, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent furniture of bokes: thereto suche leasure &amp; oportunitie was ministred
<pb facs="15"/> vnto me on all sides, that I could not possibly wishe greater. Breefely, my minde being at peace and rest, there was nothing that mighte hinder me from well doing. Therefore, that I mighte not vtterly be vnthanckefull to almightye God, and at leaste wise testifie my good meaning towardes his deare espouse the congregation: I was fullye purposed with my selfe to bequeathe (as who saythe) to the broade worlde some poore token and monumente of my good will.</p>
   <p>And in this case, deare brother in our Sauioure Christe, I referre it verily to thine owne conscience, whether with any thing more frutefully, my thought might haue ben holdē occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, than euen with this passing worthy, most high and excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of that, whiche can neuer be praised inoughe, I say, of Goddes endlesse Prouidence. Whereof long before in a great meinie, and now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb facs="15"/> in meselfe suche great proofe, and experience was shewed vnto me, that I supposed I shuld do very euil, not to make other partakers of suche wholesome lessons, as thereby I me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had then learned. From mine ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest trauelling wherin, althoughe I knewe I mighte be discouraged by reason of myne owne insufficiencie: yet was I greatly comforted by the saying of a certaine wise man, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that <hi>in magnis voluisse sat est,</hi> that is to say: in the enterprising of great things, it is enoughe to put forwarde a well willing purpose.</p>
   <p>What paines I haue taken, and what I haue broughte to passe, that mighte make for the furtheraunce of the christian reader, that will I glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly referre to their iudgemente, that haue perused other wryters of the same matter. Who by suche diligente conference as shall be voide of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection
<pb facs="16"/> and parcialitie, shall quickly perceyue without muche adoe, bothe what I haue added of mine own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreably to the doctrine of sound religion: and with what choyse and circumspection I haue now and then borowed y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> authoritie of many other. Once this wil I boldly say, which I trust vpon farther trial, shalbe openly &amp; manifestly proued true: Ther is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing auouched in this whole work, of a singular and priuate iudgement, (which kinde of teaching, although I know it be plausible in ytching eares, that take pleasure in nouelties and straunge things, yet of my part I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not in it.) Yea I wil say farther, Ther is not one thing taught in this discourse, not verie well concording with the receyued fayth of Chrystes Churche, and verie consonant to the rule of holy scrypture. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therfore I am wel assured, that any godly learned man will mislyke.
<pb facs="16"/> The godly learned man say I, and I pray thee reader, marke wel my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> superstitious I deny not, wil in deede find great fault, whō bicause they are the enimies of gods truth, I would be lothe to satisfie in any wise. And this hitherto speak I frely with good cōsciēce of the lerning &amp; mater of this boke. Touching the fourm &amp; methode whych I haue vsed, I do the christian Reader to vnderstād, that in this my processe I haue folowed that kind of order which the Rethoricians &amp; <hi>Melancthon</hi> namely, termeth by the name of Doctrinall. Therefore wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Gods Prouidence, bycause I would not haue men thynke that I speake as <hi>Plato</hi> dyd of hys common weale, or <hi>Tullie</hi> of his perfit Orator, describing that, which neither is, nor shal be: I declare first and formoste that Gods Prouidence is not an idle and bare name of a thyng that is no wher to be had, but that which is,
<pb facs="17"/> hath bene, and shalbe euer. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of make I open proofe in my two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bookes, alleaging in my firste booke certaine groundes and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereuppon I builde this my doctrine: and replying in my seconde booke, againste their fonde and vaine reasons, which by all meanes possible woulde impugne it. In my thirde booke I procede to disclose the nature of Gods Prouidēce, giuing thee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to vnderstād, that it is not all one (as some ignorant think) either with Destinie or else Predestination, much lesse with the naked prescience, and for knowledge which some only wold ascribe to Gods power. Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence after I haue defined what it is, at large I bothe proue and handle in the same booke euery membre and clause of the definition. After this in my fourthe boke (so farre as I am led by holy scripture) I vtter the power of Gods gouernement: opening after
<pb facs="17"/> what sorte God ruleth the inferioure bodyes by the superioure, the earthly by the heauenly, and the baser by the excellenter, and suche as be of more perfection. And bicause this so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a meditation mighte seeme yet of little, or no effect, if we should not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to some vse: therfore the frutes and commodities that flow &amp; growe (as it were) out of the same, in ample manner be set oute.</p>
   <p>Nowe in prosecuting, and going throughe with all these things afore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mencioned, from the beginning to the ende of my foure bokes, if it seeme to any man somewhat straunge, that for the most part I reherse y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> testimonies as wel of the scriptures, as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> catholik fathers of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church, not in their owne language, wherin they wrote, but by way of translation in our mother tōg: It may please them to vnderstande, that I considered I had to doe with two sorts of men: with some, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
<pb facs="18"/> are ignorant, &amp; know neither the Greeke nor Latine speache, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise with other that haue good skill, and be profoundly learned in thē bothe.</p>
   <p>Therefore, althoughe the incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of muche Greeke and Latine, might peraduēture haue made a good showe, and very well haue serued for the enlarging, and amplifying of my discourse: yet the vnskilfull, I knewe well inoughe, coulde haue slender for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance by suche meanes, to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it was alwayes free to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and refuge to those authors, as well Greekes as Latines, whiche by me there are recited. By conference of whome they shall well perceiue and finde oute, howe faithfully I haue dealt in my translation.</p>
   <p>It remaineth nowe, Christian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that thou catche not vnto thee with the lefte hande, that whiche
<pb facs="18"/> is raughte oute with the righte: I say, that in no wise thou be ouer-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie to misconstrue me in anye thing, that I wryte, but syncerely interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate my doings.</p>
   <p>If there be any thing, which soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not well in thine eares at the first hearing: yet doe not busilye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne that, whiche thou conceiuest not by and by. Before thou giue oute thy verdict, and proceede to thy rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous censure, I pray thee be well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised▪ Men see not alwayes vpon the sodaine: but no mannes eyes are more blīded, thā theirs which malice hath put out. If my shoe tread not always streighte, I forbidde not a brotherly admonition, which is voide of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and biting gall: for the which I shall heartily giue thee thankes. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this I require of thee, that thou depraue me not behinde my backe.</p>
   <p>This I wryte, muche misdoubting
<pb facs="19"/> the olde croked practise of some crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <hi>Zoilus.</hi> Whose manner is, rather of enuie to be nipping at other mens good endeuoures, than of any charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and godly zeale, himselfe to do any thing for common profite. But lette him say what he list, it shall not skill. For as in publishing of this my work I sought not gredily the praise of the worlde, whiche by the like doing I mighte haue hunted for, not a fewe yeres agoe, hauing a booke redy pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the printe in the latine tong: so neither do I care a whit for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious dispraising of any ill disposed, enuious, or vaine glorious person: let him plaie y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      <hi>Momus,</hi> or the <hi>Mimus,</hi> with neuer so craftie a pretence, yea or else disguise himselfe how he will. Whom moreouer fully I woulde haue aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, that I weighe more the honest testimony of three or foure godly and learned men, whose sincerity of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is well knowne: than the cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="19"/> of an hundred vngracious tongs. Yea, &amp; were it so (as I dare say of the contrary I might assure meself) that I shoulde finde either none, or verie fewe, who in a lawfull quarell would vphold my cause: yet I set more by the witnesse of a good consciēce, than any ill will, or frendship to be had in the worlde. Farewell in Christ.</p>
