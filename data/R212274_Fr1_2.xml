   <head>The humble request of Sir <hi>Ralph Maddison</hi> KNIGHT, to the Honourable House of COMMONS, <hi>Die Martis primo Decembris</hi> 1640.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat it would please this Honourable Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of the House of Commons, to take into their consideration the decay of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes commodities, and especially the Wools of this kingdom of late yeares much decayed in price; which (if it continue) will assuredly pull downe the revenue of King and subject, to the unspeakeable losse of all in generall.</p>
   <p>Which your humble petitioner conceiveth to come by two speciall or principall wayes or meanes, both of them worthy of your High and Noble consideration; namely, the overballancing of Trade in commerce with Strangers, And the marchandizing Exchange by bills used betweene us and strangers; both which doe tend to, and in truth doe drive out our kingdomes Coine both Gold and Silver for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the unequall and prejudiciall ballance of Trade, and the Vsurious and Canker-eating contracts daily practised betweene us and strangers, and especially the Bankers the first movers therein.</p>
   <p>And because the words (ballance of Trade, or commerce and marchandizing Exchange) must of force bee mentioned because they are the words of art of science well knowne to many in this Honourable Assembly, who have beene versed
<pb facs="3"/>
by Trade or Travell in forraine parts: Yet because I suppose there be more here assembled that have not beene ver<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed, or given their mind to Marchandizing businesse; I humbly crave pardon, if I be bold (for the help of all mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing herein) to explaine these words in as few words as I can.</p>
   <p>And first, of (Ballance) all men doe know what it mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in buying and selling at home, but the word (Trade) put thereto, is obscure, till it be opened.</p>
   <p>Ballance of Trade then, is the computation, or taking the account or valuation of all the marchandize exported or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into this kingdome every yeare; which (being cast up) may tell us whether wee get or lose, or what losse or gaine commeth to the kingdomes Commerce that yeare the Ballance is cast up. And if it be found that we import more than we export, then that which doth want of making the ballance equall, must be fulfilled with our kingdomes stocke or store of mony; which (in processe of time) will eate up, or consume (to a small portion) our moneys that should beat or maintaine our home-commerce and markets; (per consequence) lessen the prices of our Woolls, Corne, Lands, and what not? for this is infallibly true in common sence, that where much money is, there the prices are greater; and where little money is, there the prices of all things are lesse, and goe low. Hence it was, and will be said this proverbe, <hi>Regina pecunia donat,</hi> for money will beare rule in price in despight of all men that say no. But I do conjecture (as some have said to my selfe) some in this assembly will say; How is it possible that all goods or marchandize, going out of this Realme and comming in should be accounted? This is a thing that to some wise men doth seeme impossible. To this I answer, It is no new thing, that the valuation or rate or price of all goods going out and into this Realme, hath beene put into bookes duely kept in every port of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and once a yeare at a certaine time all brought into the Kings remembrancers office in the Exchequer, and there to be collected and made up into one grosse summe of all out bound and another grosse summe of all in bound goods;
<pb facs="3"/>
whereby the King might (as in a mirrour) see the face of his common weale whether it grew fat or leane; And this (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der favourable correction be it spoken) was one amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther causes wherefore custome of old was due to the King by common reason or law, for maintenance of the officers that attended this care in every Port, and is so ancient as in <hi>Henry</hi> the third his time it was called (the old custome:) before all memory of Record: This may suffice in brevity for the words, <hi>Ballance of Trade.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Secondly, the word exchange, all know what it is to make a change; Marchandizing Exchange is knowne onely to Marchants, and those that in forraine Travell have used it: And few of either sort doe know the par or equall exchange of Coynes betweene forrainers and us.</p>
   <p>Exchange of Marchants was first invented for saving of portage and keeping of moneys at home in every kingdom, beside the hazard that might befall in carrying of Treasure (as luggage) from kingdome to kingdome, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, upon every severall contract (made to be paid forrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) would bee exported; and every Traveller beyond the Seas should carry his expending mony with him. But now, if by equall or disadvantageous exchange a man deliver an hundred pounds here to bee paid so much like quantity of gold or silver againe there beyond Seas; this both keepeth the money at home. But if by unequall exchange a gaine may bee had by overvaluing of our money beyond Seas, as now they be overvalued, especially in <hi>France,</hi> not only a Marchant making contract as aforesaid, or a Traveller not knowing the mystery, shall lose ten or more in the hundred. And the Marchant observer of the mystery, (for the gaine had thereby) export the money <hi>in specie,</hi> but more especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gold, when visibly without change of species he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ten of those pieces and more in the hundred, and there with ninety pieces pay the hundred pieces received here; and this is the overt or open fallacy, now too frequently in <hi>France</hi> practised upon or by the denomination of that coine: But there is another more secret which is practised by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers to bee considered from the finenesse of the coine;
<pb facs="4"/>
wherein is to be noted, that all Princes coines are not alike, for some have more Ailay or Copper mixt with the gold or silver, which were a long discourse to enter into, and upon agitation of this businesse of Exchange, will be opened suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently there being only two chiefe wayes of deceit; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, or open deceit; The second, intrinsicke or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward value, consisting in the mixture of Copper more or lesse put into the gold or silver.</p>
   <p>It is not unknowne that there bee other great causes which doe hinder our prizes and procure damage to our home commodities; namely, exportation of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, diversion of bullion and home-consumption of gold and silver, Inhancing of our moneys Gold and Silver in forraine parts, and especially in <hi>France</hi> as aforesaid, and home-bred monopolian practises; all which will fall into consideration upon the handling of the two first causes above said.</p>
   <p>Whereupon my humble request is you would be pleased to cause the Ballance of Trade to be truly cast up and presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto you with all speed, as also to take notice how the exchange goeth betweene us and forraigne Marchants. And (if both be found prejudiciall) to set such convenient reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as hath beene formerly in ancient time used, or by your grave wisedomes be found more agreeable to these moderne times; And hee shall ever rest a devoted servant unto our King and Country, with his hartie prayers for prosperity of both.</p>
