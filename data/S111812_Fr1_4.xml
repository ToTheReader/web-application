      <hi>THe doubt which hath ben</hi> held, gentle Readers, vpon the vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiyng, by what way it was possible to passe into the Prouinces of <hi>Peru,</hi> I meane for the people, whiche of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, there first inhabited: But to satisfie that doubt, seemeth sufficient, the aucthoritie and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the diuine <hi>Plato,</hi> who (in brief) maketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersal thereof, in his booke, intituled: <hi>Thimeum,</hi> otherwise called, the nature thinges: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde in another booke, or Dialogue, more at large, proceeding on forward, after his <hi>Thimeum</hi> called <hi>Atlanticum:</hi> where hee treateth of an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storye, which the <hi>Egiptians</hi> set forth in praise and commendation of the <hi>Athenienses,</hi> saying: that in times paste, they were of such power, that they ouercame and atchiued victory, against certayne Kinges, and an infinite number of men of warre, which came by Sea, from a great Iland, called <hi>Insula Atlantica,</hi> which had Origen at <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillers, and was accounted greater then al <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> wherin was contayned tenne King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, the which <hi>Neptunus</hi> deuided amonge his ten Sonnes: but to the eldest called <hi>Atlas,</hi> hee gaue the greatest Kingdome.</p>
   <p>He also writeth of many other memorable thīgs as also of the customes and ritches of this great Iland, but especially, of a famous temple, which was built in the principall Citie: the walles and roofes wherof, were wainscotted, with plate of golde, siluer, and latton, and other many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities,
<pb facs="7"/>
which are longe to rehearce, as originally may be seen, where they are written at large.</p>
   <p>Many of whiche customes and ceremonies, at this day wee haue seen in <hi>Peru.</hi> From this Iland they sayle to other great Ilands, which stand on the farder side therof, nere adioynyng to the firm or continent lande, beyond the which, is the sea, called, the brode or true Sea. The formall words of <hi>Plato,</hi> in the beginninge of <hi>Thimeum,</hi> saythe: That <hi>Socrates</hi> speakyng to the <hi>Athenienses,</hi> sayd: it is holden for trouth, that your cittie in time past did resist an innumerable number of enemies, which came frō y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Sea, called <hi>Mare Athlanticum,</hi> who had taken and enioyed the most parte of all <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi>: For at that time, that strayght was Nauigable: hauyng not far from y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> mouthe an Ilande, which began neare vnto the Pillers of <hi>Hercules,</hi> whiche was reported to bee greater then <hi>Asia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Africa</hi>: and (ioyntly) from the same, was contractacion, in bying &amp; sellyng with other Ilandes, which Ilands had conference with the fyrme and continent lande, which stoode in frent of them, who were neyghbours vnto the true sea.</p>
   <p>For that Sea, with reason might be called the certayne and true Sea, and the lande, continent and fyrme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>his mutche writeth <hi>Plato.</hi> He also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmeth, that .9000. yeares before the writyng hereof, the Sea encreased with so mightie a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of water, in those parties, that in one day and one night, this great Ilande suncke, and all the people perished, and that afterward, the same sea, remayned full of sandes and shallowes, so that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hereby neuer after any mought passe vnto the
<pb facs="7"/>
other Ilandes, nor fyrme lande.</p>
   <p>All those which write vpon <hi>Plato,</hi> affirme and hold opinion, that this Hystorie was true, so that the most of them, especially, <hi>Marsilius, Ficinus,</hi> and <hi>Plantinus,</hi> wil not admit the meanyng to be <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall,</hi> although many others iudge the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as the same <hi>Marsilius</hi> referreth vpon the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations vpon <hi>Thimeum.</hi> But, where he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the .9000. yeres, it seemeth not a fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus argument: for accordynge to <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> those yeres were to be vnderstood accordynge to the <hi>Egiptians</hi> accompt, where euery monthe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted one whole yere, and not accordynge to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> course of the Sunne: so that .9000. monthes, maketh .750. yeres. Likewise it is almost a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, to geue credit to the oppinion, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng this Iland, consydering that all the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riagraphers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and Cosmographers that wrote of olde time, do cal the Sea, where y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Iland suncke, <hi>Mathanticum,</hi> reseruinge the name which it had when it was land: Than presupposyng that the Hystorie is true, who can deny that this Ilande <hi>Athlantica,</hi> began from the streight of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> or not far from <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and extended into the greate gulfe, where as well North and South, as East and West, is a greater space then the scituation of all <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The Ilands wherof the text maketh mencion seemeth to be <hi>Espaniola, Cuba, Iamaica,</hi> and the residew which stande in that Comarke.</p>
   <p>The firme landes, whiche is sayd to stande in frent of the said Ilands: doth appere by reason, to be the same firme land, which now is called after
<pb facs="8"/>
the same name, and al the other prouinces, wher vnto it is continent: which, beginnynge from the straight of <hi>Magalanez,</hi> doth contayne (runnyng Northward) the lande of <hi>Peru:</hi> the Prouince of <hi>Popayan, Castillia del oro, Beragua, Nicaragua, Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timalla Nueua Hispania,</hi> the seuen citties, <hi>Florida, Bacallaos:</hi> and the said lande, runneth along from thence Norward, vntill it come to ioygne almost with <hi>Norway</hi>: In the which (without doubt) is more grounde, then as yet throughout all the world is inhabited, or at least was knowen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the discouery of this countrey. This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth not cause any great dificultie, that the <hi>Romaines</hi> and other nations, which in time past, inioyed the Land of <hi>Spayne,</hi> had not discouered this countrey: It is to be thought, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of those Seas, in those dayes, did disturbe and hinder the Nauigation.</p>
   <p>So that this Lande, may well bee called the firme and continent Land, wherof <hi>Plato</hi> writeth: which doth agree with all the tokens and signes, which hee giueth of the other: cheefely, wherin hee affirmeth, that it lyeth infrent of the South Sea. Then forasmuch as hath beene sayled in our daies, in the sayd South Sea, doth appere, that in respect of the bredth and greatnes of the sayde South Sea, all the <hi>Mediterraneum</hi> Sea, and as much as is knowen of the Occean, vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly called, the Northen Sea, are Riuers in comparison of the other.</p>
   <p>Then all this approued true, the signes, tokens and wordes of <hi>Plato,</hi> do therwith accord: so that
<pb facs="8"/>
there is no doubt or difficultie in the first passage into <hi>Peru,</hi> of innumerable people, as well from the great Iland <hi>Atlantica,</hi> as also from other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes, from which Ilandes they vsed to sayle: and also out of the firme Land, they might passe into <hi>Peru</hi>: And if in this pointe should seeme any difficultie, yet it is to bee credited, that by the South Sea, they had vse and knowledge of Nauigation, by contraction and traficke, which they had with this great Iland, where the text declareth, that they had great aboundance of Shippes, yea, and Roades, and harbors, made by force of hande, for their conseruacion, where nature wanted.</p>
   <p>This is as much as may be gathered, touching this matter, which is not small, for a thing of such antiquitie, without light: cheefely, that in all the Prouinces and Countrey of <hi>Peru,</hi> were founde no kinde of Letters or Writinge, to conserue the remembrance of things past, nor yet the pictures or paynting, which serued in the new <hi>Spayne,</hi> for Letters, sauing only, certayne stringes, of diuerse colours, full of knots: so that by those knots and distance betweene them, was an account kepte amonge that people, but maruailous strange to be vnderstood, as hereafter in this History shalbe declared. Therfore I may saye with <hi>Horatius</hi>:
<q>Si quid nouicti restius istis, candidus imperti: si non vis vtere mecum.</q>
   </p>
   <p>And as concerning the Discouery of this newe countrey, the wordes of <hi>Seneca</hi> doth fit, which he set out in his <hi>Medea</hi> Tragedy.</p>
   <q>
      <pb facs="9"/>
      <l>Venient annis saecula seris,</l>
      <l>Quibus Oceanus vincula rerum</l>
      <l>Laxet, nouosque typhis detegat orbes</l>
      <l>Atque ingens pateat tellus</l>
      <l>Nec sit terris vltima thyle.</l>
   </q>
   <p>Besides the oppinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> at this day are to be seene the Ilands of <hi>Asorez, Canarie, Madera</hi> and Ilandes of <hi>Cabo Verde</hi>: with wonderfull shallowes and Sande, lyinge farre out into the mayne Sea, which are thought to haue bin part of the sayd Iland <hi>Athlantica.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This History doth also set forth the dutie, and royall seruice, of the Subiect to his Prince, and how Mutynies are iustly punished: And likewise, last of all, how blood is punished with blood: and the highe waye to <hi>Honour,</hi> is great paine, and daunger of lyfe. And I for my parte (Gentle Reader) desire no more for my paynes, but that thou wilte as willingly accept my trauaile, as I with good will do offer the same.</p>
   <closer>Farewell.</closer>
