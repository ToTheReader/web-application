      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ORSHIPFVLL AND
beloued in Christ; At the
solemne knitting of you
togither, was this Sermon
preached by that worthy
Seruant of God, and our common frend,
now with God, then first (as I haue heard
him say) performing that office that then
he did. Which of late lighting vpon, among
other his loose papers, I thought it would
not be amisse rather to send it abroad, then
to suffer it (as it might soone perhaps other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise)
to miscary and so perish▪ The piety
<pb facs="22"/>
and pithines of the discourse it selfe seemed
to require no lesse of me: that which any
indicious &amp; religious, I assure my self, will
with me easily acknowledge. The rarity
likewise of the subiect the rather encited
me thereunto. He treadeth a tracke not so
vsually beaten. Of <hi>Mariage Sermons,</hi> that
entreat of <hi>Mariage duties,</hi> there are extant
not a few. Such as handle the religious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of <hi>Mariage Feasts,</hi> I suppose not
many; I remember not to haue seene any.
It is that, that this holy Man of God doth
here principally insist vpon: and it is a
point very necessarie, and of no small vse.
For to let passe that grosse abuse, too too
frequent among the prophaner sort, that
esteeme such meetings neuer well seasoned,
or aright celebrated, vnlesse filthy discourse
