   <head>To all true louers of Arte and knowledge.</head>
   <l>SOmetimes I writ the formes of burning balles,</l>
   <l>Supplying wants that were by woodfals wrought</l>
   <l>Sometimes of tubs defended so by Arte,</l>
   <l>As fire in vaine hath their destruction sought:</l>
   <l>Sometimes I writ of lasting Beuerage,</l>
   <l>Great <hi>Neptune</hi> and his Pilgrims to content:</l>
   <l>Sometimes of foode, sweete, fresh, and durable,</l>
   <l>To maintaine life when all things els were spent:</l>
   <l>Sometimes I writ of sundrie sorts of soile,</l>
   <l>Which neither <hi>Ceres</hi> nor her handmaids knew,</l>
   <l>I writ to all, but scarsly one beleeues</l>
   <l>Saue <hi>Diue</hi> and <hi>Denshire</hi> who haue sound thē true</l>
   <l>When heauens did mourne in cloudy mantles clad,</l>
   <l>And threatned famine to the sonnes of men:</l>
   <l>VVhen sobbing earth denide her kindly fruit</l>
   <l>To painefull ploughman and his bindes, euen then</l>
   <l>I writ relieuing remedies of dearth,</l>
   <l>That Arte might helpe where nature made a saile:</l>
   <l>But all in vaine these new borne babes of Arte,</l>
   <l>In their vntimelie birth straight way do quaile.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>Of these and such like other newe found skils,</l>
   <l>VVith painfull pen I whilome writ at large,</l>
   <l>Expecting still my Countries good therein,</l>
   <l>And not respecting labour, time, or charge.</l>
   <l>But now my pen and paper are perfum'd,</l>
   <l>I scorne to write with Coppres or with galle,</l>
   <l>Barbarian canes are now become my quils,</l>
   <l>Rosewater is the inke I write withall:</l>
   <l>Of sweetes the sweetest I will now commend,</l>
   <l>To sweetest creatures that the earth doth beare:</l>
   <l>These are the Saints to whom I sacrifice</l>
   <l>Preserues and conserues both of plum and peare.</l>
   <l>Empalings now adew, tush marchpaine wals</l>
   <l>Are strong enough, and best be fits our age:</l>
   <l>Let piercing bullets turne to sugar bals:</l>
   <l>The Spanish féare is husht and all their rage.</l>
   <l>Of Marmelade and paste of Genua,</l>
   <l>Of musked sugars I intend to wright:</l>
   <l>Of Leach, of Sucket, and Quidinia,</l>
   <l>Affording to each Lady her delight.</l>
   <l>I teach both fruits and flowers to preserue,</l>
   <l>And candie them, so Nutmegs, cloues and mace:</l>
   <l>To make both marchpaine paste, and sugred plate,</l>
   <l>And cast the same in formes of sweetest grace.</l>
   <l>Each bird and foule so moulded from the life,</l>
   <l>And after cast in sweet compounds of arte,</l>
   <l>As if the flesh and forme which nature gaue,</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>Did still remaine in euerie lim and part.</l>
   <l>When chrystall frosts haue nipt the tender grape,</l>
   <l>And cleane consum'd the fruits of euerie vine,</l>
   <l>Yet here behold the clusters fresh and faire,</l>
   <l>Fed from the branch, or hang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ng on the line,</l>
   <l>The walnut, small nut, and the Chesnut sweete,</l>
   <l>Whose sugred kernels loose their pleasing taste,</l>
   <l>Are here from yeere to yeere preserued,</l>
   <l>And made by Arte with strongest fruites to last.</l>
   <l>Th'artichoke, the apple of such strength,</l>
   <l>The Quince, Pomegranate, with the Barberie,</l>
   <l>No sugar vs'd, yet colour, taste, and smell,</l>
   <l>Are here maintain'd and kept most naturally.</l>
   <l>For Ladies closets and their stillatories,</l>
   <l>Both waters, ointments, and sweet smelling bals,</l>
   <l>In easie termes without affected speech,</l>
   <l>Theere present most ready at their cals.</l>
   <l>And least with carelesse pen I should omit,</l>
   <l>The wrongs that nature on their persons wrought,</l>
   <l>Or parching sunne with his hot firie rayes,</l>
   <l>For these likewise, relieuing meanes I sought.</l>
   <l>No idle thoughts, nor vaine surmised skils,</l>
   <l>By fancie framde within a theorique braine,</l>
   <l>My muse presents vnto your sacred eares,</l>
   <l>To win your fauours falsly, I disdaine.</l>
   <l>From painfull practise, from experience,</l>
   <l>A sound though costly mysteries I deriue</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="4"/>VVith firy flames in scorching <hi>Vulcans</hi> forge,</l>
   <l>To teast and fine each secret I do striue:</l>
   <l>Accept them well and let my wearied muse</l>
   <l>Repose her selfe in Ladies laps a while,</l>
   <l>So when shee wakes, she happely may record,</l>
   <l>Her sweetest dreames in some more pleasing stile.</l>
