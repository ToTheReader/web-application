Or, The second booke of liuing creatures : wherein is contained their diuine, naturall, and morall descriptions, with their liuely figures, names, conditions, kindes and natures of all venemous beasts: with their seuerall poysons and antidotes; their deepe hatred to mankind, and the wonderfull worke of God in their creation, and destruction.

   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle and pious Reader, although it be needlesse for mee to write any more of the publishing of this Treatise of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous beasts, yet for your better satisfaction and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, briefly take this which followeth.</p>
   <p>After the publishing of the former booke of <hi>Foure-footed Beasts,</hi> I vnderstood of two thinges much misliked therin, wherein I also my selfe receiued a iust offence. First, the manifolde escapes in the presse, which turned and sometimes ouerturned the sence in many places, (especially in the Latine:) which fault as it may in parte concerne me, so yet it toucheth another more deepely, yet are both of vs excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable: He, in wanting the true knowledge of the Latine tongue; and I, bicause of my employment in my pastorall charge, and both of vs together, because we were not so thorowly estated, as to maintaine a sufficient Scholler to attend only vpon the presse. Wherefore, in this second Booke, we haue remooued away that blot, and vsed a more accurate dilligence, and I trust there is no escape committed peruerting the sence, and not very many altring the letters.</p>
   <p>The second exception taken against the former Treatise, was the not eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing or translating of the Latine verses, which thing I purposed to haue done if I had not beene ouerhastened in the businesse; for it had beene to the worke an ornament, and to the History a more ample declaration: This faulte I haue now amended in the setting forth of this second Booke of <hi>Liuing Creatures.</hi> Al therefore that can be saide for your direction, I could wish the Historye more compleat for the manifestation of the most blessed <hi>Trinities</hi> glory, whose works are here declared; and for the better reuelation of the seuerall natures of euery Serpent. I may fayle in the expressing of some particular, yet I suppose that I haue omitted no one thing in their Narration, which might bee warranted by good authority or experience. And therfore, although I cannot say that I haue saide all that can be written of these liuing Creatures, yet I dare say I haue wrote more then euer was before me written in any language.</p>
   <p>Now therefore <hi>Aske the Creatures (after God,) and they will tell you:</hi> For, sayth S. <hi>Austen, Interrogatio creaturarum profunda est consideratio ipsarum: responsio ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, attesta ipsarum de Deo, quoniam omnia clamant, Deus nos fecit.</hi> The aske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Creatures is a deepe and profounde consideration of theyr seuerall natures: theyr answere is, their attestation or testimony of God, because all of
<pb facs="5"/>
them cry out <hi>The Lord hath made vs.</hi> Wherefore, seeing it is most true, <hi>incogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta non desiderantur,</hi> things vnknowne are not desired, to the intent that all true English Christians may hereafter more affectionately long after and desire, both the mysticall vision of God in this world, and also his perfect sight in the worlde to come, I haue (for my part) out of that weake ability wherwith I am endued, made knowne vnto them in their owne mother tongue, the wonderfull workes of God; for the admiring of Gods praise in the Creatures, standeth not in a confused ignorance not knowing the beginnings and reason of euery thinge, but rather in a curious and artificiall inuestigation of their greatest secrets.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let all liuing men consider euery part of diuine wisedome in all his workes; for if it be high, he therby terrifieth the proud; by the truth he fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the great ones; by his affability he nourisheth the little ones, and so I will conclude my preface, with the wordes of the three Children: <hi>O all ye workes of the Lorde, praise him and magnifie him for euer.</hi>
