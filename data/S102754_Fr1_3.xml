   <head>TO THE CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S euery action of Christ is
for our instruction, soe es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
his earnest suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
made in the daies
of his flesh, are for our edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
And as our blessed sauiour came
into this world annointed to be our king,
our prophet, and preist, soe accordingly
hereunto all his principall actions were
sorted out: in his holy workes &amp; miracles,
he shewed his diuine power as a king, in his
heauenly sermons, he ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e knowne his
diuine wisdome as our prophet: and in his
praiers he testified his diuine loue as a
mercifull high preist.</p>
   <p>Three of Christs praiers are especially
commended vnto vs: that at Lazarus
graue,<note place="margin">Ioh. 11.</note> the other in the garden before his
passion,<note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> this in the 17. of Iohn, as a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
thereunto: the first made with
<pb facs="7"/>
sighes and grones, the second with droppes
of blood and teares, the third with great
zeale and affection: the first shewing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration,
the second making a way to
our redemption, the third the fruite of
his mediation.</p>
   <p>In three things this praier of Christ dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
from the requestes of his members:
first in respect of the person that praieth,
secondly in the manner of the praier,
thirdly in the matter prayed for: the first
was with authoritie, he praieth as our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
both God and man, the second was
with all sanctitie, whereas we can not tell
how to pray as we ought. Rom. 8. 16. the
third with great efficacy: the force of this
praier continueth to the end of the world,
whereas our praiers are weake, and had
need often to be iterated and repeated,
and therefore the Apostle biddeth vs pray
without ceasing.<note place="margin">1. Thess. 5. 17.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Three principall benefits are conferred
vpon vs by this praier 1. our <hi>protection</hi>
from euil and danger: keepe them from
euil v. 15. 2. the collation or bestowing of
<pb facs="7"/>
all spirituall grace; sanctifie them with
thy truth v. 17. 3. the impetration or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning
of our seuerall praiers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questes:<note place="margin">Math. 14. 31.</note>
in the first Christ stretcheth forth
his hand as to Peter, to helpe vs that we
sinke not: in the second he looketh vpon vs
with the eyes of mercie as vpon the same
Peter,<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 61.</note> to giue vs his grace: in the third
his eares are open to heare vs, as they were
at the crie of blind Bartimeus.<note place="margin">Mar. 10. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Salomon hauing built God an house,<note place="margin">1. King. 8.</note>
did dedicate it by his praier vnto God: here
a greater then Salomon, by praiers better
then Salomons, doth consecrate vnto God
an house more glorious then was Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
the spirituall temple of the church.
This praier of our Sauiour is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our praiers, the propp and stay of
our requestes, the very life of our supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vnto God:<note place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>d▪ 17.</note> as Aaron and Hurr held
vp Moses hands, soe our feeble handes are
hereby strengthned: it is vnto our praiers
as the fiery chariot and horse to Elias,<note place="margin">2. King. 2.</note> to
carrie them vp into heauen: And as the
Eagle beareth vp her young ones vpon her
<pb facs="8"/>
wings. Deuter. 32. 11. soe this praier of
Christ giueth wings vnto our praiers: &amp;
it is as the censor,<note place="margin">Apoc. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>.</note> wherein the odors of
our praiers are censed vp vnto god. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when we addresse our selues to our
praiers let vs remember this praier, as
the Israelites looked vp to the brasen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
in the wildernes,<note place="margin">Numb. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>1. 9.</note> and as Stephen saw
Iesus sitting at the right hand of God:<note place="margin">Act. 7. 56.</note> let
vs lay it vp in our hart, as the tables of
stone were kept in the arke,<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>b. 9. 14.</note> let it be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
to be laid alwaies vpon our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
offerings,<note place="margin">Leuit 1. 15.</note> and as salt,<note place="margin">Leuit. 2. 13.</note> whereby to sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
our sacrifices.</p>
   <p>Thus this holy praier of our Sauiour, if
we be in heauines, it will comfort vs, if in
perill, deliuer vs: if we want any grace it
will releeue vs: in this life it will guiavs,
and in the next saue vs: Amen.</p>
