   <head>TO THE MOST NOBLE LORD, the Lord Robert Deuoreux, Earle of Essex, of <hi>her Maiesties priuie Counsell, Knight of the Princely Order of the Garter.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Noble, my verie especiall good Lord, I present nowe vnto your Lordship, this historicall <hi>Essay,</hi> in print, which I offered before in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, eyther because I am vrged to this dutie by your most honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble munificence toward me, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I cannot prouide my other exercises written of greater and grauer matters. Yet I take the defence of mediocritie for a matter of some weight, both in this historie of <hi>Brute,</hi> which is made litigious, and in any other position of much lesse importance, euen of haire it selfe; insomuch as mediocritie cannot be disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
   <p>It is manifest, that some haue written more of <hi>Brute</hi> then behoued them, but some haue behaued themselues vnkindly against <hi>Brutans,</hi> and done lesse for them, then they should.</p>
   <p>They are on both partes, too learned for me, I am not worthy to be their moderator, in this question of <hi>Brute:</hi> howbeit, as they haue freely deliuered their opinions with out any stop, so would I shew the good will I beare to the one part, without any hatred to the other. God forbid,
<pb facs="3"/>
that diuersitie of studies, should bring forth a diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of heartes among neighbours and friendes: it were better no bookes at all were written, then to a breake the bond of vnitie, and loosen the yoke of obedience by them, seeing wee may liue better without them, men without these.</p>
   <p>I hope, I am cleane from any abuse in this present trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, I will euer honour strangers, for their good qualities of learning and life: but I must not hold my hand and pen still, when I see them too busie, in tossing our histories and actes, at their owne pleasure, which appertaine not vnto them: they cannot stay mee from my studie, more then I kept them from this practise. I fauour the historie of <hi>Brute,</hi> without regard of their disfauour, as they dislike it, without respect of other mens liking. I cannot in loyaltie defend euery <hi>Brute,</hi> but I may without any breach of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, defend this great <hi>Brute of Brutanie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Wherefore I most humbly beseech your most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good Lordship, to accept of this mightie Captaines present defence, euen as your worthy honour, vseth to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the reasonable sutes of approued men, which are like to do God good seruice, and this kingdome.</p>
   <p>Thus trusting to your Lordships magnificent, &amp; sweete fauour heerein, I most heartily commend your true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed honour, to the blessed estate of immortalitie.</p>
