                 <title>The Christian synagogue : Wherein is contayned the diverse reading, the right poynting, translation, and collation of scripture with scripture. With the customes of the Hebrewes and proselytes, and of all those nations, with whom they were conversant. Digested into three bookes. The first, shewing the meanes both inward and outward, to attaine to the knowledge of the sense of the whole Scripture. The second, vnfolding the true sense of the Scripture it selfe ... The third, teaching the true manner of confirmation, illustration, and application of doctrines ... Serving generally for a helpe to the vnderstanding, of all; that desire to know and obey the will of God in holy Writ: but more specially for all young students in divinitie, that they may more easily vnderstand the languages of Canaan, and Greece, and make a profitable vse of them in preaching.

      <salute>GOOD CHRISTIAN READER,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vch hath ever beene the inveterate malice of Satan (that old Serpent) against the Church of God; that he hath partly by open Hostilitie, and partly by contagious Heresie; sought vtterly to quench the glorious light of the Word of God: that <hi>(all men sitting in darkenesse)</hi> he might the sooner blow vp the whole frame of the house of God. How farre the Potentates of the world, haue advanced themselues in his service, our Histories doe sufficiently declare, who (with many learned Fathers of the Church) haue inrolled in their famous writings, all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer infamous hereticks, and their blasphemies, to their perpetuall shame.</p>
   <p>The Papists (as naturall children) succeeded to those viperous Parents, but haue farre exceeded them in number of heresies, and barbarous cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: setting forward Satans former policie, with all their might. For as they haue written very basely of the holy Scriptures; so haue they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled, the writings of man vnto them, and honoured the <hi>Apocryphe</hi> Bookes, with that stately throne, in the which <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> sitteth, as the onely high, and mightie commander: yea, they thundred Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications and <hi>Marana-tha,</hi> against any of the <hi>Laiks</hi> (as they call them) that dare reade, any part of Scripture in their owne tongue.</p>
   <p>But behold the great mercy of God to his Church; for, although, all those laboured to haue quenched the light of the Word, and to depriue the Church of that glorious Lampe; yet they haue come far short there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and were never able to ecclipse that Sun-shine of the Church, though they did stretch out the wings of their malice, to the ends of the earth. I referre thee <hi>(good Christian Reader)</hi> to the view of those godly and learned Instruments, whom God of his mercy raised vp, (as valiant men) to withstand this hereticall furie; whose invincible courage learning and constancie, did amase the adversaries; I forbeare to excerp particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: you haue a cloud of witnesses, specified by <hi>Irenaeus, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, Hierome,</hi> and diverse other.</p>

   <p>As for the Author of this Booke▪ Intituled, THE CHRISTIAN SYNAGOGVE, he is a godly Preacher, and well qualified in all good learning. In these his workes, he hath carefully laboured to cast out that filth and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ubbish, wherewith the <hi>Philistims had stopped Abrahams wills:</hi> Besides, he hath painefully digged, a pleasant passage that leadeth therevnto. And because the word of God hath a most sweet relish about all things; he doth instruct thee how to discerne the same, that thou may'st be drunke with the waters of life. The Author, besides the most appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Greeke and Latine Writers, hath well read with deliberation also, the ancient customes of the Iewes, in their owne <hi>Rabbines,</hi> and hath mentioned so many of them, as giues no small light for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Text, and likewise hath had conferrence vpon the same things with the most approved Schollers of the Kingdome.</p>
   <p>Let me exhort thee <hi>Christian Reader,</hi> to a diligent studie of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginalls, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greeke,</hi> with all their dialects especially, the <hi>Chaldaean, Syrian, Arabicke,</hi> and <hi>Samaritan,</hi> which are great Lights and Illustrations for the Text, whereby thou maiest more easily, not onely follow the rules, which the Author setteth before thee, in his Cannons gathered from Scripture, in his Confirmations by Scripture, and Illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both from the Scripture it selfe, and from Writers, both Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and profane: But also thou mayest delight thy selfe, in the pleasant fields of the Old and New Testament.</p>
   <p>I am assured thou shalt greatly increase thy knowledge by reading this Booke: for as others that are not yet acquainted with the Originals, haue reapt no small comfort, by reading some scattered sheetes, that came to my hand from the Presse: What mayest thou expect after thy diligent labours therein. Thou canst not praise God sufficiently, who hath offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee, the painefull travels of such learned men, that thou mayest know another day how to worke in the Lords Vineyard.</p>
   <p>As for the <hi>Reader,</hi> whose purpose is not to Preach the VVord, but to profit by the same as a reverend hearer. I dare assure thee, that by this learned VVorke (if thou pervse diligently) thou shalt attaine to great light and knowledge in the holy VVord, and shalt finde many places thereof farre more clearely opened vp then thou didst expect.</p>
