      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onsyderyng (right hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) my promise pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghted (vnto my friende, lately enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) I was enforced to performe the perfecting of this Englishe Treatise: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I had not so willingly attempted to solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite your honour wyth this vulgare stile. And sithens that reason requyreth, and duty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maūdeth, the satisfying of the trust in me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, I doubte not but that myne enterprise will be allowed.

of all humanitie, if that I shoulde ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately neglect, the earnest desire of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seased: likewise, worthy were I to be deemed vndutyfull, and altogether vngratefull, if that I shoulde omit any oportunitie, whereby I myght encrease so rare a commoditye to my country. I therefore respecting the requeste of my friend, and tēdering the profit of my coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, haue craued herein (as heretofore in all other mine affaires) your honours protection, and the rather, for that I finde none (your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour excepted) neyther in auntient aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, neyther by common consente, neyther by present proofe, that hath more warely, and wisely, warded the weale of this countrey.
