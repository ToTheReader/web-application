      <salute>SIR,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have read of an ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome used amongst the Heathens, that when they brought their sacrifices into the Temple, they brought therewith all such receits of medicines for diseases, as they had found out by experience, and there delivered
<pb facs="3"/>them to be preserved for the perpetuall benefit of their posteritie: their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences perswading them that their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices would be better accepted therefore, and that it was a wicked deed to let such knowledge die with them, which might do so much good to others: as for the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I think so well of it, as I am minded to make it my paterne: and therefore desire that under your patronage I may bring in my receit, containing a medicine, no doubt, for innumerable diseases; as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the fundamentall cause thereof, to wit, indigence: which by causing of the mindes sadnesse produceth Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious bloud and humours, the fountaine of the diseases of these times; the diseases thus caused kill by distance of time: cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials do but deferre the time: there is no approved medicine but this, in an over-peopled Common-wealth, to wit, good improvements of the earth; which may be effected by the new inventions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Booke: and there is nothing wanting but willing mindes to make this
<pb facs="3"/>Countrey the Paradise of the World; if Gentlemen of qualitie would be pleased to begin first, and to lay the corner Stone of this building, all would follow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question: for that gaine, the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of the World, being laid a little open by practise, would draw the rest: there is no cause that I know why they should be slacke in it: there be a great number of Parishes within my knowledge, and without question infinite more that I know not, where the Landlord by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of his money upon these improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may gaine double as much, as by purchasing of new Lands: also the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Tithes of many things may be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; and the inhabitants, though much increased, may live better then before. If this be not a better cure for an over-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled Common-wealth, then to make vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent incursions upon others territories, as is too frequent, I referre the matter to all mens judgements: the whole world is all of one Gods making, and no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is or should be one body Politique;
<pb facs="4"/>wherein to use Phlebotomie when there is no other meanes ready, is as foolish as to doe the same thing in Bodies naturall, also there is no disparagement to men of qualitie to take this worke in hand: for many men of eminent dignitie have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in these affaires, amongst which let <hi>Dioclesian</hi> the Emperour serve for brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties sake in this place: who when he had resigned his Scepter, could finde no such pleasure and contentment in any thing, as he did in the planting and grassing of trees, and in the Sowing, and Setting of profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Seeds: and surely it is a wonderfull delectation to see that the earths fatnesse (being the Treasure, and indeed the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all Treasure and Riches in the World,) may be transformed into what forme the Workman listeth: This Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is discovered more at large in the Chapter concerning the fertilizing of Land: and is included plentifully, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Element: <hi>viz.</hi> in the Aire, which is manifest in that the <hi>Camelion</hi> an Animall, and the <hi>Semper-vive</hi> a Plant, can live and
<pb facs="4"/>grow in magnitude and ponderositie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching any other Element: also in the Water by the infinite increase of Fishes: also in the earth by the infinite and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible treasure which it produceth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually: onely in the earth it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miscompounded: the reasons are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared at large in this Booke: for it consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth of a double nature, the one Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the other Celestiall or Aethiriall: if either of these predominate, then the earth is barren and bringeth forth nothing that is beneficiall: for if the Aethereall part be not of force and quantitie sufficient, by the heate of the Sunne, to lift up the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriall part, then no fruit thereof spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Againe, if the Terrestriall part be not of force to coagulate and harden the other into profitable fruits, then all is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to smoake, like the accustomed works of Alchymistes: all the skill consisteth in the right compounding of these two substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which in many places, may be done with such facilitie as is wonderfull: the
<pb facs="5"/>reasons hereafter declared are sufficient to turne Plow-men into Philosophers; and to make them to excell their predecessors, even as a learned Physician excelleth an Empericke. For though many notable improvements have been heretofore found out, yet they came more by accident then by good grounds of reason: yet infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beneficiall, and therefore not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised: for he that found out the way of fertilizing of Land with Lime or Marle, (though by accident) did a more charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deed in publishing thereof: then if he had built all the Hospitalls in <hi>England:</hi> for the one feedeth and cloatheth a few hungry and naked persons, the other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableth an infinite number both to feed and clothe themselves and others: these things have moved me to bestow much time and charges in these affaires; deeming my attempt to be the most excellent that wit can be employed about; for that these knowledges are more durable then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon riches: and no Lawyer can make an
<pb facs="5"/>estate so indefesible as an approved and profitable experiment is: the reason why I chose you to be my Patron, is your ripenesse of Iudgement in affaires of this nature: you being a Gentleman that hath spent threescore yeares time in invention to doe good to the State and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: and that hath accomplished more profitable experiments then any man in these latter ages: if witnesse be expected, let the noble and bountifull gift of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for your full accomplishment of your works projected and never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished formerly by any, serve the turne: To conclude, my desire is, that you and all Readers would be pleased to consider that my time being spent in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall experiments may well deny mee Scholasticall Oratorie: and therefore I desire no more of you, or of any Reader, but that my good meaning may serve in stead of <hi>Ciceroes</hi> Oratorie, to smooth over and dawbe up my imperfections that way: and that the paines and charges being
<pb facs="6"/>mine, and the profit being to redound to the Readers, if they be so pleased, may serve in stead of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> his eloquence to perswade them to take them thankfully: so I humbly take my leave this twentieth of <hi>November,</hi> 1638.</p>
