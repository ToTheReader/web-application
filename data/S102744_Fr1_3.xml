How well it is performed, I am not able to iudge, because it is out of my <hi>Element.</hi> The <hi>Gentleman</hi> arguing the Case is knowne to many, but diversly both thought and reported of, upon occasion of his present troubles.

But touching the poynt it selfe, I hope that as you (out of the depth of your iudgment &amp; great experience) are able to speake much, both for the matter and manner of it, so you will not be unwilling to declare your minde, as occasion shalbe offered, either in the like or dislike of it. And so having no more at this time to trouble your Worship withall, but patiently waiting for your opinion herein (if you so thinke it good) and wishing alwayes all maner of good unto you, I humblie take my leaue.</p>
