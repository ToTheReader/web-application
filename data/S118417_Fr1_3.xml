   <p>NO man (Christian Reader) can serue two masters, saith our Sauiour Christ; for the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that is of God is sweet and delectable: but this is not for al men, but for those only, which despise the vanities of this world. It is impossible to taste of God and his pleasures, &amp; to loue disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately the things of this life. All men would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy gladly the sweet conuersatiō of our Lord; but few there be that will forgoe their owne worldly desires, and willingly despise their earthly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēts: they desire greatly to haue the inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the soule; but withall, they desire to satisfy their own extraordinary lusts and appetites. This may well appeare in the Apostasy of this Noble man, very godly &amp; carefully broght vp in his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeeres in the true Religion, who casting off all true feare of God, loue of true Religion, and the great honour &amp; commendations that his house &amp; predecessors had, for professing &amp; maintaining the same against the enemies therof, suffering himselfe in the prime of his yeres, with pride and preiudice, two of his chiefe guides into Italy, to be bereft of that precious &amp; inestimable pearle of Christs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: for pride insinuating her selfe, crept into his soule (a most dangerous ghest) &amp; taking once pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, is very hard to be expelled againe. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice on the other part, so great an enemy to the
<pb facs="4"/>
truth, that it makes the mind vncapable of it; for if in his heart he had laid a sure groūd, all his enemies had not shaken it, much lesse ouer thrown his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Ye see, be loued, what it is to serue two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as he would haue done. I compare him vnto those, who kindles a fire vnder greene wood, and leaues it so soone as it begins to flame, leauing off a good beginning, for want of seconding it with a suteable proceeding: but rather lazily &amp; cowardly being ouercome with the pleasures of the coūtry, and the curiosity of his young and vayne conceits, forgetting the seruice of God, wherin he had liued before, betook him to the seruice of Antichrist, &amp; with-drew himselfe, as with a discontented mind, from the company of his chiefe Gouernour, both graue, wise, and godly, giuing himselfe ouer to the company of those deuouring Serpents, who neuer left him, vntil he was broght into the endlesse La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borinth of their superstitious Idolatry, &amp; made his soule drunk with the new wine of the cup of the Beast. I beseech you therefore, all that loue your owne saluation, to take here your example, and eschue the company of the vngodly &amp; wicked, but especially such, as in the habits of simple Lambs, come secretly as Wolues, to infect and deuoure your soules, vnder the pretence of holinesse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion: and so I bid you farewell.</p>
