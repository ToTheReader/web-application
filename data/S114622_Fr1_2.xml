      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou are saluted, by (I thinke)
you know not whom: I would
be sorrie you should; for a
beggerly generation of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenarie

the reporters of all truths in

you from the number of ordinarie censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
so let your charitie excuse mee from being
of the number of ordinary writers.</p>
   <p>The Seller of these presents entreated I would
speake a word or two to you in his name: but I
thought it most necessarie to be mine owne aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate;
lest, if it should happen this <hi>concealement</hi>
to be found out, (as
<q>Multa fidem promissa leuant.</q>
The largest promises come from the longest
tongues) I might be exposed to the tyrannous rage
of them, who by my expence of two houres, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated
in their proiect, importing at least two
peeces, and twentie or thirtie coppies. Beleeue
this therefore, as y would beleeue any thing that

the voluntarie oathes of many, the truth of which
none can doubt of, but such as vse themselues to

I heard not of it (how could I?) till it was too
late to see it; but if I had, there motenesse of the
place would peraduenture haue perswaded me (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the prouerbe) rather to content my selfe
with beleeuing it, than to goe to see it. But that I
may not be too light in so graue and waightie a
matter, I will conclude with that common excuse,
<hi>You haue it as good cheape as I,</hi> and cheaper;
for it cost me thrice as much time in writing, as it
