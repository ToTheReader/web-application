                 <title>A briefe dissection of Germaines affliction : with warre, pestilence, and famine; and other deducable miseries, lachrimable to speak of; more lamentable to partake of. Sent as a (friendly) monitor to England, warning her to beware of, (generally) ingratitude, and security as also (particularly) other greevous sinnes, the weight whereof Germany hath a long time felt, and at this present doth (and England may feare to) feele. Written from approv'd intelligence, by M. Parker</title>

   <l>THus (tender hearted Reader have I set</l>
   <l>Before thine eyes (what thou shouldst nere forget)</l>
   <l>The misery which neighbour Nations feele,</l>
   <l>Through war, famine, and pestilence, the wheele</l>
   <l>Of Fortune's still in motion, though we sit</l>
   <l>In peace, and plenty, yet ith midst of it,</l>
   <l>Tis fit we should on <hi>Iosephs</hi> troubles thinke,</l>
   <l>Least of the cup of wrath, we also drinke,</l>
   <l>Let's all consider tis th' Almighties hand,</l>
   <l>That striketh others, and doth spare our land,</l>
   <l>And that his love, (not our desarts) are cause,</l>
   <l>Why from our Nation he the stroke withdrawes,</l>
   <l>We are as wicked (if not more) then they</l>
   <l>On whom he doth his rod of anger lay,</l>
   <l>And therefore though as yet we live in mirth,</l>
   <l>(Injoying all the blessings upon earth,</l>
   <l>A Gracious King, under whose Governement</l>
   <l>We live, in peace, and for our more content</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="13"/>Are fortifi'd with Royall Off-spring which</l>
   <l>Our land with future blessings may inrich,)</l>
   <l>Yet if this peace and plenty which we have,</l>
   <l>Doe make us proud, forgetting him who gave</l>
   <l>Vs all these comforts, which our neighbours want,</l>
   <l>We well may feare, least he his love transplant,</l>
   <l>Into another people, that will yeild</l>
   <l>A larger crop of thankes; O let the field</l>
   <l>Of each ones heart, receive the seede of grace,</l>
   <l>And with true gratitude prevent his face,</l>
   <l>Lets hate our loved sins, our vaine excesse</l>
   <l>Of (Luciferian) pride, sloth, drunkennesse,</l>
   <l>Extortion, avarice, and luxury,</l>
   <l>Let's feede and cloath Christ in necessity,</l>
   <l>I meane in's little ones, what's done to them,</l>
   <l>His owne words ratifie, as done to him,</l>
   <l>This is his will, to do't lets all endever,</l>
   <l>And he (no doubt) will give us peace for ever.</l>
   <closer>Amen.</closer>
