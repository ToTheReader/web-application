   <head>To the Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, health.</head>
   <p>GEntle Reader, not manie yeeres since, a booke was published <hi>of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian exercise, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:</hi> written by a Iesuit beyonde the Seas, yet an English-man, named Ma. <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> which Booke, Ma. <hi>Edm. Bunney</hi> hauing dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently perused, committed to the publique viewe of all indifferent iudgements: as glad that so good matter proceeded from such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected people, and that good might arise thereby to the benefite of others. Since the manifestation of that booke, the first Author thereof, named Ma. <hi>Parsons,</hi> hath enlarged the same Booke, with a second part and new additions, wherein hee hath concluded and
<pb facs="4"/>
finished his whole intent of the Resolution, and that vppon some speciall causes, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe setteth downe. For hauing enlarged di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers poynts, which before he omitted, and comming to the reasons of this newe supply, in his Praeface he saith in this manner.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Beeing admonished by the writings of diuers, that since the publishing of my first booke, it hath beene misliked in two principall poynts. First, that I speake so much of good works, and so little of faith. Secondly, that I talked so largely of Gods iustice, and so breefely of his mercie. Beside, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing by the information of many, that diuers persons, hauing a desire in themselues to read the former Booke, but yet beeing weake and fearfull to be touched so neere in conscience, as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that booke did: durst neuer intermedle therewith, beeing informed there was nothing in the same wherewith to entertaine themselues, but onely such vehement matter of perswasion, as would greatly trouble and afflict them. For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie of which inconueniencie, I haue framed this second part of that worke, and therein inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted diuers Chapters and discourses of matters more plausible, and of themselues more indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: wherewith the Reader may sollace hys minde, at such times as he findeth the same not willing, to feele the spurre of more earnest motion to perfection.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Heereupon grewe the cause of his fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming this seconde Booke, which performeth
<pb facs="4"/>
what you haue reade in his owne wryting. And considering howe diuers were desirous to haue thys latter part, because they had thorowlie read the other: after passage the perusing of sundrie learned men, who haue thought it as worthy to be seene as the first, it is (gentle Reader) presented to thy viewe, reade it indifferentlie, and iudge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as thou findest occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
