   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>L this whole world and all
the learning and wisdome
thereof <hi>lies in wickednes
or darknes,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 19</note> and cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
discerne or judge and
find out whether any gesture
be indifferent,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 8.</note> or if they
were, which is the fittest gesture: for <hi>he that
walketh in darknes knoweth not whither
he goeth,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 35.</note> whither he conforme to a right ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
or to a wrong it is all oneto him. Harken
not then to the arguments or reasons of <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
or of flesh &amp; bloud (though all the chosen
chariots of Egipt go before thē) but let vs goe
to the light, not in the doctrine onely, but in
the Ceremonie also, not in the substance one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but in the gesture also, for no error may be
conformed vnto in either: and whatsoeuer is
<pb facs="4"/>
not warranted by the light, must needs bee
darknes; yea if it come not from the truth, of
necessity it is erroneous and dangerous, and
therefore not to bee conformed vnto. If then
<hi>Christ bee the light of the world,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 12.</note> and his
<hi>word</hi> be the onely <hi>truth</hi> in the world,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 17.</note> then
whosoever followes not Christ in the gesture,
according to the testimony of the word,
walkes in darknesse and conformes to errour
therein. Howsoever therefore I doe with all
thankefulnesse to God, and due respect of you,
confesse and acknowledge that I doe highly
reverence you with <hi>Peter:</hi> yet <hi>I</hi> doe avow in
the sight of God, and of all his Churches, that
all those are <hi>worthy to be blamed,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 11.</note> who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
iustifie or approue conformity to knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in that manner and order as it is urged,
(and by the meaner or poorer sort refused) or
especially that presse it with such violence, as
if they would take it by force: yea herein <hi>I</hi>
am bold through Christ, to <hi>resist you,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>I</hi> know, <hi>Whosoever</hi> (be his gifts ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so excellent and admirable) <hi>doth any
thing</hi> (in substance or in ceremony <hi>presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tnously</hi>
against the apparant practise of the
Apostolicall primitiue Churches,<note place="margin">Numb. 15. 30</note> grounded
in the evidence of the spirit, upon the plaine
testimony of the inspired Scriptures, being
approved by Christ himselfe in the very insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
and haue no warrant from the word of
God for their so doing, do directly <hi>blaspheme
the Lord;</hi> which place, that <hi>I</hi> be not censured
to abuse, or any other at any time upon this
<pb facs="4"/>
occasion mentioned by me, this once for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
<hi>I</hi> doe in all humility desire the godly
to consider and remember, that howsoever eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
place of Scripture hath a particular intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or speciall respect, yet in the large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
thereof (as it hath relation unto all ages,
Churches, and persons) there is also, and that
warrantably a more generall drift and purpose
directly intended: though therefore <hi>I</hi> presse
them not in that speciall or particular intent,
yet if according to the true Analogie of
faith, <hi>I</hi> use and urge them in the larger sence,
and respectiue meaning of the Holy Ghost, <hi>I</hi>
hope <hi>I</hi> may sasely, yea in the assurance of faith
iustifie, that <hi>I</hi> erre not from the direct pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of the spirit of truth. As for example,
the Holy Ghost saith, that <hi>not to heare the
the voyce of Christ</hi> even in <hi>all things,</hi>
      <note place="margin">heb. 3 13. 15 with Act. 3. 22.</note> will
harden <hi>the heart.</hi> Whence <hi>I</hi> conclude from
the large extent and generall scope of these
places. That not to heare and regard the word
of God (which is the voyce of Christ) which
plainly declares that Christ hath approued a
table-gesture, and no other, and yet to declare
and teach the people that any gesture ordained
by the Church, and in particular this in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
is lawfull and ought onely to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to, or in cases of extremity may bee
vndergone as a burden, though Christ haue
given no warrant for it, <hi>I</hi> say such positions
and courses taken and maintained, will <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
the wisest, most learned, best disposed,
and most zealous heart or hearts of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerest
<pb facs="5"/>
teachers and professors in the best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches in the world. Againe, it is
said, <hi>When Christ commeth hee will tell
us all things,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 25.</note> the particular intent of this
place concernes the publicke worship of God;
from the larger and generall scope whereof, <hi>I</hi>
hold it a most warrantable conclusion, that
<hi>Christ</hi> in his word hath certainly made
knowne what gesture we may conforme to in
the act of receiving the Lords Supper (being
essentially necessary in this part of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship)
but in the whole Scrip. Christ hath not
given approbation to any but a Table-gesture:
therefore no other may bee conformed unto.
For these things were not written for them
of those times onely,<note place="margin">Ro. 4. 23. ver. 24.</note> but for <hi>us also:</hi> yea for
all the churches to the end of the world.</p>
   <p>Another thing I also desire not to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in, namely that though I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
and therfore confidently affirme, that
Conformitie to any gesture of religious vse in
the worship of God, being not warranted by
the word, is absolutly vnlawfull and sinfull,
yet do I not thereby Iudge, or hold all Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants,
to be vile and wicked persons:<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> or that
such Congregations are not the true Churches
of Christ, for I know, it is <hi>God which works
both the will and the deede, euen of his
good pleasure,</hi> as he sees best, not alike at all
times, nor to all persons, but some shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
ignorant of some truths (yet not to be
therfore seperated from.<note place="margin">ps. 119. 113.</note> Others <hi>hate all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions</hi>
(yet not therfore to be runne after
<pb facs="5"/>
as if they were the onely true churches, and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatiō
no where els to be found) some <hi>I</hi> say ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly
conforme to error, others according
vnto knowledge abhorre and <hi>hate all false
waies,</hi>
      <note place="margin">ps. 119. 104. 120.</note> and yet both of these the true Churches
and faithfull servants of God. Onely my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
before the Lord is to strip hypocrits of that
conceite which they haue of their wisdom,
learning, authoritie, and great estimation
which they haue purchased or obtained in the
world, for nature, or the naturall man, putting
on the shew of grace, or the name and title of
the <hi>spirituall man</hi> (as the Asse in the lyons
skinne) is presently conceated, that forthwith
they are Canonically holy, spirituall, or diuine,
because such traditionall titles, are successiuoly
compounded for thē (though none in the world
be more lycentious and profane then euen some
of thē) yea and that in these outward forms of
Godlines divised by man for Gods diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and service, the verie substance of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so farre as it is outward and subiect to
sence, doth in a speciall or principall parte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist:
for they hold, that no man neede or ought
to make question, but that these humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
being performed (not in superstition
but in a good Intention,) are most acceptable
&amp; well pleasing unto God, and therefore ought
of verie conscience to be conformed unto. In
which respect I do stryue gladly to dryue them
from this deceitfull and conceited kinde of
pleading, by a Iudicial proceeding to the triall
of their faith, for so shall wee quickely discern
<pb facs="6"/>
what they are, <hi>Infidels</hi> or <hi>Vnbeleevers;</hi> for
profession of the truth (though never so fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall)
no nor practise of it also, makes
not a true beleever, though a true professor,
for even that man of sin himselfe, and many
other of like ambitious humour, know and
acknowledge, professe and practise many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
truths;<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 2. with 3. 19.</note> but <hi>faith</hi> onely puts the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and proues who is for the Lord, and who
bolds on the other side against him. What
action or ceremony then soever of Religious
use is not conformed unto in faith, is confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to in infidelity, unlesse we must admit of
<hi>Agrippa</hi> his <hi>almost a Christian,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 26. 28.</note> halfe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
halfe infidell, halfe Papist halfe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
halfe of God and halfe of the Divell,
halfe Turke and halfe Christian: not that
<hi>I</hi> aime at any other perfection but that which
is Evangelicall, even sincerity and truth in all
things;<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 32</note> but to declare that <hi>all are shut up
under unbeliefe,</hi> though they be never so
wise and learned, great and many, till they bee
enlightned. But these men say and sweare,
they haue faith, yea a iustifying, living, and
saving faith, as well as the best of them all, and
in their conformity do liue and walke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
This is soone said, but not so soone pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Let us therefore come to the tryall:
Faith consists not in good opinion, or well
meaning, or preventing inconueniences. For
though I intend in kneeling before an image,
onely to stirre up my heart to devotion, that <hi>I</hi>
may with greater feeling and fervency call
<pb facs="6"/>
vpon God in the confession of my sins, and
craving pardon for the same; yet this is not
done in faith, no though <hi>I</hi> finde that in my
conceit such effect therein, even as <hi>I</hi> did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and desire; for nothing that is in nature,
as wisedom, reason, sence, discretion, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
experience, or whatsoeuer can bee by
any possible meanes, in any respect the true
object of saving faith (for the learned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
of all nations haue these, and yet all in
the true churches (though true professors)
haue not faith) but onely the <hi>word of God</hi>
is the obiect of faith, yea true and saving
faith in all things of holy and religious use
in the divine service of God, rejects not onely
what is forbidden therein, but conformes to no
thing but what in the evidence of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is plainly grounded on the Scriptures: for
without the warrant and commandement of
the word, subscription to or approbation of
any thing of divine use cannot bee an act of
the faith of Gods elect, but of some other
counterfet faith, transformed <hi>I</hi> confesse into
the likenesse or appearance thereof, which (like
<hi>Will with wispe,</hi> ar <hi>Megg with Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,</hi>
or some other <hi>hob-goblin</hi> with a false
light) having dazled their sight, or darkened
their iudgement, will by degrees lead them into
the boggs and quagmires of <hi>Armenius</hi> his
inherent grace, free-will, or other like deceiuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fables, and damnable errors. So that this
is not an argument of true faith, if <hi>I</hi> doe not
conforme, the people will bee untaught, or the
<pb facs="7"/>
church overtbrowne, and the like, or it is not
forbidden in the scripture, therefore though it
be of religious use in the worship of God, and
be onely devised by man, yet thou mayest, yea
being commanded, oughtest to conforme
unto it: but directly it is a plaine doctrine of
infidelity. For whereon I pray you is faith
grounded in such a case, but onely upon meere
and wilde vncertainty (a sea whereof this
sluce will open.) As therefore it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of <hi>fooles</hi> to doubt of any thing which
the Scriptures teach;<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 25</note> so it must needes be a
speciall branch of infidelity, in matters of
conformity to things of religious use in Gods
publicke worship, to ground our faith therein
(for hope they will not say but they doe it in
faith) on any thing but the sacred Scriptures.</p>
   <p>Now the Word telleth vs plainely that a
table gesture was sanctified by our Lord in the
institution, are they not fooles then (by Christs
owne doome) who will not beleeue that it is a
good &amp; boly gesture, &amp; that our faith in cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
thereto is plainly grounded on the
scriptures? and seing no other gesture is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by the Scripture, is not the doctrine of
conformitie to any other whatsoeuer our faith
therein being grounded on vncertainty a direct
doctrine of Infidelity? may not the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sts
justly crie out, <hi>Lord who hath beleeued
our Report?</hi>
      <note place="margin">Esa. 53. 1.</note> why so <hi>I</hi> pray you will some say,
what do they reporte? euen this, that in the
first institution by Christ him self the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
gesture in the act of taking or rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="7"/>
the holy bread and wine, was onely a
table gesture and no other will the professing
and beleeving many other truthes, though thou
willfuly (against the plane ouidence of the
truth) refuse to beleeue this, euer prooue the to
be a sound Christian; hath Christ honoured a
table gesture, and do men onely honor another
gesture? will you say then conformity to them
is an action of faith and yet refuse thereby that
gesture which Christ by his presence &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
honored? is not this <hi>to loue the
praise of men</hi> (or that which men praise)
<hi>more then the praise of God?</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 43.</note> (or that
which his word commends) true it is <hi>I</hi> knowe,
that men do preferre those that conforme vnto
them, and will not Christ doe so also? Yea, is
it not a marke of infidelity to <hi>receiue</hi> such
<hi>honour one of another,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 44.</note>
      <hi>and seeke not the
honour that commeth from God alone?</hi>
Will you feare the displeasure of man if you
doe not conforme? and will you not feare the
displeasure of God if you do not conforme to
his gesture in the act of receiving? I say his
gesture, for so none can deny but it was in
the institution, <hi>I</hi> meane of his direct ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynting;
and did he ever cashiere it? or did
his Apostles or true churches ever dislike or
refuse it? Take heed therefore, for hee that
beleeues not every place of Scripture, beeing
made known unto him, will not be bound to
be subject to any scripture further then hee
lusts or likes:<note place="margin">vers. 47.</note> They that will not <hi>beleeue
Moses or his writings,</hi> will not beleeue the
<pb facs="8"/>
doctrines or practise of <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe; reject
one place wittingly, and in effect thou renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
all.<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 50.</note> Let us then <hi>beleeue the word of
Iesus</hi> in this controversie; he tels us by the
Scripture, that a table-gesture is a holy ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
of divine institution; let us never there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conforme to any other without like
warrant.<note place="margin">Eccles. 3. 14.</note>
      <hi>For whatsoever hee hath done,
it shall be for ever</hi> (unlesse himselfe alter
it) to it <hi>can no man add</hi> (such deepnesse of
learning is the very height of dark ignorance)
<hi>from it can none diminish</hi> (to assume
such power is direct presumption. Hath
<hi>Christ</hi> sanctified a Table-gesture?<note place="margin">psal. 95.</note>
      <hi>Come let
us worship and fall downe, and kneele
before the Lord our Maker,</hi> euen giue this
honour of devising his owne worship and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
both in matter and manner, both in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
&amp; order to him onely &amp; to non other:
for his is the kingdome, in devising his own
service; and the power, in making it effectuall
to his church; and the glory, of praise and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
for making known and exhibiting his
eternall loue thereby, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
