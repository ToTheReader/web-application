   <head>To all Children of a Christian towardnesse: the feare <hi>of God, and eternall health in</hi> Iesu Christ.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S a certaine Noble and excellent King was neither asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nor greeued to ride sometimes on a rodde or staffe for the instruction of his young Sonne: So neither am I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed or greeued (good Christian children) both to collect and frame for your sakes, though with so slender a quill) and like stile, as best fitting your tender capacitie, certaine Christian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, hoping yee will both accept the same, and gratefully esteeme of my good meaning and louing affection
<pb facs="6"/>
therein expressed towards you. But I know well, it will seeme very strange vnto some, that I haue giuen this my collection the title of Contemplation: for that (after the opinion of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers) contemplation, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined either the Godly motion of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine minde: or the diligent and deepe consideration of heauenly things, doeth not properly appertaine vnto children. Therefore as they placed the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue life, in the cōtemplatiue good, and the contemplatiue felicity in the contemplation of God: so the younger sort (say they) haue not (as yet) attained to those three things which are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto necessary: that is, <hi>Vnderstāding,</hi> which is an Act of the highest power: <hi>Wisdom</hi> which is the most noble ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite: and <hi>God himselfe,</hi> which is the worthiest obiect. Whereof it was, that they reserued the last age of mans life for the contēplation of diuine things, and wold that al the former ages should
<pb facs="6"/>
be employed on some other Sciences, as from the which they might proceede and growe more able in the end to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the consideration of things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine. But those persons neither begin where Christ commaundeth you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, where he sayeth <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: <hi>Seeke ye first the kingdome of God</hi>: nor do they teach, as he teacheth when he saith, that <hi>the kingdome of God apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to children.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And that indeede was no little cause that too many (the more pitty) applying themselues to these terrene and worldly things (which <hi>Solomon</hi> worthelie comprehendeth within Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities kingdome) haue most vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye spent out the flower of their youth, and could neuer tast the sweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this thing so necessary and profitable for man in their life, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed cutte off, and vnhappily
<pb facs="7"/>
preuented by an vntimely death: for as it is a common thing for men once to dye: so neither dooth cruell death spare children, of the which too many in those their vaine studies and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish delightes, expect and looke for at the length, but all too late the most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie time of searching for and enioying those heauenly and profitable exercises. Therefore, as it is good for you (deere children) to withstand such beginnings of mischiefes, least the medicine for the desired cure be prepared and applyed too latelie: so ought yee to know, that it is not meete yee should consume the vertues of your minde in the onelye knowledge of those earthly things: but rather to keepe the same preserued for the vse of things heauenlie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, the which are euer more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and necessarie in your life; to the which yee are taught and inuited euen by the Lyons and Eagles, which when
<pb facs="7"/>
when they goe, doe turne their tallents inwarde, to the end they may not weare out, but be preserued sharpe and fit for the praye. And so should yee likewise fill your greene vessels with that wholsome Water whereof yee should most long-somly reteine and keepe the sent and sauor, to the glorie of God, the benefit of his Church, and your owne health. Neither ought yee so much as imagine that the holy Contemplation of diuine things nothing belongeth to young children. Moreouer consider what is taught you in the sacred Scriptures: <hi>Solomon</hi> the wifest of all the Kings thus counsaileth you: <hi>Remember thy maker in the dayes of thy youth.</hi> And omitting other places, Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus saith: <hi>Suffer little Children to come vnto me, and forbid them not. Habel</hi> beeing thus schooled by his Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Heuah,</hi> being yet but young, offered vp vnto God a
<pb facs="8"/>
right acceptable Sacrifice. So <hi>Enoch</hi> in his childhood walked with God, and pleased him: so <hi>Isaack</hi> the son of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> the sonne of <hi>Isaack,</hi> were religious and godly affected euen in their yong and tender yeares. <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> being a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> was an abstei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from his birth sanctified vnto God; <hi>Samuell,</hi> as yet but a little boye, was by <hi>Hannah</hi> his mother brought forth and dedicated to the Lord. Thus also both <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>: thus <hi>Iosiah</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> and many others the children of God, whiles they were very young sauoured of the holy religiō. Lastly for a perfect example of your imitation, Christ Iesus being yet but twelue yeares of age exhibited and declared himselfe most learned in the diuine contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euen in the middest of the learned doctors in <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Therefore haue I the sooner, on these my briefe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
<pb facs="8"/>
imposed the title of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, the same being (indeede) god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemplations, with the which if yee shalbe first seasoned, yee shall (by the grace of God) prosper and proue more able to all vertues in the same Iesus, who beeing the true vnderstanding, wisdome, <hi>Immanuell,</hi> is to bee sought for, imitated and followed of all, aswell children, as elder persons, towardes the father Almighty in godly contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherefore (good Christian chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) vse you these contemplatiōs both godly and happily to your natural good, and to the eternall glory of the highest <hi>Iehouah.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And if it shall follow, that this my laboures shall be any thing profitable vnto you, by the which the sooner yee shall prosper (through the operation of the blessed Spirite) in the right Seruice of God and holye religion,
<pb facs="9"/>
I shall be during my life most glad and ioyfull thereof, and I will withall both freelie and thankefully acknowledge that I haue receiued that recompence and reward for those my labours which thereof I might haue expected. And thus fare yee well, and prosper in all Godlinesse in the Author of our saluation, and finisher of our faith.</p>
