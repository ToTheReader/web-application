      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen Readers,
thus though rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and vntimelie,
yet truly and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie,
yee haue
heard the tenour of
this newes, or at the least so much, as I
could well fish out, for it is a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
impossible, and may passe
for a paradox, to reach vnto euerie
particular accidēt. For the newes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not inacted in our own Countrey,
comming from farre, as also wee our
selues not present, or <hi>oculati testes,</hi> but
relying on letters, bare reportes, and
heresay, like <hi>testes auriti,</hi> wee must
needes misse of much of the matter, &amp;
sometimes happily, (or rather vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily)
either in too much, or too little
cōmit an absurditie; But (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
assure your selues, wee swarue
not wittingly one tittle from truth,
but haue inquired diligently thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
&amp; offred vnto your view nothing
<pb facs="10"/>
but that we haue seen in the letters of
credible persons, or been instructed
of at the hands of men of account, or
that commonly passeth for trueth at
the Exchange, or hath been preached
to the French congregation, or is tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vp &amp; down at the Ambassadours
house in the mouthes of the best;
which al in my opinion may serue for
a certificate autentique. But leauing
these ambages, and cleauing to your
curtesie, I beseech you in courtesie be
not too curious, but more willing to
lep ouer a block, than wilfull to stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at a strawe, considering the finest
Veluet hath his brack, and nothing is
fo currantly writtē, but admitts some
crabbed imperfection, &amp; may
captiously bee miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred.
