   <p>NOt longe agoo, after I had
translated into our englysshe
tonge the boke called <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
sanitatis Salerni,</hi> I hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
being at London to talke
with the prynter, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of hym, what be thought, and how he
lyked the same boke: and he answered, that
in his mynde, it was a boke moche necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
and very profitable for them that take
good hede to the holsome teachynges, and
warely folowed the same. And this moche
farther he added therto, that so fareforthe
as euer he coude here, it is of euery man ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well accepted and allowed. And I sayd,
I pray god it may do good, and that is all
that I desyre. And thus in talkynge of one
boke and of an other, he came forthe and
sayde: that if I wolde take so moche peyne
as to translate into Englysshe the boke that
is intitled <hi>De med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>rina guaiaci, et morbo
gallico,</hi> wryten by that great clerke of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
Vlrich <hi>Hutten</hi> knyght, I shuld, sayd
he, do a verye good dede. For seynge hit is

      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oth, as this great clerk writeth of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
Guaiacū (For he hym selfe hath had
the verye experience therof) how nedefull
and howe beneficiall to the common welthe
were it? For almoste into euerye parte of
this realme, this mooste foule and peyneful
disease is crepte, and manye soore infected
therwith. Whan he had sayde thus his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasye,
and that I hadde bethought me and
well aduysed his wordes, I answered: If
I thought it wolde do good, I wolde take
the peyne with all my verye harte, and hit
were moche greatter, and yet (sayde I) I
feare me, it be as moche or more than I am
able to accomplysshe. For I doubt whether
I may com to the clere vnderstandyng ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
or not: It is in ernest a matter straunge
inough to translate, not onely for the names
of herbes and other dyuers thynges therin
conteyned, but also for the phrase and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quente
style. But what so euer aunswere I
made hym, I finally determyned to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate
the sayde boke, as I haue done in dede,
not so well I am sure, so playnly and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitely
as many other coude, if they wold
vouchesafe to take the peyn: But yet I trust
I haue not moche erred from the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
of the auctour. And I saye not the
<pb facs="3"/>
contrarye, But somme wordes haue I lefte
barely englysshed, and somme not at al, but
they be suche, as are by those names in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
vsually knowen to phisitions, withoute
whose counsayl (specially those that be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
and knowen to be syngularly lerned
in physyke) I wold counsayll no man to be
to bolde either to practise or receyue any me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dycine.</p>
