   <head>To the right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, my worthy and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Patron, Sir <hi>Henry Wallop, Knight, high Sherieffe of Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiere,</hi> and to the vertuous Lady Elizabeth his wife.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>AS Christian modestie, (right Worshipfull) moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a Deuine (I make no question) the Authour hereof, not onely to conceale his Name, but also to cease from setting foorth any thing in the praise of that, which of right deserueth to be commended: So Christian iustice and equitie, which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs to giue to euery thing his due, would not suffer mee to let that passe without some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, where-vnto I am not able sufficiently to giue any.
<pb facs="3"/> But considering, that slightly to cōmend a thing, were the next way to dispraise it, except with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it were shrowded vnder the patronage of some worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: and thinking it vnmeete to let that goe like an Orphant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, which had a Father at home, I presumed to cōmit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Worships patronages, not a bare Lawrell, which of it selfe for the greenenesse (when other be withered) may seeme to be accepted, but the same decked &amp; adorned with most Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Meditations: So that as I think, if your Worships were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented with a materiall Lawrel, (wherin besides naturall green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, were but this necessarie
<pb facs="3"/> vse, that it could defend you in your Garden from the heate of the Sunne) you would accept, if not of the gift, yet the good-will of the giuer: So relying my selfe vpon your accustomed fauour &amp; clemencie, I hope you will afford some fauourable acceptation heereof: for heerein is not that greenenes, which consisting of naturall qualities, must then wither whē all things haue their ending, according to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the flourishing greene promises of the couenaunt of God, which (as GOD himselfe) last alwaies immutable, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. Heere are not the beautifull leaues of a materiall tree, which delight onely the
<pb facs="4"/> outward sight, but a most fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar view of GOD himselfe in Christ, euen to the delight of the soule, and the inward comfort of the spirit, which take pleasure onely in heauenly thinges. To conclude, heere you are not shrowded from the heate of the Sunne, but shall finde most coole shade from the parching heate of sinne: from which, as in dutie I am bound, I will pray that God in this life shielde &amp; defend you both, and in the life to come, graunt you euerlasting rest.</hi>
