      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not for nothing (right curteous and christian rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders) that we haue bene by our Sauiour Christ so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares sithens before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand warned of the state and condition of this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and doting world set on fire vpon mischiefe &amp; iniquitie, that the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer it groweth and hasteneth vnto his end, the worse &amp; worse it shal daily wax, insomuch that the Lord when he shal come to iudgement,<note place="margin">Luk. <hi>18.8.</hi>
      </note> shall hardlie finde faith vpon the earth. For such are the miseries of our times, that notwithstanding the plentifull preaching of the Gospell in most places, sin still raigneth in aboundance, and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie getteth more and more the vpper-hand, insomuch that those enormities and outrages, the which are condemned by the law of Nature, the word of God, the practise of the godlie in all ages, the testimony of the Heathen, and generall consent of all commendable learning, are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of many not onely laughed and ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted as, but also sought to be countenanced, and
<pb facs="5"/>defended (aneuident token of the great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our age) of such as otherwise want not their due praise for ciusll conuersation and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour. Among these is not the last nor least, the too vsuall bad custome of childrens marrieng, without the consent and allowance of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes a sinne that nature it selfe abborreth, and all writers of the better note, in all ages vtterlie disalowed, and yet of the greater number holden and taken for no fault at all, whose error in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, arising for the most part of ignorance, I haue fasthfully laboured by all sufficsent kind of proofes in this writing to disprooue, the which not vnfitly, nor nigh my purpose and meaning at the leastwise) offensiuely, I haue tearmed a <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholmew fairing,</hi> respecting the time, and the great resort that yearly come vp to the fair, who, now if they list may haue a nouell of small prices but yet of much value, to bestow vpon themselues their children &amp; their friends, worthy I hope of their reading and much more of their practise, as their seueral places &amp; callings shall require. And I haue bene the more willing to enter into this course, and vndersaken this matter, that I might discharge some part of a promise vnto diuerse my godly friends of Kent and Sussex, which are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the right honourable and vertuous Earle of Huntington, vnto whom I also my selfe am bound in all dutifulnes in the Lord, who by their due right may iustly claim the same as my hand of whom they haue all so well deserued, and vnto whom I am sure this treatise will come welcome
