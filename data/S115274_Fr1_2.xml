   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo Bookes haue beene lately set foorth by the Priests in the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry defence of their good name and fame, which were &amp; are to this day so irreuerently plaid vpō, as people of all professions, fooles and physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions make vp their morning and euening meditations with the most vnciuill termes, which they may deuise against them. How sottish would that Cobler haue beene accounted in these daies, who, being controlde by a Painter for presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to giue his iudgement of a Picture aboue the shooe, departed quietly, and would not once replie vpon <hi>Ne sutor vltra crepidam? Tractant Fabrilia Fabri</hi> was the olde saying, euerie man was to attend that which belonged to his Trade, but the age is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in which S. <hi>Hierome</hi> liued, and of which he vsed this saying, <hi>Scribimus indocti docti{que} poemata pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sim.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Dist. <hi>19.</hi> can. nulli fas.</note> The Iesuites might haue plaid with their Canon vpon such as resisted the Apostolicall Decrees, and without blame haue made a breach, yea and vtterly haue ruinated those whom in such cause they should assault; but to disturbe and infect the aire which hath giuen them life with this breath; Hearken ô ye facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ye are Rebels, ye are Schismatikes, ye are excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated persons, Irregular, no better then Sooth-sayers
<pb n="2" facs="3"/> and Idolators, and as Ethnickes and Publicans was neither commendable in such as make shewe to immitate Iesus, nor euer will be iustifiable against those Priests, who at the sight of the Breue gaue an inuincible argument of their obedience to Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall decrees, and haue a long time aduentured their liues for the dignitie of the Sea Apostolike as farre as the Iesuites haue for anie matter whatsoeuer. Other who either immediately, or by others haue a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Iesuits, some for want of other inuētiō, some to keepe their tongues in vre, some to trie who can vtter the most despitefull speeches against those Priestes to whom perchaunce they haue beene most bounde, some to winne all to goe one way (which they may and do full euil) must follow their dam, and crow after kinde, least their spirituall guides and grand-fathers should abandō them as a misbegotten brood. And while they all euerie one at his Qu play their parts, as shrewd boyes, while they byte kick and scratch, crie that they cannot be let alone, they make a great shewe as though they would most gladly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a peace. F. <hi>Garnet</hi> the head of the Iesuites here in England solliciteth some to be a meane for peace, but with such condition, as no satisfaction be talked on for the clamorous speeches before rehearsed, and what hath vpon them ensued to manie, who haue with the best deserued of Gods Church and a fresh offer of some things most seriously promised at the first attonement, and not as yet performed. At the same time flie Letters like Bats, and are shewed in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret to such as haue no list but to lie still in a grosse
<pb n="3" facs="3"/> and affected ignorance, which manner of carriage what else could it portend other thē a defect of truth, largenesse of conscience, a fresh alarum to farther tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults? and if F. <hi>Garnet</hi> the Superiour of the Iesuites were of counsel thervnto, smal is his sinceritie (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer his charitie is) which hee pretendeth in his mock-offer of peace. The presumption that he was of counsell to these Letters of M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpō M. <hi>Blackwels</hi> instructions, where after a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of vnitie betweene the Priests and the Iesuites, the Archpriest is willed to seeke the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and counsell of the Superiour of the Iesuites in the greater matters, <hi>Curabit Archipresbiter in rebus maioribus iudicium quoque eius consiliumque acquirere;</hi> great follie it were to shut this Letter of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priests from his matters of great weight, being an answere to seditious Bookes (as hee termeth them) and such as may bring great hurt to the Church of God, and cōsequently an endangering of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest to say that he did not take the aduice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the Prouinciall of the Iesuites herein (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Bookes concerning them as much as him) F. <hi>Lister</hi> being alwayes readie with his Canon. <hi>Nulli fas est vel velle vel posse transgredi Apostolicae sedis praecepta, <hi>It is not lawfull for any to be willing or able to transgresse the precepts of the Sea Apostolicke.</hi>
      </hi> With the which he, his fellow Iesuites, and the Archpriest also are perswaded that the Priestes are shaken, yea &amp; brought to vtter ruine. These Letters of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest while we shal take the paines to answere for the instruction of such as either vpon their owne igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="4" facs="4"/> haue erred, or by the double diligence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue bene misled, and shewe how we are dealt withall by the one, while an offer of a mock-peace is tendered by the other, we craue no other then indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencie in the Christian Reader, and nothing doubt but to discouer the drift both of him who dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth not himselfe or his intentions, and also of the other who to colour his owne and his fellowes mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours in this matter (as if hee were no partie, much lesse the principall maintainer of this faction against vs) pretendeth to be a stickler betweene the Archpriest and vs.</p>
