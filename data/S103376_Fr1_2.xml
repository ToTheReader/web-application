   <l>REader, y' have here the Mirrour of the times,</l>
   <l>Old <hi>Iones</hi> rapt in his colours, and my rimes.</l>
   <l>Receive him fairly (pray;) nor censure how,</l>
   <l>Or what he tels: the matter hee'l avow.</l>
   <l>And for the forme he speaks in, I'l maintain it,</l>
   <l>It comes as neere his vaine as I could strain it.</l>
   <l>For 't were improper to set forth an Asse</l>
   <l>Capparisond, and pannell a great-horse.</l>
   <l>My part claimes no inventions praise: for (know it)</l>
   <l>Where ere there's fiction in 't, there he's the Poet.</l>
   <l>His last deeds here epitomiz'd, intreat</l>
   <l>Some thundring pen to set them forth compleat.</l>
   <l>Let him whose lofty Muse will deigne to do it,</l>
   <l>Drinke Sack and Gunpowder, and so fall to it.</l>
