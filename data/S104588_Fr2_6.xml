      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ho so shall duly consider the whole progresse of mans
estate from life to death, shall find it (gentle Reader) to
be nothing else but a very pilgrimage through this earth
to another world; for whether we obserue the common
course of all flesh, which from the mothers wombe to
the graue, is still trauelling with change of bodily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
from youth to age, from health to sicknesse,
&amp; so from one estate to another. Or if we behold the particular incounters
which each man findeth in himselfe, in the variable change of hopes and
crossing of his purposes: in both it shall by a generall experiēce of all mens
calamities be assuredly confirmed to be too true. But how much more may
we find in the direction of our s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ules to the proper hauen of their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(euen to heauen) a multitude of aduersaries lying in the way to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
out t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>auell to that Promised land; how many afflictions of the minde,
frailties of the flesh, bayts of the world, and snares of Satan, are bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs, to slacken (if not cleane to diuert) our due course thitherwardes,
in such sort as if God of his infinite mercie and prouidence did not often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
preuent and stop our willes and powers, and bridle the malice of
these aduersaries, we should all assuredly perish by the way. But now (such
is his fatherly care and loue to vs in Christ) that he hath left vs a direction
&amp; ready way of safetie in the midst of all assaults or afflictions how perillous
soeuer, euen praier; which being formed according to the rules prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
vnto vs by his Sonne, and with feruencie of faith offered vp vnto him,
are of power to penetrate the heauens, purchase our safetie, pay our debts,
and procure vs peace of heart in the midst of all earthly perils: yea (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our coldnesse herein, and feare of our owne guilt, deterring vs from
his presence) he doth not onely licence vs to this boldnesse, but allur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>th vs
by many sensible blessings felt in our owne consciences; and calleth vs by
a supernaturall courage, sometimes with confidence to come vnto him,
and euen to hope against hope in our most desperate necessities. He doth
direct our tongues oftentimes here in before our mindes, and our mindes
before our hearts; being himselfe readier to giue then we to aske, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
with more regard of our good, then we can craue or conceiue: for
all which he expecteth nothing else at our hands, but continually to flie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and to yeeld him due praise: to relie on him onely in the day of
triall, and to encourage others thereto; for in this sort alone he
<pb facs="72"/>
will be honoured of vs. This our earthly pilgrimage being then so daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to all flesh, &amp; so readie a way prescribed vnto vs for our safer passage
therein, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

(which costs so litle as our wils to haue it) &amp; more vncharitable that
would nor do his best to assist his cōpanion in his iourney, with both coūsell
&amp; cōfort of the same. For this cause (gentle Readers) I hauing (through gods
great goodnes) felt in the direction and protection of my vnstable youth, a
plentifull portion of the wonderfull care he hath ouer vs, &amp; of the vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
force of praier &amp; thanksgiuing in all extremities: the more to stirre vp
my selfe to a memorie thereof, haue thought good to set downe these ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
passions of my passed afflictions, as witnesses of the impedimēts most
stopping me in my Christian pilgrimage, and testimonies of the meanes of
my euasion hitherto, which may serue for presidents for my selfe in the like
future occasions: and not be altogither vnprofitable for others to imitate.
In which (as in a glasse) may be seene, the state of a renegerate soule, sicke
with sinne, sometimes (Ague-like) shiuering with cold despaire, straight
waies inflamed with feruencie of faith and hope. One while yeelding vnder
the burden of sinne to eternall death, and presently incouraged to runne
chearefully forward the appointed course of this his pilprimage; and like a
practised traueller, vsed to the change of company, dyet, heat, cold, paine,
pleasure, plentie, and want, not to amaze himselfe long with any change:
but by a consideration of pleasures passed, or rest expected, patiently
to passe ouer this world full of incombrances; from a sence and feeling
whereof in some measure, no true child of God is any long time (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
expempt. Now, although I doubt not but euen these reasons will carry
the iudgement of the godly Christian Reader to a fauourable interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my purpose herein, and to some delight in the tast thereof, to whom
no person or occasion, style or phrase, will seeme vnseasonable, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to the glorifying of God, and profit of the Church, or proceeding
from a zeale of that effect; yet the consideration that the greater number
to whose handes this Treatise may happen to come, are either not so well
affected, or so discreet and temperate as were to be wished, maketh me
thinke it needfull to say something in declaration of my purpose herein:
not in excuse of my exercising my selfe in such theames, which in deede
ought to be the common action in some measure of all men, as oft as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
affaires of this life wil permit them, neither in that I make common
with others this my exercise, which seemeth in secret only to be practised by
my selfe▪ for that I take it not to be alwaies a token of pride or vaine-glory,
to make knowne for a common good to others, that which may breed a
suspect of ambition in the Author among the prophane or cauelling mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
though how herein I am caried my selfe, I leaue to God the sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of hearts to iudge: only I would satisfie them first in the cause of my
writing them in verse, then of the confused placing of them without spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
titles. To the first I was induced, for that I find many oftentimes (spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
<pb facs="73"/>
such as had most neede to praie and meditate) to reade bookes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the affection of words then liking of matter, and perhaps more to
controll the compiling, then commend the contents, Such yet (so as they
read) shal giue me al that I craue, &amp; find I hope that good they loked not for,
if not in all, yet in some among many of these Sonnets. As for the apt nature
of Poetrie, to delight, to contriue significatiuely in fewe words much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to pearce and penetrate affections of men, with the aptnesse thereof,
for helpe of memorie, I will not saie much: but for my deducing these passiōs
and affections into Sonnets, it answereth best for the shortnesse, to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and common humor of men, who are either not long touched
with so good motions, or by their worldly affaires not permitted to continue
much reading. To the cause of my so preposterous placing of them, and
deuision onely into three sorts, I confesse indeed I am perswaded their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
doth best fit the nature of mankind, who commonly is delighted with
contraries, and excercised with extreames; and also as they were by God
ministred vnto my mind to set downe by sundrie Accidents: so I suppose
my prouidence could not (by a formall placing of them) so soone hit the
affection of euery reader, as Gods direction (by that which mē call chance)
might often do. As they are therefore, I recommend them to thy courtesie
in reading, and thee to Gods holy spirit in the perusing of them. If they
may haue the same working in thee, that I praise God some of them had in
me, they shall not be vtterly vnprofitable. If in matter they iumpe not to thy
passions in all pointes, thinke that in the great Arsenall of Satans Armor
he hath choise of weapons for sundrie assaults, and disposeth of them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly,
according to the strength or weaknesse of the partie he besiegeth:
which (being as different in particular persons as Gods gifts are to them)
thou shalt doe well (to thy abilitie) to reforme or supply my defect therin
If in manner of the verse or stile, they be (as I doubt not but they are) to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
much, I do not greatly seeke the praise of a curious Architector,
neither (without neglect of more necessary duties) could I attaine to the
required obseruances that way. And therefore craue that thy discretion
may excuse my intention and abilitie And thus I hartily recommend thee
to the Almightie.</p>
