   <head>The Argument of the Epistle to <hi>the Romanes.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N setting forth the vtilitie of this Epistle, I knowe not whether I were best to tarry long, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I feare leaste through my commendatiōs, which most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely are farre inferiour to the dignitie thereof, it be nothing els but obscured: and also because euen in the entrance thereof, it doth more cleerely declare it self, and more liuely shew foorth it self, then by any words can be described. Therefore I thinke it nowe best to come vnto the Argument, wherein without all doubt it shall presently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that besides many others, and the same very excellent vertues, this doth properly apperteine vnto it, which cā neuer according to the dignitie thereof be sufficiently praysed: that if a man haue attained vnto the true vnderstanding of it, hee hath a speedie passage made him, vnto all the most secrete trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the scripture.</p>
   <p>The whole Epistleis so methodicall, that the very entrance of it, is framed according to art. The workmanship whereof as it is to be seene in many things, which shalbe obserued in their places, so specially in that, that the principall argument is dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen hence. For he hauing begun with the confirmation of his Apostleship, descendeth thence to the cōmendation of the gospel: which because it doth necessarily bring with it the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of faith, he passeth thereunto, the wordes of the text (as a man would say) euen leading him by the hande. And so hee entreth into the principall question of the whole Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Sciliz.</hi> that wee are iustified by faith. Wherin he is occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied vnto the end of the 5. Chapter. Let vs therefore put
<pb facs="10"/>
downe the generall proposition of these Chapters, to say, The mercie of God in Christ is the onely righteousnesse vnto men, whiles it beeing offered by the Gospel, is apprehended by faith. But because men are so secure in their sinnes, and flatter, &amp; deceiue themselues with a false imagination of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, that they thinke they stande in no neede of the righteousnesse of faith, except nowe they be cast downe from all trust in themselues: againe, they are so delghted with the sweetnesse of carnall lustes, and sounde a sleepe in great secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, that they are not easily raysed vp to seeke after righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, vnlesse they be smitten with the terrour of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore hee doth not onely conuince them of their iniquitie, but also being cōuicted doth rouse them from their drowsinesse.</p>
   <p>First of all, hee condemneth all mankinde since the worlde began of ingratitude: that in so excellent a workemanship, they did not acknowledge the workemaster: yea when they were constrained to acknowledge him, they did not worthily honour his maiestie, but prophaned &amp; violated the same with their vanitie. So all men are proued giltie of impietie, then the which there is no more detestable wickednesse. And to the ende it might more plainely appeare, that all men are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from the Lorde, hee rehearseth the fylthie and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable woorkes, whereunto euery where men are subiecte. Which is a manifest argument, that they haue degenerate frō God: for as much as they are tokens of Gods wrath, which appeare not but in the godlesse. And because certaine of the Iewes, and also of the Gentiles hauing couered theyr in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wickednesse with the cloake of outward holinesse, did seeme vnreproueable of these impious workes: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were thought to bee exempted from the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: the Apostle directeth his stile against that fained holinesse. And because that visarde before men, coulde not bee drawen from those pettie saints: he reuoketh them vnto the iudgement of God, whose eyes beholde the verie hidden thoughts.</p>
   <p>Afterward hauing made a distribution, he citeth the Iewes
<pb facs="10"/>
by themselues, and the Gentiles also by themselues before the tribunall seate of God. Hee taketh from the Gentiles that excuse of ignorance, which they pretended. For their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science whereby they were sufficiently conuicted, was vnto them in steede of a lawe. Hee vrgeth the Iewes with that chiefly, which they tooke for their defence: namely, with the written law, wherof in as much they were proued to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours, they could not cleare themselues of iniquitie: seeing the mouth of God had alreadie pronounced sentence against them. Hee preuenteth also that obiection which might seeme to make for them, <hi>videliz.</hi> that the couenant of God, which was vnto thē the marke of sanctification, was violated, vnlesse there were difference put betweene them and others. Here, first he teacheth that the title of the couenant, made them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better then others, seeing through their vnfaithfulnesse they were fallen from it. Secondly, least the constancie of gods promise should be in any part diminished, he graunteth vnto them some prerogatiue by the couenant: but such as consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in the mercy of God, and not in their merite. Then final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the authoritie of the scripture, he proueth al both Iewes and Gentiles to bee sinners: where also he speaketh somwhat of the vse of the law.</p>
   <p>Thus when he hath depriued all mankind both of the trust of their own vertue, and also of the glory of righteousnes, and throwen them downe with the seueritie of gods iudgement, he commeth vnto that which he purposed: namely, that wee are iustified by faith: shewing what faith that is, and howe wee obteine thereby the righteousnesse of Christe. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto hee addeth in the ende of the third Chapter, a singuler sentence to beate downe the fiercenes of mans pride, least he should aduaunce himself against the grace of God. And also least the Iewes should hemme in the grace of God within the compasse of their nation, he proueth by the way that it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the Gentiles also.</p>
   <p>In the 4. chap. he argueth frō an example, which, because it was cleere and therefore free from cauillations, he putteth it downe: to wit, in Abraham, who, in as muche as hee is the father of the faithfull, ought too bee in steede
<pb facs="11"/>
of a rule &amp; generall example. Hauing therfore proued him to be iustified by faith, he teacheth that the same way is to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of vs,</p>
   <p>And heereupon hee inferreth, by the comparing of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to followe, that the righteousnesse of workes must vanish where place is giuen to the iustification of faith. Which thing he proueth by the testimonie of Dauid, who reposing all the blessednes of man in the mercy of God, doth take this from works, that they should make a man blessed.</p>
   <p>After this hee handeleth that more at large, whiche hee had briefly touched before: namely, that there is no cause why the Iewes shold aduance themselues aboue the gentiles, who are partakers of the same felicitie with them, seeyng the Scripture declareth righteousnesse to haue happened vnto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham when hee was vncircumcised. In which place hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth occasion to intreate of the vse of circumcision. After this he addeth that the promised saluation doth depend vpon the onely goodnes of God: for if it depended vpon the law, then could it neither bring peace vnto our consciences, wherein it ought to be firmely rooted, neyther were it like euer to come vnto his perfection. Wherefore, that it may be firme and sure, in imbracing of it, we are to consider the onely truth of God, and not our selues: and that after the example of Abraham, who not considering himselfe, did wholly set before him the power of God. In the ende of the Chapter, to the intent hee might more aptlye applye the alleadged example vnto the generall cause, hee conferreth those thinges which on both sides are like.</p>
   <p>In the fift Chapter, after he hath touched the fruite &amp; ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the righteousnes of faith, he is almost wholly occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in amplifications, whiche serue to make the matter more cleere. For by an argument taken from the greater, he sheweth how great things, we now being redeemed, &amp; reconciled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, are to expect &amp; looke for at his hands through his loue: which was so bountiful towards vs being sinners, vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vndone. &amp; cast away, that he gaue vnto vs his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, &amp; only beloued sonne. After this he compareth sinne with
<pb facs="11"/>
righteousnes which commeth by free grace, Christ with Adā, death with life, the law with grace. Wherby he declareth that the infinite goodnes of God doth ouermatch our sins, how great so euer they are.</p>
   <p>In the sixte Chapter, hee commeth vnto sanctification which we haue in Christ. For our fleshe is prone, assoone as it hath tasted a little of this grace, to cocker wantonly his sins, &amp; concupiscences, as though it had now dispatched al. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paule on the contrary declareth here, that we cannot bee partakers of righteousnes in Christ, vnlesse also wee lay holde on sanctification. Hee fetcheth his argument from Baptisme, wherby we are admitted in the felowship of Christ: therin we are buried together with Christ, that being dead in our selues, by his life wee might be raised vnto newnes of life. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it ensueth, that no man without regeneratiō, can put on his righteousnes. From hence he draweth exhortations vnto puritie, and holines of life, which necessarily ought to appeare in those who are translated from the power of sinne, into the kingdome of righteousnes, hauing cast away the wicked coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering of the flesh, which seeketh a more licentious libertie of sinning in Christ. Finally, he doth briefly make mention of the abrogation of the law, in abrogating wherof the new testamēt is made manifest, where, besides the forgetting of sin, the holy spirite is promised.</p>
   <p>In the 7. Chapter, he entreth into a most necessary disputatiō of the vse of the lawe, whiche hee had lightly by the waye touched before: giuing a reason why wee are loosed from the law, because that by it self, it had no power, but vnto condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And least this should turne to the reproch of the law, he doth mightily cleare the lawe from all reproches. For he sheweth that through our fault it came to passe, that the lawe which was giuen for life, was made the matter of death. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring also howe sinne is encreased by it. From hence hee passeth to the description of the fight between the spirite and the flesh, which fight the children of God feele in themselues, so long as they are shut within the prison of this mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: for they beare the reliques of concupiscence, wherby they are continually drawen partly from the obedience of the law.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="12"/>The eight chapter is full of consolations, least the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the faythfull being feared with that disobedience which he reprooued before, or rather imperfect obedience, should be ouerthrowne. But least that the wicked should take occasiō herby to flatter thēselues, first he sheweth that this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit doth not appertein vnto any but vnto the regenerate, in whō the spirit of God liueth &amp; is of force. Therefore he vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth two things: the first, that all those which are graffed into the Lord Christ by his spirit, are freed frō the danger, &amp; feare of condemnation, howsoeuer they are yet laden with sinnes. Secondly that they which yet remain in the flesh, without the spirit of sanctification, are not partakers of this so great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: thē afterward he declareth howe great the certainetie of our trust is, seeing <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      </hi> spirit of God by his testimony doth driue away all douting and wauering. Moreouer by an anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or preuenting he sheweth that the assurance of eternall life cānot be interrupted or disturbed through the presēt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, whereunto, for the time of this mortall life, we are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: but rather by such exercises, our saluation is furthered, vnto the excellencie whereof, if all the present miseries bee compared, they are nothing. This thing he confirmeth by the example of Christ: Who as he is the first begotten, obteining the principalitie in the house of God, so he is the first paterne, whereunto we ought all of vs to be conformed. And therfore as vnto a thing most safe and sure, hee addeth a notable tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe, wherein he triumpheth couragiously against the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and engines of Satan.</p>
   <p>And for as much as many were greatly mooued, when they sawe the Iewes which were the principall keepers, and heires of the couenat, to dispise Christ: for thereby they gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that eyther the couenant was translated from the posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Abraham, whiche contemned the keeping of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or els this was not the promised Sauiour, whiche proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not better for the people of the Iewes: he beginneth to meet with this obiection in the entrāce into the nienth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Hauing therefore first of all testified his goodwill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his countreymen the Iewes, that they might not think hee spake any thing of malice, and also hauing mentioned
<pb facs="12"/>
those ornaments whereby they excelled others, he descendeth easily to the taking away of that offence, which did arise of their cecitie or blindnes. And deuideth the sonnes of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham into two sortes: that he might declare how that all those which are borne of him according to the fleshe, are not to bee reckoned in his seed, to participate the grace of the couenant. And on the contrary those which are not borne of his seed, to be counted for sonnes, if they be ingraffed by faith: Wherof he proposeth an example in Iacob and Esau. Therefore he calleth vs here, vnto the election of God, vpon the which, this whole matter must necessarily consist and depend. Againe, seeing this election leaneth only vpon the mercie of God, in vayne is the cause thereof sought for in the worthines of men. Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is contrary, which notwithstanding it is most iust, yet is there no cause aboue the will of God. About the end of the chapter hee declareth by the testimonies of the Prophetes, both the calling of the Gentiles, and also the reprobation of the Iewes.</p>
   <p>In the tenth chapter, hauing begunne agayne with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of his good will towards the Iewes, he sheweth that the vaine trust of workes was the cause of their ruine. And least they shoulde pretende excuse by the lawe, hee preuenteth that, declaring, howe by the lawe wee are also led as it were by the hande, vnto the righteousnesse of faith. Adding that this righteousnesse, through the bountifulnesse of God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently offered vnto all nations: but yet to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of those onely, whom God hath lightened with his speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace. And whereas moe Gentiles then Iewes are partakers of that blessing, he sheweth that that also was forespoken of, by Moses and Esai: The one whereof prophesied playnely of the calling of the Gentiles, and the other of the hardening of the Iewes.</p>
   <p>Here yet remayned a questiō, whither the couenant of god, put not some difference between the seede of Abraham, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations. Whiles he goeth about to satisfie this question, first he admonisheth, that the worke of God is not to be boūd vnto the sight of the eye; seeing many times the elect passe our vnderstanding.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="13"/>Euen as in olde tyme Elias was deceiued, who thought that religion was vtterly perished among the Israelites, when as yet there were seuen thousande aliue. Secondly, that we are not to be troubled with the multitude of vnbeleeuers whiche wee see abhorre the Gospel. At the length hee affirmeth that the couenant of God abideth, yea euen in the posteritie of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham according to the fleshe, but yet in those, whom God according to his free election hath predestinated. Then he conuerteth his talk vnto the Gentiles, least they growing too proude through their adoption, shoulde lift vp themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Iewes as reprobates, when in the meane time they excell thē in nothing, but in the fauourable acceptation of the Lorde: which ought rather to bee vnto them a cause of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. And the same also, is not vtterly departed from the seede of Abraham, for the Iewes at the length, by the fayth of the Gentiles, shall bee prouoked vnto emulation: that so GOD may gather vnto him all his Israel.</p>
   <p>The three Chapters following conteyne preceptes or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions touching manners: but they are diuersly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished. The twelfth Chapter conteyneth generall preceptes concerning a christian life. The thirteenth chapter for the most part is spent in establishing the authoritie of Magistrats. Whereby wee may make a most certayn collection, that there were then some vnquiet persons, which thought christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie coulde not stande, vnlesse the ciuill power were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. But least Paul shoulde seeme to impose any thing vpon the Church besides the dueties of charitie: hee sheweth that this obedience is also conteyned vnder charitie. After this hee addeth those preceptes for the instruction of our life, whiche hee had not mentioned before.</p>
   <p>In the nexte chapter hee taketh on him an exhortation, which was very necessarie for the present tyme. For there were some, who, through obstinate superstition, beeing addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the obseruations of Moses, could not without great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence suffer the neglect of them. Agayne, there were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, who being confirmed, touching the abrogation or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of them, whiles they went about to remooue su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
<pb facs="13"/>
purposely shewed foorth a contempte of them.</p>
   <p>Both parties offended throughe vntemperatures. For the superstitious condemned the others, as contemners of the Lawe of GOD: and they agayne without discretion despised the simplicitie of the others.</p>
   <p>Therefore the Apostle putteth downe for them both a conuenient moderation: calling those were stronge from pride and disdayne, and those were superstitious of infyrmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and weaknesse, from their too muche frowardnesse.</p>
   <p>Moreouer hee prescribeth a notable fourme of Christian libertie, that it might consiste, within the boundes of Charitie, and edifycation: hee giueth those are weake wholesome counsayle, whiles hee forbiddeth them to attempt any thing agaynst their conscience.</p>
   <p>The fifteenth Chapter beginneth with a repetition of the geenerall sentence, as the winding vp of the whole disputation, that those are stronge myght bestowe their strength to confyrme the weake.</p>
   <p>And because there was a perpetuall strife betweene the Iewes, and the Gentiles, about the ceremonies of Moses, the materiall cause of pride beeing taken out of the way, hee endeth all the quarrell betweene them. For hee teacheth them, that the saluation of them both doth depende vpon the onelie mercie of GOD: whereunto they leaning, ought to lay downe all pride: and wherin they being cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together in the hope of one inheritance, ought euerye way to imbrace one another.</p>
   <p>Lastly, he coueting to make a digression vnto the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Apostleship, which brought great authoritie to his doctrine, taketh occasion thereof whiles he exscuseth, and craueth pardon for his rashnesse, that he was so bolde to take vpon him the office of a teacher among them. Furthermore, hee putteth them in great hope of his commming, whiche thing hee saith in the beginning of this Epistle, hee had in vaine hitherto gone aboute, and prooued: and this hee doeth, adding the cause which presently did hinder him:</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="14"/>Namely that the Churches of Macedonia &amp; Achaia had committed to his charge, the carriage of that almes vnto Hierusalem, which they had giuen to relieue the poore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren there.</p>
   <p>The last Chapter standeth wholly almost vppon saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but that it being heere and there tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with certayne preceptes not to be contemned, is concluded with an excellent prayer.</p>
