   <head>TO THE RIGHT WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull Sir <hi>Henrie Bedingfield</hi> in <hi>the Countie of Norffolke Knight:</hi> George Wilson <hi>wisheth in this world, health,</hi> wealth, and prosperitie: and in the world to come, eternall felicitie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Treatise (right Worshipfull) tending to the commendation of Cockes, and Cocke-fighting, was by me long since pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in <hi>London, Bostone,</hi> and other places: but like an ill Debtor, I haue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken many dayes of payment: yet now at the last I haue made perfourmance, although perchance not altogether in such good manner, as some men may expect, yet is it in the best sort that I can: and as it is, I hope you will accept it. <hi>Mison</hi> could not paint so exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely, as <hi>Apelles</hi> did, yet <hi>Darius</hi> allowed of his labours. Silly <hi>Baucis</hi> could not feast <hi>Iupiter</hi> in siluer plate, but in wodden vessels. All that honour <hi>Esculape,</hi> cannot decke his shrine with Iewels: neither can all they that write, expresse their mindes, so well as they would. But as <hi>Apollo</hi> gaue Oracles, as well to the poore man for his mite, as to the rich man for his million: so I doubt not, but your worship will accept of this my poore offering, and patronize this booke as willingly, as I dedicate it har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
<pb facs="3"/> and although I know it is vnworthy, to weare your worthy name: yet haue I (presuming on your wonted curtesie) placed it on the browe of it, to be an ornament vnto it to grace it, and a shield to defend it, against all enuious detractors. Now, the reason why I haue made choyse of you, rather than of any other, is, both in regard of the good will you beare to Cocke-fighting, (wherein I know you take exceeding great delight) and also to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest my loue, and dutie vnto your worship, to whom I am more than much beholding, for many and most vndeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued curtesies. Being loath to trouble you with too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an Epistle, in all humility, commending my booke to your fauourable protection, I end, hoping one day to doe something that shalbe more worthy of your acceptance, till when and euer, I rest your Worships, to commaund.</p>
