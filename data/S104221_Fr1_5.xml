And it is maruaile that I being in all myne other spea ches so playne, and perceaueable, should here desyer, or not shun to be harde, so farre forth as I can kepe the lerninge, and sayinges of the author. But I feare me a number do so thincke of thys booke, as I was aunswered by a prynter not longe agone, Thou gh sayth he (Sir your boke be wyse, and ful of learnyng, yet peraduenture it wyl not be so saileable) signifying indéede that flim flames, and gue gawes, be they neuer so sleight and slender, are soner rapte vp thenne are those which be lettered and Clarkly makings.

To be shorte, (as it is best for a man to be wyth hys frend) he that is least acquainted wyth suche trashe, and pelfe wyll better perceaue suche thinges whych be sauerye and sappye. If there be such hardnes as is sayd to be in thys booke, to me it is not hard, nor through me it is not hard. Whether it be throughe Horace hys diffuse speache, or vnknowne knowledge, or through the Readers suspected ignoraunce, let it there rest, and to theim be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To impropriate it to me it were neither honestye, nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wysedom. For of truth ther is no such cause Why. Certainelye Horace hymself is hard, and very hard, neyther any mā which can iudge, can iudge it one &amp; y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> like laboure, to trāslate Horace, and to make, and translate a loue booke, a shril tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedye, or a smothe, and plat leuyled poesye. Thys can I tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye say of myne own experyence that I can soner translate twelue verses out of the gréeke Homer, then sixe oute of Horace. Prayse I seke not for nor except I be a foole I care not for. To doo that whych I doo, is and shal be to me recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence sufficiente. I neuer harde tell of anye man that was great gayner by poesies, and the better the poet is, the more commonlye is he hated. Homer was so contenmed that beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerye was hys best lyfe: and so hated of a many of trewands that Zoilus for verye rancoure fell a whippinge of hys Image: Uirgill for his goulden verses, was recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced wyth a certayne od cast of bread. Horace had his tillage
