   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an vsuall thing (Right
honourable) for subiects
to imitate their prince, &amp;
for inferiours to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
themselues to the
example of great persons: as Abimeleck
said to his soldiers:<note place="margin">Iud. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</note>
      <hi>what ye haue seene
me doe, make hast and doe the like:</hi> for as
Ambrose saith,<note place="margin">lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 span">
            <desc>〈…〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> amplius proficitur exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo:
nec difficile redditur quod iam fact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>
est, &amp; vtile, quod probatum: <hi>men profit
much by examples, for neither seemeth
that hard, which is done before, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
that is tried by others:</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thus should we all set before our eies
<pb facs="3"/>
the example of our master Christ, and
tread in his holy steppes: <hi>I haue giuen you
an example</hi> saith our blessed sauiour
Iohn 13. 15. this it is to run after the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of his ointment,<note place="margin">Cantic. 1. 2.</note> to followe his
sweete example. As Aarons ointment
ranne down from his head to the skirtes
of his cloathing:<note place="margin">Psal 134.</note> so Christs holy vestures
are from him as our head dispersed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his members: therefore Christ
vouchsafeth to call his faithfull seruants
his fellowes or partners. Psal. 45. 7. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they partake of his goodnes, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of his vertues.</p>
   <p>Heere then is set forth vnto vs in this
treatise the example of Christ praying:
that we should therein be like our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
master, to be occupied in earnest
and faithfull praier: wherein in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
diuerse profitable points are to be
obserued.</p>
   <p>I We are taught how necessary a
thing it is to be suters vnto God by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
for if Christ praied, who in respect
of himselfe needed not to pray, but for
<pb facs="3"/>
our example: who neither wanted any
grace to pray for▪ nor yet had any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
to pray against, if he notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
praied for vs, much more haue
we cause to pray for our selues, both to
receiue graces, which we haue not, and
to be released of the euills which we
haue. Ambrose saith well: quid pro
tua salute facere oportet,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. in L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>.</note> quando pro te,
Christus in oratione praeuertat? <hi>what
should we doe for our selues seeing Christ
watched for vs al night in praier?</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the saying is, <hi>it is more necessary
for vs to pray then to breath.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>II We learne also by this holy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of our sauiour, which was fulfilled in
euery part thereof, how effectuall the
praiers and teares of the faithfull are:
<hi>whatsoeuer they desire</hi> (saith our sauiour)
<hi>shall be giuen them of my heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Math. 18. 19.<note place="margin">Ad Cel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>tium.</note> vim faciebat precum
tuarū fidelis ambitio: <hi>the faithfull am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of thy praiers did as it were force
God:</hi> saith Hierome Alexander said
to Antipater,<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> that made great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb facs="4"/>
of his mother: <hi>knowest thou not
that she with one teare will blot out all thy
complaints?</hi> much more auaylable with
God are the teares of his seruants, which
as precious liquor he preserueth in his
bottles.<note place="margin">Psal 56. 8.</note>
   </p>
   <p>III In that our Sauio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>r praied often,<note place="margin">Luk. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 span">
            <desc>〈…〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note>
and continued in praier, it teacheth, that
we also should therein be daily exercised,
and as the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">1. Thes. 5. 17.</note>
      <hi>pray continually:</hi>
quia semper accipis semper inuoca: <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou hadst need alwaies to receaue,</hi>
      <note place="margin">

         </gap>ii. Xen. lib. 1. de Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

      <hi>alwaies pray:</hi> Xenophon writeth o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
that would neither dine nor supp,
<gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> before he had swett; neither
should we eate or drinke before we had
shed teares vnto God.</p>
   <p>IV Christ when he praied, was who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intent and fixed vpon that holy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
so should our thoughtes be setled in
prayer, that then most of all men should
follow the wise mans counsell,<note place="margin">Prou 4 23.</note>
      <hi>to keepe
our hart with all diligence</hi> that we shew
our selues in praier not <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> but
<gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> as Zeno said of his schollers,
<pb facs="4"/>
not bablers of words, but vtterers of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
Hierome foūd this to be his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that oftentimes in my praier saith he,<note place="margin">aduer Luciferius</note>
aut per porticus deambulo, aut de faenore
computo: <hi>I thinke I am walking on the
streates, or accounting my mony:</hi> so it is
an easy matter for the thoughts to roue
in praier, which we are taught to settle
by Christes example.</p>
   <p>V Our blessed sauiour had therefore
free recourse to praier, because he was of
an holy and innocent life: soe if we would
haue our praiers heard, we must lift vp
pure hands as the Apostle saith 1. Tim. 2. 8.
Basilo saith well: <hi>that the presence of an
honest life doth make our praiers to haue
a loud sound.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note>
   </p>
   <p>VI Our sauiour also by his example
teacheth vs for what things we should
cheifely pray: not for temporall, but spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
blessings: as v. 17. he saith <hi>sanctifie
them with thy truth:</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 King 3.</note> Salomon, because
he asked wisdome rather then honour
or riches, pleased god, and receiued them
all, euen those temporall things▪ which
<pb facs="5"/>
he had not asked: Hierom saith well: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarus
sum ad accipienda beneficia, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
plus bibero,<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>d C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>esiphon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</note> tanto plus sitio: <hi>we should
be euen couetous of spirituall blessings:
&amp; the more we drinke, the more to thirst,</hi>
for he that craueth temporall blessings,
often asketh them to his owne hurt: as he
<hi>that is sick of a feuer,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note>
      <hi>as one saith, craueth
for wine.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>VII Lastly our Sauiour praieth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
v. 24. father I will: soe hath he
taught vs to pray without doubting:<note place="margin">Mark. 11 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</note>
      <hi>whatsoeuer you desire beleeue you shall
haue it and it shall be done vnto you:</hi> we
should not be discouraged, though at the
first one request be not granted. Deus dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert
desiderium, non ausert: <hi>God differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
our desire he dissolueth it not:</hi> Bias
that heathen philosopher could say,<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> that
a <hi>good conscience is without feare:</hi> soe
should our conscience in praier be free
from fearefull doubting.</p>
   <p>Thus this example of our Sauiour as a
rich store-house affordeth infinite trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and as a bundle of mirrh sendeth
<pb facs="5"/>
forth a most fragrant smell. This Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
exercise, is the supporter of princes,
the sheild of defence for nobles, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
of rest for all: This maketh honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
persons truly noble indeed, when
they acknowledge him, by whome they
are innobled: and indeed the greater the
affaires of state are, wherein your hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urs
are imployed, the more need haue
your honours of spirituall direction: as
Daniel that great Regent vsed to pray
thrice in the day. Herein his Christian
maiestie, imitating the diuine and highest
maiestie may be an example to all both
honorable and inferior subiectes, who as
he practiseth in his royall person,<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>. 11.</note> soe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
to his princely sonne <hi>to pray of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
and in what manner, and for what
things to pray. And indeed what can be
more honourable then to talke with the
most high? what more comfortable, then
for God to speake to our hartes? for
when we <hi>drawe</hi> neere vnto God by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
he draweth neare vnto vs, and as one
saith: <hi>a pure praier is Gods temple:</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note>
      <hi>striue therefore with
God in praier</hi> (as Augustine saith) with
Iacob, that he may ioy to be ouercome.</p>
