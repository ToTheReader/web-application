   <p>HOw Saint <hi>Hugh</hi> was sonne vnto the renowned King of <hi>Powis,</hi> a noble Britaine borne, who in the prime of his yeares loued the fore Virgin <hi>Winifred,</hi> who was the only daughter of <hi>Donwallo,</hi> which was the last King that euer raigned in <hi>Tegina,</hi> which is now called Flint-shire But she refusing al offers of loue, was only plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a religious life. Her father was sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; dyed; whose La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy left her life long before. This Virgin therefore for sooke her fathers Princely palace in <hi>Pont Varry,</hi> and made her whole abiding in the most sweet pleasant Vally of <hi>Sich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>nt,</hi> and liued there solitarily, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of all companie or comfort. It chanced that in Summers heate, this faire Virgin being greatly distressed for lacke of drinke, and not knowing where to get any, there sprung vp suddenly a christall streame of most sweet and pleasant water out of the hard ground, whereof this Virgin did daily drinke: Vnto the which God himselfe gaue so great a vertue, that many people hauing beene washed therein, were healed of diuers and sundry infirmities wherewith they were borne. Moreouer, round about this well, where this Virgin did vse to walke, did grow a kinde of Mosse, which is of a most sweet sauour, and the colour thereof is as fresh in Winter as in Summer; so that lying thereon, you would suppose your selfe to be on a bed of Downe, perfumed with most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious odours? And what of all this; Marry read the booke and you shall know; but reade nothing except you reade all. And why so? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the beginning shewes not the middle, and the middle shewes not the latter end.</p>
