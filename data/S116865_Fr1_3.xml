   <head>To the courteous and
friendly Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Readers, although I present you
with this tearie Mappe of S. <hi>Peters</hi>
submissiue Minde, yet I craue pardon
of you, as <hi>(Clinius</hi> did of <hi>Virginius)</hi>
that if you finde any thing amisse, you
will passe it ouer with fauourable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
desiring you to reade with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
correct with iudgement, and
winke at a fault.</p>
   <p>After I had writ these few lines, I stoode in doubt whether
I should commit them to the Presse, let them lye obscurely in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or else to remaine priuately in my owne hands, but being in
doubt least any false copie should be scattered abroad, &amp; by that
meanes it should come corrupt to the Print, disguised in the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of an other mans humor: it imboldened my weake abilitie
the more to giue it passage to the Presse: yet it may be, that cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
skill will make this reckoning, that though it bee course in
respect of exquisite labours, yet it may entertaine indifferent
mindes, for that the ground thereof is pietie, and this commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
it will carie with it, that the Reader may learne the true
path to perfect Ioy, and how to humble himselfe in the schoole
of repentance.</p>
   <p>Thus wading ouer rashly like <hi>Gherillus</hi> I flattered my selfe,
yet farre from the minde of <hi>Terence,</hi> when he first beganne to
studie Poetrie, he thought all the world would be in loue with his
writing, but if this may winne any one to a repentant minde, hee
shall receiue the fruites of his good worke, and I shall inioy the
content of my full desire.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Phidios</hi> founde the more fauour in setting out his simple
pictures, in that he did what he could, and I hope to find your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
iudgement for this imperfect worke in that I doe what
I can. Though <hi>Cicero</hi> were eloquent, <hi>Ennius</hi> was bluntish, high
stile is not herein used, but a plaine <hi>Decorum</hi> touching the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a worke roughly hewed out of a hard rocke, not polished by
the curious hands of <hi>Artifex,</hi> yet brought to the view of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
whose cleare sighted iudgement may condemne me of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
yet this I know, that the well literate will winke at a fault,
when the captious misliker will finde fault with euery letter, for
the one, I will honour his discreet fauour, for the other, I neuer
meant to please his humor.</p>
   <p>Thus I commit my selfe and my booke to your courtesies, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
the friendly Readers the fruition of all felicitie, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them to the protection of the celestiall powers, and this my
good will towards them, to their fauourable considerations.</p>

      <signed>Yours to commaund in all
