      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Inding here to treate of the Art of Logike in our vulgar tongue, for the profit of those my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that are not learned in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine tongues: I thinke it no shame nor robbery to borrow termes of the said Art from the Latines, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as they did from the Greekes: and specially such termes as cannot be aptly expressed in our natiue speech: and yet therewith I doe not forget plainly to shew the signification of cuery such terme, so as euery man may easily vnderstand what each terme signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth: thinking it much better so to doe, then to fayne new wordes vnproper for the purpose, as some of late haue done. And as my minde is hereby to please the vnlearned, that are desirous of learning, hauing both good wits, and also good disposition with aptnesse to learne. So my hope is not to offend the learned, who, I am sure doe well allow of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in saying, that euery good thing, the more common it be, the better it is: neither are they ignorant, that in old time past, aswell the Greekes as the Latines, of what Art soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="3"/>
they wrote, each one wrote the same, for the most part, in his owne vulgar speech. Euery man is not able in these costly dayes, to finde either himselfe or his Child at the Vniuersitie, whom if God not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing hath indued with a liuely wit, and made him so apt to learning, as hauing some helpe at home, he may by his owne industry, attayne vnto right good knowledge, &amp; be made thereby the more able to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, and to profit his Countrey. Truly, I see no cause why the learned should disdayne, or be miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that such Man or Child should be freely taught this or any other good Art, without any cost or charge. Wherefore arming my selfe with assured hope, that with this my labour, I shall greatly profit and pleasure the vnlearned, and not hinder or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please the learned, I will boldly follow mine enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, and here briefly shew the order of my said Worke, which is diuided into sixe Parts or Bookes: for sith Logicke is chiefly occupyed in discussing of Questions, and that such questions, both simple and compound doe spring of wordes, the first Part of my Booke shall treate of Wordes, shewing which be Simple, which be Compound, and also which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend more, and which comprehend lesse: &amp; which be of affinitie, and which be not: leauing out no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Rules belonging thereunto, that are taught either by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or by any other Moderne writer:
<pb facs="3"/>
Secondly, because all simple questions consisting of single wordes, are to be discussed by Definition and Diuision: the second Part treateth of them both, and therewith sheweth also with what methode and order such simple questions are to be handled. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because all compound questions are to be discussed by reasoning or argumentation, and that euery kinde of argument doth consist of Propositions: the third Part treateth of a Proposition, and of all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereunto. Fourthly, because no sound argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be made to proue or disproue any thing that is in question, vnlesse the Disputer know from whence to fetch his proofes: the fourth Part of my Booke treateth of all the places from whence any argument is to be fetched. And the fifth Part treateth of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation, and of all the kindes thereof, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how euery kinde is to be performed. The sixt and last Part treateth of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, shewing how all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticall arguments are to be confuted.</p>
