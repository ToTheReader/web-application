   <head>¶ The preface of Johan Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier knyght lorde Berners / translatour of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent cronycle.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat condygne graces and thankes ought men to gyue to the writers of histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes? Who with their great labours / haue done so moche profyte to the humayne lyfe. They shewe / open / manifest and declare to the reder / by example of olde an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyquite: what we shulde enquere / desyre / and folowe: And also / what we shulde eschewe / a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde / and vtterly flye. For whan we (beynge vnexpert of chaūces) se / beholde / and rede the auncyent actes / gestes / and dedes: Home / and with what labours / daūgers / and paryls they were gested and done: They right greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monest / ensigne / and teche vs: howe we maye lede forthe our lyues. And farther / he that hath the perfyte knowledge of others ioye / welthe / and higher prosperite: and also trouble / sorowe and great aduersyte: hath the xpert doctryne of all parylles. And albeit / that mortall folke are marueylously separated / bothe by lande &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter / and right wōderously sytuate: yet are they and their actes (done {per}aduenture by the space of a thousande yere) cōpact togyder / by thisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphier: as it were the dedes of one selfe cyte / and in one mānes lyfe. Wherfore I say that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie may well be called a diuyne prouydence: For as the celestyall bodyes aboue / complecte all and at euery tyme the vniuersall worlde / the creatures therin cōteyned / and all their dedes: semblably so dothe history. Is it nat a right no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble thynge for vs / by the fautes and errours of other / to amede and erect our lyfe in to better? We <abbr>shuld</abbr> nat seke and acquyre that other dyd / but what thyng was most best / most laudable / and worthely done / we shulde putte before our eyes to folowe. Be nat the sage counsayles of two or thre olde fathers in a cyte / towne / or coū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tre: whom long age hath made wyse / dyscrete / and prudent: farre more praysed / lauded / and derely loued: than of the yongemenne? Howe moche more than ought stories to be cōmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded / praysed / and loued? In whom is encluded so many sage counsayls / great reasons / &amp; hygh wisedoms: of so innumerable {per}sons / of sondry nacyons and of euery age: and that in so long space / as four or fyue hundred yere. The most profytable thyng in this worlde / for the instytu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion of the humayne lyfe / is hystorie. Dues the contynuall redyng therof / maketh yonge men equall in prudence to olde men: and to olde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers stryken in age / it mynystreth experyence of thynges. More / it yeldeth priuate persons worthy of dignyte / rule and gouernaunce. It compelleth themperours / hygh rulers and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours / to do noble ded{is}: to thende they may optayne immortall glory. It exciteth / moueth / and stereth the strong hardy warriours / for the great laude that they haue after they ben deed / promptly to go in hande with great and harde parels / in defence of their countre. And it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibyteth reprouable persons to do mischeuous dedes / for feare of infamy &amp; shame. So thus / through the monumentes of writynge / whiche is the testymony vnto vertue / many men haue ben moued: Some to byldecytes / some to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyse and establisshe lawes tight profitable / ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie / and behouefull for the humayne lyfe: Some other to fynde newe artes / craftes / and sciences / very requisyte to the vse of mākynde. But aboue all thynges / wherby mans welthe ryseth / speciall laude and cause ought to be gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to historie. It is the keper of suche thinges as haue ben vertuously done / and the wytnesse of yuell dedes. And by the benefite of hystorie: all noble / highe / and vertuous actes be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. What moued the strong and ferse Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to enterprise in his lyfe / so many great incō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable labours and pyls? Certaynly nought<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>els / but y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> for his meryt{is} immortalyte mought be gyuen to hym of all folke. In sēblable wyse dyd his imytator noble duke These us / &amp; many other innumerable worthy prices and famouse men / whose vertues ben redemed sro oblyuion &amp; shyne by historie. And where as other monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes in processe of tyme / by varyable chaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces / are confused and lost. The vertue of histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry / dyffused and spredde throughe the vuyuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall worlde / hathe to her custos &amp; kepat it (that is to say tyme) whiche cōsumeth the other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges. And albeit that those menne are right worthy of great laude and prayse / who by their writynges shewe and lede vs the waye to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: yet neuerthelesse / the poems / lawes / and other artes that they foūde / deuysed and writ / ben mixed with some domage. And sōtyme for the trueth / they ensigne a man to lye. But one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
<pb facs="3"/>
hystorie / truely with wordes / representyng the actes / gestes / and dedes done: complecteth all profyte. It moueth / stereth / and compelleth to honestie: detesteth / erketh / &amp; aborteth vices. It extolleth / enhaunceth / and lyfteth vp / suche as ben noble and vertuous: depresseth / poyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth / and thrusteth downe / such as ben wicked / yuell / and reprouable. What knowlege shulde we haue of auncyent thynges past / and historie were nat? Whiche is the testymony therof / the lyght of trouthe / the maystres of the lyfe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne / the presydent of remembraūce / and the messanger of antiquyte. Why moued and ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Phaleryus / the kynge Ptholome / oft and dilygently to rede bokes? Forsothe for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause / but that those thynges are founde writen in bokes / that the frēdes dare nat shewe to the price. Moche more I wolde fayne write of the incomparable profyte of hystorie / but I feare me / that I shulde to sore tourment the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this my preface. And also I doute nat / but that the great vtilyte therof is better kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen / than I coulde declare: wherfore I shall breuely come to apoynt. Thus / whan I aduer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tysed and remembred the many folde comody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of hystorie / howe benefyciall it is to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall folke / and eke howe laudable and meryto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryous a dede it is / to write hystories / fixed my mynde to do some thyng therin. And euer whā this ymaginacyon came to me / I volued / tour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned / and redde many volumes and bokes / con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teyning famouse histories. And amonge all other / I redde dilygently the four volumes or bokes of sir Johan Froyssart of the countrey of Heynaulte / written in the Frenche tonge: whiche I iudged comodyous / necessarie / and profytable to be hadde in Englysshe / sithe they treat of the fomous actes done in our parties. That is to say: in Englande / Fraūce / Spay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne / Portyngale / Scotlāde / Bretayne / Flaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders / and other places adioyning: and special<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly / they redounde to the honoure of Englysshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. What pleasure shall it be to the noble gē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylmen of Englande / to se / beholde / &amp; rede: the highe enterprises / famous actes / and glorious dedes / done and atchyued by their valyant aū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytours? Forsothe and god: this hath moued me at the highe cōmaundement of my moost re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>douted souerayne lorde kynge Henry the .viii. kyng of Englande and of Fraunce / and highe defender of the christen faythe. &amp;c. Under his gracyous supportacyon / to do my deuoyre to translate out of frenche in to our maternall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glysshe tonge / the sayd volumes of sir Johan Froyssart. Whiche cronycle begynneth at the raygne of the moost noble and valyant kynge Edwarde the thyrde. The yere of our lorde / a thousande thre hundred and sixtene: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynucth to the begynning of the reigne of king Henry the fourth. The yere of our lorde god a thousande and foure hundred: The space by / twene / is threscore and fourtene yeres. Requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge all the reders and herers therof / to take this my rude translacion in gre. And in that I haue nat folowed myne authour worde by wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de: yet I trust I haue ensewed the true reporte of the sentence of the mater. And as for the true namyng of all maner of personages / Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis / cyties / townes / ryuers / or teldes: Where as I coude nat name them properly nor aptely in Englysshe / I haue written them acordynge as I founde them in frenche. And thoughe I haue nat gyuen euery lorde / knyght / or squyer his true addycion: yet I trust I haue natswar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued fro the true sentēce of the mater. And there as I haue named the dystaunce bytwene pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by myles and leages / they must be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande acordyng to the custome of the coūtreis where as they be named / for in some place they be lengar than in some other. In Englande a leage or myle is well knowen / in Fraūce a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge is two myles / and in some place thre. And in other coūtreis more or lesse / euery nacion hath sondrie customes. And if any faute be in this my rude translacyon / I remyt the correctyon therof to thē that discretely shall fynde any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable deraute. And in their so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge / I shall pray god to sende thē the blysse of heuen.</p>
