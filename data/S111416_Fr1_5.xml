   <head>A Preface to the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONG all the Romane writers, there is none (by the iudgement of
the learned) so much auailable to bée read and studied, for the true
knowledge and puritie of the Latin tong, as <hi>Pub. Terentius:</hi> for,
sith the chée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest matter in speech, is to speak properly and
aptly, and that we haue not a more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Crafts-master of apt and proper
spéech than <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> well woorthy is he then, euen with all
care and dilligence, to be both taught and learned before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And
surely, great is the pity, that <hi>Terence</hi> were not more vsed of
maisters in teaching, and made more familiar to schollers in learning, than
commonly it is: being (as I haue knowen my selfe) by dyuers men, in diuers
sentences, diuersly misvnderstood: for, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in many places,
vsing abbreuiations, and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue spéeches, aswell in regard of
his verse, as also that such maner of writing, was very eloquent and
famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar in his tyme: doth thereby cause the sence séeme very
doubtful, to such Readers as are not fully acquainted with him: which comes
to passe, by meanes that this booke, is not so frequented in schooles,
nor laboured in studie, according to the woorthines of it: but other base
and inferior bookes, commonly preferd before it, to the vtter marring, and
maiming of Schollers both in stile and iudgement.</p>
   <p>Though this Comoedie, now englished, perhaps séeme not
altogether so pleasant, as could be wished, neither in matter, nor manner
of handling: Yet is it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered <pb facs="6"/> (besides that it
léeseth his natural grace, being turnd into another language) that the
tyme when, and the place where, it was first published in Latin, affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no other sort of Comoedies than this is. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it was no part of my
meaning, to trāslate the same, as a thing either pleasant to be played,
or very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to bée read: (Notwithstanding that this Author was
most excellent, and most learned, of any that wrote in this kinde:) but
especially, for that the Latin is pure &amp; eloquent, much commended by
<hi>Tullie</hi> himselfe, &amp; right requisite to be studied, &amp;
vnderstood of all such, as would attaine to the knowledge of right
speaking, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of wel writing, in the Latin tong: for whose only
sakes (and also at the earnest request of some, whom I was desirous
to satisfy) I haue aduentured the engli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing hereof: wishing, that as
I haue thus boldly begoon with the first, so some other hauing more
leisure, and learning, would go thorough with the rest of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. I
haue vsed (as neere as I could) the most knowen, vsuall, and familiar
phrases in common spéech, to expresse the authors meaning, as
(to my thinking) best agréeing therewithall. Neuertheles, I make
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count my doing herein, shall be carpt and caueld at by some, from
whose malicious censure, euen the best writers can not scape vntouched,
and therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile if they spurne at me. Of which kinde of men, I
haue knowen by experience, &amp; noted for memory, twoo sorts: One sort
pretending a shew of learning, &amp; being indéed but very dunses,
loue to be speaking they wot not what, to disgrace they care not whom, and
yet not rendring any reason why, but onely to feed their owne bad humours: In
whom, true iudgement, being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether supprest, what with affection, or
ignorance, or both: as either mooued by fond lyking, to commend that is bad: or
stird with fowle hatred to dispraise that is good: are thus commonly
carried along, with the vaine tyde and winde of their willes, without any
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <pb facs="6"/> of right, or due respect of wrong. An other sort
(whereof I knew some good schollers, the more the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) blinded with
ouerweening of themselues, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyking al other mens dooings (how wel
soeuer they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue:) like onely of their owne, be they neuer so mean:
neuer geuing any man his due, fearing, by like, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer commendation is
attributed to others, that the same must néeds be a derogation frō
themselues: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are far vnlike <hi>Tullie,</hi> the welspring of
wit and learning: who alwaies praised, all men of desert, euen in those
things, wherein he both desired, and deserued, most praise himselfe:
This is read of <hi>Tullie,</hi> to his great praise, and remembred of others
to their iust reproch. And here, least perchance I be mistaken more than
I would, &amp; misconstrued otherwise than I meane, though my woords
before doo sufficiently declare my meaning: yet (to auoyd all dowt) it
shall not be amisse, if I ad a few more in this place. To disalow the
iudgement of such, as by learning can, and by reason know, where, when, and
how, to finde fault, as iust cause and matter shall lead them: were to be
wilfully blinde, and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately foolish: God forbid I should be so
vnreasonable, or that men should iudge of mée so vnrightly.</p>
   <p>Of the curious <hi>Carper</hi> I looke not to be fauoured, and yet
if my labour may be equally compared with my Authors words and meaning, I doubt
not but it will appeare vnto him, an easier matter to finde fault with part,
than to amend the whole.</p>
   <p>Onely, I submit this poore translation vnto the vew &amp;
iudgement of the learned: who lyking the Truth, and louing to speake Truth,
will both allow what is well don, and amend that is amisse: As for others,
I see not but that they ought first to learne, before they take vppon them
to Controll:</p>
