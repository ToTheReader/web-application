   <head>The Preface wherein both the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the discourse ensuing is deliuered, and certaine generall faults of the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, touched.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had once well hoped, that eyther the authoritie of the Magistrate could haue commanded, or the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the common enemie, that so violently doth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle the whole Church at this time, would haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced the contentious to make an ende of their braules: and if neither reuerence of superiors, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of common profit could put them to silence; yet did I imagine, seeing they haue nothing to say, that discretion, and common sense would make them to hold their peace. how much my expectation was deceiued this petition which I haue here vndertaken to answere, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. for without respect to lawes, or common profite, yea or common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the author thereof hath put forth himselfe to speake. a man as you shal see without reuerence to superiours, or conscience in reporting of lawes, or iudgementin matters diuine or humane, and most vnable to speake, or write in this, or other argument.</p>
   <p>To goe no further, this his petition shall make proofe of my words. for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there art in his stile, nor witte, or sharpenesse in his arguments, nor is there any decencie obserued in the discourse: nor doth the treatise agree with the title, nor the parts thereof with themselues. the stile is like Iohn Bels song of Couentrie, the sentences hang together like lenten deames: first, <hi>he kneeleth on his knee, then asketh pardon, afterward telleth of all good subiects, how they desire peace (and yet notwithstanding he telleth of many that increase contention,) then he talketh of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of bookes, of generall counsels, and a newe kind of disputing by writing:</hi> matters that neyther haue coherence among themselues, nor with his general purpose. hauing made this absurd entrance, he proceedeth more absurdly. his arguments are all drawen from authoritie, of late writers: a weake kind of reasoning, and good for nothing: yet as if hee had sayde very much stoutely doth he reuell at Bishoppes, Iudges, lawes; and quarrelth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the state: afterward hee gathereth certaine notes of his owne disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which vnlesse you receiue of his bare word, you stop all his glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: last of all he layeth downe certaine articles, and interrogatories. It
<pb facs="7"/>should seeme he hath bene eyther a pettie fogger in law, or a clerke in some office: or hath bene furnished with these matters by some odde clerke, or petie fogger. nothing is more simple, nor clerkely, nor worse beseeming men of learning. there is in his writing no good course of words, no good frame of sentences, no sufficient proofes, no order nor sequence of parts.</p>
   <p>His arguments yet are worse then his stile. to proue the consistorie and his new conceits of discipline, he alledgeth first, <hi>that the gouernment of Byshops is not so exquisite, but that somewhat may bee amended.</hi> as if it followed because men doo not their dueties, or because there are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in men, and in proceedings, or want of some lawe: that the state were to be ouerturned, and a newe vncouth and vnruly gouernement by Churchaldermen to be imbraced: or els, as if a man should say, we were to be gouerned by the lawes of Turkes or Iewes, because of the faultes of the common lawes. nay rather let lawes stand, and such Turkish and barbarous conceites of generall innouation bee corrected, and faultes of lawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
   <p>Secondly <hi>he bringeth in a packe of authorities against Romish bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops:</hi> as if eyther the ancient Bishops of Rome, or the late Bishoppes that preach the Gospell, were to be measured by the wickednesse, and tyranny of the late Romish Byshops: or gouernment were to be taken away, because it hath bene abused. thirdly <hi>he produceth the opinions of</hi> Caluin, Beza, <hi>and a packe of</hi> others: most of them vnlearned and vnknowen, as if it were reason to follow them against all antiquitie; or as if the gouernement of the Church stood vpon opinion, not vpon scripture, and ancient lawes, and customes. Before times these fellowes told vs of a discipline commanded in scriptures; this fellow telleth vs of certaine fancies of <hi>Caluin, Beza,</hi> and certaine obscure authors newly brought out of corners into light. and yet can he not shewe, that any of these whome he hath alledged, doe in all poynts consent with our platformers. to prooue that his partisans offend not against law, <hi>he alledgeth diuers of their opinions:</hi> as if it were an excuse for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes to say, they beleeue well in some few poyntes. what punishment then do they deserue that offend both in the opinions alledged, and diuers others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed? finally to prooue that his fellowes offending against lawe, are not to be punished, <hi>he sheweth that Bishops also offend against Lawe:</hi> as if the offence of one, were to be an excuse for another, or as if a man offend in any small point of law, and that not of malice, it were lawfull for these fellowes to ouerthrow all lawes, and that of selfewill, and malicious purpose.</p>
   <p>There is no decorum obserued in the whole discourse, <hi>the petition is
<pb facs="7"/>supposed to bee made by the author kneeling before her Maiestie.</hi> yet doth he often speake to others, and quarrell and dispute with those that are absent, as if a man making his petition to her Maiestie, should sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rise vp, and quarrell with by standers. which not onely is a poynt of absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, but of the authors old frensie.</p>
   <p>Secondly what is more vnseemely, then before the chiefe gouernour to plead as doth the petitioner; <hi>that all his gouernment is leud, &amp; antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and that his lawes are deuoyde of reason, and that iudgementes giuen are vniust, and ought to be reuersed, and most odiously to raile on the state and gouernours?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly seeing this petition is directed to her Maiestie, to what ende is the same put in print? belike the mans purpose is, that so much as the Queene by wisedome shall denie, the people by force, and furie shall establish. which in deede is his drift. for the same was neuer presented to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, but onely to the people.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, nothing is more absurde, then to handle matters of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie by way of supplication. seeing he disputeth, he should rather haue come in schooles, then in court; and before lawyers, then courtiers.</p>
   <p>Lastly a very vndecent thing it seemeth to me, that a man not conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in studie of diuinitie should teach diuines, that a disordered companion should controllgouernors, and lawes: that a man lately distracted of his wit should teach law and order, neither knowing order, nor lawe. which course if it may be suffered: it is but folly to studie diuinitie or lawe, or to maintaine gouernement; and a bad incouragement for iudges to do iustice, seeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ignorant &amp; disordered companion shal take on him to control them and to teach lawe, &amp; to gouerne as it were by reuelation, inspiration, and fancie. what should be the cause that this base fellow should come forth, I know not: vnlesse this be it, that all that were wise foreseeing and eschewing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, this bedlem writer that neyther foresawe, nor sawe any thing, being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with diuers collections of others, should say something, if for nothing els, yet to make shew, that they can say somewhat.</p>
   <p>The treatise answereth not to the title. for where hee promiseth <hi>therein to deliuer a meanes how to compound matters;</hi> in the whole treatise he doth with all his force endeuour to enkindle warres, he rayleth on gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and lawes, controlleth iudges, and goeth about to reuerse iudgements, and would if he could; ouerthrow all the ecclesiasticall state: which sauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth rather of a humour to fight, then to compound. and yet is not he the man that must bee the leader of these consistoriall warriours, being but a
<pb facs="8"/>ragazzo fit for nothing but to cary baggage.</p>
   <p>In this his booke hee fighteth no more against vs, then against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. he sayth <hi>hee will neither speake to ouerthrow Bishops, nor to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect consistories:</hi> yet doth he his vttermost malice against Bishops, and speaketh what hee can for Consistories: and yet nothing to purpose. hee <hi>professeth hee knoweth not whether part hath better grounde,</hi> wherein like a simple fellow, he not onely confesseth he speaketh of matters he vnderstandeth not, but also contrarieth himselfe in denying that hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth. in the very first entrance <hi>he saith, that all her Maiesties lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing subiectes, that loue religion, honour her Maiestie, and doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the good of the Realme, doe heartily bewayle the contention of our Church:</hi> wherin hee pronounceth sentence against himselfe, and his consortes, as neyther louing ber Maiestie, religion nor the state. for seeking to enflame this contention by scurrilous libels, and interrogatories, how can it bee surmised, that they doe bewayle, this contention? do men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle, that which they doe? or doe men seeke peace, that against good men throw out their bolts, euen bitter and slanderous words?</p>
   <p>Besides the former, the libeller hath also these faultes. most fouly hee abuseth scriptures: most shamefully hee alledgeth authors, most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly hee talketh of lawe, and maliciously reuelleth at the ecclesiasticall state. in the first page hee abuseth three places of scripture. the<note n="1" place="margin">Prouerb. 31.</note> wise man sayth, <hi>open thy mouth for the dumbe &amp;c.</hi> by this place he would iustifie his babbling in this treatise. but nothing is more impertinent to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, then this sentence. for the wise man would haue innocents, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not speake for themselues defended by order, and iustice, by such as can speake. neyther may wee thinke, that it was his meaning, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery seditious person shoulde gape and rayle against Lawes and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours for doing iustice, or that malefactours shoulde bee defended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst lawe, and iudges. how can then this place agree to his purpose, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those men whome the libeller defendeth are not innocentes (for they were condemned for felonie, and tryed according to the lawes of England) neyther were they mute, when they reuelled against gouernours, nor was <hi>Iohn Vdall</hi> condemned, but for speaking too much: nor is this busie behauiour of this companion any way allowed, nor sedition or libelling priutledged?</p>
   <p>The Prophet sayth further,<note place="margin">Psal. 115.</note>
      <hi>that because hee beleeued: therefore he spake.</hi> which the libeller turneth <hi>answere,</hi> and woulde drawe to this his treatise. but it fitteth not. for this petition is no answere, but rather a
<pb facs="8"/>rayling libell, or challenge, neyther proceedeth it of faith, but of a foolish disordered conceite of a distempered brayne, not yet well seasoned, since the authors last bedlem fits. and if this bee his beliefe, then is his faith built vpon fancie, and vpon that which himselfe confesseth, he knoweth not.</p>
   <p>Neyther doth it appertayne to his purpose, that the Prophet sayth, <hi>that for Sions sake he will not hold his peace.</hi> for it is not the cause of Sion,<note place="margin">Isai. 62.</note> nor any good cause, but sedition, faction, fancie, conceit, and opinion, that by him is here defended: &amp; that to the great scandale of all the watchmen of <hi>Sion,</hi> yea of althat pray for the peace of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> in the end of his articles against Bishops, as if hee were rauished in an ecstasie hee exclameth: <hi>how long Lord holy and true? and saith, come Lord Iesu.</hi> which sentences make much against him. for all good men desire, that God would trie the cause and that he in iudgement would visite the perturbers of this Church, which if once it shal please him to determine to doe, then shall hee and such vipers as hee, that fret the bowels of the Church which nourisheth them, be discouered, punished, &amp; rooted out. these may serue you for a tast. the rest of his forgeries, and forcing of authors shalbe touched, as they shall offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in their place.</p>
   <p>Neyther may wee thinke, that he that maketh so litle conscience to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, or dally with the scriptures of God, hath vsed more religion in handling the writings of men. for example; to prooue the aldermen, of his Church, &amp; their proceedings, <hi>he hath alledged Luther, Zuinglius, Melancthon,</hi> and many others that are contrarie to these men in their discipline, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knewe such aldermen, as he speaketh of. neyther doth <hi>Caluin,</hi> nor <hi>Beza</hi> ioyne with him in his seuerall poynts of discipline. therefore doth he alledge them in grosse, and abuseth his readers with a shew of names. the like abuse shall appeare in his quotations of lawe, which he by forging and lying maketh to speake contrary to lawe.</p>
   <p>Little doth hee vnderstand of lawe, hee neyther knoweth what procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of office meaneth, nor what is lawe in ministring of othes, against which hee argueth: neyther any one poynt of common, ciuill, or Canon lawe, of which hee so much standeth. but whatsoeuer his knowledge is in lawe, his malice in rayling against the state is singuler: all which poyntes as they are touched here in a generalitie, so hereafter shall bee more particularly layde open, and most of his misallegations, falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, malicious slaunders, weake proofes, and proceedings answered, not that eyther the author, whose insufficiencie is notorious, nor the discourse, the weakenesse whereof is too too pitifull, deserueth any answere: but least
<pb facs="9"/>that the simplicitie of the ignorant, who is easily misled with these great shewes might be abused, or iustice be by opinions controlled. herein also all men may vnderstand the weakenes of the cause of the Consistorie, the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, malice, and fashood of the Consistorians, and such as contend for it, and how fit it were, that such as are altogether vncapable of reason, should be gouerned, if not enforced by lawes.</p>
   <p>The author whatsoeuer he pretendeth for colour, proposeth to himselfe to proue diuerse thinges: First, <hi>that the Ecclesiasticall gouernement of the Church of England is to be changed.</hi> for that doth he meane by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Secondly, <hi>That an Eldership should be established among vs, as being a gouernement vsed in the ancient Church, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be continued in all ages.</hi> and to the end that his reasons may be weighed, <hi>he craueth disputation by aduised writing.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth, that the disciplinarian faction hath not offended against the statute of 23. Eliz. c. 2, and that</hi> Iohn Vdal <hi>was vniustly condemned.</hi> Fourthly, he would declare, <hi>That the consistoriall patrons are vniustly slaundered with desire of innouation, and their doctrine with disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie or disorder, and endeuoreth to excuse himselfe for not declaring himselfe, nor setting his name to his petition.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Lastly, <hi>by diuers Articles, and questions, he goeth about to bring the Ecclesiasticall state into enuie and hatred;</hi> That while men are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in examining their faultes, his clients of the new disguised discipline may escape in the darke, and without danger vndermine the estate.</p>
   <p>To meete therfore with his malice, and to encounter him in al his turnes, I doe purpose by Gods grace to shewe; First, that the gouernement of the Church of England is most conformable to the practise of the gouernment, both vnder the lawe, and the gospell, and hath testimonie of scriptures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of antiquitie, and was neuer gainesaid, but of late dayes, when factious companions, and clouters, and tinkers, and marchants, and men of occcupatiō aspired to Church gouernement; and that the cauils and proofes brought by the petitioner against it, are fond and foolish:</p>
   <p>Secondly, that the noueltie, vanitie, iniustice, and inconueniences of the new gouernement are such, as cannot stand with any good, or well ordered state, wherein also the insufficient pleading of the petitioner for the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie shall be refuted: thirdly, that <hi>Iohn Vdall</hi> was iustly condemned, and that the platformers are iustly charged not onely with breach of diuers lawes, very penall, but also with sedition and faction; and therefore are most mercifully dealt withall, that they are nether in greater number, nor in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="9"/>qualitie punished; the vaine glosses, that are set vpon their factes, and opinions shall be there also wiped away. in the last part of this treatise, such accusations, as the libellor hath brought to disgrace the Ecclesiasticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and which he hath set downe in malitious Articles, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories shall be answered; neither doe I meane therein to omit any speach, that shall seeme any way pertinent to purpose: being loth, he should say, he was not answered.</p>
   <p>Wherein if you see no colour, or shew of reason for this newfound plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes; or proofe of his accusation: consider then I pray you first, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie hath ben offered by this libellor to the Church of God, to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie and her lawes, to the Ecclesiasticall state, and such as liue in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of lawes: and secondly what they deserue, that haue offered this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie vnto so many and honorable persons, and brought this scandale in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of God. the common<note n="1" place="margin">Rescius i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> ministro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</note> aduersarie maketh profite of those shameles slaunders, which those vnciuil, and vnlettered authors of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition haue vttered against the Church: the aduersarie triumpheth to see this contention: disordered companions take occasion of contumacie, and rebellion: when will the gouernors vse like diligence, to represse them?</p>
   <p>If then you loue religion, her Maiestie, and the state: you will not suffer such notorious reuellors at lawes and gouernors: if you be desirous of trueth; you will no more be abused with vaine gloses. <hi>H. Nicholas</hi> hath painted his booke with quotations, as full as T.C. he vseth the same stile, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue the same erronious spirit.</p>
   <p>He saith as well as T.C. <hi>that for Sions sake,</hi>
      <note n="2" place="margin">In euangel. regni.</note>
      <hi>he will not holde his peace.</hi> and yet nether of both speaketh to purpose, nor to the edifying, but rather the pulling downe of Gods Church. and therefore seing both the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and their dealings haue bene tried: let them be both dealt with all, and esteemed according to their deserts.</p>
   <p>It may be these felowes looked for answere of her Maiestie: and to say sooth, the Magistrate were most fitte to shape aunsweres for such disordered petitions. but in the meane while it may please them to accept of my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. they are no such high persons, but meaner men then her Maiestie may answere them, &amp; reason it is seing they put their petition in print, they should also receiue a printed answere: and seing they chalenge me, they should heare my answere. And let them not thinke, but that howsoeuer their malice is repressed by lawe; their fond assertions and cauils shalbe refuted by reason.</p>
   <p>That trueth may appeare; I haue done my endeuour. God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="10"/>I seeke for nothing but trueth and peace. there rosteth then nothing, but that trueth be embraced, and lawe maintained. for little auaileth it to knowe either, if by faction, &amp; mutinie lawes may be broken, &amp; trueth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. to make trueth and Iustice knowen, it belonged to vs: to defend the same belongeth to Magistrates; to wish the same to all. reade therefore and iudge, and seeke the maintenance of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and trueth, without which neither Church, nor state can be well gouerned.</p>
