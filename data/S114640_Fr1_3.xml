Of thy selfe thou art but a tree turned vpward, hauing no sap from the earth; and if thou beest not moistened with the deaw from heauen, though by the sent of water thou maiest bud, yet shalt thou perish in the blade, because thou hast no spirit at the roote. Therefore if thou expect in thy labour blessing, in thy peace continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb facs="10"/>in affliction comfort, in thy death triumph; thou must respect in thy calling honesty, in thy pleasures iudgement,<note place="margin">Eccles. 11.9. Tit. 2.12.</note> in thy sorrowes mercy, &amp; in thy life religion. For if God be not with thee to direct thee that thou stray not, to correct thee that thou swell not, to preserue thee that thou famish not, to pardon thee that thou despaire not, to curb thee that thou stumble not, to strengthen thee that thou fall not, to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie thee that thou sinne not, and to glorifie thee that thou perish not:<note place="margin">Psal. 145.14. Psal. 19.12.</note> so many be the errors of thy life as thou canst not heale them, and so safe is thine iniquitie sealed vp, as thou canst not chuse but haue change of sorrowes.</p>
   <p>I haue therefore presumed in a Christian loue of thy soule, if not to cure thy iealosie of the world, yet to prescribe thee Physicke to crucifie thy selfe. It is a field sowne by the hand of another, though some fell not vnfruitfully I hope into my ground; and albeit many yeeres haue now ouergrowne my papers since I first plowed it, and that the seeds-man himselfe sleepeth in the earth, yet somewhat to awake the memory of the righteous, and to quicken and giue heart to the desires of the religious, I haue shot some few arrowes that I had of his, which if thou peruse with diligence, and lay vp with consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thou shalt find of greater force then the shafts of <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than;</hi> since these forewarne thee of the fury not of <hi>Saul,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Sam. 20.21.</note> but of Satan, who reioyceth more in thy damnation then he sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth for his owne. So hoping thou wilt either looke vpon me in loue, or lay me aside without shame, I commit thee to God, who giue thee and forgiue thee much.</p>
