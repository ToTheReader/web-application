What shall I say more?
For this Epistle would
be ouer long, if I should
speake of our Sauiour

         </gap>2. &amp; 19 28 &amp; 21. 28.</note> as the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
oppositions and
combats, which hee
had with the Iewish
Priests do shew; or of
his Apostles, who (as
<hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe)
fought with men,
<pb facs="5"/>
as mad and furious as
any wilde beastes.</p>
   <p>Wherefore to omit
other testimonies and
examples that might be
alledged for proofe of
this point, let vs only
insist a little vpon that
example, which is set
before vs in this present
text of Scripture, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we haue (as it were)
a Monomachie, or sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
combat betwixt the
Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> and
<hi>Saul</hi> a King, whom hee
himselfe (by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of God)
had anoynted.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
Now, whereas vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
and euill
men are of two sorts,
some fierce and cruell,
as Dogs &amp; Lyons, that
will turne again, &amp; rent
such as reproue them,
as the Sodomites,<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 9.</note> and
<hi>Ieroboam:</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Kin. 13. 4.</note> others, subtill
and crafty, as Serpents
and Foxes, full of shifts
and faire pretences. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>
in this place, hath
to deale with the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For hee hath to
deale with <hi>Saul,</hi> who
hauing (for the time)
layd aside his Lyon-like
disposition, wherewith
<pb facs="6"/>
hee rored against his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
son <hi>Ionathan,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Sam. 20. 30, 31▪</note> doth
now fall (like his father,
the first <hi>Adam</hi>) to sly and
shameles shifting,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> with
<hi>Samuel</hi> the faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of God.</p>
   <p>For first of all (put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on a brow of
brasse,<note place="margin">Vers. 13. 10. 12.</note> and a fore-head
of iron) hee telleth <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>
by way of preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and against the
light of his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,<note place="margin">Vers. 15.</note>
that he had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
being put from
that starting hole, and
<pb facs="7"/>
plainely conuinced of
a flat vntruth, hee shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it off from himselfe
to the people; whom
yet hee iustfieth, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their end and
good intent, which was
(as he saith) to do sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to the Lord their
God.<note place="margin">Vers. 20. 21.</note> Thirdly, being
further conuinced of
his sin, and the root of
it (that is, greedy aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice)
being layd open,
hee hardneth his heart
yet more, and with an
impudent face doth iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie,
both himselfe and
the people, as thinking
<pb facs="7"/>
it great pity, to kill such
a goodly Prince as <hi>Agag</hi>
was, and to spoyle and
cast away such fat cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and make them a
prey for the fowles and
wilde beasts, which
might serue for better
purposes; thus secretly
taxing the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord, of
too much rigor and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity,
&amp; making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
more wise &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
then God.<note place="margin">Vers. 24. 25.</note> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
being driuen from
this hold, and so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
conuinced, that
he could not deny it to
<pb facs="8"/>
be a sin; yet he seeketh
to extenuate and excuse
it, as a sin of infirmity,
which hee committed
not in contempt of
God;<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 32.</note> but for feare of
the people, which thing
also mooued <hi>Aaron</hi> to
make the molten Calfe.<note place="margin">Verse 30.</note>
Lastly, being brought
by maine force, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that his sin
could not bee cloked,
nor excused, hee doth
not goe about to seeke
reconciliation, &amp; make
his peace with God; but
all his care is, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his honor, and to
<pb facs="8"/>
keep his credit with the
people.</p>
   <p>To conclude, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
in this Treatise
two things: whereof
the first is the matter &amp;
subject thereof; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
the speech and
manner of handling. In
regard of the former,
it may bee called, The
vncasing, or discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of an Hypocrite:
In regard of the latter,
it may be called (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the phrase of
the Apostle.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 13</note>) A true
type and patterne of
wholsome speeches or
<pb facs="9"/>
words. The first is a fit
subiect for euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Minister of Gods
holy Word, to labour
often in: and the other,
a liuely example of <hi>diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Word of God a
right,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 15</note> opening and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of it with that
wisdome, plainnesse,
simplicity, and power,
which will preuaile
more with those that
truely feare God, then
all the painted elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of human wisdom,
that the wit of man can
possibly shew. To such,
<pb facs="9"/>
I commend the reading
and hearing of these
godly Sermons, besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
God to adde his
gracious blessing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
euen for Christ
Iesus sake, In whom I
rest,</p>
