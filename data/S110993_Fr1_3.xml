   <head>¶ Iohn Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine to the ministers of the churches in the countie of Newecastel.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F anye man maruell, my dere brethren and companions in the worcke of the Lorde, that I wyll occupie my selfe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vnto a boke whyche is vnworthy to be spokē of, or to be made mencion of, seinge that I maye oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupye my selfe, as men thincke, in beter thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and thynges of more frute, it shalbe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiente excuse for me to alledge that I haue done it at the request and instaunce of manye good fayethful men, wyth sente the boke to me from far countries, which testimonie that it was verye nedefull for the helth of many soules, that I shoulde take it in hand. For I thincke verelye that this should be sufficient to contente them that be resonable, that my intente was to obtayne as well to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes as to the desires of them whiche I knewe to be zelous for the glory of God and the edification of his people. But yet haue I an other answere for to excuse me by, to them which may thinke that it is foly in me, to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie my selfe in a thyng so barren and trife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge, as is thys little boke, which apereth to be made by ignoraunte people: which is, that we haue no greater priuyledge than had the prophetes of God, and that oure payne is no
<pb facs="3"/> more preciouse, than was theirs. Nowe we se that Ezechiel was constrayned to speake and write not only agaynst disceiuers which were ignoraunte and of no reputacion, but also agaynste women which woulde be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetesses. Seynge the prophet spared not to dispute agaynste women, ye and that it was commaunded hym by God so to do, because thorow their leasynges they led the people to supersticiō and erroure, and letted the veritie of his course: it should be a presūption to vs, not to wytsafe to do the lyke. It is trewe that thys boke, whiche I am desired and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to confute, hath no nede of resolution towardes them that haue learnynge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandynge: for as muche as of it selfe it is sufficientelye reproued, in that it is so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learnedly &amp; folishly written. But for as much as it hath a certayne coloure to abuse and cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cumuente the simple, which haue not the iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gemente to discerne: oure dutye is to helpe them, and aduertise thē of the malicious sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telties of sathan, to the intente that they be not thorow imprudence disceiued: we are det<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tours to one and other sayeth sanicte Paule. Therefore we muste do seruice vnto all as muche as in vs is, specially whan necessitye requireth it. I protest therfore, that myne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencion is onlye in shorte or fewe wordes, to shewe vnto all fayethfull christen men which be rude and vnlerned, what and how daūge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a poyson thys doctrine of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes is: and also arme them by the word of God agaynste the same, to the ende that
<pb facs="3"/> they be not disceyued or if ther be any, which all redy be wrapped in their snares, that they may be brought agayne vnto the ryght way. Wherefore I beseche all them whiche desire to continew in the pure knowledge of Iesus Christe, and in the obedience of his Gospel, to take paynes to rede attentiuely thys little boke, euen as I haue dedicated it vnto them: and also take the paynes well to peyse the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonnes whiche I do alledge vnto them: that they maye abyde in the trueth whan it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto them. Therefore reason whyche moued me to dedicate this presēt treatise vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to you, is double. Fyrste, bycause it shoulde be a publyke testimonie of the coniunction whiche I haue and desier alwayes to haue wyth you: and that al menne myghte knowe howe we are vnited as wel in doctrine as in affection of herte. The seconde is, to the ende that the redynge thereof myghte be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter commended and receyued of all them ouer whom you haue charge to bere the worde of Iesus Christe: in suche sorte that the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ouer whych the prynce of pastours hath made your ministers, maye be intertayned in pure doctrine, and preserued from al peruerse opinions, contrarying the truth of the gospel It is true, that you myght right well (my dere brethren) haue discharged me of thys payne. And also, alredye oure brother. M. Wyllyam Farell, accordynge vnto the grace whyche God hathe geuē him, and the exersies whiche he hath of longe tyme had, and continual cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stume in fyghtyng astaynste the ennemyes of
<pb facs="4"/> the trueth, and resistynge all false doctrines for to mayntayne Christes kyngedome, hath well satisfied you in parte, in that thynge whyche you nowe require of me. As I haue sene by the actes of a disputatiō done in the good towne. In such sorte that of those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles whyche are there treated, no man can desyre a more suffitiente declaration, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy hys conscience, then is ther geuen. But bycause they vnto whome I desyre and am bound to do seruice, do make me beleue that it is necessarie that I take thys charge vpon me, I wyll consent vnto theyr request, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out makynge any longer excuses. The Lord Iesus Christe haue you alwayes in hys ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye protection, and hys churches whiche he hathe committed vnto you: and leade you by hys holye spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite alwayes: for to serue hym with youre ministerye vnto hys honoure and vnto the healthe of hys pore people. Amen.</p>
