To whom may this <hi>Discourse</hi> of <hi>Valour</hi> be more lawfully dedicated, then to your Maiestie? Kings and People giue Her place. They all with one consent doe giue Her this advantage without enuie, knowing that Shee hath well deserued it. It was dedicated to your Maiestie eleven yeares since; since which time, there hath not one yeare passed, but I haue giuen your Maiestie some thing, and you haue not giuen me any thing. This disproportion did put me backe: your Maiestie hauing done me the honour to say often, That I was one of the olde seruants of her house, and an honest man. At this second Edition I would addresse it to
