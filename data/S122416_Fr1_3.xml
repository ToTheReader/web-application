   <head>THE TRANSLATOVR
to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HERAS (gentle Reader) in the
yeare of our Lord God 1607. there
being published, both in English &amp;
Latin, a Booke, intituled <hi>Triplici no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
triplex cuneus,</hi> or, <hi>An Apology for
the Oath of Allegiance,</hi> and this
without Name of Authour: the
same was answered very briefely &amp; modestly in both
languages by the Catholicke party the next yeare fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
And first in English, by an English-man,
who also concealed his Name: and then in latin by
<hi>Card. Bellarmine,</hi> vnder the Name of <hi>Matthaeus Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi>
Who not suspecting the said Booke to be his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
of Great Britany, (as indeed it was) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of some of his Ministers about him, thought it not
fit to publish this his answere in his owne, but in the
name of the foresaid <hi>Matthaeus Tortus.</hi> But when in
the yeare 1609. his Maiesty (hauing now seene these
answers to his booke come forth) resolued to publish
anew his said Apology, with a large Preface or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
<hi>To all Christian Princes &amp;c.</hi> he therwithall
forthwith gaue commandement to two of the best
learned (as is thought) in his Realme, that they should
separately make Answer to both the fornamed Books,
<pb facs="4"/>
written against his foresaid Apology, which presently
they did. And that in English he committed to <hi>M.
Doctor Barlow,</hi> who made Answere therto, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
it the same yeare 1609. but how substantially
he hath performed the same, may perhaps be shortly
examined. The other in latin of the forsaid <hi>Matthaeus
Tortus,</hi> he recommended to <hi>M. Doctor Andrewes,</hi> a
man of great esteeme and litterature in our Countrey,
who the same yeare in like manner, set forth an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
therto, intituling it <hi>Tortura Torti:</hi> which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
of his comming forth in latin, <hi>F. Martinus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi>
of the Society of Iesus, and Professour in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity,
hath, though briefely, yet substantially,
confuted, this present yeare 1610. And for that
the said Fathers Booke is very short, &amp; written in
latin, I haue bestowed a few houres to translate
the same into our English tongue, for such, as eyther
vnderstand not the latin, or els haue not had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
to come by any of the said Copyes of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
edition, published in that language.</p>
