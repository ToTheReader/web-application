   <head>THE PREFACE OF the Treatise of Humilitie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He fathers of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, are frequent in obseruing vpon the ancientes both of Greece and Rome, that many of them did excell in most of the morall vertues, for which they were much rewarded with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall blessings by the open hand of almightie God; but that the vertue of humilitie, was soe farre from being possessed and
<pb facs="3"/>
practised by any of them, as that they had not soe much as any apprehention, nor did they fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me any conceite at all thereof, and therefore hath not this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, any name at all in either of those ancient, and learned ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues.</p>
   <p>That which the fathers said of those Gentiles, we their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may in some sorte affirme of theis Protestants, for as much as may concerne the vertue of humilitie. For how soeuer they are acquainted with the name, yea and with the nature of it too, by speculation of what is said by vs, touching that subiect yet in order to practise and life,
<pb facs="3"/>
the two Poles are not more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from one another, then they are from this vertue. For noe man either euer had, or can euer haue humility of will, till first he haue humilitie of the <hi>vnderstandinge,</hi> and no creature can euer deuide himselfe from the Communiō of the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church, vpon presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that he knowes more of God almighties minde then it, but that this man must be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely proud. So that the very in trinsique forme of heresy, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly pride, as on the other side, a man cannot possibly be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke, but with all, he must infallibly be humble, for as
<pb facs="4"/>
much, at least, as may concerne the vnderstanding part of his minde. Because the very condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being à Catholicke, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes thus much, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer naturall repugnances he may chance to finde, in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this or that, he yet giues himselfe wholly into the hands of the Church, and is ready ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to loose a thousand liues, then to credit his owne reason, against her rules.</p>
   <p>But yet Good Catholickes stay not heere, as if they were content to doe God homage by their vnderstanding alone; but they seeke alsoe to range and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their will to the loue and
<pb facs="4"/>
practise of this vertue. And espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this is endeauoured, by such amongst vs, as enioy both the name, and nature of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men. Who as they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the great honour of being drawne neerer to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Majestie then the rest, so God forbid but they should make it their busines, to corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with that infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and greatenes, which can neuer be better done, then by acknowledging their owne ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senes &amp; weakenes.</p>
   <p>Of this I present you heere with a most liuely example. For this Treatise of humilitie, is not soe properly a booke, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="5"/>
vpon that vertue, as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, and aspirations, and instructiōs of a Religious man, who was breaking and bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Nouices committed to his charge, towards the contēpt of the world and the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them selues, by the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our lord Iesus in that diuine vertue, which himselfe in person came to plant. Now this you shall finde, not to haue bene done after a kinde of Protestant cutt; whoe (when they take vpon them to speake to men of God, and good things) consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me their howers in generallities; scratching onely such eares as itch, and not passing (as a man
<pb facs="5"/>
may say,) beyond the very first skinne of the soule. And if any man esteeme me to doe them wronge heerin lett them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front me by shewing such a Protestant booke as this. I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne not that they should shew me such a booke of humilitie, for ought I euer heard, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue neuer written booke of that vertue; but let them shew me any such booke of any vertue, where the difinitiō of the thing in question, is so cleere, where the diuision is soe exact, where the degrees are soe distinct, where the authorities are soe choice, where the examples are so proper, where the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="6"/>
&amp; motiues are so conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and, aboue all, where the addresse &amp; exercise, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, and examination, and refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is so particular, so sweete, and so stronge, and where the way is made soe easy, and smooth, for the arriuing to the most laborious iourneys end for flesh and blood, which is to be found in the whole world.</p>
   <p>It is highly glorious to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, and it helpes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re and more to Canonise the holy Catholicke Church, when men see that shee hath Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who are so serious, so stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and soe vigorous, as that when they are shutt vp hand to
<pb facs="6"/>
hand with God, and without any other witnesses, then bare walls, they are acquiring the highest humane perfection for themselues, and imparting it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soe to one another, vpon the price of whatsoeuer flesh and blood holdes deere. And for my part I shall be of the Duke of Arcos minde, whoe wondring (in those first beginnings of the Societie) how it was able to produce such rare men (whilst yet he vsed to meete them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out those exteriour mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and austerities either of habit or dyet, wherein other holy orders excell,) grew able afterward to make a good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
<pb facs="7"/>
to his owne questiō, when he once came to see and weigh both theis works of F. Alfonso Rodriguez, and many others, and by meanes thereof, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how they are wont to breede themselues within doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and by the vse of continuall prayer, and the solid and sincere practise of the most heroicall vertues, to make themselues, by the fauour of heauen, to beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me as soe many vnshakē towers or rocks, against the proud wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of the whole world, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer there growes to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, of the greatest glory of God, and the Good of man.</p>
   <p>And this is most true, but yet
<pb facs="7"/>
it is not all that truth which we must fetch from thence. But it imports vs alsoe to consider, that as Religious men are most obliged to procure Christian perfectiō in the highest degree, and particularly this vertue of humilitie, in regard of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse vocation, and of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary helpes and meanes which they haue beyond secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar people, yet noe man who calls himselfe Christian must hold himselfe exempt from the necessitie of attending to that vertue, which Christ our lord himselfe came to teach, and the possession whereof will carry and conduct men vp to heauen,
<pb facs="8"/>
as the want thereof, did preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate those rebellious Angells downe to hell; But there is a world of other motiues besides this of punishments &amp; rewards which the discourse ensueing will declare.</p>
