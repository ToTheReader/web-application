      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Auid that notable king and excellēt Prophet, feeling in the course of this life, the comfort and direction of the eternall word of almightie God, professeth openly in that his Octonary Psalme these wordes.<note place="margin">Psal. 119. Nun.</note>
      <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerna pedibus meis verbum tuum (O Domine) &amp; lumen semitis meis.</hi> Thy word (O Lord) is a lanterne to my feete, and a light vnto my pathes. Dauid well perceiuyng the corruptiō of his nature, the blindnes of his vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, could not but acknowledge in that his long meditation, the necessitie that he espied in the Scripture of God, for where he sawe his wyt to weake to comprise the meruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous workes of God aswell in his creation, as in his redemption, (which he saw in spirit before,) could not well atteyne the life that he most ioyed in, in this trāsitory world, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his vnderstandyng should be illighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and his whole state of life truely gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the lanterne and light of Gods word. He was no phantasticall reader of his word, he ioyed not rather to be a student or a tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, then a worker, but effectually framed all his senses to sauour and knowe the will of God, and to folow the same. His spirit was altogither set to vertue, which entent who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<pb facs="4"/>
doth not folow,<note place="margin">Iames. 1.</note> he doth as a man by the testimony of S. Iames, which delighteth to behold his naturall countenaunce in the glasse, and is not carefull so to impresse the same in his remembraunce, thereby to wype away the spottes of his face: for whosoeuer doth not thus earnestly tary in the lawe of perfect libertie,<note place="margin">Iames. 1.</note> he deceiueth him self, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in vanitie. For it is he onely that is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in his act that doth persist in his law, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the vnderstandyng therof to heale his owne infirmities, and to be able to be a light vnto others, as we haue great cause to thāke the goodnes of almighty God, for deuising of such a rule of Scripture to be lead by, and as we be bounde to magnifie almighty God by his holy spirit to rayse vp such his welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued seruaūtes to call vpon vs, and to bryng vs to the knowledge of hym selfe, whereby we might be thākefull: so is the daūger very great to all such as couer this his light vnder a bushell, that deteyne this precious iewell vnder vnrighteousnesse of life. The worlde was neuer more full of the certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, then it is at this day, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God was neuer more dishonoured then he is at this day, by many that professe by theyr knowledge to be leaders to the blind, instructours of the ignoraunt, hauyng the fourme of right vnderstandyng by the law of God.</p>
   <p>Why therfore doest thou sayth S. Paule:
<pb n="3" facs="4"/>
Teach other and teachest not thy selfe, and so blasphemest the worde of almighty God before them that know not the power ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whose condemnation (if they repent not) shalbe the greater. We haue much delight now a dayes to know many thynges, but litle lust we haue to lyue after our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it is not he that heareth the worde of God that shall be partaker of Christes bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, but he that doth the word, not he that hath right vnderstandyng of his will, but he that is earnestly giuen to expresse his will in his secret thought betwixt God and hym selfe, in his wordes and deedes of lyfe to the institution and example of others. It shal not be asked at that dreadful day when we shall come to make our aunswere to almighty God, how much we haue learned, how oft we haue read, how much we do know, but how well we haue liued, what workes we haue expressed to testifie with vs of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde regeneration, of our inwarde fayth, that he might be thereby glorified. And for this intent that we should be instructed in our true dueties to god and our neighbour, amōgest many workes &amp; bookes to teach vs the same, none is more apt then this booke of Salomon which we haue in hand none is more fit then this, which setteth out the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of our corrupt affections, no author more liuely, no writer is more apt to teach all maner of persons, aswell publike as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
<pb facs="5"/>
to rule thēselue a right in this misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vale of our corruptible lyfe, thē is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this doctrine cōteined in this booke. For whosoeuer will endeuour hym selfe to apply his wyt and his vnderstandyng to the counsell of this worke, shall soone perceyue the corruption of this world, and the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their owne nature, and in all his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayles what soeuer state of lyfe hee leades shall see by this lanterne, how to step forth frōm fayth to fayth, frō vertue to vertue, frō charitie to charitie, &amp; in cōclusion shal finde all thynges mere vayne and vanitie, nothing permanent, nothyng durable, nothyng allowable, but the knowledge of almighty God, and the feare of his holy name: to whom be all honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye for euermore.</p>
