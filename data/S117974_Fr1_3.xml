      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, the Lord forbad our first Parents to eate of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and euill with denunciation of an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting curse vpon their disobedience. Againe, the same Lord commandeth vs to eate of the Tree of good, and euill, as a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to an euerlasting and perfect remedy: For as the eating thereof was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all euill, so the eating thereof is the beginning of all good. For as the desire of the knowledge of good and euill brought ignorance, and death, euen so the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and euill maketh wise vnto life. But heerein wee shew out of what root wee are growne, and out of what rocke wee are hewne, namely, to be alwaies against the Lord. For as our first parents being forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to eate of that one Tree, did first of all eate of that Tree; so wee being commanded
<pb facs="6"/> to eate of this one Tree of the Garden with promise of blessing, had rather eate of any other Tree of the Forrest, though the fruits thereof be present death: which obseruation of our froward hearts caused the Heathen Poet to say,
<q>Nitimur in vetitum semper, cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musque negata.</q> Englished thus:
<q>
         <l>To things forbidden wee chiefly doe aspire.</l>
         <l>And things denyed wee most of all desire.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Now seeing that the onely good and wise God hath turned this curse into a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that both the knowledge of our sinne and misery, and also of perfect holinesse and righteousnesse should come by the Law, that so working guilt of sinne, feare of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and vtter despaire of life in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, wee might bee inforced to flie to Christ for succour and reliefe in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed estate, and that being in Christ, the sting of death which is sin, and the strength of sinne which is the rigour of the Law îs abolished, and is become the rule of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb facs="6"/> life, and a Tree of life to them that eate thereof; seeing I say, it is thus, let vs desire to eate of this Tree, for the fruites thereof are not grieuous; yea, they are pleasant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, and more sweet then hony and the hony combe, to the sanctified taste, reuiuing, and quickning the soule to eternall life.</p>
   <p>For these causes did the Lord so strictly charge the Israelites to exercise themselues in his Lawes continually: And that they might haue them in perfect remembrance aboue all things, hee commandeth them to rehearse them continually to their children, to write them vpon the posts of their houses, and vpon their gates, <hi>Deut. 11. 18. 19.</hi> and to weare fringes couered with a riband of blew silke on the borders of their garments for the same end, <hi>Numb. 18. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>9.</hi> that in all things, in all places, and at all times, they might, as an holy and peculiar people do the will of God, and not their owne lusts as the Gentiles do, <hi>Deut. 26. 17. 18. 19.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now although these, and such like cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies be abolished, yet the Law is euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, and giueth no more liberty of sinning to vs, then vnto them; yea hauing receiued
<pb facs="7"/> greater measure of the Spirit of Adoption, wee should more ioyfully and cheerefully performe all obedience, then they that had but the spirit of bondage, <hi>viz.</hi> who like children were held in awe with temporall threatnings, and sharper outward punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Let vs therefore which haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the promises (which they saw a farre of) freely without constraint, ingenuously and willingly as adopted sons reade, heare, talke, and meditate in the Law continually, and in steed of Iewish fringes, ribands, and Phylacteries, fitter for children then men of perfect age, let vs carry the Law ingrauen in the fleshy tables of our hearts.</p>
   <p>And because the Law maketh but shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low impression in our stony hearts, and is therefore quickly defaced, and worne out with the rust of corruption, wee haue need of daily meanes to cleanse, purge, and correct those furring vessels, and so much the more because wee haue also corrupters and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters without vs and about vs, the world and the deuill that old deceitfull cauiller withdrawing and mis-leading vs in euery action and thought of the mind, from the
<pb facs="7"/> will of God to their owne lusts.</p>
   <p>Now for thy more distinct knowledge, and more spirituall and true vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Law, for thy better direction in all matters, and for thy furtherance in godlinesse and vertue in these latter euill daies, wherein that wicked one, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 14. so wonderfully hardneth the hearts of most men, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. I haue drawne an Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Commandements, in such a forme and order, with such breuity and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and with so many &amp; manifest proofes, as that any man, learned or vnlearned, may reape great benefite thereby.</p>
   <p>And seeing that it is easie for the price, waighty for the matter, and light for the carriage, either in pocket, or in thy bosome, or in thy handes: thinke it I pray thee no more trouble to thee then Fringes and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 5. were to the Iewes, then Crosses and Crucifixes to the Papists, who think hereby to scarre away deuils, whereas indeed the deuils know where to take vp their Iunes and Lodgings by these whorish tokens &amp; markes. Contrarily, here thou hast God speaking plainely to thee, and louingly
<pb facs="8"/> instructing thee, and informing thee as a father doth his sonne. Thou hast heere a powerfull weapon, euen the voyce of God, to scarre away deuils, and to reproue the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in all their vniust dealings: Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer men say, iudge, or do, and howsoeuer the world swaggeth and reeleth, as the spirit of the aire that worketh in the children of disobedience hales it from iniquity to iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Heere thou hast a firme Foundation and vnmoueable Rocke; cleaue to this Rocke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, and build therevpon without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering, so shalt thou abide for euer, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 17. when others with their wisedomes shall come to naught, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. and with their vnfruitfull workes of darkenesse shall perish euerlastingly: For they that haue done good, as the Law of God informeth them, shall go into life euerlasting, and they that haue done euill shall go into euerlasting fire.</p>
