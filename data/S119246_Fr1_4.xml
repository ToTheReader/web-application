   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T first I toke this worke of Maister Huloets in hande (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)</hi> onelye to enlarge, and when I had herein passed some paineful time, I perceyued it almost a more easye matter to make new, then to amende: for there were many such woordes, as eyther serued not for the matter, or were out of vse. Yet sith I had taken so much pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therein, and brought therto welnighe then a Thousand words and Phrases, I thought not so to lease my labour &amp; forsake the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, but once againe toke penne in hande, and such woordes as were not sufficient (by consent of authoritye) I eyther displaced, and put farre bettter in their roumes, or if they were doubtfull, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by sclender authority, or els serued the place but not so fitlye, I gaue them an Asteriske or note in this maner * and in some places if I had better, &amp; yet thought those would stande, I gaue the same note * and set such woordes or Phrases as I founde after it. I haue also where myne Author wrote the Englishe and not the Latin, filde those places: so where it was farre out of order, and ill to finde, there haue I not without great paine brought it in, &amp; put too many names of things, yea and somtime their natures, cyting the booke or Chapter wher I red them &amp; adding therto the <hi>Frenche.</hi> And for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> better attayning to the knowledge of words, I went not to the cōmon Dictionaries only, but also to the Authors themselues, and vsed the rein conference with them which wrote particularly of suche things, as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> place requyred. As in herbes I followed the iudgemēt of Master <hi>Turner, Dodoneus, Pineus, Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi> and sometime <hi>Plinius</hi>: In beastes, fishes and foules, <hi>Conradus Gesnerus</hi>: In instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of warre <hi>Vegetius</hi>: In buildinge <hi>Vitruuius:</hi> generallye <hi>Hadrianus Iunius</hi>: In names of places <hi>Ptolomeus:</hi> In the nature of wordes <hi>Valla</hi> &amp; others: In Phrases <hi>Thierre</hi> out of which I confesse I haue taken a great part of this Booke, notinge the Phrases wyth <hi>S.</hi> after the Frenche, for that <hi>Stephanus</hi> was the first Author thereof: and finallye I wrate not in the whole Booke one quyre, without perusinge and conference of many Authors. Therefore wher you finde in the Booke any of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> first letters, of the names aboue, or the like: that same standeth for a note of the Authors name, where I founde suche Phrase, Frenche, name, or word as is there placed. And if any shall doubt hereof, let him but conferre <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loet</hi> and this together, and peraduenture in one letters lookinge ouer he shal finde so muche added, as shall seeme more painful to him in accompte, then I deemed the laboure in doinge it. I fought be taken away, be sure it was done, not withoute some conference with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> beste Authors: the same shal you finde obserued in the additions, whiche thinge those that canne iudge better, and vse lesse reprehension shal sooner finde, then those that vse more, wyth lesse and weaker iudgemente. And thoughe the booke needes no explication, sithe it is farre more easye, as wel for the Phrase, as also for the order then it was before, yet for the better vnderstanding thereof, obserue this followinge. Where you finde a verbe withoute this signe <hi>To,</hi> before him (which is oure Englishe note of the infinitiue mode of al Verbes, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Passiues) you may adde the signe thereto, as in this Verbe <hi>Laye,</hi> where is <hi>Laye blame, Laye to ones charge, Laye in waite,</hi> which are in their places so easye for him to vnderstande that knowes a Verbe from a Nowne, that they neede no exposition: and signifye, <hi>To laye blame, To lay to ones charge, To laye in wayte.</hi> Yet haue I in many places added this signe <hi>To</hi> before them, as in <hi>Leade,</hi> thus: ¶ <hi>To leade one to &amp;c.</hi> For where I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Phrase with the word wherin it is, and keepe the order of letter stil in the first front, there begin I the line with such a Paragraphe, ¶: As in <hi>Lye</hi> thus, ¶ <hi>To tell a lye, ¶ To forge a lye, ¶ To maintaine a lye, ¶ To take one in a lye, ¶ To imagine a lye,</hi> and likewise in others. And where euer you finde the Paragraphe, that same is all by mee added y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth it. Wherefore gentle Reader accepte my paynes, as thou wouldest others shoulde (in like case) accepte thine, whiche if I perceyue, assure thy selfe (or it be longe) to receyue other fruites of my labour that shall profit thee more.</p>
   <closer>Farewell gentle Reader.</closer>
