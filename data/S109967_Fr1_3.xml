people) were <hi>Pharisies, Saduces, Esseis,</hi>
and <hi>Gaulenists:</hi> beside the false worship
of <hi>Turkes, Affricans, Tartars, Persians, Cataians,</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi>
Among <hi>Christians,</hi> there are <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants.</hi> The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
which call themselues <hi>Catholiques,</hi> haue diuided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
into <hi>Dominicans, Franciscans, Iesuits, Seminaries, Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
Scotists, Tomists, Occamists, &amp;c.</hi> Among <hi>Protestants,</hi>
haue sprung vp, <hi>Anabaptists, Familists,</hi> and <hi>Brownists.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>As in <hi>Diuine,</hi> so in <hi>Humane Sciences</hi> speculatiue, grounded
only vpon probable coniectures, there haue risen also among
the Professors thereof, diuers and contrary opinions, &amp; Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.
Among the <hi>Phylosophers,</hi> were <hi>Stoicks, Peripaticks,
Platonists, Cinnicks,</hi> and <hi>Epicures.</hi> Among <hi>Physitians,</hi> there are
<hi>Empericks, Dogmaticks, Methodici,</hi> or <hi>Abbreuiators,</hi> and <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsians.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The more part of these, plunged in humane error, &amp; mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by carnal respects, as singularitie, enuie, pride and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hath dissented from others of sound and vpright iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But some of these ayming at perfection, and hauing
the aduantage of succession and other helpes, haue by <hi>Tyme</hi>
procreated a plaine and naked truth. For this latter Age of
the world, abounding in all maner of Learning, &amp; with men
of mature and pregnant wits, haue greatly inlarged, illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="5"/>
and refined all Artes and Sciences.</p>
   <p>If Therfore <hi>Endymions</hi> diligence, which first found out the
course of the Moone: If <hi>Amphions</hi> Musical brayne, which
first conceiued Harmonie: If <hi>Appolonius Memphites,</hi> whose
industrie first described the Anatomie of mans body: If <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
which first discerned the vertue of Hearbes, and taught
<hi>Aesculapius</hi> Physicke: If <hi>Hermes Trismegistus,</hi> the first that
reached &amp; attained the <hi>Aethereal</hi> and <hi>Quintessentiall Physick:</hi>
If <hi>(I</hi> say) these, and many others, in their rare inuentions,
haue deserued singular commendation: then <hi>Hypocrates, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
Discorides, Ʋalerius Cordus, Paracelsus,</hi> learned <hi>Quersita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
&amp; others moe, which haue added any thing to the enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and perfecting of that noble Science of <hi>Physicke,</hi> are
to be imbraced and honoured, albeit they agree not together
in opinion for that they all by their labours haue sought the
good of mankinde.<note place="margin">Eccle. 38.</note>
      <hi>Honour therefore the Physitian (saith</hi> Iesus
Syrach) <hi>for the Lord hath created him, and giuen men knowledge,
that he might be glorified in his wonderous workes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But some Readers of their works, not carrying this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
like <hi>Midas,</hi> preferre <hi>Pan</hi> before <hi>Appollo,</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Chymicall Physicke, Halchymie, and the Spagericke
Art, as too curious, dangerous, and desperate to bee dealt
withall. Alleaging also (which is too true) that many <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymists</hi>
are notable Sophysticators and deceiuers.</p>
   <p>The meaning of some, by these and such like preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
is nothing else, but like bad and vnskilfull <hi>Herborists,</hi>
to sowe <hi>Rocket,</hi> and to weede <hi>Endiue.</hi> Yet let such car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
know, that the abuse of Art doth not abrogate the right
vse thereof. For as if the tree be blasted that blossomes, the
fault is in the winde, &amp; not in the roote: so the fault is not to
be ascribed to Arte, which is not in Arte, but the Artificer
which is vnworthy the name. And in very deed, it were to be
wished, for common vtillities sake, that all such cozoners and
deceiuers, might be banished out of Cittie and Countrey, and
from all societie of honest men, which without lawfull allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
take vpon them such professing and practise: or at the
least, that they might be restrayned, that through their leaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that art be not disgraced, which the ancients did not let to
<pb facs="5"/>
call <hi>Holy.</hi> And for my part, I doubt not, but that one <hi>Aomus</hi>
or other, wil recompence me with Balme, and say that I am
out of my element, in that I being a professed Diuine, should
take vpon me to meddle with Physicke, &amp; to publish that in
the vulgar tongue, which was more fit to be in the Latine, as
I found it.</p>
   <p>To this I answer, that a generalitie in humane learning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemeth
a Diuine: and of all Sciences none more sutable to
profession than Physick, as I could easily proue by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
And therfore the wisedom of Christ appointed the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
wrought by himself &amp; his Apostles, to consist chiefly
in healing corporal infirmities. S. <hi>Luke</hi> was both a professed
Physitian, &amp; an Euangelist. It cannot be but a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
labour, &amp; a charitable worke in whomsoeuer, to seeke by
good means to preserue life,<note place="margin">Luke 14. verse 5.</note> be it but of thy neighbors Oxe,
or Asse: This my labor <hi>I</hi> am sure is wel intended, hosoeuer
cōstrued. But a wand thrust neuer so right into the water, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
crooked or broken: euen so a bad heart misconceiueth
good actions. As concerning the publishing of this in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
I haue these Inducements. First, the common good of all
men. For euen the ignorant shall learne hereby, to haue in
high reputation (as is fitting) that which before they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not, &amp; so wil the more readily in time of need haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the learned Physitian. Moreouer, if the knowledge
of holy writ be conuenient for al sorts of men, as the Physick
proper for the soule, why should not natural <hi>Phylosophy,</hi> and
Physick speculatiue, be common likewise to al for the health
of the body?<note place="margin">Num. 11. 29.</note> Therfore herein, I say as <hi>Moses</hi> said: <hi>Enuiest thou
for me? I would al the Lords people were Prophets.</hi> So <hi>I</hi> wish, that
all which are capable, had the true speculatiue knowledge of
Physick. Then should <hi>Physick</hi> and <hi>Phylosophy,</hi> not only haue
a more great and general esteeme, but also euery meane Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecarie,
the Physitians left hand, should wel vnderstand how
to Elixerate, which is greatly to be wished.</p>
   <p>As for the time which <hi>I</hi> haue spent herein, it is my gaine:
happily extracted from idle time, whereas otherwise for my
recreation, <hi>I</hi> might vnhappily haue done nothing: and yet
haue not neglected my pastorall function.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
If therefore (courteous Reader) by this my painfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
thou mayest procure to thy selfe, but one scruple of
knowledge more than before thou haddest, and in time of
neede, one dramme of health, it is that which I seeke,
wishing thee thy full contentment in all the gifts
and graces of God, to thy further profite,
and to Gods glorie: to whose
protection, I now
leaue thee.</p>
