   <head>Vnto his worthy Friend, and industrious Artist, Master IOHN BABINGTON.</head>
   <l>VVHen as <hi>I</hi> did thy Booke by chance espie,</l>
   <l>With divers figures grac't, most curiously</l>
   <l>Contriu'd, all new, and of thine own invention,</l>
   <l>With sundry Engines made by iust proportion:</l>
   <l>I did admire thy skill, thy active braine,</l>
   <l>Whereby those things thou didst so well attaine:</l>
   <l>Justly I might, for of no Nation yet,</l>
   <l>There's any hath this path so fully beat;</l>
   <l>Nor laid those grounds that thou hast done, whereby</l>
   <l>We might attaine to things that tend so high.</l>
   <l>For sencelesse things with life thou seem'st to fill,</l>
   <l>Making them wondred at by common skill.</l>
   <l>Thou sundry doubts unfold'st, and with much ease,</l>
   <l>Thou teachest us to measure Land and Seas.</l>
   <l>When as I thought on these, and knew how rare</l>
   <l>Men thus addicted, and thus given were,</l>
   <l>My mind, my hand, my hand did force my pen,</l>
   <l>T' offer my mite of thankes 'mongst other men.</l>
   <l>Accept it then, and let it no lesse bee</l>
   <l>Pleasing, then greater gifts are unto thee.</l>
