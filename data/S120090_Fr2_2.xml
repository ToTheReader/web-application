   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, be pleased to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand; First, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biemes, darke questions, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, is no new deuise, but very ancient, and of great continuance. Secondly, it is likewise of great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> vse, for it serueth to try the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of mens wits, and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; also to exercise and to whet them; also it puts by much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd brawling and dangerous talke: and giues occasion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wholesome, wise and graue sayings. Thirdly, praises and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> rewards haue been appointed


<pb facs="71"/>
and giuen, to such as could loose such knots, and frame fitting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers. Lastly, not alone humane and prophane, but sacred and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Stories afford vs examples and presidents, of such mysticall Questions; the truth of all this will appeare in these few things heere annexed and set down.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports, that it was a custome amongst Kings of olde times, to put Questions one to another, to make proofe of best wits: and that a certaine praise was appointed to him that got the victory.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Dius</hi> an Historiographer of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> rehearseth the Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles and Questions that <hi>Salomon</hi> sent to King <hi>Hiram,</hi> saying, that it cost him very much in that hee could not open them, vntill at length he found a yoong man of Tirus (named <hi>Abdenan</hi>) who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphered to him the most part of


<pb facs="71"/>
them: Poets write that Sphinix was wont to set forth a reward of freedom and libertie, to him that could absolue his Riddle.</p>
   <p>We finde in the booke of Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that <hi>Sampson</hi> put forth a hard question, how meat could come out of the eater, and sweet out of the fierce? an elegant rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, consisting in contraries; for he that eateth, and he that giueth meat: also, he that is fierce and bitter, and he that is sweet, are opposites, of contrary natures; Hee also promised a reward to him that could read his riddle.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ambrose</hi> (as he is cited by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martir</hi>) demanded the cause why <hi>Sampson</hi> made his probleme, and he saith, that because men in feasts, when they haue well drunke, are wont to be somewhat full of talke, and to rebuke others too intemperately, which for the most part turned to contention;


<pb facs="72"/>
therefore to auoid that, graue men were wont to put forth rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles or problems, omitting dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous talke, and turning their mindes to the exposition of things put forth: whose example <hi>Sampson</hi> followed, and set a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for him that could open his question; to shew that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and sharpnesse of minde ought to be rewarded; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, ignorance and foolishnes ought to be shamed and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: thus farre are the words of <hi>Ambrose.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In the first of Luke, <hi>Mary</hi> the Virgin putteth a difficult questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto the Angell, which brought hir the message of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing and bearing the Sonne of God. <hi>How</hi> (saith Shee) <hi>may this be, seeing I know not a man:</hi> that is, how may I be a mother, while I am and remain a Virgin.</p>
   <p>Lastly, through out the Gospel


<pb facs="72"/>
we finde <hi>AEnigmata,</hi> and many hard parables Christ put vnto the Iewes, which his owne Disciples could not open: therefore did aske him, apart, what they ment.</p>
   <p>These things I doubt not make it euident, that this course which I take is warrantable, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Especially if the nature and importance of my doubtfull ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses be considered, tending to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct in diuine things, which concern saluation and religion; and the iniquitie of these times be thought on, wherein it is hard to say, whether ignorance or malice doe more abound; some that would talke of good things in their meetings, cannot, for lacke of skill to put forth or loose a question wisely: others, are so wicked and malitious, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride all wholesome communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: now seeing the sharpning of wits, is a maine and principall


<pb facs="73"/>
end of Questions, for the trying of our knowledge, some may muse why I would set downe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, to ease men of their owne labour in searching, and so take both the praise of the answer from others, and hinder the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which would come by see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; to this I say, that I had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cause in this draught to aime at my owne praise, for many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects; but as I mooued questions to prouoke some, which better can, to frame better and more: so I thought good, to frame an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer vnto these, that such as could not by their owne knowledge vpon their tryall finde a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might haue heere a peece of an answer and satisfaction, to giue them some contentment: I haue put each case and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer together, desiring such as can fit and yeeld more pregnant, and substantiall answers, to set


<pb facs="73"/>
them downe, and to accept in the meane while these my poore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours. Farewell.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Mine answer is a slender thing,</l>
      <l>Yet rest in it, or better bring.</l>
