      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is a common guise and practise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christian Kings and Princes, (most noble Prince) that in publishing and proclayming their Edictes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther monumentes of writing in theyr Coynes, which by their Mintmen they cause to be coyned, and now and then also in their buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings vpon statues or images curiously carued in theyr paynted tables, againe, on their clothes of estate, on their gorgeous hangings of Tapistrie, on their purple robes, on their Couerlets of Arras, and suche like preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ornamentes, when they put to their name and func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they discretely adde something, whereby they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse themselues to haue obteyned, <hi>THROVGH THE GRACE OF GOD,</hi> all the honoures and dignities that are befalne them, which custome commonly and euerye where receyued, can neuer sufficiently be praysed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled, for it putteth them in minde of most graue and weightie matters, and such as ought alwayes worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be before their eyes. First it teacheth them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse and acknowledge, that kingdomes and common weales are at <hi>GODS</hi> disposition, that they are most wisely gouerned by his prouidence, and that one whyle forsooth they flourishe for the Godlies sake, and another while are subuerted, bycause of the wicked, as testifye <hi>Iob</hi> Chap. <hi>34.</hi> and <hi>Salomon Prouerb. 28.29.</hi> and finally, that wonderfull alterations, far beyond all mens expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb facs="10"/>witnessing Daniell Chap. <hi>2.</hi> are brought to passe in them. Secondly, they are giuen to vnderstand, that it is their partes and duties to ascribe all their honoures, power, and happinesse, whatsoeuer be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ideth them on earth, only and alone to <hi>GOD,</hi> and to render thanks vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him continually for the same, in as much as of <hi>Dauid,</hi> a most diligēt ponderer of <hi>GODS</hi> iudgemēts, they may all learne, that it is <hi>GOD</hi> alone, and none other, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth happie successe and safetie vnto Kings, Psalm. <hi>144.</hi> with whome his sonne <hi>Salomon</hi> in all poynts agreing, pronounceth, that he only by the benefite of <hi>GOD</hi> was installed in the soueraigne state of his kingly dignitie, <hi>2.</hi> Chronic. <hi>1.</hi> And in the same place where the same <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> craueth wisedome to be giuen him, <hi>GOD</hi> hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe maketh answere, <hi>That he would not only giue him wisedome,</hi> whiche is a thing very necessary to a happye gouernemēt, <hi>but also that he would franckly and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully adorne him with riches, power, glory, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</hi> Moreouer, it is méete and conueniente that they acknowledge <hi>GOD</hi> to be a most mightye Emperoure and Monarch, in whose power and dominion it is, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish with horrible paines, or euen vtterly to destroy (and that iustly) all those that refuse to submitte themselues, and to do his commandements. And for this cause it is, that the said kingly Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> sang, <hi>Be wise nowe therefore yee Kings: be learned ye Iudges of the earthe, serue the Lord in feare, &amp; reioyce in him with trembling. Kisse the sonne, least he be angrie, and yee perishe in the way, if his wrath be kindled but euē a little.</hi> To be short, so many Kings and Princes as doe aduisedly consider, that they <hi>BY THE GRACE OF GOD</hi> haue obteyned the highest degrée of honour, should for many causes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoure themselues with all their power and inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to become as like vnto <hi>GOD</hi> as is possible, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so farre forthe as they may, his goodnesse, iustice,
<pb facs="10"/>clemencie in al points. It is most truly said of a certaine wise man, <hi>That a Prince is the image of GOD that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth all things.</hi> Though euen this also ought not a little to moue them, that in the holy Scriptures they are not seldome times called <hi>GODS,</hi> Exod. <hi>22.</hi> Psalme. <hi>82.</hi> Now héere vpon further it followeth, that all Kings and Princes, especially so manye as doe beare the worlde in hand, that they knowe <hi>CHRIST,</hi> by whome grace and truth is broughte downe to vs from Heauen, and that they embrace and kisse hym from their hearts, that I may vse the worde of Psalmist, ought diligently, &amp; with all dutifulnesse, to perfourme and set forwarde all those things that tend to the aduancement of the glory of our true &amp; euerlasting <hi>GOD</hi> on earth, who alone is the most mightie King of all Kings, &amp; Lord of all Lords Apoc. <hi>19.</hi> For héere vnto doth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> diuine crier inuite all y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, Psal. <hi>29.</hi> saying, <hi>Giue vnto the Lord yee sonnes of the mightie, giue vnto the Lorde glory and strength.</hi> And surely, if Kings and Princes would by any meanes go about to amplifie <hi>GODS</hi> glory, they cānot do it any better way, than if they cause as many people as maye be, to be brought to the knowledge and sincere worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of <hi>GOD</hi> y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Father, &amp; of hys son <hi>IESVS CHRIST.</hi> For why? <hi>GOD</hi> accompteth this to be hys greatest prayse and glory, whiche also he challengeth to himselfe alone, and will neuer yéelde it to anye other, that all men shoulde haue the knowledge of hys power, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, righteousnesse: that they shoulde receyue hys commaundementes, worshippe and call vppon hym wyth their whole heart, and finallie, from hym looke for all good things, and euen euerlasting saluation. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which thing, <hi>Moses,</hi> Prince of al Prophets, Deut. <hi>10.</hi> saith, <hi>And now ô Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to feare the Lord thy God, to walke in all his wayes, and to loue him, and to serue the Lorde
<pb facs="11"/>thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soule?</hi> And <hi>Esay. 43.</hi> God himselfe sayeth, <hi>Euery one shall be called by my name, for I haue created him for my glory.</hi> Again in the same place, <hi>This people haue I formed for my selfe, they shall shewe foorth my prayse.</hi> And Chap. <hi>48. For mine owne sake, for mine owne sake will I do it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than my name shoulde be polluted, neyther wyll I giue my glory to another.</hi> By no small number of suche sentences <hi>GOD</hi> declareth, that he then excelleth in sound &amp; perfite glory, when as of good mē he is honoured, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, &amp; worshipped: but to what end is it to make any lō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger rehearsall? Howbeit, least anye man should doubte that the chiefe happinesse consisteth in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> true knowledge &amp; seruice of <hi>GOD,</hi> and that therby men atteine vnto that place, where with the blessed Saincts they shall enioy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting felicitie. Let vs hearken vnto <hi>GOD</hi> himselfe, <hi>Ieremy</hi> declaring in this sort, <hi>Let not the wise man</hi> (saith he) <hi>glory in his wisdome, nor the strong man glory in his strength, neyther the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that gloryeth, glory in this, that he vnderstandeth and knoweth me, for I am the Lord which shew mercy, iudgement and righteousnesse in the earth, and in these things I delight</hi> saith y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lord. And as touching y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his sonne, the same God Esay. <hi>53.</hi> sayeth, <hi>By hys knowledge shall my righteous seruant iustifie many, and he shall beare their iniquitie.</hi> But all this matter, our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <hi>CHRIST</hi> dispatcheth very roundly, where he spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to his father in these words Iohn. <hi>17. This is eternal life, that they know thee to be the onely true GOD, and whome thou hast sent IESVS CHRIST.</hi> But now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth this thing to be discussed, will some man say, to witte, from whence we haue to fette the knowledge of <hi>GOD</hi> the Father, and of his sonne <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and from whence we may readily learne, how <hi>GOD</hi> will be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped of vs. This matter is easily answered and
<pb facs="11"/>determyned. And soothly it is best for vs in thys behalfe to heare men inspired with the spirite of <hi>GOD,</hi> rather than any other else whatsoeuer. Therefore the authour of the <hi>19.</hi> Psalme, would haue vs to flee to the very law, and testimonie vttered by <hi>GOD</hi> himselfe: <hi>The Lawe of the Lord,</hi> sayth he <hi>is vndefiled, conuerting the soule: the testimonie of the Lorde is sure, and giueth wisedome to the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, reioycing the hearte: the commaundement of the Lord is pure, and giueth light vnto the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for euer: the iudgements of the Lorde are true, and righteous altogither. More to be desired are they than golde, yea than muche fine gold: sweeter also than hony, and the hony combe. Moreouer by them is thy seruaunt taught, and in keeping of them there is great rewarde.</hi> Many things spoken to this effect in the <hi>119.</hi> Psalme, I purposelye passe ouer. In Esay Chap. <hi>8.</hi> Whosoeuer, by <hi>GODS</hi> disposition, do offer themselues vnto <hi>CHRIST</hi> to be taught as being desirous to learne the trueth, are commaunded to resort for councel to the lawe and to the testimony. And he, whose integritie is renoumed in the Sermons of the Prophets &amp; Apostles, I meane <hi>Abraham</hi> the common father of all the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Luke. <hi>16.</hi> to those that are carefull to prouide and foresée, least they fall into endlesse paines and torments, giueth in charge, that they heare attentiuely <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophetes. Last of all, <hi>CHRIST</hi> speaketh exprese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye <hi>Iohn. 5.</hi> saying: <hi>Searche the Scriptures: for they are that testify of mee.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Then the matter is brought to this pointe: that so many Kings and Princes as are desirous to rouze vp men to the purchasing of the knowledge of the true and euerlyuing <hi>GOD,</hi> and of hys sonne <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> and to bring them home to a sounde and sincere religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, haue néede especiallye (for manye greate causes and
<pb facs="12"/>considerations) to become authours themselues vnto all their subiectes, and euen to as manye as they maye, that they and euery of them to the vttermost of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer maye applye their diligence continuallye to the reading, hearing, examining, and meditating of the holy Scriptures. Other waye than this, wherein a man might walke safely as in respecte of knowing the true <hi>GOD</hi> and of puchasing saluation, without feare of erroure or anye other daunger, can none be shewed. And vndoubtedly this businesse is in it self of such great excellencie &amp; dignitie, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it is a thing well worthy wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Christian Kings and Princes shoulde by a speciall regarde make decrées in their publike edictes and actes of Parliament.</p>
   <p>Neyther in verye déede are they ignoraunt, how it is the moste sage and sacred commaundemente of <hi>GOD</hi> himselfe, that so manye as are desirous to bée enrolled and registred in the blessed <hi>Common weale</hi> and Citie of <hi>GOD,</hi> shoulde continuallye exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in learning and meditating the lawe of <hi>GOD,</hi> that is to saye, the holy Scripture. <hi>These words whiche I cōmaund thee this day</hi> (sayth <hi>GOD</hi> alwayes our most noble Emperoure, Deutronomie. <hi>6.</hi>) <hi>shall be in thyne hearte: and thou shalte rehearse them continually to thy children, and shalte talke of them, when thou tariest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the waye, when thou lyest downe, and when thou risest vp.</hi> Which decrée we finde to be repeated in the <hi>11.</hi> Chapter of the same Booke, that euen hereby it may be apparant, that it is a matter very earnestly vrged of <hi>GOD.</hi> Wherfore if Christian Magistrates doe at any tyme make lawes for theyr people, wherein they shall no lesse seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye than grauelye commaunde, that all and euerye householder and gouernours of familyes shall daylye in theyr seuerall houses ordinarilye reade, heare, and
<pb facs="12"/>examine from tyme to tyme certaine Chapters of the holye new Scriptures: they can not bée sayd to attempt anye matter, or straunge from theyr office and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng: but with all faythfull diligence to propounde, commende, and putte in execution the moste aun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ent ordinaunce and decrée, euen of <hi>GOD</hi> hymselfe, by whose grace and fauoure they so ofte confesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be aduaunced to theyr hyghe and moste honourable estate. And in good sooth if Magistrats woulde duely consider with themselues by howe so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne an othe, and for howe manye causes they are bounde and beholden vnto <hi>GOD:</hi> againe, if they woulde call to minde, howe néedefull a thyng it were, especiallye in these dayes, for all menne to bée trayned vppe in the doctrine of true Religion: and besydes, howe manyfolde commodities myghte by this moste holesome enterprise redounde vnto all estates: they coulde by no meanes abyde, to be counted slacke or negligente in thys behalfe. But rather they woulde wyth all godlye care, and so long time putte foorth Lawes touching the reading and meditation of the Scriptures, vntyll they shoulde sée menne to bée more in loue with Diuine matters, than nowe they are, to profitte somewhat like in the Doctrine of Fayth and Christianitie, and to amende their manners whyche we sée nowe euerye where (oh vnhappye age of ours) to be ouermuche corrupted, and plainely abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>
   <p>And questionlesse, it becommeth Magistrates wyth greate courage and constancye to goe forwards in thys office: for so muche as they vnderstande that it is euen by name enioyned vnto them also of <hi>GOD,</hi> that they shoulde continuallye be occupyed in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the sacréed Bookes. For thus doeth <hi>GOD</hi> the supreme lawgiuer, Deutronomie <hi>17.</hi> say vnto them:
<pb facs="13"/>
      <hi>When the king shall sitte vpon the throne of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then shall he write him a copie of this Lawe in a booke by the Priestes of the Leuites: and ye shal be with him, and hee shall reade therein all the dayes of his life, that he maye learne to feare the Lorde his GOD, and to keepe al the wordes of this Lawe, and these ordinaunces, for to doe them. That his hearte bee not lifted vp aboue his brethren, and that he turne not from the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente, to the right hande or to the lefte, but that hee maye prolong his dayes in his kingdome, hee and hys sonnes in the middest of Israell.</hi> They then are more grosely deceiued, thā y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they shal néed with any long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to be confuted, whosoeuer they be that imagine this commaundement to belong in no wise vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Magistrates. Certaine it is, that as well y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> king as all other Magistrates in generall are appointed of <hi>GOD,</hi> whom it happeneth at anye time to be placed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a multitude, that acknowledgeth the lawe and the Prophetes, that is to say, the pure and sincere religion frée from all staine of superstition. And that this precept maye rightly be transferred to all posteritie that should at leaste imbrace the selfesame religion, this maye bée an Argument, that <hi>GOD</hi> did then gyue it forth, when as the <hi>common Wealth</hi> of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> had not as yet any king.</p>
   <p>Nowe this is also out of all question, that lawes both maye and oughte to be made of Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, whyche shoulde not only approche moste néere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the lawes of <hi>GOD,</hi> but also be as proppes and stayes alwayes in a readinesse, to ayde, helpe, and assiste by al meanes possible, menne as yée would saye otherwise weake, wearie, and almoste fainting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their burthens, to the kéeping and obseruation of them. Wherefore <hi>Augustine</hi> in hys seconde Booke <hi>Chap. 58.</hi> againste the letters of <hi>Petilian</hi> the <hi>Donatist</hi>
      <pb facs="13"/>wittily sayeth, <hi>If lawes of earthly gouernement take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the succour of the Churche, whiche is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, that thing is not to be found fault with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: seeing Paule the Apostle by the helpe of mans lawes defended himselfe against his enimies.</hi> No lesse fitly and to the purpose in his Epistle <hi>48.</hi> to <hi>Vincentius: yea in deed,</hi> sayth he, <hi>the Kings of the earth do serue CHRIST, when they make lawes for CHRIST.</hi> Finally in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle <hi>50.</hi> to <hi>Boniface</hi> the Earle, he sayth: <hi>The king ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Lorde in feare: but one way in that he is a man, and another way in that he is a king. In that he is a man, he serueth him by liuing faythfully: and in that hee is a king, he serueth him by constituting lawes, cōmaunding iust things, and forbidding the contrarie. As Ezechias ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him, in distroying the Idol groues and temples, and those hye places whyche were erected against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of GOD. As Iosias serued him, he also by doing the like. As the king of the Niniuites serued hym, in compelling the whole Citie to pacify the Lorde. As Darius serued him, in giuing the Idoll into the power of Daniell to be broken, and in thrusting his enimies to the Lions As Nabuchodonosor serued him, in forbidding by a terrible lawe all that were in his kingdome from blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming of GOD. In this therefore doe kings serue the Lorde, so farforth as they are kings, when they doe those things to serue him, which none can do but Kings.</hi> Thus much sayth he. That the first and principall care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Christian kings and Princes ought to be besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, in and about the establishing of lawes, which may be of some importaunce to the spreading abroade, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating, and maintayning of religion, no man thoughe neuer so rude and vnciuil can deny.</p>
   <p>Neyther doth the Emperour <hi>Iustinian</hi> dissemble this matter, <hi>in Nouellis, constitutione. <hi>6.</hi>
      </hi> to <hi>Epiphanius</hi> the Archbishop and Patriarke of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> writing
<pb facs="14"/>in thys manner: <hi>The greatest giftes that GOD of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine clemencie hath giuen vnto men, are, the Priesthood &amp; Imperial gouernemente: wherof the one ministring in diuine matters, and the other ruling with diligēce in humayne, eyther of them proceeding from one and the selfe same beginning, do beautifye and adorne mans life. And therefore shall Emperours prouide for nothing so muche, as for the honestie of Priestes, seeing perdie that they also doe praye alwayes vnto GOD for them. For if that truely be blamelesse on euery side, and faithful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes GOD, and the Empire diligent in adorning the Common weale committed vnto it: then will there bee a certaine happy harmonie betwixt them, yeelding all things profytable vnto mankinde. And herevpon it cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that wee haue so greate a care aboute GODS true religion, and about the honestie of the Priestes. Whiche if they obtayne, we are perswaded that we thereby shall haue great giftes giuen vnto vs of GOD: and that those whiche we haue alreadie, shall be confirmed vnto vs: &amp; those which as yet we haue not, we shal attain. Thē do al things goe well, and happily, when the beginning is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued and accepted of GOD. And this we truste shall come to passe, if the holy cannons bee duelye obserued, which the blessed, prayseworthy, and reuerende behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and ministers of GOD the Apostles haue taught, &amp; the holy fathers haue kept and expounded. Wee decree therefore, following in all things the sacred canons, &amp;c.</hi> And from hence forsooth it came, that there are found so many lawes decréed by Emperors as touching y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our religion: as by <hi>Gratiā, Valentinian, &amp; Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius,</hi> concerning y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> blessed Trinitie and the Catholike Faith: &amp; other (lawes) by other (Emperors) which it wer ouerlong to repeate. And they al either ensue the traces of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy Scripture, which they cōmaund also as a <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus</hi> thréed to be followed in al things: or else like vnto
<pb facs="14"/>faithful schoolemaisters, by their counsels, exhortations, &amp; now &amp; then by their threatnings they perswade, and prick forwarde mē to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> better execution of <hi>GODS</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements. But as now for our present purpose tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> dayly reding of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sacred scriptures, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> law aboue al other is most fit &amp; conuenient, whereby y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Emperoure <hi>Iustinian <hi>constitutione.</hi> 146.</hi> prescribeth in what tong y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Iews scattered throughout al natiōs of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> erth, &amp; sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> heauy yoke of exile, ought to read y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy bookes: <hi>We decree,</hi> sayth he, <hi>that in what places so euer the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes are founde, it shal be lawfull to so many as wil, in their Synagoges to vse the Greeke tongue, and likewise this countrey language, namely the Italian, or any other tong whatsoeuer, according as the alteration of the place requireth, wherein they are able with vnderstanding to reade the holye bookes: to the intente that so muche the more by their reading, they may vnderstande the whole drift &amp; order of the words more plainely, and frame the tenor of their life &amp; conuersation according to the same.</hi> And after a few words: <hi>They that read the Greeke tong shal vse the interpretation of the Septuaginta, whiche is more exact thā al other, &amp; containeth aboue the rest ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hiddē things.</hi> And again: <hi>Neuertheles least they shold think, that we de bar thē frō other interpretatiōs, we giue thē leaue, to vse also the interpretatiō of Aquila.</hi> Again: <hi>Whervpon by this our licence graunted vnto thē, nether shal they be subiect to any penalties that vse the Greeke tong &amp; other tongs, neither shal they be forbiddē by any so to do.</hi> And a litle after: <hi>Therfore haue we giuē thē free libertie to inioy the vse of al tongs to the reading of the holy bookes, to the ende that if they all orderly imbrace the knowlege of thē, they may be made more fit to learn better things. Sith it is a plain case, that he is muche more apt to discerne &amp; entertain better things that being nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sled in reading the sacred bookes, is not far off frō amēde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="15"/>and to be brought to some thriftinesse, then he that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth no suche matter, but hangeth onely vppon the bare name of religion, and cleaueth therevnto as to a holy ancker, and supposeth the knowledge of GOD to consist only in the bare name of the sect.</hi> Thys lawe the Emperour commaunded to be openly proclaymed by <hi>Ariobindus</hi> his Liuetenaunte, and other officers: and so many as woulde not obey it, to forfayte all their goods, and to goe into exile. But if thys moste holy Emperour was carefull, to determyne, in what tong the Iewes (who at that time as touching that matter contended very odiously among themselues) should read y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holye Scripture: why shoulde not our kings &amp; Princes prouide by Lawes, firste, that all Christians vnder theyr Dominions maye reade, then nexte in what tongue they maye reade the sacred Byble, not so muche publikely in Churches as priuatelye in their houses? And what shall we say of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Emperour <hi>Theodosius</hi> the seconde, who (as the reporte goeth) (and no doubte moued by the commaundement of <hi>GOD,</hi> whyche is extante as touching Kinges, Deutronomie. <hi>17.</hi>) wrote out with hys owne hande the Bookes of the Newe Testamente, reade euerye mornyng in hys house some parte of them, and recyted customarily certaine Psalmes and prayers togither wyth hys wife (shée was <hi>Eudocia</hi> the daughter of <hi>Leontius</hi> a Philosopher of <hi>Athens,</hi> of whome they say were written right lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Poems) and with his sisters.</p>
   <p>But if I shoulde go aboute to produce moe proues tending to thys ende, I feare leaste I shoulde incurre offence, who especiallye haue excéeded alreadye the compasse of an Epistle. Therefore that my speache maye drawe to an ende, I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded verylye that it wyll then goe well wyth the Church, and with the whole common wealth, when as
<pb facs="15"/>the Kings, Princes, and all other Magistrates of these our times, seriously turning their minds to the Statutes of the Almighty and euerliuing <hi>GOD,</hi> whiche were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed euen nowe out of Deuteronomie, and to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the most noble Emperoures, of whome wee haue spoken, shall beginne to putte forthe, and with all godly diligence, to commend vnto the people committed to their charge, lawes, as touching the dayly and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall (and that perdie in their owne Countrey lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) reading, hearing, and meditating of the holye Bible. And as for the reasons wherewith men may bée moued to obey their most holesome lawes and decrées, I haue in this volume, partly out of the most sacred Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Prophets and Apostles, partly, out of the Commentaries of the most excellent Doctors, packed togither, as ye would say in one bundle, very many, and the same not to be misliked: so that this onely remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, namely, that with what willingnesse and desire they are of me offered, with the selfe same, all menne, whensoeuer they shall reade them, woulde vouchsafe to receyue them. My purpose and scope to dispatche it in a worde, is, to profite at leastwise somewhat by my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour all sortes of men that are carefull for a better life, and for the euerlasting saluation of their soules. But vnto your highnesse most noble Prince, I haue thought good to consecrate this worke, as well for sundry causes and considerations, as also especially for twayne, which haue in them more force than the rest. The one is, when I behold and consider the iustice, clemencie, gentlenesse, and other vertues naturally ingenerate in you, togither with the notable education and instruction worthy a most famous Prince, doubtlesse I am perswaded, that your Highnesse may easilie be broughte to this poynte, namely, that you will not onely exercise your selfe dayly in the reading of the holye Byble, according to <hi>GODS</hi>
      <pb facs="16"/>commaundemente Deuteronomie. <hi>17.</hi> but also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke and stirre vp one whyle by gentle exhortations, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother while by sharpe and seuere preceptes, all the people and inhabitantes of youre Dominion (as <hi>GOD</hi> also hath willed, Deuteronomie, <hi>6.</hi> and. <hi>11.</hi>) to the doing and practising of the like. For what shoulde not I looke for at his hands, whose father <hi>Friderike,</hi> Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> and those twayne of the same house, neuer suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently praysed, supplying before hym the selfesame honoures to theyr innestimable commendation, I meane <hi>Fridericke,</hi> and <hi>Otho Henry,</hi> haue accomplished many difficulte attempts, for the amplifying of <hi>GODS</hi> glory, and encrease of sincere Religion. Neyther haue I anye doubte, but that youre Highnesse most noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, caused therefore of late the Bookes of the Diuine Oracles, most cléerely, and at his greate charge to bée Printed in the vulgar tong, to the intente, that both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Copies myght be conueyed and spredde ouer all youre Dominions and other places, and also be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutely redde of euery man for conscience sake in theyr priuate houses. The other cause is, so soone as other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates shall perceyue you, whose glory standeth aloft on a high and stately place, to gyue some onset to the trayning of Christian people to the reading and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising of the holy Scriptures: it is very lykely, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatelye therevppon many of them (that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie) wyll stoutely followe in the selfesame rare of godlynesse. It happeneth, I wote not how, that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whiche procéedeth from Princes and greate men, casteth forthe farre and néere an incredible brightenesse, and as yée would say, beames, whereby it both rouzeth vp a great number, and also allureth them to mutation. And euen as wittie Paynters doe choose out all the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauouredst bodyes they can come by, and do lay to gette Tables that haue bin aforehande curiously wroughte
<pb facs="16"/>by the cunningest Artificers of their occupation, to the intente they may drawe forthe and expresse them wyth theyr pencill and couloures: so likewise, suche men as are of a noble courage, and especially of an honourable stocke and Parentage, do much more willingly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirously learne vertue of their equals, than of anye other sortes of men besydes whatsoeuer. Wherefore, I most humbly pray and beséech youre Highnesse, to take well in worth my good wyll and meaning héerein. The King euerlasting, immortall, inuisible, and <hi>GOD,</hi> onely wise, vnto whome alone all honour and glory is due, vouchsafe through <hi>IESVS CHRIST</hi> his sonne, to informe your mind with his holy Spirite to good gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to guide and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende you to the ende. Farewell moste noble Prince.</p>
