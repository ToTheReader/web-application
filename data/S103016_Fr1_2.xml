   <head>To the right hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
the Lorde ROBERT DVDDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY
Maister of the Queenes Maiesties
horse, and knight of the noble order of the
Garter, Robert Fills wisheth long lyfe,
with the encrease of godlye
honour.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our good zeale (right
honorable lord) to the
aduaūcement of gods
glorye in this realme,
and the singuler gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilnes
and fauour that
you vsually shewe to the furtherers
thereof, hathe moued and encoraged
me to flie to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> protectiō of your name,
partlye to procure thereby some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and cōmendacion to this good
worke, which I haue translated into
the Englishe tongue, and partly so
muche as in me lyeth, to do you that
honour whiche of righte I thinke to
to appertaine vnto you: that is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
you by the dedication of
this worcke (as you are in deede to
your great praise &amp; renowne) a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
patrone of good &amp; godlye mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.
<pb facs="3"/>
But there is nothing so well
minded, or so godly deuised, but that
it may, &amp; cōmonly is, by euill taking
misconstrued, and by sinister talking
depraued: such is the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
of the malicious and slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
tongue, that being but a lytle
member, yet it is euer busye and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beling,
neuer quiet, barking alwaies
byting somtime, fynding great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
where none is, makynge of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
some thinge, of some thynge a
greate thinge, of a Mouse a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
of a Gnat an Olephant, of a
smale sparke, enkindlynge a fyer of
much discorde and dissencion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
albeit y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Greke Poet Aristopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
truly sayeth, that there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
against the byting of a Sicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
or slaunderer: yet somewhat
to stoppe the rage of this running &amp;
ranging tongue, and to preuent and
cure as muche as maye be this pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
poyson, I haue not only thought
good to vse the sayde meane, of your
honorable name, but also to expresse
in thys my preface, bothe the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
&amp; substaunce of the boke, and y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      <pb facs="3"/>
minde &amp; meaning of my selfe y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slatour,
y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> if the malicious man wyll
carpe or cauil at either of them, your
honour and other that by your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
shall iudge well of thinges well
entended, maye haue at hand a trew
apologie and defence. The booke con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teineth
lawes and statutes, without
which a common weale can no more
be ruled, then the body lyue without
the soule, or a great shippe in the boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
sea, bee gouerned without a
wise and skilfull lodesman, and they
are y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> statutes of Geneua, a Citie coū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
of all godly men singularly well
ordered, as well for good policie, as
also for the gouernemente of the
Churche in all estates, orders, and
vocations, where sincere religion is
wonderfullye aduaunced, erroure
mightely beaten downe, vertue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedingly
maynteyned, vice seuerelye
repressed: suche is the execution of
those lawes, such straight discipline
is practised, that not only grosse cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
are punished, but common (faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
as men take them) are narowlye
seene vnto, as blasphemye, heresye,
<pb facs="4"/>
straunge and pestiferous doctrine,
fornication spirituall and corporall,
swearinge, sclaunderinge and suche
lyke, so y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in dede that place maye be
a lantarne to manye other, bothe of
sinceritie in iudgement, and of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
in conuersation, as this booke
presently doth witnes, &amp; the practise
and example doth much moore lyuely
declare. Now, the intent &amp; minde of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
translatour is faithfullye to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
to Englishe men, this treasure
taken oute of the Frenche tongue,
(obteyning the copye oute of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister
booke of the foresayde Citie)
that thereby they may beholde as in
a glasse, a christian reformation, and
employe them selues to the imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as farre forthe as they see best for
them, as shalbe most conuenient.
Hereby maye not bee gathered that
the Translatour is a newe lawe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
or authour of any innouacion, or
that his industrie and diligence is in
any wyse preiudiciall to the lawes of
this our realme, which are laudable,
good, and godlye: but as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all histories is to all suche
<pb facs="4"/>
as desyre to heare, see, and knowe,
thynges profitable and pleasaunte,
and necessarye, so besyde the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of the common lawes posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
the readynge of thys fruitefull
worcke, shall brynge to the priuate
man godlye instruction. If we haue
a pleasure to reade Iosephus, Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,
Plutarche, Aristotle, Liuye,
and suche other, and wyshe them to
bee tourned into knowen and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
languages: that thereby we may
peruse and vnderstande the lawes,
fashions and ordinaunces of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
Grecians, Romaines, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
howe muche more ought men
to suffer and take in good parte this
facte of him that bringeth home to vs
out of a strange and far coūtrey, and
forein tongue, a forme &amp; patrone, not
only of a wel instituted cōmon weale
but of a well reformed churche, not
for Heathen to gase on, but for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to folowe, not so much for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation
as for edification. Whiche
fruite of my laboure, God graunte
maye tourne to hys glorye, and to
the encreace of good nourture and
<pb facs="5"/>
discipline in Christes scoole, that
trew repentaunce and amendment
of lyfe maye ensue, that by our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
our heauenly father may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
and his people by the example
of our faith and mutuall charitie edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
And further, this worke maye
serue for matter of answere to those
that inueying agaynste the lyues of
men of our profession, do more false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
speake euill of vs, than they can
trewlye speake well of theyr owne
faction. They charge vs with liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and licenciousnesse moste vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
reportinge that we departed oute
of this realme in the late tyme of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishement
of Goods churche, onelye
to this ende, to enioye more vnchas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
freedome of sensuall lyfe: But
when they shal beholde these lawes,
&amp; shal not bee able to proue, but y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the
same are as vertuously folowed, and
as seuerely executed in those places
where we lyued, as in this boke they
be here expressed: which shal appeare
howe small lycence is in oure refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
churches left to synne, in compa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rison
of the realmes drowned in their
<pb facs="5"/>
supersticion, where their truste in
mans pardon hathe quenched the
feare of gods displeasure, and where
horrible synnes are dispensable for
money, I truste these slaunderours
shal haue their mouthes stopped, tyll
they bee able to shewe a common
weale of their owne, where so good
lawes both of sincere religion and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
iustice and honesty, are so dewly
put in practise, so reuerentlye obeyd,
and so preciselye kept, yea &amp; by those
that willynglye for the loue of god,
and tender care of their owne salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
do forsake the landes of greater
libertie of lyfe, to thrall them selfes
to such seueretie. For the maner of
translating I shall beseche your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and all good readers to beare
with the plaine and simple rudenesse
thereof, and for myne excuse to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstonde,
that I considered these to
be lawes and rules of lyfe and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
in expressinge whereof, I had
rather be to curiously faithfull, then
any thinge neglygently or vntrulye
fine, I haue giuen it worde: for word
rather folowing somtime y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Frenche
<pb facs="6"/>
prase to muche, then at anye tyme
venturynge to presume or take to
my selfe a iudgement that I attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the sence of the worcke, yf I
should swarue from the wordes. My
laboure I beseche youre honoure to
accepte in good parte, as I wyll not
fayle to continewe in prayer to God
for the continuaunce and encreace
of your godlye zeale and
Christian affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
