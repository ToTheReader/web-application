And Alexander the great, had that noble writer of the famous battell of Troy in such prize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse estimation, that about what affaires soeuer he inclined his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he had his workes about him, nor euer slept but they rested vnder his pillow. Moreouer, comming into a School, and not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the the labors of Homer there, he struck the maister with his fiste, meaning thereby, that the knowledge of Histories, was a recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fitting all estates and degrees, and that it was a great and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall offence to be without them. For like as in Musicke, manie discord notes and manie tunes make one consent, and one delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full harmonie, so in a historie, the varietie and multitude of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples tend all to one end; that is, the aduancement of vertue, and ouerthrow of vice: offring themselues as a most perfect mirror for man to behold, not the outward portraiture and shape of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but the liuely image and expresse figure of his inward minde, instructing him how to apparell himselfe in decent ornaments, &amp; to discard from him his wilde infirmities.</p>
