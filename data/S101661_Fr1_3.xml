And agayne: Aunswer a foole accordyng to his foolyshnes, lest he may sceme to himself to be wise: It may now of good congruence be verified in the cause vttered in question for order of ministers apparell. It is not vnknowen what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes and conclusions, what letters and wrytynges haue ben vsed and tossed from man to man in secrete sort, for these two or three yeres, to disproue the libertie of the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God in the vse of externe thynges, to conuel the obedience that true Subiectes shoulde perfourme to the aur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of theyr Prince, &amp; to the lawes of the Realme esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyshed, to the discredityng and condemnation of such which in a whole conscience thynke it lawefull for them to weare, and yet charitably bearyng with the weaknes of such whose consciences are entangled with fearefull scrupulositie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the same. The small weyght of theyr reasons and argumentes so set out, theyr cause so harde to defende with learnyng (so many graue wryters of iudgement agaynste them) the matter fullye debated by the best learned men of the Realme of late, with thorder of the counsayle taken in the tyme of blessed memorie Kyng Edwarde, and fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: caused diuers men (beyng yet offended with suche

Paule helde others in scilence, whereas he chargeth his scoler Timothy thus: <hi>Stultas et ineruditas que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiones respue, sciens eas parere pugnas: porro seruū domini nō oportet pugnare, sed placidū esse erga omnes, propensum ad docendum, tolerantem malos cum mansuetudine, erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entē eos qui obsistunt, si quando det illis deus paenitentiam ad agnoscendum veritatem, et resipiscant a diaboli laqueo, capti ab eo ad ipsius voluntatem.</hi> Foolyshe and vnlearned questions put from thee, remembryng that they do but gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der stryfe: for the sernaunt of the Lorde must not stryue, but must be peaceable vnto all men, and apt to teache, and one that can suffer the enyll in mekenes, and can infourme them that resyst, yt that God at any tyme wyll geue them re pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce for to knowe the trueth, that they may come to themselues agayne out of the snare of the deuyll, which are nowe taken of hym at his wyll.</p>
   <p>To enforce this text at this tyme in the particuler appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng therof, shalbe spared yet, for hope of their amendement who haue disorderlye behaued them selues. To eragerat the matter agaynste them, with muche alleagyng learned mens iudgementes (many dead, some yet alyue) otherwyse then to instruct them by a few reported, shall also be spared, as it would haue ben wyshed, the matter wholly myght ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with scilence haue ben styll buryed. But now the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of a treatise so solemlye aduouched, so confidentlye affirmed, of very late so publiquely by prynt diuulged and dispearsed, hath made this wryter nowe to thynke it hygh tyme, to call to remembraunce the latter part of Salomons scntence: <hi>Responde stulto iuxta stultitiam suam, ne vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur sibi sapiens:</hi> Not yet professyng by this examination to
<pb facs="4"/>
say halfe so much as myght be spoken in the comprehension of the cause, nor takyng so much aduauntage agaynst that inconfiderat wrytyng, as it myght deserue to be charged: but briefely to put to the aucthours consideration the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the reasons, the sophisticatiō of the arguments of that discourse, vnworthy of it selfe (to saye the trueth) to be once aunswered, as beyng so written, as euery man (but such as be eyther to parcially bent to the cause, or for lacke of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng can not expende the substaunce of the wrytyng) maye perceyue that it muste nedes fall to ruyne &amp; decaye of credite of it selfe, though no man should bende any force at it, &amp; how soeuer (in the heate which is now taken) thought to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyly, grauely, inuincibly wrytten, but worthy in deede to be put out in the name of such, whō it would specially defende. Yf ye aske me whom I coulde thinke to be vnder the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof: Surely I can not see, that diuers suche as be learned, and commonly iudged to be amongest this number, can muche ioy to fight vnder that banner, or to runne with them to that marke they shoote at. For it is certayne, that many whom this smale route, named London Ministers, woulde haue ioyned with them for theyr more honestie, be farre from theyr determinations in this question, neither so handling it, nor so woulde conclude in this cause as they do: Who howsoeuer (some of them) do yet a litle stay at the vsing of this apparel in themselues, yet be not of their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to condemne the thyngs of wyckednes, nether in them selues, nor in the vse of thē, as the Ministers in this Church of Englande be called nowe to weare them. And therefore howsoeuer they woulde wyshe a libertie to theyr owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences reserued, tyll they may see more in the cause, yet be they faxre of to condemne theyr brothers, whose consciences can serue them for obedience sake to vse them. And therfore I must nedes wype a great many out of their brotherhood, in their singularities conteyned in this last writing, and say: They be but a very fewe in them selues, other then such as haue ben eyther vnlearnedly brought vp, most in prophane
<pb facs="4"/>
occupations, or suche as be puffed vp in an arrogancie of them selues, peraduenture chargeable to suche vanities of assertions, as at this tyme I wyll spare to charge them. God graunt they do not by this degree, fall to the sectes of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistes, or Libertines, wherevnto some wyse and zelous men of theyr owne frendes &amp; Patrones, feare they do make poste haste, one day, openly to professe. Wherevpon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries of true religion can winne no great reioyce at these mens ouersightes, as beyng but a very fewe, and counted in deede none of the sincere and learned protestauntes, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer for a tyme they seemed to be amongest vs. For though they be gone out from vs, yet they were belyke neuer of vs. So that the aduersaries shall haue the whole state of the Cleargie in place and reputation, for learnyng, wysdome, and grauitie, concordely ioyned to be wholly agaynst them, to defende the sinceritie of the Gospel, though a fewe of these make suche adoo in our Churche (as stories make mention, was euer wont some to ryse in sundry tymes to trouble the state of their Churches, where they dwelt.) And good it were that these Englishe Louanistes, dyd not to muche delyght them selues with any hye reioysinges, as though the Prince woulde for disprouyng of a fewe counterfaites, dislyke the whole state of the rest of the Cleargie, who shall by Goddes grace be able ynough to defende the true religion of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, whiche they maye heare howe the Prince doth professe dayly and openly, to maintaine and defende to the vttermost iote of the worde of God, with renouncing aswell all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne aucthoritie, as all forrayne doctrine, not surely groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon this stable rocke of Gods worde. Theyr fawning flatterie prefaces, theyr greatly conceyued hopes, theyr busie dispraysyng of better learned then them selues be, can not so bewitche wyse mens heades, or hartes, but they can discerne trueth from falsehood, deuotion from superstition, papistrye from the Gospell, tiranny from discipline, Christ from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist. And therefore sirs, if ye knewe howe fewe these are, by whom ye delyght to slaunder the learned, howe lytle we
<pb facs="5"/>
thinke the rest of the Apostles discredited, though Judas fell out from them, and howe these be regarded and accompted of (so long as they thus continue) and finally, howe lytle we shall ioy of them, and vse them, to take the Gospell in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence agaynst you: Ye woulde not be so busie to infarce in your bookes the reproche of these men, to lade other with enuye, the breath of whose pennes, ye shall neuer be able to aunswere, say and wryte what ye can. Your bookes so fast and hastyly sent ouer in great numbers (beyng not muche feared for any substaunce that is in them) may for a time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue you to your sustentation, may be gaineful to your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp; Pedlours, may peraduenture ieoparde your frendes, within this your naturall Countrey, for readyng and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing matter agaynst theyr owne suretie, and agaynst the state of the Realme. But trueth is to hye set, for you to plucke her out of heauen, to manyfestlye knowen to be by your papers obscured, and to surely stablished, to drowne her in the myrie lakes of your Sophisticall licorous writinges. Howsoeuer ye embosse out your glorious stiles, they be but <hi>Superuacaneae conflictationes hominū mente corruptorum,<note place="margin">i. Tim. vi.</note> quibus adempta est veritas, qui existimāt quaestū essepietatē,</hi> with the forepart of the text there expressed, that is, but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous brawlings of men peruerse in hart, from whō the truth is withdrawen, which think that lucre is godlynes. &amp;c. Ye were best to vnderstand, <hi>Quod qui habitat in coelis. &amp;c.<note place="margin">Psal. ii.</note> irridebit omnes Iannes et Mambres, qui resistunt veritati, homines mente corrupti, reprobi circa fidem, sed non profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent<note place="margin">i.

Ye shoulde do well to remember <hi>Quod dominus est qui custodit veritatē, et quod veritas mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<note place="margin">Psal. cxlv. iii.

it is the Lorde whiche preserueth the trueth, for the trueth is of great force, and is stronger then all other thynges, for veritie wyll remayne, wyll preuayle for euer, and wyll lyue and haue the victory, worlde without ende. But to drawe to an ende, and to say some thyng to these vpon whom this labour is bestowed, who moste glory of this gaye booke of theyrs, I shall wyshe them to haue a respecte to theyr for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer callyng and profession of the Gospell. And as loue of grace and trueth (I trust) dyd fyrst induce them: so God graunt that they do not finally fight agaynst this grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, and wylfullye peruerte the true sinceritie of the Gospell, by treadyng not aright, ouercome by humaine cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as was Peter for a tyme, tyll Paule dyd reprehende him. Trustyng that they wyll so aduisedly expende the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest counsell of these two notable Fathers, Maister Bucer, and maister Martir, in this their purposed discussyng of the cause, that they wyll finally rest in quiet, praysyng God in trueth and veritie, forsakyng errour couered with zelous perswasion, to the sauyng of theyr owne soules, to the reioyce of such Christians to whom they haue ben teachers, as good subiectes ought to do, to the glory of God. To whom be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dominion for euer.</p>
