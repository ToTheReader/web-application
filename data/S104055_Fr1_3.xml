   <head>To the generous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but especially to
Bachelours and
Virgins.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Age affording
more Poets than
Patrons (for nine
Muses may travell
long ere they can find one <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coenas</hi>)
made mee at a stand to
whom I might commend the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of this small Tractate,
especially bearing this Title. To
any <hi>Matron</hi> I durst not, though
never so modest; lest her consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
might alledge unto her
<pb facs="3"/>
she had beene guilty of reading
the like <hi>Lectures.</hi> To a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
man</hi> I feared to doe it, lest
having beene often terrified
with his <hi>Curtaine clamours,</hi> I
might rather add to his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than insinuate into his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Therefore to you, O
single <hi>Batchelours,</hi> and singular
<hi>Virgins,</hi> I recommend both the
patronage and perusall of these
papers; and the rather, because
in you it can neither breed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust,
nor beget distaste; the
<hi>Maides</hi> not comming yet to
<hi>reade,</hi> nor the <hi>Young men</hi> to be
<hi>Auditors.</hi> But howsoever I
proclaime this worke free from
all offence, either to the single,
or the double. <hi>Marriage is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,</hi>
and therefore I say
unto thee, Marrie: feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<hi>Audaces fortuna juvat:</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
for it may be suspected, if there
were fewer Bachelours there
would be more honest wives;
therefore I say againe, Marry at
all adventure. If thou hast chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
thinke them thine owne,
though they be not: thou art
sure to have a wife of thine own,
though the issue be another
mans. Be valiant, feare not
words, they are but wind, and
you live at land, and not at sea:
with which admonishment, and
encouragement withall, I bid
you generously farewell.</p>
