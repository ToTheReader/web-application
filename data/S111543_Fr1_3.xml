      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Eare Brethren, and fren dly Readeres, vvee haue heere according to the trueth &amp; meaning of the Author, sette forth this needefull and necessarie vvorke concerning the Anatomy of mans body, being collected and gathered by Maister Thomas Vicary, and novve by vs the Chirurgions of S. Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mevves Hospital reuiued, corrected, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. And albeit this treatise be small in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, yet in commoditie it is great and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Notvvithstanding if the things therein conteined be not discreetely &amp; vvisely studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and applied, according to the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Author, vve haue to tell you heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that therein is great perill, because through ignorant practitioners, not knovving the Ana tomy, commonly doth ensue death, and sepa ration of soule and body. Furthermore vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as many good and learned men in these our dayes, doe cease to publishe abroade in the English tongue their vvorkes and trauelles, it

is for that if any one fault or blemish by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune bee committed, either by them or the printer escaped, they are blamed, yea and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for ignorant men, and error holders. But novv vve cease heere from these points, to trouble the gentle readervvith longer discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, for vvhose sakes &amp; comodities vve haue takē these pains: vvishing that men more skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and better learned vvould haue bome this burthē for vs. Crauing only this much at your handes, for to correct our faults fauorably, &amp; to report of the Author courteouslye, vvho sought (no doubt) your commodities onely and the profit of the common vvealth vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out praise &amp; vaineglory of him selfe.
