      <hi>TO MY THRICE-HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOVRED KINSMEN, THE</hi> TWO WORTHY KNIGHTS, Sir <hi>WILLIAM HARVY, of</hi> Ickworth. and Sir <hi>EDVVARD SVLYARD, of</hi> 6Hauley.</head>

      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OBLE Knights: When I had read ouer this Discourse, and waighed the sincerity of the Author, and how iustly in taxing his owne Country, he hath laid open the errours of Ours; and not onely searched the bottome of our corruptions, but prescribed a dyet and a remedy, both to preuent and cure their contagions. And seeing how cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and euill example hath misled all sorts, euen of the most peaceable natures, to such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
<pb facs="3"/>
that almost euery man thinkes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe out of fashion, if he be not incompatible; I thought I could not better employ my idle houres for the generall good, then to make this Directory of Honour and Well-liuing, a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denizon, and to speake our Countrey Dialect. If I vndergoe the censure of a Foole in Print, I care not, my intent is honest: I tooke the paines partly to please my selfe, and to auoid worse oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations: And I am sure that all vertuous and good dispositions will make true vse of it. For the rest, none can wish them more good, then they will worke themselues hurt.</p>
   <p>Now hoping (my most entirely honoured Knights) that you are both of this first, and best Ranke; as also true votaries to all other noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mind, I thought it fitting in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, to addresse it to you: And among other good causes, for that you are both Linguists, and can iudge of my indeauours; you are in an age, and of an age, fitting to run or be throwne vpon these disastrous rockes: you liue at ease, with plenty and pleasure, which may produce effects of hot blood. Be pleased to behold from the Port of your felicities, the stormes, ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks, torments, and precipitations of them, that had more false courage then good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and I doubt not, but it will make you both
<pb facs="3"/>
good husbands of your Honours, Liues, and Soules: which I thought my selfe obliged to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise you of, as a testimony of the seruiceable and sincere good wishes of</p>

      <signed>Your most affectionate kinsman and seruant, Thomas Heigham.</signed>
