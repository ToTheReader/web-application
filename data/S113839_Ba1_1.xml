      <p>MOst glorious LORD GOD, whose▪ dwelling is in the highest heavens, and yet beholdest the lowlie and the humble vpon earth, wee blush and are ashamed to lift vp our eyes vnto heaven, because we haue sinned against thee which dwellest in the heavens: But looke downe, wee beseech thee, from▪ heaven thy dwelling place▪

      <p>Wee confesse, Almightie Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, that thou madest vs at the first after thyne owne image, thou cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedst vs with innocencie as with a garment, thou seatedst vs in paradise a place of all delight and pleasure: But wee haue defaced thine image, wee haue cast off our first covering, we haue thrust our selues out of that pleasant place. Wee ran away from thee, and were not obedient vnto thy voyce: Wee were lost and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned before wee came into this world: Our first parents sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst thee, and we sinned in them: They were corrupted, and wee are inheriters of their corruption: They were the parents of disobedience, and wee are by nature the children of wrath: Sinfull and vnhappie children, of sinfull and vnhappie parents?

Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, O Lord, art thou in thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And our miserie is ▪from our selues. But great was thy mercie vnto vs. Wee came into this world in a flood of vncleannesse, wallowing in our mothers blood; and thou didst set open a fountayne for vs to wash in: Wee were washed in the laver of baptisme▪ and wee haue returned with the swyne to our wallowing in the myre. Wee came from a place of darknesse into this world, we lived as children of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse▪ wee sat in darknesse, and in the shadow of death: Thou gavest vs thy word to bee a lanthorne vnto our feete, and a light vnto our paths▪ that in thy light wee might see light; that so walking in the way of trueth, wee might attayne ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting lyfe: But wee haue loved darknesse more than light, &amp; haue not beene obedient vnto thy word. Wee came into this world crooked

even from our mothers wombe; and thou gavest vs thy law to be a glasse wherein we might see our deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and a rule whereby to square all our actions, words, &amp; thoughts: But wee haue shut our eyes that wee might not see, and wee haue refused to bee ruled by thy law: The law of sinne in our flesh doeth daylie cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate vs. The roote of originall sinne which lyeth hidden in vs, doth everie day put foorth new branches: All the parts and faculties of our bodies and soules are so manie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of vnrighteousnesse to fight agaynst thy divyne Majestie. Our hearts imagine wicked things, our mouthes vtter them, and our handes put them in practice. Thy mercies everie day are renewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, and our sinnes are everie day multiplied agaynst thee: In the day of health and prosperitie we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thee, and we never thinke vpon the day of sicknesse and adversitie.

Thou didst send thy Sonne in the fulnesse of time to take our nature vpon him, to fulfill thy law for vs, and to bee crucified for our sinnes: Wee haue not followed the example of his holie lyfe, but haue everie day afresh crucified him by our sinnes. And now, O LORD, if wee shall become our own judges, we cannot but confesse that wee haue deserved everlasting torments in hell-fire. But there is mercie with thee O Lord: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will wee not despare. Our sins are manie in number: But thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are without number. The weyght of our sinnes is great: But the weyght of thy Sonnes crosse was greater. Our sinnes presse vs downe vnto hell: But thy mercie in Christ Iesus rayseth vs vp. By Satan wee are accused: But by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ wee are defended. By the law wee are convicted: But by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ wee are justified. By our

In vs there is nothing but sinne, death, and damnation: In him there is treasured vp for vs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. lyfe, and salvation. Wee are poore: Hee is our riches.
