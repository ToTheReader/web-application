      <hi>A man can do no more then he can,</hi> giveth a just an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thereto. Great hath beene the weakenesse of my body, first occasioned by a very dangerous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease in <hi>August</hi> last (how low I was brought thereby,

many of you are witnesses) and further increased by two relapses, one in <hi>Nov.</hi> the other in <hi>Febr.</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> where he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that <hi>by the weakenesse of Ministers bodies the Churches commodities may be intercepted,</hi> concludeth that <hi>Ministers in such cases are not to be blamed.</hi> But howsoever my weakenesse were a just impediment to preaching (whereby the spirits of a feeble man are much exhausted) yet would I not make it a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text for wasting precious time in idlenesse.

Indeed on speciall occasions I have out of the pulpet delivered some of the points handled in these <hi>Treatises:</hi> but I never finished any of them. It is without question a point of prudence to eye the divine <hi>Providence</hi> in all things. For <note n="f" place="margin">

By a due observation hereof may our disposition to God be so ordered, as that, which God expecteth, be effected: namely <hi>Gratulation</hi> for his <hi>Favours</hi>: <hi>Humiliation</hi> for his <hi>Iudgements.</hi> Now are the times wherein clouds of Gods anger have obscured the bright skie of the Church. Pertinent therefore to the present times are the <hi>Treatises</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and in that respect the more profitable to us of these times. <note n="g" place="margin">Quo magis quid accomodum, eo magis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum est.</note>
      <hi>The more pertinent a point is, the more profitable it is.</hi> I could wish that there were not so just occasion of treating of the fore-said <hi>three ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,</hi> as there is. We have felt the bitternesse of the <hi>plague</hi> within these six yeares more then in many hundred yeares before in this land: which <hi>arrow</hi> is now againe shot against us: and how farre the venime thereof (for it is a venimous <hi>arrow)</hi> may infect, who knowes?

How much more justly may we take up that complaint against the Popish Clergy, <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, Monks, Priests, Friers,</hi> and the rest of that rabble?
