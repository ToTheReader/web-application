      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F that long worke I vndertooke some yeeres agoe, (whether well or ill) so much is after my fashion done, as were it well done, might iustly be accounted more then halfe In these present Meditations, conceiued in the sweetest calme of minde, and purest vacation from any crosse or molestation my God for manie yeers had giuen me, I haue endeauoured so to set forth the nature, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and vse of Christian faith, as if thou follow my method in thy practise thou shalt neuer I trust haue iust cause to feare lest thy faith ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen too fast, or proue vnsound at the root. Now the auoidance of these inconueniences, as in the preface to my first labours is specified, was amongst others, one principall occasion of my writing after so manie learned writers of this age. What then I purposed concerning this Argument, and some what more is at large exhibited in the Treatise following. For thy better direction to trace my foote-steps through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the principall passages thereof, otherwise not so much beaten as many of the like Argument are, may it please thee first to view my progresse in this short map or draught.</p>
   <p>Aswell of our owne as forraine writers, auncient and moderne, I found the most more forward to vrge a certainety of beleefe, as alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather necessarie vnto saluation, then clearly to teach how this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety could possibly fasten vpon obiects not euident to the beleeuer: such, notwithstanding the obiect of Christian saith are held by them that hold it morl certain, then the principles of any humane science.
<pb facs="8"/>
In the discussion of this difficultie <hi>(Section 1. Chapter 34. 5,)</hi> I doe not much differ from that graund light of the English Church, whose opinion (had I been aware of it, before this Treatise was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) might happily hane fashioned my conceipt vnto the form of words wherein he expresseth his, from which my phrase or dialect doth som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differ. In the maine point we well agree, that Faith is an <hi>assent</hi> as well vnto the <hi>goodnesse</hi> as vnto the <hi>truth</hi> of matters diuine. That which hee with some auncient Schoole men tearmes <hi>certainty of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence,</hi> is in my dialect, <hi>stability o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> firmnesse of beleefe;</hi> which. I deriue not so much from the euidence or certainty of things beleened, as from their worth and goodnesse. All of vs by nature adhere more firmly to things of great and knowne worth, then wee could doe vnto the very same, if their worth, either were in it selfe, or by vs estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, lesse, albei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> their certainty were equall. The next lesson which reason will hence learne is, That vnto some truths our adherence may be more firme then vnto others of greater euidence and certaintie, in case the former excell the later more in goodnesse then they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceeded by them in euidence and certaintie.</p>
   <p>But seeing with the Romanist we admit the nature of faith to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in <hi>Assent,</hi> we might perhaps be thought to confine it wholy (as hee doth) to the vnderstanding; an error iustly abandoned by most in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, who, in this respect (for the most part) either define it not by <hi>Assent,</hi> or else to make vp one entire and compleate definition, match <hi>Assent</hi> with other tearmes not so well consorting with it as the rules of art in my occasions require. To this purpose rather in defence of mine owne, then any waie to preiudice other mens methods, which must be measured by the end at which they aime, the first and second Chapters are premised. But some perhaps would reply, that <hi>Assent</hi> being terminated vnto truth, can haue no greater alliance with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then with those differences assigned vnto it by other writers, reiected by vs, not as false, but as not formall. And the obiection (to speake the truth) could not be put off as impertinent, did we follow the Romanist in another erroneous principle, not discouered, much lesse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by such as most oppugne them; from which principle notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the worst inconueniences can in this argument be obiected to their doctrine directly follow, and are not so cleerely or fully auoided by those that contradict them, as by vs that assent vnto them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining Christian faith by <hi>Assent.</hi> Not with the moderne pontifician
<pb facs="8"/>
onely, but generally amongst the schoolemen, <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>works</hi> are so dissociated, as if they were of linages altogether distinct, and had small or no affinity. Most protestant writers acknowledge them to be of entire blood, yet somewhat farther remoued then in my opinion they are. The principall reason whereof as I coniecture is, that they esteeme more of schoole-philosophy then schoole-diuinity, and with the schoole-men, specially <hi>Aquinas</hi> and his followers, imagine the will and vnderstanding, from which faith and good works in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauldry seuerally discend, to be faculties really distinct, like brother and sister, being indeed but two names, or titles of one and the same intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall nature; as <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>goodnesse</hi> (their supposed really diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent obiects) in matters morall differ onelie in degrees of apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as one and the same person knowne a farre off vnder the common notion of a man, is oft times cleerely discerned by his approach to be an honest man and our louing friend. Sutably to this true Philosophie, learned out of the best professors of that facultie, and to omitte other Schoole-men out of the wise and learned <hi>Gerson,</hi> I place faith neither in the wil nor vnderstanding, but in the intellectual nature, as subiect to both these titles or appellations. The inference hence taken is, that <hi>faith,</hi> although it be formally an <hi>Assent,</hi> may be as imediately termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the goodnesse, as vnto the truth of reuelations diuine. And these being of all the matters that can be reuealed or knowne, both in themselues, and in respect of vs, far the best: I make that faith which primarily distinguisheth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> true Christian from an hypocrite, or fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse professor of orthodoxall religion, to bee an assent or <hi>adherence</hi> vnto reuelations diuine, as much better then any contrary good the world, the diuell, or flesh can present to peruert our choice of what they prescribe for our sauing health, or habitually to interrapt or hinder the prosecution of their designes. By these deductions drawne forth at large in the sixth Chapter, the Reader may easily perceiue the linke betweene faith and works, to be most immediate and essentiall.</p>
   <p>This maine conclusion whereon the most of the Treatise following depends, is further confirmed <hi>(Chap. 7.)</hi> by instances of sacred wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ascribing all the victories of Gods Saints ouer the world, Diuell, or flesh, vnto faith, or apprehension of diuine promises, better then ought could come in competition with them; all backsliding into euill, or backwardnesse in good courses, vnto want of faith, or apprehension of Gods iudgements, or threatnings, as more terrible then any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb facs="9"/>
which man can deuise against his fellow creatures. Briefely the whole drift or scope of the Apostle from the later part of the tenth Chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> vnto the end of that Epistle, iumps fully with the former conclusion. Whereunto likewise the vsuall dialect of the holy spirit, when he speakes absolutely, not with reference to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecismes of hipocrites, or such as haue diuorced <hi>truth</hi> from <hi>honesty,</hi> or set <hi>words</hi> and <hi>works</hi> at variance, is exactly consonant. It is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally obserued by all interpreters of sacred writ, that the termes which it vseth to expresse the proper asts or exercises of sence and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, still include those affections or practique faculties, which are most homogeneall to them. The true reason whereof is not because hee who sees the heart, and inspires it with faith, speakes more vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or grosly, but rather more metaphysically then many Diuines or Philosophers doe; as supposing the truth before specified, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the identity of the wil and vnderstanding, with the essentiall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of truth and goodnesse in matters practicall. The consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hence inferred and exemplified at large in the eight and ninth Chapters are in briefe vnto this purpose. As the apprehension of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine infalibility breeds an infallibility of perswasion, or sure reliance vpon his promises: so assent vnto his goodnes or imitable attributes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulates our soules to them. Euery obiect rightly apprehended or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood imprints it similitude vpon the apprehensiue faculty. The diuine nature therfore must leaue an impression or stampe in our soules as well of his goodnesse, as of his veracity: otherwise wee apprehend him who is essentially as good as true without any liuely apprehension of his goodnesse. This stampe or character of goodnesse diuine, is as a touch to drawe the soule, as the Adamant doth the iron after it selfe: and in this adherence of the intellectiue nature (once touched with grace) vnto the celestiall promises the definition of sauing faith is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished <hi>(Chap. 9.):</hi> whose generall or cheefe properties are set foorth <hi>(Chap. 10.).</hi> For conclusion of the first Section <hi>(Chap. 11.).</hi> I notefie the principall errors of the Ramish Church, partly because method so required, partly for more commodious solution of some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties obiected by them in the point of instification, but principally for expugning their doctrine of merits by works, which as it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely false, so it is more abhominable in them then in vs it could bee, because their workes can bee but dead being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eparated from the life of faith by which ours, so we practise as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap> teach, are truely quickned.
<pb facs="9"/>
The controuersie itselfe I must refer to the article of <hi>CHRISTS</hi> comming vnto iudgement.</p>
   <p>The second part of this Treatise aduiseth for the directing of faith aright vnto it proper end, and that wee suppose to be firme adherence vnto Gods mercies in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> or inseparable vnion with this our head. Of this end many that seeke saluation by <hi>CHRIST</hi> vsually faile by these meanes especially; First, by defectiue or misgrounded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions of faiths inherence before they haue it, or of great loue and loyalty to their Redeemer, when as they remaine in the same gall of bitternesse that the heathens did, which persecuted all true professors of his Gospell, or the Iewes which put him to death. The first roots or generall originals of these dangerous misperswasious are handled <hi>(Chap. 1.).</hi> The poysonous sap or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ce of Gentilisme and Iudaisme thence propagated to most Protestants, Papists, or others professing the name of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and boasting themselues to be the onely braunches of the true and naturall oliue, is discouered in the second and third Chapters. The conclusion arising from these instances or inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is, that faith in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> connot be truely notified but by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere loue, nor such loue to him otherwise knowne then by doing his fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers will, or obseruing his commaundements: and in obseruing some or many of these, wee may be so zealous as to lay downe our liues, and vndoe our selues and our posterity, rather then leaue them vndone, or transgresse them, and yet proue but Pseud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

The issue of the fourth Chap. wherein the qualification required to Martyrdome with other like points are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at large, is that the sincerity of our faith &amp; loue must be tryed by an vnpartial and vniform obseruation of all Gods commandements, as is proued in the Chap. following; first by the anthorities of <hi>Siracides,</hi> a man well ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="10"/>
      <hi>Paules</hi> disputes, within whose limits is included that vniformity of works, which Saint Iames requires vnto iustification or saluation; by whose Apostolicall authority the former conclusion is refortified. In perusing of this first Chapter recall to minde, or haue recourse vnto the points set downe <hi>(Chap. 8. Sect. 1.)</hi> and vnto those passages of the eleauenth, wherein the different value or diuerse acceptions of faith in Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>Iames</hi> are discussed.</p>
   <p>Others againe faile of the former end of faith. i. (vnion with CHRIST, or reconciliation with God by his mediation) either by inuerting the vse of faith, or by mistaking the measure of sanctifying graces necessary to saluation. The former error is peculiar to the Romanist, who labours to misperswade himselfe and others, that faith is giuen him as a bare foundation of other graces, or as a talent for fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to traffique with, vntill he obtaine such a full measure of inherent righteousnesse, as shall immediately acquite him of all reckonings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his Creator and him, by expelling all reliques or slaine of sinne as vtterly out of his soule as the water doth the ayre out of the vessell which it filleth vp to the very brimme. The dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this errour are handled at large (<hi>Chap.</hi> 6. and 7.) And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vse and measure of faith and other graces inherent I reduce the controuersie of iustification, here inserted, contrary to my first intent; least otherwise I might haue ministred some offence vnto the Church wherein I liue, or left some scruple in the Readers minde, how faith should iustifie without works; the linke or bond betweene them being so strict and essentiall as I make it, almost identicall. The same doubt naturally offered it selfe from the discussion of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, partly in the Chapter precedent, partly in the last Chapter of the the first Section. Out of sundry other passages of this discourse it likewise apeares, that the works required to iustification by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> are virtually included in the faith whereto Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth iustification: whence, it may seeme to imply a contradiction in the very tearmes, to say we are iustified by faith alone without workes, if in iustifying faith works necessarily he included.</p>
   <p>As the Trent Councels doctrine which vpon penalty of damnation exacts a measure of inherent righteousnesse, whereof mortality is not capable, nurseth finall doubting or despaire, so others in opposition to it, minister occasion of carelesnesse or presumption either by not vrging such a measure of perfection as Gods word requires, or
<pb facs="10"/>
by deeming that sufficient enough to saluation, although it bee sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to iustification. Whereas hee that can once fully perswade himselfe he is actually iustified, will not easily bee brought to doubt whether he want ought necessarie to saluation. All of vs that haue forsaken the Romish Church rightly acknowledge the end and vse of faith to consist in calling vpon the name of the Lord in the daie of euill and temptation, and that all such as call vpon him faithfully shall bee saued. But many of vs are either much mistaken by our hearers, or else deceiue our selues in imagining faithfull inuocation of Gods name through Christ to be one of the easiest points or operations of faith, being indeede the most difficult, because the finall seruice, whereunto all other obedience to his Lawes, and daily wrestlings with flesh and blood doe but inure vs, as souldiers in the time of peace and truce are trained against the day of battell. All persecutions or exercise of our patience are in respect of this last conflict with hell and death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in victory is obtained, onely through faith in Christ, but as playing at foiles in a fence schoole to better skill and courage in triall of masteries at sharpe. These and like points are handled in the two last Chapters of this second section not so fully as these times require but large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for hints to popular sermons.</p>
   <p>The third and last Section shewes the necessity and vse of humane industry for attaining vnto the faith, whose nature and properties are set forth in the first; notwithstanding that such faith is the sole gift of God, not wrought in part by vs but wholy created by him. The points whereto our endeauours must bee addressed, thou shalt easily perceiue by the titles of the Chapters; onely let mee request thee to beare in mind Chap. 6. of Section 1. whi est thou readest the fowrth of this third: as also to compare Chap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>. of Section 1. with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>. of this.</p>
   <p>Order of doctrine did require that I should set down the nature &amp; properties of that faith by which the iust doth liue, before I admonish for auoidance of misper swasions concerning the present cossession, right vse, or regiment of it, and these againe were to be preuented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I direct for the right planting of it. Notwithstanding, he that desires to bee a doe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> not a hearer onely of the truth, must beginne where I end, and first practise the rules giuen in the last Section, and so proceed to the first and second. Thus he shall finde euery Section suited to the three branches of his vowe made in Baptisme, as they are set downe in the Catechisme authorised by our Church. The first;
<pb facs="11"/>
      <hi>To for sake the Diuell and all his workes, the pompes and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this wicked world, and all the sinfull lusts of the flesh.</hi> [The third Section expounds the meaning of this resolution, shewing withall that serious endeauours to performe it are ordinarily prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the infusion of faith.]</p>
   <p>The second <hi>To beleeue all the articles of the Christian faith]</hi> The nature and properties of this beliefe, are set downe in the first Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The third <hi>to keep Gods holy will and commaundements, and to walke in the same all the daies of this life.</hi> How beleefe of the Creed doth enable vs to this obseruance, is partly shewed in the first but more fully in the second Section; wherein likewise is handled at large, how far we are bound to obserue Gods commaundements. How necessary prayers are, eyther for attaining to this perfection, or for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution from all our sins after faith is infused; (which is an other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part of that Catechisme,) the Reader may be informed by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the same Section: what it shall please any well-affected to aduise me of, as eyther defectiue or amisse in this Treatise, shal by Gods assistance be amended in my exposition of that Catechisme, a worke vpon speciall occasions, lately begun for the benefit of the vnlearned.</p>
   <p>Besides these generalls, euery part of this Treatise hath a peculiar vse for more commodious explication of the articles following. The last Section hath speciall reference to the Article of euerlasting life. The second to the articles of CHRISTS death his passion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto iudgement; and containes withall an Elench of those vulgar fallacies, which must be auoided before we come to search what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety of iustification or saluation may be had in this life, or of whom it may be expected. The handling of these fallacies in my first inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was referred in the Articles <hi>concerning Christ and remission<note place="margin">Vide prefat. ad librum 1. pag. 6</note> of sinnes.</hi> The first Section hath a transcendent vse throughout all the Articles following, what peculiar reference the seuerall passages of it haue to particular Articles wil better apeare in their seuer a explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; wherunto my next labors are now consecrated. God of his infinite mercy assist meinwardly with his grace, and blesse me outwardly with that measure of health, of vacancy from other businesse, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer meanes, he knowes fittest for his seruice.</p>
