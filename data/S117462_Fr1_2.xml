   <head>TO THE MOST RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father in God, George <hi>by the Divine providence, Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe</hi> of Canterbury, Primate and Metropolitan of England, and <hi>one of his Maiesties most Honorable privie Councell, Grace and peace.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apostolicall times, from the Apostolicall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine (Most Reverend) haue incited me to write this <hi>Probleme.</hi> It may seeme strange to some, that future heresyes should be thus preuented: but howsoeuer it seeme strange to some, it is not strange to the enlightened and sanctified: for first, he that knewe what was to come, endited
<pb facs="3"/>the holy scriptures: he I say that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> &amp;c. <hi>Quae sunt, et erunt, quaeque ante fuere.</hi>

   <p>Secondly in those tymes in which the holy Scriptures were written, there were the same wits, the same corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the same enemy of mankind, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the diuell, which are in our tymes: therefore no maruell, if there be the same opinions, The heathen philosopher said that the same opinions in philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy were renewed and so it is in diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> haue renewed the opinions of the <hi>Enthusiastes.</hi> the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines</hi> defend <hi>Pelagius</hi> his opinions. and haue not the <hi>Vbiquitaryes</hi> also brought <hi>Eutyches</hi> his opinion againe vpon the stage? Cut off <hi>Hydras</hi> heads, and more will springe vp. I will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer this pointe in any more words. It remayneth then that I craue pardon, for that I haue troubled your Grace with so small a Treatise: but your Lord-shipe
<pb facs="3"/>knoweth that <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. If therefore <hi>Bene</hi> be in this booke, and <hi>Well</hi> be in this worke, it is certaine that much is in the same. But this I leaue to your Grace to iudge of, as I doe allso to the Church of God. The spirits of the Prophets are subiect to the Prophets. The Lord of Lordes multiply his graces vpon you to the good of his Church, and your euerlasting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
