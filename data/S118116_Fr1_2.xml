<pb facs="3"/> pure, without the least taint or tincture of corruption (like waters in their own Source and Fountaine) yet the <hi>Waters of Marah</hi> have been round about you, and no doubt, but your <hi>Grace</hi> hath had a taste (no lesse than others of that Hierarchy) of their <hi>Gall of Bitternesse.</hi> Witnes their <hi>divine Tragedies</hi> and <hi>impudent Appeales;</hi> their late <hi>Curranto's,</hi>

   <p>Pardon this Digression, most Reverend Father. Obscure men may, without offence, deplore the miseries they cannot redresse; Those that are more eminent, may doe both. A <hi>Generall Harmony,</hi> aswell in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> as in <hi>Discipline</hi> is yet wanting in the <hi>publike practice</hi> of our Church, though not in the <hi>Principles</hi> thereof; which is the maine Anvile most of my Sermons ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer on; where, though you shall meete, belike, with much <hi>dust</hi> and <hi>rubbish,</hi> yet there is a way begunne to a <hi>richer Myne,</hi> which more elaborate and higher wits may <hi>dig</hi> after, if they please.
