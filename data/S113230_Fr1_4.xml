      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are almost euery where throughe Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie scattred abrode certayne Questions, written or Printed, and that to the ende the professoures of the gospel, and especially such as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst thē are vnlerned, might by them be troubled, broughte into doute, and as it were quite driuen from the gospel, as from a newe, doubtfull, false and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt doctrine. For some of these Questions are so coloured with scriptures, that at the first sight they seme to haue some shew of truth. But they all shute to this marke, that they may thruste in and plant, not the true church of Christ and his doctrine, but the churche of Rome, her doctrine,

manners, statutes, and other abuses. Whereby it comes to passe by the infirmitie of man, and by reason of persecutions, that many cōceiue an euil opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and lothsomnesse of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and that chiefely when they see there is no man to instructe them, strengthen and comforte them. Wherfore when by some I was requested to make some breefe and plaine answere to the said Questions, and somewhat to open the matter, that bothe they might perceiue how to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande those places of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as also see that oure reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grounded on the Gospell, is not suche as they slaunder it to be, I toke that matter in hande: And applied my diligence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the true religion (as indede it is the duetie of euerye good
<pb facs="10"/>
Christian) to comfort the godly and suche as were afflicted, and according to the talent giuen me of God (for without his helpe all mans doing is but vayne) I answered the .lxi. questions, for so many came vnto my hands, &amp; therfore whether there be more or lesse in other places I know not. Wherfore I beseeche thee good Christian Reader to take this my trauell in good parte, and follow the Counsell of S. Paule, who byddeth thee to proue all thinges, and to keepe that which is good. And thus much more I say for their sakes that shall eyther reade or heare this Treatise, that if they bee weeried wyth the contentions and strifes in Religion, and the sharpe tauntes that oftentimes fall out in that cause, I haue in
<pb facs="11"/>
this Booke cheefelye laboured to teache the matter moste brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly and playnly, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all heate of contention, to Gods glory, and the profitable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>difying of the godly. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tycles or Common places which are touched in these lxj. Articles, I haue here breefly set, folowing in order.</p>
