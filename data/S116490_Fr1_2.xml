      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>OMEwhat later thā I gladly wold, howbeit not with lesse forwardnesse too acknowledge howe muche I am beholdē vnto you, nor with lesse cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of youre freendly accepting of my small trauel, I offer to your curtesie this token of my good wyll, For besides your other friendly dealings, both before and since, I confesse your goodnesse to haue bin such and so great towards me all the whyle I soiorned at Barwicke, in the time that you were Marshal there, as I may not forget it without iust blame of vnthankfulnes. Resting therefore assuredly vpon the continuance of the same, which I perceiue by diuers prooues to bee both deeplyer settled in you, and more
<pb facs="3"/>
increased towards me: I am bolde to put foorth this little treatize vnder your name. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bycause I am fully perswaded, that vntoo you which haue bin trayned vp welneere as it were from the shell in martial affayres of this world, and there through haue had experience of aduersities and troubles, and do delight still to hazarde your self for honour in the seruice of your prince &amp; country, it wil be neither te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious nor vnacceptable to heare and consider of this kinde of <hi>Warfare</hi> also. For although it be not of like nature, nor to be atcheeued with like furniture, pompe and brute, as the warres of this worlde are woont too bee: Yet doth it farre passe them, both in noblenesse of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, in valiantnesse of souldiers, in greatnesse of perill▪ in certaintie of conquest, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of victorie. For in those warres, the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines (be they kings or keyzars) are but mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal men, subiect to al the same inconueniences that the rest of their souldiers are, neither able to defende their souldiers nor themselues frō the stroke of Mars and death: but in this, the Captaines are God the maker of heauen and earth, and his sonne Iesus Christ, the Lorde of life and death, whom no sword, speare, arrow, curryer nor can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n can hurt, no nor hit, and which is able both to saue his seruāts frō deth, and too rayse thē when they be dead. In those
<pb facs="3"/>
the souldier doth in deed indure trauel, labour, watching, harde fare, colde, weat, heate, long seege, penurie, thirst, famine, wounds, &amp; death, howbeit al these haue often intermissions, and long ceasings, and commonly an ende by vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie in fewe battels: But in this, besides the suffering of all the sayde inconueniences and many moe, the souldier must stande continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally armed, continually watching, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually fyghting: then most ware to defende himselfe, when he seemeth most to haue foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his enimie: scarce atteyning so much as a breathing time, and neuer looking for finall victorie, but by his owne death. In those, the souldyer is at peace with himselfe, he hath fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes to sticke to him and to help him, and he hath none other enimies than such as are of Flesh and bloud, as himselfe is: but in this, hee must be at vtter defiance with himself, he must hate himselfe, he muste abyde the brunt alone without helpe of mortall wight, nay all mortal helpes are so far frō doing him good, that they rather hurt him: and more ouer, he must main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne battell both against visible and inuisible enimies: and being but one, he must euermore incounter hande to hand against three, of whō the weakest is able to subdue a whole worlde of people, if God assist them not from aboue. In those, the greatest perilles are but the losse
<pb facs="4"/>
of helth, limmes, libertie, possessiōs, &amp; life, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che being dispatched by death (the ende of all worldly miserie) shalbe restored againe in their due season: or else the losse of honour and good name, the stayne and infamie whereof is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne and ceasseth in lengthe of time. But in this, he that cowardly yeeldeth himselfe to his enemie, and is finally ouercome without recouerie, forgoeth the freedome of a good conscience, casteth himselfe into all kinde of wretchednesse, &amp; lozeth both body and soule, to be plunged in euerlasting darknes, tormēt, confusion, sorow, and shame. In those, neither the multitude of souldiers, nor the strength of munitions, nor the store of artillerie, nor the wisedome &amp; pollicie of the Captaines, nor the aduantage of the groūd, nor the ayde of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie friends and alyances, can warrant victorie: but in this, whosoeuer hath but only an assured fayth in Iesus Christ, is sure to outstande al as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, to abyde all bruntes, too beare backe all darts, to warde all blowes, and finally to wade out of all dangers with glad conquest &amp; ioyful victorie. To be short, in those, the rewarde of victory is but eyther the spoyle of the enemy, the gaine of some Citie or countrie, the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of hateful crueltie by beastly reuenge, or (which the worlde counteth the greatest price of al such perils) the blasing abrode of the name
<pb facs="4"/>
with renowne, whyle the harte broyleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the conscience of his owne miserie: but in this, to him that getteth the vpper hand is giuen quietnesse of conscience in the middes of woe, mirth of hart in the mids of sorow, ioy of minde in the midds of torment, happinesse in the mids of mizerie, comfort in deepest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, a gladsome life, a blisful death▪ and after death (which in deede is no death, but a sweete and ioyful rest) a crowne of euerlasting glory, a garland of rightuousnesse, a name of eternal honour, a robe of vnappayrable innocencie, a scepter of incomparable strength, a throne of heauenly maiestie, the fruition of the tree of life the perpetual presence of God, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of Iesus Christ, the felowship of the holy Angels, the society of al gods children, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of heauen, the possessiō of Paradise, endlesse ioy, felicity and blessednes, and finally vnutterable abundance of such good things, as no eye hath seene, eare heard, nor hart of man is able to cōceiue. This is the war that becōmeth a noble minde, a wise minde, a valeant minde, a godly mind. This is the right way to the true worship, honour and renowne, which can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be had by inheritance, nor giuen or taken away at the will of mortal men, but cometh of god. It is not for cowardly, for childish, for nice, for tender, nor for effeminate folke too deale
<pb facs="5"/>
herewithal. Strong chalendges require stout Champions. Stout I say not in wordes or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance nor in peeuishnesse or pryde of harte, but in fayth, in spirite, and in patience through the knowledge of Christ and his glorious go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell. Therefore according to that knowledge and wisedome which God hath giuen you by the often hearing and reading of his word (see how the goodnesse of the matter caryeth mee into great boldnes with you) buckle yourselfe to this incounter of al other the most honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, most glorious, and most assured, after the example of our Sauiour Christ, who for the great excellencie of the glorie that was set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, despysed al aduersities, afflictions and death, and notwithstanding that hee was the son of God, yet lerned obedience by the things that he suffered. For (as saith the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) If we suffer with him we shal also be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed with him. VVherevnto that both you and we may attayne, I beseech him to graunte vs abundantly the grace of his holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Amen. VVritten at London the xvj of Ianuary 1576.</p>
