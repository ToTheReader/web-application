   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RABLE THE LORD <hi>BVCKHVRST,</hi> L. High Treasurer of England. The Lord <hi>Henrie Howard,</hi> L. Warden of the Cinq-Ports: and the Lord <hi>Cecill</hi> of <hi>Esenden,</hi> Principall Secretarie of Estate to the Kings Maiestie, and of his Highnesse most honourable Priuie-Counsell.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE NVMBER IS BVT</hi> small, (at least not very great) of men so sencelesse or weake of iudgement, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inconveniences they readily see, and can easily discerne. Notwithstanding, to find out the grounds of publique harmes, and the meanes how to cure them, is a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die so intricate, &amp; a practise so dangerous; that wary men hold it safer to prouide for priuate ease (in regard of the times) then to busie theyr wits for anie <hi>common-good.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But how aduised soeuer, and respectiuely wise in this kinde, the most sort seeme to be, as wishing onely that all might goe well, though not long of themselues: fewe or none are found of so still a temper, as not to complaine, when publique greefes worke theyr owne sencible smart.</p>
   <p>Such then as by long and extraordinary patience supping vp theyr priuate wrongs, haue endeuoured to giue way to the streame of publick contumelies, in hope of better dayes: must needes be excused if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelld at the last by lawlesse necessitie, to referre euents to GODS prouidence, in discharge of their Duties to <hi>Him,</hi> their <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> they vndertake the defence of their owne reputations in a Cause publicke and generall. The rather, when as without purpose of offence towards any, their Intentions appeare, to giue onely a reason of such Disorders in their present Functions, as for want of serious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, or true Information, haue hetherto by Iealousie and miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
<pb facs="3"/>yeelded matter and occasions from time to time of their speciall Disgraces and obloquie.</p>
   <p>Such and none other, was the drift and scope of a late Discourse of the present Estate of Customes, not so publiquely printed, as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately directed <hi>To the Graue and godly vvise in highest Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,</hi> by the Title and Inscription of <hi>THE CVSTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MERS APOLOGIE.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But. <hi>Pro captu Lectoris habent sua fata Libelli.</hi> For the booke being written for <hi>vnderstanding Readers,</hi> and so digested, that by reading alone, without passion or partialitie, such might be their own and onely Iudges; hath notwithstanding, by the <hi>Ignorant</hi> beene late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly censured, and strangly mistaken. Vainely striuing to commend &amp; make good that within Booke, which neuer was in question: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously vrging some things without Booke, that neuer were meant by words nor writing to be defended. But with such successe as still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls <hi>Folly,</hi> who delighting to see her owne shadow daunce, hath not the grace to conceale her owne shame.</p>
   <p>¶ About such time as by the goodnes of GOD, the light of the Gospell beganne to lay open the Errors of Superstion in these parts of the world, and by the hands of our <hi>Soueraignes</hi> to disperce them in this Kingdome: many Questions were mooued to vphold sundry poynts of the Popish religion; but none so hotly disputed for the time, as that which they terme the <hi>Sacrament of the Alter,</hi> and <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saints.</hi> Whereof amongst others, a certaine young Scholler more confident then wise, hauing vndertaken a serious Defence: as one sicke of loue with the thing he had begotten, and ambiciously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the publishing of it; entreated a learned friend of his, &amp; well-minded to the Cause, to read it ouer. The request was performed. But looking for Arguments sitting the Question, When nothing was found but a needlesse labour, to approoue and maintaine by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick CREEDE, That IESVS CHRIST, was the true SONNE of GOD, very GOD, and very MAN that redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Worlde:</hi> And that there was also a <hi>COMMVNION OF SAINTS.</hi> The Booke was returned without applaude, or shew of satisfaction.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>RIGHT HONORABLE.</hi> Such hath beene of late yeeres, the successe of a like learned Writer, who printing, <hi>A Treatise of publique Commerce,</hi> in fauour of the priuate Societie of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants-Aduenturers,</hi> hath with much a-doe, and a heape of sillie words, (farre vnfitting the grauitie of his Theame) endeuoured to
<pb facs="3"/>perswade his Readers, <hi>That Trafficke rightly ordered, is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Kings, and prosperitie of Kingdoms:</hi> And that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> in that respect, <hi>were to be cherished, fauoured, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in all Common-wealths.</hi> Quia <hi>VITA CIVILIS IN SOCIETATE POSITA EST, SOCIETAS AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEM IN IMPERIO ET COMMERCIO.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It is strange to obserue, what strong apprehentions are able to worke in weake mens braines. For as a plaine simple man was sometimes perswaded, that if <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> had not beene a Saint, the Apostles would neuer haue suffered his Name to stand in the <hi>Creede:</hi> so this <hi>Treatise-Writer,</hi> by a strong imagination of the <hi>Merchant-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers</hi> extraordinary deserts: seeing the admirable effects of the golden blessings of England, by turning <hi>Creekes</hi> into <hi>Ports,</hi>

   </p>
   <p>With this and such like stuffe the Booke beeing confusedly fraught, <hi>(cuius contrarium verissimum est,)</hi> might well haue beene suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue dyed in the birth, if withall it had not beene mingled with aspertions of obloquy &amp; vntruthes against <hi>CVSTOMERS of the Out-Ports of the Realme.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>CVSTOMERS.</hi> A kinde of Creatures capable of Religion aswell as Reason: free Men by birth, and of best education. Men euery way happy, saue in their Names and Callings: and in nothing more wretched then in the Places of their Functions. <hi>The Out-Ports of the Realme.</hi>
      <note place="margin">London the onely Port of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. all other Ports are counted but Out-Ports, to London.</note> O holy <hi>LONDON!</hi> Men I say, that being by the curious eye of the Law, <hi>Chosen of the best,</hi> and placed in the ranke <hi>of the most sufficient</hi> that Wisedome can finde, or choise af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; would faine retaine the reputations,<note place="margin">The Law is as carefull in the choise of a Customer, as of a Shriefe of the Shiere.</note> if not of <hi>Saints,</hi> yet at the least of <hi>Christians,</hi> and plaine <hi>honest Men.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To let it therefore in some sort appeare, that it is not enough for Men affecting their owne good &amp; credits by <hi>Traffick,</hi> to value theyr worths by disgracing of others; and that by such kind of Imputations &amp; Shifts,<note place="margin">Customers are no Prophets; to gesse by the Goods, of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Owner is, it beeing a mysterie among Merchants, to lend hands, and culloure one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others dealing.</note> as none but Merchants (perhaps themselues that thus byte and whine,) onely or most vsually commit, and is not in the <hi>Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> power to preuent or amend: that which ensueth, hath beene wrung from them by way of further Defence. For though it might be said, That to aunswere all priuate oppositions were fruitlesse, and to no end: yet least he that runnes alone, should still thinke himselfe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most: to satisfie <hi>Wisedome</hi> and <hi>Authoritie</hi> it selfe,<note place="margin">The Treatise hath beene twice printed at Midleburge and Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and dedicated to the Lord Cecill.</note> I haue beene prouoked (by words &amp; writings) out of other Mens labours and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer experience, (as by way of witnes) to make good that for <hi>Traffick,</hi> which the <hi>Apologie</hi> before did but tenderly touch, and briefelie set downe.</p>
   <p>Besides. Not to shew the decay of those Effects which both main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Customers</hi> Credits, and giue Essence to their Functions, by the occasions of the Ecclyps in their <hi>Cause Efficient:</hi> were wittingly to betray the generall <hi>good</hi> of all Men, &amp; worthily to set down in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall obloquy. And publique slaunders are not washt off but by
<pb facs="4"/>publicke Defence.</p>
   <p>For <hi>TRAFFICK</hi> therefore: <hi>Customers</hi> beeing bound, and bold to contend, the aduancement whereof, like Hony in Hiues, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth Customes.<note n="*" place="margin">The childish commendation of <hi>Trafficke,</hi> by the <hi>Treatise-writer.</hi> Page. 3.</note>
      <hi>Not that Commerce, which children as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as theyr tongues are at liberty doe season their sports by: Nor that which Weomen among themselues doe chop and change by:</hi> But that <hi>TRAFFICK</hi> whose Lawes at the Standart of Equitie, wey out Order, (not by priuate Discretion, nor partiall Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) but by the weight of generall Iustice. Whose <hi>Merchants</hi> are Persons all euery where Loyall and friendly. Whose <hi>Ports</hi> &amp; <hi>Staples</hi> at home, <hi>Markets</hi> &amp; <hi>Marts</hi> at home &amp; abroade, are places for accesse conueniently <hi>easie,</hi> and for safety generally <hi>free.</hi> And whose <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise,</hi> for <hi>Matter</hi> honest, for <hi>Vse</hi> profitable, by <hi>Nature</hi> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and by <hi>Art</hi> made amiable, is at all handes vendible onely for the <hi>Goodnes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>That <hi>TRAFFICK,</hi> I say, whose diuine Elixar <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> the quintessence of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> applied to Materialls, breedes Misteries in <hi>Trades,</hi> turnes <hi>Trades</hi> into Mettals, and all Mettals into pure Siluer, and fine Golde. The restauring power whereof, easing all griefes in Sores, suppling all Sores in diseases, and curing all Diseases in particular Members, holdes the whole Bodies of <hi>Kingdomes</hi> in health. Lastlie: That <hi>TRAFFICK</hi> which concernes <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> whose seate is euery where the <hi>Soueraignes</hi> bosome. Whose voyce well tuned, is the harmonie of the World, To whom <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Countries</hi> owe fealtie and homage, the meanest <hi>Subiects</hi> feeling her care, &amp; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <hi>Princes</hi> subiect to her prouidence.

To the end, I say, that by other mens complaints, as well as <hi>Customers,</hi> the world may see how hunted, restrained, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolised, and ill beholden, that <hi>TRAFFICK</hi> is &amp; hath been to all <hi>priuate Societies.</hi> In the Fore-Ranck whereof I set the<note n="*" place="margin">This is heere added, onely that the <hi>Treatise-writer</hi> might exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the grounds of his ovvne folly or frenzie in taxing Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers as friends to the <hi>Haunces,</hi> by speaking against his <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants-Aduenturers.</hi> To whom, as to <hi>Subiects,</hi> onely for their <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignes</hi> sake, they wish all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and loue, but reuerence ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as <hi>absolute Princes.</hi>
