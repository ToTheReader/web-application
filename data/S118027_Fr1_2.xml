Forbes, pastour of the English Church at Middelburgh : vnto certen of the companie of marchands adventurers at Stoade, at their earnest desire, for resolving this question: how a Christian man may discerne the testimonie of Gods spirit, from the testimonie of his owne spirit, in witnessing his adoption. And now againe renewed and enlarged by the authour, at the desire of divers good Christians, for the comfort of their troubled co [n] sciences, and published by those of his flocke, to whom he did dedicate it for the publike vse of the Church</title>
