Paul is to be harkned vnto of the Gentles es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially.</note> vessell, which in the Hebrew phrase is an organ or instrument, elected whereby his name should be spred abrod thoroughout the whole world. And the name of the Lord we know is Iesus Christ. Nether did <hi>Paul</hi> preach amongst y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Bētiles these let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters only or words or soūdes, but also those things whiche are by them signified: namely that Iesus Christ is the sauiour of mankind, also our wisedome, righteousnes, and sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and finally whatsoeuer good thing we haue. And forasmuch as we come of the stocke of the Gentiles, we right chiefely to harken vnto him, which aboue others was appoynted the maister and Apostle of the Gentiles, and was thereunto sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from his mothers wombe. And as valiant souldiers, and couragious horses, when they heare theyr trumpet blow, do erect themselues do make redy theyr wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, neyther can theyr force be restrayned: so ought we, when <hi>Paul</hi> is recited, or whē we rede him by our selues, to erect our minds, and all our motiōs, endeuors &amp; appetites to the obedience of God, as men which fele our selues stirred vp by our owne trūpet. And to what office this Apostle was appointed, he declared in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Acts of the apostles when he made his oration to <hi>Agrippa</hi> the king: when he sayd, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the lord had said vnto him, <hi>For to this end haue I appeared to thee, to appoint thee a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
      <note place="margin">What was the ministe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry of Paul</note>
      <hi>and a witnes, both of those things which thou hast sene, and of those thinges in which I will appeare vnto thee, deliuering thee from the people and nations, to whome I now send thee: that thou mayst open theyr eyes, that they may be conuerted from darkenes to light, and frō the power of Sathan to God: that they may receaue forgeuenes of sinnes, and inheritance amongest them which are sanctified by fayth in me.</hi> And with how great diligence <hi>Paul</hi> executed this office, it is manifest, when as towards the end of this epistle he writeth, that from Ierusalem to Illiricum, he had filled all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces rounde about, with the Gospell. which thing he with so feruent a minde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that in the 20. chapiter of the Actes he in effect spake these wordes to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians, <hi>I haue by the space of three yeares preached the Lord, and that night and day,</hi>
      <note place="margin">How Paul behoued himselfe in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</note>
      <hi>with many teares, and haue opened vnto you all the counsel of God: I haue not coueted any mans gold or siluer amongst you, these handes haue ministred to my necessities, and to thē that were with me.</hi> These wordes haue a wonderful emphasis: He sayth that he had preached vnto them not one day or twayn, but whole 3. yeres: not by turnes &amp; times, but night &amp; day: not with a cold affection, but with many teares: not guile fully or disceitfully, for he opened vnto thē all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> coūsel of God: not in a quiet &amp; peace able state, when as the Hebrues sought sundry and manifold ways to destroy him: neither had he a regard to his owne thinges, when as he desired nothing that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned to any man: neyther finally tooke he small paynes in this office, when as<note place="margin">In what sort all men ought to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate Paul.</note> with his owne handes he gott thinges necessary both for himselfe and his. These thinges can not we without shame heare, which so leue destitute our wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, famely, frendes, kinsfolkes, and cosins, and finally all those with whome we are conuersant, that we neuer at any time preach either Christ or his doctrine vnto thē: vnto whō yet we ought most feruently to preach. For we are no lesse Apostles to these, then <hi>Paul</hi> was appointed for y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Gentiles. And whē as he sayth y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he had ope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned vnto thē all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> counsels of God, it is to be wondred at, how that many will so with tooth and nayle hold fast things as necessary to saluation, which we know of what Bishoppes of Rome, and of what counsels, &amp; of what decrees of men they were brought in, and are not prescribed vnto vs of <hi>Paul,</hi> nor of any part of the holy scripture. <hi>Paul</hi> for the better executing of his office, contēned wonderful great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: and where he saw the gate open thither he slacked not to go, although he had many aduersaries which sought to withstand him. He was made all thinges to all men, to the Iewes a Iew, and to those that were without the law, as one that
<pb facs="7"/> wanted the law: Yea and to the Ethnikes; whē as they had no skill in the prophets<note place="margin">Why Paul some times in his sermōs vsed verses of Poets. Paul came to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre hys gospel with the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. What fruit is to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for of counsels. That Paule at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the church. wāted not fruite. Paul was not of the meane sort. Paul was most studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the law. Of those thinges which are sayd to be done of a good entēt. From whence the epistle to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians was written. Why Paul spake more gently tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching the obseruyng of the law to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, thē to the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians. Pauls se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary was named Tertius. From whence these let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were geuen. Argumēts whereby the Iewes thought that the Gentles were to be excluded from the Gospell.</note> neither had any knowledge in the scriptures, he cited verses out of theyr Poets, as out of <hi>Aratus, Menander,</hi> and <hi>Epinemides.</hi> And the same Paul was not aferd to go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ierusalem to conferre the Gospell with the chiefe Apostles, not as though he had small confidence in his doctrine, which he had receaued from the Lord out of heauen: for he had an assured persuasion, and as the Greaciās say such a <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, that he pronounced him to be <hi>Anathema</hi> or accursed, which preached any other Gos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pel: neither as touching this thing spared he the angels. Neither is it any meruail, for such a certaintie fayth requireth. Wherefore we learne, that Counsells are not to this end to be called, as though our fayth ought to depend of theyr determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but that there we should make manifest, that those thinges which we beleue exactly agree with the holy scriptures, and playnly to proue the same to our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. Neither is there any more fruite or commodity therehence to be looked for. The louing mercy also of God prouided, that that also turned to good to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Church that <hi>Paul</hi> had at the beginning so vebemently persecuted it. For they which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward saw him sodenly cōuerted vnto Christ, could not beleue, that this could haue happened with out the mighty power of God. For as a man doth not vpon the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> become most vile, so also is not a man of a wicked man straight way made most holy, vnles the Spirite of God worke the same. <hi>Paul</hi> was none of the commō and meane sort, he was not an obstinate Iewe, which wanted learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but he was most studious in the law: neither had he bent his study to it only, but also applied himselfe to the traditions of the fathers. And thereof it came, that he persecuted the Church of Christ. For if he had geuen himselfe to the law of God only, without adding vnto it the leuen of humane traditions, he should the easelier haue acknowledged Christ. But whosoeuer haue addicted themselues to humane traditions, they must nedes be persecuters of the Church of Christ. They say that <hi>Paul</hi> did these thinges of a good pretence, and not of an euill purpose, but of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entent (as they vse to speake) For my part as I confesse, that this somewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minisheth the greauousnes of the sinne both before God and before man (for I do not make all sinnes a like) so also affirme I that the case is thereby the more dange<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous. For they which sinne vnder the shew of holines, and vnder a godly pretence, and not of an euill purpose, do with the more difficulty returne agayne into the right way, for that they are farre of to vnderstand that they sinne. Wherfore in that case there nedeth the wonderfull great mercy and helpe of God. But this is all y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I mind at this time to write touching <hi>Paul.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now in what order his epistles were written, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> as I thinke hath suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficiently shewed. From whome herein only I dissagree, that I thinke that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Galathians was written at Rome. For that in it he vehemently repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the obseruers of the rites of the old law: touching which matter he spake more gently in those epistles which he had before written, and in those which were the last he wrote when he was at Rome. For that at the beginning he thought it good somewhat a while to beare with their infirmity, whom he thought mought be won vnto Christ, vntill they were better instructed. But when he afterward vnderstode that the deuil abused this gentlenes, so that by his fals apostles he obtruded y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> obser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uation which was then but permitted, as a thing necessary to saluation, as though Christ with out it were not sufficient, he began more vehemently to resist, so that he sayd: <hi>If ye be circumcised, Christ is nothing profitable vnto you:</hi> &amp; other thinges which were more sharply written to the Galathians thē here in this Epistle. The Scribe which wrote this epistle as <hi>Paul</hi> endited it, was named <hi>Tertius:</hi> and he sent these let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters frō the port Cenchries, which is not farre distant from Corinthe, &amp; they were caried to Rome by a Christian woman called <hi>Phebe.</hi> The occasion that moued him to write this epistle was this: The nation of the Iewes as they had a great pride in themselues, so also they alwayes enuied other nations. Wherefore at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning many of them would not haue had the grace of the Gospell of Iesus Christ communicated but only to the Iewes. And they thought, although fasly, that the promises were dew only to the seede of Abraham as touching the fleshe. Moreouer forasmuch as they iudged that the Gospell was to be distributed according to the dignity of the receauers, and they saw that the Gentiles were prophane and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully addicted to idolatry, they thought them to be vnworthy one whom shoulde be bestowed so great a benefit. Yea and the Apostles stayed long, before they went to the Gentiles: although they had heard that Christ gaue them in charge to go to al nations, and to preach the Gospell to euery creature. Neither as I suppose wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there some which went about to auoyde these commaundemēts, thinking that the Apostles should go to diuers nations, to the end to preach Christ to the Iewes
<pb facs="7"/> which were dispersed thorough out the whole world, and not to the Ethnikes and that which was spoken to all creatures they contracted to theyr Iewes: for that al the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>arth is sometimes called that part only which pertayned to y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Iews. But the Apostls being illustrated with the holy ghost were neuer infected with this error. Howbeit they differred theyr going to the gētiles, for that they knew that the gospel should fyrst be preached in Iewry, and they knew not how long they should abide there. Wherefore they wayted to haue geuen vnto them from God an assured signe when they should goe: which theyr expectation was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.<note place="margin">By what signe God first shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that thes shold prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che to the Gentiles.</note> For the lord by a vision shewed vnto Peter that the nations were sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied when he sayd vnto him: <hi>Say not thou that that is common, which God hath san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified:</hi> and he impelled him to goe to Cornelius the Centurion: vnto whome, when he had heard the word of the Gospell, God by a visible signe communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the holy ghost. These were manifest tokens, that the calling of the Gentiles shold no lenger be differed. Of this, which I haue spokē, the Acts of the Apostles beare witnes: in which also we read, that the Apostles &amp; the disciples, that were at Ierusalem, wondred, that the Gentiles had receaued the holy ghost, And Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was accused by reason of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion, for that he hadde gone to the Gentiles. But he defended himselfe both in declaring vnto them the vision whereby he was admonished, and also shewing vnto them, that the holy ghost had visibly fallen vpon those Ethnikes. We read also that after the death of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan</hi> many of the beleuers went to Antioch, and to Ciprus, and to other places of the Gentiles, but yet taught not Christ but only to the Iewes. But whē they now by <hi>Peters</hi> oration manifestly vnderstoode that they should no lenger stay from admitting the Gentiles, they thought that though they were put downe<note place="margin">The Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es sought to lay vpon y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Gentiles the yoke of the law.</note> from the first steppe yet they would stay in the second, namely, to lay vpon the neck of the Gētiles conuerted, the yoke of the law. There were doubtles Iews dispersed thorough out the whole world, to whome the pharisies and prests sēt letters not to admitte the doctrine of Christ. But they which were now Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but yet not thoroughly instructed, wrote, that Christ indede is to be recca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but yet together with him it behoued them to receaue the ceremonies of the<note place="margin">Whereof sprang the trouble in the church.</note> law of <hi>Moses.</hi> Hereof sprang no smal trouble, and the state of the Church was at that time very vnquiet: this was the cause why <hi>Paul</hi> reproued <hi>Peter.</hi> And the same <hi>Paul</hi> consented, to circumcise <hi>Timothe,</hi> to polle his hed in Cenchries, and to offer in the temple at Ierusalem a gift, as though he had made a vow. This ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">The fault of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and of the Gala<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thiās, was partly like, and partly vnlike.</note> was the occasion that moued the Apostle to write this epistle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines: which were sicke of the same dissease, that the Galathians were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward infected with. Howbeit the condition and state of ech of these natiōs was not a like. For the Balathians were first well instructed of <hi>Paul,</hi> whome after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the false Apostles and lieng preachers corrupted. But contrariwise the Romanes were not at the beginning well taught: and as it should seme, they receaued together with Christ much of the leuen of <hi>Moses:</hi> but when they knew the falshode, they repented: wherefore theyr fayth is much commended. But by<note place="margin">That Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was flayne at Rome, it can not be denyed.</note> whome they were first brought to the fayth, many put great doubt. That <hi>Peter</hi> went thither and was there slayne for Christs sake, I will not deny, when as in a maner all the Fathers and the ecclesiasticall histories testifie the same. How be it it is not very likely that the Romanes were by him first brought to the fayth. But paraduenture they by this meanes came to the fayth, for that now a great multitude of the Hebrewes were come to Rome, partly being brought thyther by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and partly by reason Iewry was now in subiectiō: to the Romanes and was brought into the forme of a prouince. And amongst others many of the faythfull remoued thither. Touching <hi>Priscilla</hi> and <hi>Aquilla</hi> it is very manifest<note place="margin">What they were as it is most like<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, which preached y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> gospel fyrst to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines. Their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which neglect this Epistle. Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the Romanes.</note> by the last chapiter of this epistle. By these and such other like of the faythfull, the Gospell mought there haue hys beginning, but not without controuersye touching the ceremonies of the law. Some haue by reason of these thinges takē occasion to withdraw men from studieng of this epistle: and haue said, that from the .xii. chapiter to the end it is worthy to be red, for that there is set forth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent institucion touching maners. But vnto that chapiter, forasmuche as (say they) there is nothing entreted of, but only striues and contencions concerning the ceremonies of the law, it serueth litle to our vse to know them, for that they of conduce not to our times, wherein are vtterly remoued away the ceremonies of the Iewes. But these men are farre deceaned themselues, and seke also to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue others. For the whole epistle doubtles is a golden epistle, and most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be red: It contayneth places touching naturall knowledge, and ciuill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, touching the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and touching the Gospell: it expliraceth iustifica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion and original sinne: it setteth forth grace, it entreateth of election, predestina<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="8"/> the execution of the Iewes, and of the restoring of them agayne. From the twelfth chapites it contayneth what kind of sacrifice we ought to offer, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth touching the magestrate, and touching bearing with the weake, and re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mouing away offence. And who seeth not that these are great matters and most<note place="margin">The questi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on being moued tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, is reduced to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</note> profitable to be knowen? But whereas they obiect vnto vs, that as touching the first part is entreated of ceremonies I graunt indede, that by the meanes of them the question began first, which <hi>Paul</hi> seking to dissolue reduced it to the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> or generall word. And to declare that we can not be iustified by the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the law, he proueth generally that iustification can not come of any our workes. And so when he had taken away the <hi>genus,</hi> the <hi>species</hi> or parts could by no meanes consist. For it followeth. We are iustified by no workes, therefore, neyther by ceremoniall workes, nor by morall workes, nor by iudiciall workes. And that the reasons of <hi>Paul</hi> extend so farre I will proue by these arguments<note place="margin">Argumēts to proue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> here are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of works ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and not of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyall workes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> following. First he teacheth that we are iustified by sayth, and by the mercy of God, that the promise might be firme. But that promise is not firme if it depend eyther of the execution of ceremonies, or of the obseruation of the ten commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: for that we are as touching ech part a like weake. Moreouer he sayth, that we are iustified freely, which word, Freely, is of no effect vnles we exclude morall workes. For he which worketh, vnto him reward is rendred according to debt and not according to grace. Afterward he entreateth of the obseruation of that law, by which we haue the knowledge of sinne, which thing belongeth rather to morall precepts, then to ceremonies. This is the law whirh worketh anger: neyther doubt we, but that God is more prouoked to anger, if we trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse the ten commaundements, then if we offend in certayne rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies. And more ouer <hi>Paul</hi> putteth our iustification to consist of the grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy of God, to the end our boasting should be excluded. But if thou remoue away ceremonies only, and say that we are iustified by morall works, boasting is not taken away: for we may at the least boast of them. Farther it is certayne, that the ceremonies of <hi>Moses</hi> pertayned to the first table where the worshipping of God is commaunded. Neyther were the elders any lesse bound to these ceremonies, then we are at this daye bounde to receaue baptisme and the Eucharist. And if <hi>Paul</hi> proue that we are not iustified by those thinges which pertayn to y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> first cable: much more then is it proued that we can not attayne vnto righteousnes by the workes of the latter table. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had declared that we are now by the benefit of Christ free from the law, obiecteth vnto himselfe, <hi>Let vs sinne more freely, and abide in sinne, that grace may the more abound.</hi> If the question had bene moued touching ceremonies only, he mought haue answered: ye are not deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but only from ceremonies, ye are still bound to the morall law. But he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no such answere, but sayth, that we ought to sinne no more for that we are now dead vnto sin, and grafted into Christ, and buried together with him. And the same <hi>Paul</hi> when he wrote, that by the fauor of Christ we are deliuered and absolued from those thinges, which in our flesh resist the law of God, expressed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared of what law he entreated. For he made mencion of that commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>Thou shalt not lust.</hi> Lastly in the epistle to the Galathians, where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth of the selfe same matter, be pronounceth him accursed which abideth not in all the thinges which are written in the booke of the law. When he saith, <hi>all,</hi> doubtles he excludeth not morall workes. Wherefore this disputacion of the Apostle is not superfluous. Yea rather vnles he had taken it in hand, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church had bene put in great danger, which the deuill sought to bring vnder the law, as though Christ of himselfe were not sufficient to iustifye men. And the reasons which are perticularly brought in touching ceremonies are<note place="margin">A sure rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son wherby is proued y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> no man is iustified by the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of mē.</note> not superfluous. For by the selfe same reasons we may proue that mens tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, and the rites which men haue appoynted vnto vs, are not such worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinges of God, as can not be changed, nor omitted, if they shall seme not to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duce to saluation. For these thinges much les pertayne to the obteyning of righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teousnes, then do the ceremonies instituted by God himselfe. Wherefore if these auayle not to righteousnes then can not those of necessity be required vnto it. Thou wilt demaund paraduenture, whether bicause of these reasons of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stle, we ought to thinke our selues losed from all maner of law. Not so vndoub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tedly,<note place="margin">Whether we be free from the law.</note> neyther doth this follow of his sayinges: vnles thou vnderstand that we are free and loosed from the law in respect that we can not be iustified by it. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise we ought to obey it, and to the vttermost of our power to labour to ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ecute it, but yet not with this purpose to seke thereby to be iustifyed. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching the ceremonies of the old law, two extreme errors are to be takē hede of,
<pb facs="8"/> the one is of the <hi>Ebionites</hi> and others, which Iewishly sought to ioyne of necessi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">Two er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to be taken hed▪ of▪ as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the olde law.</note> the ceremonies of <hi>Moses</hi> to Christ. Contrariwise the other extreme error is of the <hi>Marcionites,</hi> which affirmed that the old law was not geuen of a good God, but of an euil gouerner, the maker of this world. We saile in y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> middest betwene these extremities, and affirme, that now after Christ, the ceremonies of the law are not still to be kept, when as theyr time is now expired. Howbeit we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, as thinges which in the time of the fathers before Christ came, were good: and we beleue that they were instituted by the selfe same God, which is the father of our lord Iesus Christ. But to make the discourse of the first part more<note place="margin">Abrief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle.</note> playne, and vniuersally the vtility of the whole epistle, we will briefely touch the summe thereof, that it being in that maner layd before our eyes, the whole epistle may haue the more light.</p>
   <p>In the first chapiter is set forth vnto vs, how that neyther naturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<note place="margin">The first chapiter.</note> nor ciuill offices could by any meanes iustifie men: for that it is euidently shewed that men endewed with them, liued drowned in most horrible sinnes: whiche thing shoulde not haue happened, if by these thinges they had bene iustyfied.</p>
   <p>In the second chapiter the Iewes are made equall with the Gentiles, whose<note place="margin">The second chapiter.</note> life accused as most corrupt: for that they preached that a man should not steale, and yet stole, that a man should not commit adultery, and yet committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, that a man should not committe sacriledge, and yet committed it thēselues. By which it is manifest, that the law which they had receaued brought them not to iustification.</p>
   <p>In the third chapiter lest he might seme to deface the law, he confesseth that y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      <note place="margin">The third chapiter.</note> it was an excellent gift of God: but yet not of that kind, that it could iustifye. He attributeth vnto it other offices, namely, to bring forth the knowledge of sinne. And so he reduceth both the Iewes and the Gentiles to one Christ, as to the fountayne and author of all righteousnes. And yet notwithstanding he doth not by thys meanes he sayth violate or ouerthrowe the law, but most of all establishe it.</p>
   <p>In the fourth chapiter, he proueth the selfe same thing which he had before<note place="margin">The fourth chapiter.</note> put forth, by the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who before workes, and before he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued circumcision, was for this cause pronounced iust, for that he beleued the promise of God. This doubtles was imputed to him to righteousnes. And to confirm y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> same he bringeth a testimony of <hi>Dauid</hi> who saith, <hi>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgeuen and whose sinnes are couered. Blessed is the man to whome the Lord hath not imputed sinne.</hi> Which chapiter if be diligently peysed, we shall find, that in it the Apostle in a maner tē times vseth this word of <hi>Imputacion.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought not to seme so strange, if we also vse it, when we affirme that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence lest in vs after baptisme is sinne, although it be not imputed vnto sinne: and although we are not able to get vnto our selues that righteousnes, which is the true righteousnes before God, yet if we beleue in him, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes of Christ is imputed vnto vs.</p>
   <p>In the fift chapiter, after that this righteousnes of Christ is apprehended by<note place="margin">The fifth chapiter.</note> fayth, many thinges are declared touching it: that is, that it is firme, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braseth Christ, who died for the weake, for enemies, wicked men, and sinners. And in it is set forth a comparison of Christ with <hi>Adam.</hi> For euen as by him all our kind was vitiated and corrupted, so by Christ are all the elect renewed: yea rather Christ is sayd to ouer passe <hi>Adam.</hi> For he by one sinne infected al men: but infinite sins were not able to resist Christ, but that he performed that redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which his will was to performe. Yea he so vsed this euill, that he gaue the plentifuller grace, where the greater plenty of sinnes raigned.</p>
   <p>In the sixt chapiter he ouerthroweth the importunate obiection of diuers<note place="margin">The sixth chapiter.</note> which hereof inferred that we should sinne freely, and liue loosely, if, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle had sayd, greater grace should there be rendred, where were found more sinnes. The Apostle answereth, that theyr collection was not good, forasmuche as we are dead vnto sinne and grafted into Christ, we ought vndoubtedly to liue vnto him and not to iniquity.</p>
   <p>In the seuenth chapiter he declareth the maner how we are exempted from<note place="margin">The seuēth chapiter.</note> the law. And that is, that forasmuch as in vs whilest we liue here is not a full &amp; perfect regeneration, and corrupt affections do continually resist the lawes of God, by the grace of Christ is brought to passe, that we are deliuered from sin, although it perpetually inhabite in our members, and in our flesh.</p>
   <p>Whereof he concludeth in the eight chapiter, that there is no condemnation<note place="margin">The eight chapiter.</note>
      <pb facs="9"/> to those whih are in Christ Iesus, neyther walke they according to the flesh. For they haue the spirite of Christ, whereby they both liue and also are made pertakers of the resurrection to come: they mortifye the deedes of the flesh, and in themselues they haue witnes of the selfe same spirite, that they are the children of God, and by the selfe same spirite they are confirmed in aduersities, to suffer them with a constāt and valiant mind: and they haue this spirite making intercession for them, &amp; which draweth them to expresse the similitude of the image of the sonne of God: and at the last bringeth to passe that they can neyther be accused nor condemned before God.</p>
   <p>In the ninth chapiter he answereth vnto the Iewes, which contēded that these<note place="margin">The ninth chapiter.</note> promises were bestowed vpon theyr nation only, and were not powred vpon the Gentiles. Vnto whome he sayth that touching this matter all thinges are done by the election of God, whereby he hath mercy on whome he will, and whome he will he hardneth. And he compareth God to a potter, who of one and the selfe same clay maketh some vessells to honour, and some to contumely.</p>
   <p>In the tenth chapiter he entreateth of the effectes of thys election, namely, that<note place="margin">The tenth chapiter.</note> some embrace fayth: and other some reiect it. And he also declareth that Christ is the end of the law, and that the law requireth this, that we should beleue in Christ. And hereby he proueth that the Iewes attayned not to righteousnes, for that they went about to obtayne it by their owne merites, and by their owne workes: but the Gentles attayned vnto it, for that they claue vnto fayth: And all those thinges he confirmeth by the oracles of God, that the Iewes (I say) were made blynde, and that the Gentiles were receaued.</p>
   <p>In the eleuēth chapiter he mitigateth that hard reprobation of the Iewes which<note place="margin">The ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter.</note> he had set forth, and declareth, that not all vtterly were reiected, but putteth them in good hope, that for asmuch as their roote is holy, many also of that nation shal be holy: howbeit they are in the meane tyme excluded as touching vs, which were wilde Oliue trees, that we might be grafted into the good Oliue tree. And after that this is accomplished, they shall agayne be receaued. And so he knitteth vp this discourse, that God hath shut vp all vnder sinne: and he is compelled at the lengh to cry out. <hi>O the depth of the wisedome of the riches. &amp;c.</hi>
      <note place="margin">The twellth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Thys controuersy being thus taken vp, he beginneth hys twelueth chapiter wyth an obsecration, wherein he requireth vs to offer our bodyes a sacrifice most acceptable to God, and to approue the wyll of God, and to haue a care that we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree on with an other, forasmuch as we are one body, and one an others members He commendeth also vnto vs the loue of our enemyes.</p>
   <p>In the thirtenth chapiter he willeth vs to be subiect vnto the Magiestrates, to<note place="margin">The thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenth chap. The four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene chap.</note> loue our neighbours, to liue iustly, and to put on Christ.</p>
   <p>In the fourtenth chapiter he commendeth vnto vs those that are weake in fayth that we should louingly beare wyth them: and that we should as much as is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble see that concord be kept euen towards those which haue but small knowledge, that we should beare with them, and to take hede, that through our default they be not offended. And on the other syde he commaundeth the weake ones not rashly to iudge the stronger sort.</p>
   <p>In the fiuetenth chapiter he exhorteth to this selfe same thing by an example of<note place="margin">The fiftene chapiter.</note> Christ who bare vpon hym our contumelies and punishments, and communicated hymselfe not only to the Iewes but also to the Gentiles. He wisheth vnto the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes the holyghost, and rendreth vnto them a reason, why he wrote those letters vnto thē, he promiseth vnto them hys commyng, &amp; desireth them to pray for hym that he myght be deliuered from the vnbeleuers amongst the Iewes which sought hys destruction.</p>
   <p>In the sixtenth chapiter being also the last, he commendeth vnto the Romanes<note place="margin">The sixtene chapter.</note>
      <hi>Phebe</hi> an holy woman, by whome he had sent vnto them these letters. He most cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously saluteth a great many, and admonisheth them to beware of those which vse doctrine for the commodity of their belly, and for filthy gayne sake. This is a briefe<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ought not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fēded with Pauls ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng. Augustine in his boke <hi>de doctrina Christiana,</hi> attributethē vnto Paul a certayne eloquence,</note> and manifest summe of this whole epistle, which being set forth vnto vs, we shall the more redely interprete euery thing particularly. But still there are many which therfore abhorre from the reading of <hi>Pauls</hi> epistles, for that he semeth to speake so rudely and barbarously, that he filleth the readers with tediousnes, neither can men easely come to the sence of them. Vnto these men we answere that <hi>Pauls</hi> phrase of speach, if we beleue <hi>Augustine</hi> in hys fourth booke <hi>de doctrina Christiana</hi> is not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly wythout iust order of speaking. Not that he sought after eloquence, but for that eloquence followed his wisedome. For he is iudged to speake aptly, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon hym to entreat of thynges most excellent, and speaketh all those thinges which are necessary, neither entreateth of them otherwise then behoueth. <hi>Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/> in hys tourth booke <hi>de Sacerdotio</hi> is of the same myde with <hi>Augustine:</hi> where he maketh a distinction of eloquence, that one is deceatfull, whereat men<note place="margin">Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

         </gap>.</note> are amased, when they see that thinges of no force are extolled, and things high are plucked downe. This eloquence vseth coloures and deceat. Thys eloquence finde we not in <hi>Paul.</hi> There is an other eloquence which is of much force to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishe doctrines, and most constantly to defend the truth: and with this chiefly was the Apostle endewed. Wherefore let vs not in him require the pleasant spech of <hi>Isocrates,</hi> the high stile of <hi>Demostenes,</hi> the excellent dignity of <hi>Plato,</hi> or the reuerēd maiesty of <hi>Theucidides,</hi> but a bare and simple oration, which cōtayneth the know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of thinges most chiefe, and most strongly confirmeth that which it taketh in hand. They which are slouthful and sluggish, pretend at theyr pleasure the vn skilfullnes of <hi>Paul:</hi> namely, lest doctrine should be required at theyr hands, whē as <hi>Paul,</hi> as they thinke without it gouerned the Church.

How was it possible, that he should so long time retayne his auditory, if he spake so barbarously or vnaptly as these men imagine he did? It is manifest by the selfe same chapiter, that he delt at Athenes with the Stoykes and Epicures: &amp; there is none which is in his right wittes which will not wonder at his preaching which is described that he had there. He was also of the men of Licaouia taken for <hi>Mercury,</hi> by reason of his eloquence of speach. And if thou say, these thinges indede are true, for that such giftes were brethed into him by the holy ghost: let it be so as thou sayst: therefore his phrase of speach is not to be reproued, as a thing euery way vnapt and barbarons, And yet doth it not thereof follow, that therto he added no endeuor at al to speake aptly.

For wheras <hi>Origen</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the darke, vnorderly, &amp; imperfect sentēces, it may by this be excused, for that the Apostle went to worke coldly, but wrote with so feruent a mind, that somtimes he may seme to be rauished beyond himself, and he leauing all other study and care, only hereto endeuored himself, to drawe the hearers vnto Christe, being not very carefull for the fine ioyning together of wordes, but vsing most mighty engines to stirre vp, and throughly to moue our hearts.

   <p>Touchyng the <hi>Cilicians</hi> tounge, which is sometimes obiected agaynst the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,<note place="margin">Why Paul is sayd som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes to haue vsed the Cilici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans tonge.</note> thus we may answere. That the holyghost decreed to write those thinges both for the learned and vnlearned. Wherefore it was requisite to vse the common and vulgare speach. For it oftentymes happeneth, that the vnlearned are through too much exquisitnes and fines of speach so hindred, that they are not able to vnderstand the sense or meaning. For remedy agaynst the same, it behoueth that there should be vsed a playne and accustomed kynd of speach. And as touching the learneder sort it oftentimes happeneth, that they more esteme thynges beside the purpose and not necessary, neglecting in the meane tyme those thynges which are the principall: and they are so sometymes rauished wyth the admiration of that art, that they litle geue hede to the matter and wisedome, which is set forth vnder the ornaments of Retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke. Moreouer thys is to be added, that <hi>Paul</hi> was the Apostle of hym that was crucified, and preached Christ crucified, vnto whom were not meat the ornaments and goodly shewes of words, least the power of the crosse should be abolished. For
<pb facs="10"/> thys was to be taken hede of, that it should not be ascribed to humane wisedome, that men were drawen vnto Christ. Neyther wil I casely graunt that <hi>Paul</hi> had no care at all in the placing of hys words and sentences, when as hys words are eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where sharpe, neyther can there lightly be found more vehement wordes: so that <hi>Ierome,</hi> who sometymes accuseth the negligent speach of the Apostle confesseth that when he readeth hym, he heareth not wordes but thunders: and <hi>Paul</hi> had without<note place="margin">Ierome. Why he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> doubt vsed thys way greater diligence, if he had knowen that the same should more haue conduced to saluation. And whereas it was obiected, that the Apostle so spake Greke, that a man might casely know that he was an Hebrew, it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at: for as much as the Church at that tyme consisted both of the Hebrewes and of the Ethnikes: which church for that it dayly vsed the scriptures turned into the Greke tonge, it had learned so to speake of thynges diuine, that it did not much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sagree from the Hebrew maner and phrases of speach. wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> is not to be reproued for vsing towards the Church of Christ such a kynd of speach, which was both Greke, and also sauored somewhat of the naturall tonge, wherein the oracles of God were set forth. The Apostle (say they) findeth fault wyth hys vnskilfulnes of speach, he semeth indeed to do so, but if a man more diligently weigh the thyng,<note place="margin">Whether Paul foun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> fault wyth his vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes.</note> he shall see that <hi>Paul</hi> when he sayd, <hi>Although vnskifull in speach, yet not vnskilfull in knowledge,</hi> spake thus by way of graunting: not that he acknowledgeth great faults in the speach breathed into hym by the holy ghost, but he defendeth hymselfe from false Apostles which sayd, that hys epistles were of great wayght and strong, but hys phrase of speach when he was present was but weake. Amitte (sayth he) that I am but of small force as touching my phrase of speach, wyll they also take away frō me the knowledge of things? doubtles although he semed to those which were strangers frō Christ to speake foolishnes: yet notwithstāding they which belonged to Christ, indged those things which he spake to be most high wisedome, as they were in very deede. And when we affirme that the writings of <hi>Paul</hi> want not elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which yet he sought not after, but it folowed hym in speaking, yet meane<note place="margin">Good arres are not to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of those which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</note> we in no wyse to feare away men from y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> study of good artes. Yea rather we geue thē counsell, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they most diligently apply thēselues vnto them, that afterward whē they come to teach Christ earnestly, they may help them euen when they thinke not of them. For thys is not to be suffred in a preacher of the Gospel, that when he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth or speaketh, he should addict hys mynde to the preceptes of these artes: but if he be instructed wyth them, it shall be free for the holyghost to vse them when he shall thynke good. This only ought to be the worke of the preacher, to set forth Christ and hys word. And if he be well learned, the force of good artes wyll follow hym whether he wyll or no. But if preachers shall eyther in wryting or speaking labour for finesse &amp; ornaments of Rhetoricke, they shall waxe colde as touchyng matter. For the mynde of man is not able at one tyme with a singular sharpenes to applye it selfe to two thinges. Therefore we sometymes see preachers well learned in arts deale very coldly: &amp; contrary wyse such as are not so well learned handle theyr mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wyth greater vehemency. But if that measure be kept which I haue set forth, an vntruth though it be garnished and fensed wyth good artes shall take no place, and the truth though it be vnarmed and weake and without any ornament shalbe made manifest. These artes are placed in the midst, &amp; therefore we may make them to do Christ seruice and to loose them from the bondage of the deuill: so that as <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> sayd: The heathen woman haue her nailes payred, her heare cutte, and her gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment chaunged. By all those thynges we gather, that the phrase of speach of Paul is not of that nature, that it ought to feare vs away from the reading of these epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. But let vs on the other side consider what pricketh vs forward wyth singular diligence to read thys epistle to the Romaynes. In it is set forth the controuersy of iustification, a matter of great wayght, and such as not only at that tyme very much<note place="margin">Why this epistle is most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be red.</note> vexed the Church of Christ, but also in our tyme vexeth it, and doubtles it is of that sort, that there is nothyng more mete whereby to impell men vnto Christ. And besides that, the thinges which are here written are dedicated to the people of Rome, whose empire extended farre euen throughout the whole world, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it much made to the saluation of the whole world, what kind of religion they should receaue. For the nations vnder them commonly wyth great endeuor imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">In tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Romanes he instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the whole worlds,</note> the orders, rules, maners, and religion of their Princes. Wherefore when he taught the Romanes, he in a maner instructed the whole world: of which thyng the deuill was not ignorant. For he left no stone vnturned, to infect that citie with corrupt doctrine. To the accomplishing of this he instigated false Apostles and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked preachers, which with the preposterous ceremonies of <hi>Moses</hi> obscured the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christ. Neyther is it of small force to the setting forth of the worthines of thys epistle, that <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe both was, and was borne a citizen of Rome. Wherefore he
<pb facs="11"/> was bound and that by no small bond of loue to fauor these men best next to the He<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brews.<note place="margin">
         <p>Paul loued the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes best next to the Hebrues.</p>
         <p>In what thyng al mē agre, and in what they disagree. How the ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellenter sort of men thought they should attayne to blessednes. What was the opinion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people. The people of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues as a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene both. Paul ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth all those thinges.</p>
      </note> Now let vs come nerer to the matter. It is certayne that all men desire the extreame and chiefe good thing: but they are deceaued, for that they somtimes place it in the riches, plesures and good things of this world. But agaynst these mē there nedeth no long disputacion, for they are sufficiently confuted euen of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> philosophers and of them that are but meanely learned. But others thought, that they might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to perfect righteousnes and felicitie, if they gaue them selues to ciuill offices, to mortall vertues, and to the contemplation of things most excellent. But others when they saw that euen the most excellent men also fell oftentimes into horrible vices, thought that by religious expiations yea rather by supersticions and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippinges, of them selues inuented, they might make God fauorable vnto them of whome afterward they might be able to obtayne all good thinges. This in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was the opinion of the common people: whiche iudgement was after a sorte not so ill as the iudgement of the philosophers. For they were so puffed vp with the pride of vertues, and of ciuill offices, and by reason of theyr knowledge in thinges naturall, that they thought that these thinges were sufficient for them to attayne fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie. But the common people were not ignorant both of the filthines of theyr sins and of theyr dayly offending of God: wherefore they thought it requisite to flye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to religion. And forasmuch as they had no pure nor chast religion they fell into ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. The people of the Hebrews were as a meane betwene these and embrased ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part. By reason of the decaloge or ten commaundements they boasted that they had the summe of all vertues: and if they should chance to transgresse in them, they had ceremonies prepared for them, to make satisfactiō for them. <hi>Paul</hi> striueth against these thinges, and proueth that it is not possible for vs to obteyne righteousnes by morall or naturall offices. For neyther the Iewes nor the Gentiles do in any wise expresse in life and in maners, so much as they aknowledge the law either of nature or of <hi>Moses</hi> requireth at theyr handes. Neyther is it to be graunted that we can ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perfectly obserue the law, for then should we obteyne perfect righteousnes by workes, which were vtterly absurd: for out iustification herein consisteth, that our sinnes should not be imputed vnto vs, but that the righteousnes of Christ should be imputed to them that beleue. There commeth indede some instauration, when we being iustified do worke vpright workes, but that is not perfect. Grace also is geuen to the regenerate, but not such a grace which remoueth away all impedimēts which are a let to the most perfect obseruation of the law of God. Neyther when we speake this do we set forth paradoxes, or ascribe vnto <hi>Paul</hi> strange thinges, but we defend those thinges which most of all agree with th the doctrine of the Apostle. And as touching ceremonies and rites, of which on the other side the Iewes boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, when they are without Christ and without fayth, they are counted detestable before God, as <hi>Ieremy, Esay,</hi> and other prophets which were interpreters of the law haue most manifestly taught. wherefore it followeth, that although the Hebrewes boasted that they were endewed with eche part of righteousnes, yet were they not iustified. Howbeit I speake of them, which embrased these partes of the lawe wyth out Christe.</p>
   <p>Ye haue now the scope of the Apostle. And in this whole disputacion, forasmuch as it is a long discourse, it shalbe very good oftentimes to call to memory this sum of it now set forth.</p>
   <p>But let vs now come to exposition of the first chapiter. what is there entreated<note place="margin">Of the first chapter spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. The propo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sition and the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> of I haue alredy declared: namely that the Gentiles were not able by the strengths of nature to be iustified. This he proueth, for that they liued most wickedly, and ouerwhelmed them selues with most filthy sinnes, when yet notwithstanding they were not ignorant what they ought to haue done. But first is set forth a salutacion, which I will expound, and afterward will deuide the rest of the chap. into his partes. The things that are hard I will the more largely explane: and the things y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> are easy I will but briefely touch: and in such questions which shall chance by the way I will somewhat the longer tary.</p>
