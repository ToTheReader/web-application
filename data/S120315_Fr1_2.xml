      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      <hi>Haue at the last yeelded to the request of some friends, for the publishing of those Sermons, which I preached some yeeres since. Of what vse they will proue to the Church of God, his blessing vpon the carefull reading thereof, will in time discouer. For my part, I haue laboured, by the penning and setting of them foorth, to bring some helpe to the better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Gospell, to cleere such matters, as offer themselues to be considered; and to furder all men, that will vouchsafe the reading of them, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the mystery of our redemption, and in the fruits of true sanctification. If any man, that heard them deliuered by worde of mouth, finde some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb facs="3"/> betwixt that, which then I spake, and this, which now I write; it may please him to vnderstand, that I had but some very short notes of my former Sermons; and happely my second thoughts haue afforded me by the blessing of God some better knowledge of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists purpose and meaning. Their extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry length must bee imputed to the swiftnesse of my speech. If I go forward in the expounding of this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, it is my purpose to doe it rather by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary for instruction, then by discourse for exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: vnlesse it doe appeare that this manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which I haue now vsed, bee of greater profite to the Church of God; to the seruice wherof, I haue vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my poore labours. The same God, of his infinite mercy, vouchsafe his gratious blessing vpon them, to the glory of his owne name, the furdering of the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his children, and the increase of my comfort in the faithfull discharge of that duty, which I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to performe, to the vttermost of my small pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> Aprill. 11. 1609.</p>
