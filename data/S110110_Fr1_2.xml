         <p>I say the truth, I lie not, my conscience bearing me witnes in the Holy-ghost, that I haue with the Apostle great heauinesse, and continuall sorrow in my heart for many of my brethren and Country-men. And my hearty desire and prayer for them to God, is, that they may be saued. For I beare them recorde, that they haue the zeale of God, though not according to knowledge, which is the onely cause that mooued me to write this short Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise. And, because God of his great goodnesse hath vouchsafed your tender yeeres the education of <hi>TIMOTHIE,</hi> and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Highnesse, since your happy gouernement with princely gifts, knowledge to discerne truth, and zeale to maintaine truth, I humbly present vnto your Maiestie, these few lines, containing a subiect of so great importance. The common voyce, and hope
<pb facs="3"/> of your best affected people is, that your Highnesse hath a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intent, to make God yet better knowne in <hi>IVDA,</hi> and his name yet greater in <hi>HIERVSALEM,</hi> to bring all these your Kingdomes to the acknowledgement and profession of one truth; so that hereafter <hi>HIERVSALEM</hi> may be as a walled towne and fenced citty, which is at vnitie within it selfe: and as it was in the dayes of the <hi>IVDGES,</hi> all <hi>ISRAEL</hi> may be gathered together, as one man, from <hi>DAN</hi> to <hi>BEERSHEBA,</hi> vnto the Lord in <hi>MISHPAH.</hi> The Lord guide and prosper you in all your wayes, the Lord establish your house and kingdome, the Lord blesse you out of <hi>SION,</hi> that you may see the wealth of <hi>HIERVSALEM</hi> all the dayes of your life, that you may see your Childrens Children, and peace in <hi>SION.</hi>
