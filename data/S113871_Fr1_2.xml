                 <title>Two little workes defensiue of our redemption : that our Lord went through the veile of his flesh into heaven, to appeare before God for vs. Which iourney a Talmudist, as the Gospell, would terme, a going vp to Paradise: but heathen Greeke, a going downe to Hades, and Latin descendere ad inferos. Wherein the vnlearned barbarous, anger God and man, saying, that Iesus descended to Hell: and yeelde vnto the blasphemous Iewes by sure consequence vpon their words, that he should not be the Holy one of God.

   <p>BY knowing that <hi>Hades,</hi> a terme vsed in the Creede, is the place
generall, where soules are before Gods throne, diuided there, fat
enough, by heauen &amp; hell, so that in speach of the holy, <hi>Hades</hi> the
generall, by difference of the Person, is <hi>Heauen,</hi> and in the wicked,
<hi>Hell,</hi> as we cōmonly terme <hi>Hell:</hi> which place is on high, out of this
world by Apo. 14. &amp; all Iewes in <hi>Cether Malc.</hi> fol. 11. by knowing
of this great light cometh to Religion. First their opinion falleth,
who thank God for sending his sonne to redeeme the Fathers from
<hi>Hades,</hi> to <hi>Paradise:</hi> that is, from Paradise to Paradise. So <hi>Limbus
Patrum</hi> and <hi>Purgatorie</hi> fall: when <hi>Hades</hi> hath onely two partes,
Heauen and Hell. So our madnes falleth, who in the Creede, put
for that Part of <hi>Hades,</hi> which holdeth the faithfull, and is heauen
or Paradise, the part which holdeth the wicked, and put for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
Hell, to which they that goe, perish for euer. Here standeth the
Article: Our Lord being in body crucified, dead and buried, had a
soule immortall, as all men, which went hence to God: &amp; being in
<hi>Hades,</hi> holy, had not hell but heauen. This is all. When the Gospel
began scant any held soules immortall. <hi>Pliny</hi> sheweth that. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was needfull the Creed should haue it. When the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
was graunted, very many Creedes did omit the article: because
in speach of a man, to die &amp; to go to <hi>Hades</hi> is all one. Of an horse,
Grekes would say, <hi>he is dead.</hi> Of a man, more: <hi>He is dead &amp; gone to
Hades.</hi> This matter vnknowen hath vexed the world by ignorāce
of one Greeke worde. And two Bishops vexed their owne. Against
whom two smal writings folow: besides much otherwise printed &amp;
written to them. The style is not of their gall, but it may gall, in
mildnes.</p>
