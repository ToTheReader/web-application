      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E may beholde (Christian Reader) with</hi> no lyttle gréefe of minde, the great looue of our God, and the lyttle regarde of our selues, his fatherlie motions, and in vs no signe of amendment. Referring the innumerable examples, happening not onely to our Fathers, but in our tyme also: let vs onely consider these twaine, the one of an abhominable swearer, the other of a wicked Woman, that would not forgiue. If we consider the wickednesse of the time, growen into a contumely, bothe of God &amp; good things. we may enter into a secrete conferring with our selues, how, or by what meanes, we shall lay claime to the mercie of God, béeing altogether voide, and shewing no signe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, wherby he may perceiue any sorrow for our sinnes, or in vs any desire to be pardoned. We abuse his name daylie, in euerie lyght and trifling matter: we goe to heare his woord, rather for a fashion, then any affection we beare to it. Looue is exiled amongst vs, neighbourhood nothing regarded, pitty vtterly subuerted, and remorse of conscience nothing estéemed, what shall become of vs? Remember we not, there is a life to come, a ioy, a blisse, a crowne of glorie? Would we be partakers thereof? no, if we would enioye that heauenlie happinesse, our life and conuersation, would shewe some meanes, how we séeke to deserue it. And shall we then wilfully lose it? oh no, take holde of Faith, embarce Repentaunce▪ humble your soules to the throne of mercie: that albeit the Lord perceyue we are vnprofitable labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb facs="10"/>
in his Uineyard: Yet that he may beholde in vs a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, a good will, and a faithfull intention, to put our selues foorth: and though sinne so gréeuouslie presse vs downe (that our weaknesse cannot resist him,) yet that we are armed with Faith, and entire Hope, in that swéete Sacrifice once offered vp for vs all, euen the precious body and blood of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus, in his merites, to foyle our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, comfort our féeble soules: and with a repentaunt heart, enter into the bosome of rest, prepared for vs, since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world. To the which that we may come, and leaue this wickednesse of lyfe: Assist vs most mercifull Father, with thy continuall grace, and arme our soules with faithfull patience, so shall we triumphe ouer our foe, and reioyce in glory world without end: which God graunt vs, for Christes sake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
