   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing employed in this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age by the right honourable <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> Baron of <hi>Warder,</hi> to take due notice, and make true report of the discouery therein performed: I became very diligent to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue (as much as I could) whatsoeuer was materiall or of consequence in the businesse, which I collected into this briefe summe, intending vpon our returne to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the same. But he soone changed the course of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments; and long before our arriuall in <hi>England</hi> had so farre engaged himselfe with the Archduke, that he was constrained to relinquish this action. But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and profits of the countrey, together with the fitnesse of plantation, being by some honourable Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of good woorth and qualitie, and Merchants of good sufficiency and iudgement duly considered, haue at their owne charge (intending both their priuate and the common benefit of their countrey) vndertaken the transporting of a Colony for the plantation thereof; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much encouraged thereunto by the gracious fauour


<pb facs="3"/>
of the KINGS MAIESTY himselfe, and diuers Lords of his Highnesse most Honourable Priuie Councell. After these purposed designes were concluded, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated to publish this briefe Relation, and not before; because some forrein Nation (being fully assured of the fruitfulnesse of the countrie) haue hoped hereby to gaine some knowledge of the place, seeing they could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure our Captaine or any speciall man of our Company to combine with them for their direction, nor obtaine their purpose, in conueying away our Saluages, which was busily in practise. And this is the cause that I haue neither written of the latitude or variation most exactly obserued by our Captaine with sundrie instruments, which together with his perfect Geographicall Map of the countrey, he entendeth hereafter to set forth. I haue likewise purposedly omitted here to adde a collection of many words in their language to the number of foure or fiue hundred, as also the names of diuers of their gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, aswell their friends as their enemies; being reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be made knowen for the benefit of those that shal goe in the next Voyage. But our particular proceedings in the whole Discouerie, the commodious situation of the Riuer, the fertilitie of the land, with the profits there to be had, and here reported, I refer to be verified by the whole Company, as being eye-witnesses of my words, and most of them neere inhabitants vpon the <hi>Thames.</hi> So with my prayers to God for the conuersion of so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and well disposed people, and for the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous successiue euents of the noble intenders the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof, I rest.</p>
