and Happinesse.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Learnd
Poet <hi>Horace</hi>
intending to
bestowe the
true praise of Wisedome
upon them which are most
worthy, saith that they
<pb facs="11"/>
most of all diserve it,
which knoweth best to
joyne Profit and Pleasure
together, for those two
thins to the Jngenious are
excellent and admirable:
For as much as <hi>Hesiode</hi>
reporteth, that the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
Gods desire that
profit might daily bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with travell
and labour, and that usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the end of pleasure is
bitter and unpleasant,
therefore ought he to bee
<pb facs="11"/>
mended for a good Artist,
which can with facility &amp;
dexterity incorporate and
unite them, as the one may
still interchangeably ensue
and rise of the other, to
which intent (<hi>notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
their diversity
of opinions the ancient
Philosophers endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the uttermost, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their ingenuity
to polish and beautifie
that most excellent por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="12"/>
of us,</hi> the Mind as
prepaired the beetter to
receive the Print of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
seale, we might in this
race of Frailty clime to
some degree (<hi>at least of
true happinesse &amp; sound
felicity) but because the
name of vertue is of such
Majesty, as at first view
it would dismay the
countenance of her ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
beholders, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Philosophers ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
aside their frosty
<pb facs="12"/>
beardes, and other such
ceremonies of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
shew: with loving
care to maintaine and
cherish those soft and
sweet gentle minds, and
tender natures that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
presently combat
with the tediousnesse of
scholastique exercises</hi>
have studied and presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
certaine pleasant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
(wherewith to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
&amp; sweeten the study of
Philosophy handling each
<pb facs="13"/>
part thereof so familiarly
and facilly, <hi>that the most
wilde and stupid heads
were oftentimes incited
to hearken and follow
their wholesome docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
Like the <hi>Phrygian</hi>
Fabler Aesope, giving
fained speech to Creatures
vnreasonable, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
thereof hath left to
future posterity, most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Precepts of all Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
&amp; Moral duty the like
hath beene done in all ages
<pb facs="13"/>
by many Noble Poets,
who in their fabled Forgery
(<hi>if rightly marked</hi>) have
uttered all manuer of most
deepe and profound Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<hi>I speake not of
Comicke writers, who
pretending but sport, by
prety contriving of
Parts and Persons, teach
how to behave our
selves towards all sort of
Persons, and specially
to shun the cousening
Ginnes of those which
<pb facs="14"/>
are registred amongst
the vilest kind of people;</hi>
which fruit is also to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
of our common plays
and interludes; which
grounded (ordinarily) upon
the rule of Philosophy, doe
whet and sharpen the wits
of the beholders; as those
exercises of Tilting, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
Wrestling, leaping, or
running, doe by use streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the limbes, and
frame the body better and
more ablie to discharge,
<pb facs="14"/>
when need shall require
their office of armes. <hi>But
lest I should wade too
farre in the praise of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
which may be
termed as a labyrinth:
Give me leave, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Reader, to let you
understand that this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
booke in</hi> French, <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening

of the World and
Worldly things, and
