   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>IT is no maruell, though that Antichrist the Pope of Rome (seeing his kingdome of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse decay apace in these dayes, and fearing the vtter ouerthrowe of it for euer) being rowzed, bestirre himselfe as hee doth. He is in high place, &amp; hath of some yeres growen too mightie in this world by his owne am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious pride, and the grace hee hath founde in the eies of great princes and their people: God so iustly punishing mens ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, towardes his maiestie. This lawlesse man therefore, of whom I speake, will no doubt leaue no meanes vnattempted, so long as hee may, to vpholde this his pompe and estate, whiche thing will not in these daies be perfourmed without much ado, especially when he cannot bee content to keepe himselfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in boundes, that is, as a Romane at home in his owne Citie and Countrie, where hee dwelleth, or as a Churche man in Church matters: but will needes roue ouer the worlde, sitting in <hi>Gods seate,</hi> and hauing; an Oare in euery mans boate (as they say) yea and ruffle, euen among Monarques and great Princes, and that in, and for their kingdomes: giuing the same, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, placing, displacing, disposing, &amp;c. at his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
   <p>But playing thus his parte like himselfe, that is, so impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Godlesly, in the sight nowe of all the worlde bewraying himselfe to bee in deede that man of sinne that is prophesied of: Gods spirit on the other side, detecting and reuealing day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.</note> vnto vs, by the cleare light of the Gospell, the treacherie and sleightes of <hi>this sonne of perdition:</hi> some, possible, may mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell howe hee shoulde finde fauour grace, and good liking, with any that beare but a shewe of godlinesse and honestie, sauing that, wee are sufficiently admonished afore hande, <hi>that the God of this worlde hath blinded the mindes of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesue<note place="margin">Cor. 4. 4.</note>
         <pb facs="3"/>
not, that the light of the glorious Gospell of Christe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, which is the image of God, should not shine vnto them.</hi> And againe, <hi>because they that perishe, haue not receiued the loue of the truth that they might be saued, therefore God will</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 10. 11. 12.</note>

   <p>So then, such thinges as wee see come to passe at this day, and set abrod for the vpholding of that beast the Pope of Rome and his rotten religion, ought so little to seeme strange vnto the faithfull, that being assured the Lorde will destroy that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 8.</note> man, with the spirite of his mouth, &amp; take him away by the appearing of his cōming: We should take cōfort &amp; incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt therby, &amp; manfully rather oppose our selues against him &amp; his ministers, euery one in our calling, then bee any whit wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by such accidents, <hi>&amp; putting differēce</hi> (as we are taught)<note place="margin">Iude. ver. 22. 23.</note>
      <hi>haue compassion of some, and saue other with feare, plucking them out of the fire, and hate euen the garment spotted by the fleshe.</hi> The moe stumbling blockes wee see Satan and his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postes to cast before men, the more diligent and paineful ought we againe to be in setting our hands &amp; shoulders to the worke for the remoouing thereof out of mens way, if God at any time will giue suche, as are intangled in the snares of the Diuell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to knowe the truth, leauing euer in good hope the successe to God and his blessing.</p>
   <p>The consideration heereof, in confidence of Gods mercifull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, mooued mee, though among his seruants of a thousande the vnfittest, whyle other bee otherwise occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, to take in hande vppon request of diuers godly and well disposed, to answere a certaine seditious booke of late imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and set out to the viewe of the worlde, by I. <hi>Howlet</hi> the title whereof is: <hi>A briefe discourse containing certaine reasons, why Catholikes</hi> (so hee calleth the earnest and hot
<pb facs="3"/>
Papistes heere in Englande, reconciled of late yeeres vnto the Pope) <hi>refuse to goe to Churche, written by a learned &amp; vertuous man,</hi> (as hee saieth,) <hi>to a friend of his in Englande,</hi> Whome hee nameth not, neither the one nor the other. Why not to her Maiestie: as these men vse to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,<note place="margin">

      </note> and wee must beleeue what they say. The whole (for the woorthinesse thereof forsooth, with a long Epistle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorie) is offered by <hi>I. H. To the Queenes most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Maiestie: and printed</hi> as is pretended, <hi>at Doway, By Iohn Lyon with priuiledge.</hi> Though wee knowe it was printed, not at <hi>Doway,</hi> but in Englande, without priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or good leaue: yet wee may not say so, nor doubte of the other, such suppositions bee these Catholiques principles, wee may not cal them in question, nor iudge of them, they be aboue our reache.</p>
   <p>For the Authours name of these reasons, because they list not to vtter the same, I am not curious, whether the same proceed from him that wrote the Dedicatory Epistle to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie or no, it is not greatly material, sauing, if they did not; M. <hi>Howlet</hi> seemeth to doe his fellowe some iniurie, in taking out of his handes that which hee promiseth, in his booke in the second place to performe, and nowe omitteth, to wit: to shewe<note place="margin">

This peece of dealing with her Maiestie shoulde haue come after the treatise, sauing that M. <hi>Howlet,</hi> either doubting of the performance, or seeking that glorie, as one, loth to tarie so long, or for some other respect gleaning as appeareth from his friend, setteth the same out afore hande, and putteth it in the forefronte.</p>

      <hi>some corps,</hi> or other misfortune, as they say, commeth out of his hole, and flickering about with his shreeching noyse, stayes himselfe vpon the midle beame of S. <hi>Martines</hi> temple, where they sate in the Councell: casting his brode eyes directly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>Balthasar.</hi> All there present, fel in a wonderment, that a night birde which shunneth the light, came in the middes of the assembly at brode day light, by which wonder and strange sight they did (not without cause) thinke some mischiefe to bee foreshewed. <hi>Behold,</hi> saide they, one to another softly, <hi>the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is come in the shape of an Owle.</hi> And when the rest looking one on an other, &amp; vpō <hi>Balthasar,</hi> could scarsely forbear laugh ter, <hi>Balthasar</hi> himself (vpon whome alone this madge <hi>Howlet,</hi> casting his eyes, stedfastly looked) did blushe for shame, sweate for anger, and fretted in his minde: and at length, not knowing how to helpe otherwise this his so great disgrace, breaking vp the councell, arose, and went his way. There followed after another session wherein againe after the same maner, the madge <hi>Howlet,</hi> (though as I thinke not called) failed not to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, casting still his foule eyes vpon <hi>Balthasar,</hi> which m. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> he seeing to be returned, was not without iust cause, more troubled and striken with shame than afore, and not being able to abide the sight of the madge <hi>Howlet</hi> any longer; he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to be beaten away with libbets and clubbes, and with crying noyse, but M. <hi>Howlet</hi> neuer a whit disquieted either with
<pb facs="5"/>
their shreeching noyse or other disturbaunce woulde not flie away, till with muche cudgeling at him, being very sore beaten, hee fell. downe dead before them all. These things (saith our Authour) learned I of a certaine faithfull, and trustie friende, who, at that time came straight and directly from Rome, of whiche I making doubt, by reason of the strangenesse thereof, my friende being very earnestly sworne; Assured me, hee told mee that was moste true, and added further, that all that were present, were hereby brought into an vtter contempt, disdaine, and mocking of that councell, and the whole companie by little and little falling away, hee affirmed there was nothing at all there doone to any purpose. Thus farre <hi>Clamengius,</hi> cited very truely by maister Foxe.</p>
   <p>For the Gentleman, the authours worshipfull friende (as hee speaketh) if there be any suche, and he not too farre gone, I wish him to bee aduised, and take heede, what scholemaisters hee betake his conscience to be framed by, the matter is of no small importance, let him at leastwise without preiudicate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion heare and reade both sides before hee iudge, or thruste himselfe too farre ouer the shoes: for our part (what euer opinion the aduersaries bee of,) leauing the rest to hym that is aboue, wee desire no more at his handes: this is it wee haue from the beginning, and many a day sought and requested. If hee will heare this counsell, hee shall first see that wee drawe him not from the Pope and Popishe religion, to carry him to depende vppon any mortall man in the case of religion and conscience, bee he neuer so high or mightie: but only vppon the true and immortall God of heauen, and his sacred mouth: Next, that wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde him not doctrines deuised by mans braine, and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōmended vnder title of the Church, to intangle his cōscienee, and without eyther grounde or good reason, make him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and doubtfull by subtill quidities and questions, as these men doe, but after we haue brought him to feede in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
<pb n="4" facs="5"/>
and sweete pasture, and to drinke of the pure and liuely fountaine of Gods holy woorde, which is the trueth, hee shall see, wee endeuour to vnwrap and vnfoulde his conscience from snares, to quiet the same with the true peace of God, teaching him to make conscience where God and his woorde woulde, and no where els, and to looke well to these two points in the case of conscience. God may and doth make lawes to bynde conscience withall, and onely God may deale therein and no mortall man, muche lesse that man of sinne the Pope.</p>
   <p>In summe, the more precisely in these matters pertayning to his soules health, he shall cleaue to God and his holye truth contayned in the Scriptures, renouncing all sectes and partes of whomesoeuer, aswell Pope as other, the better shall he please, I will not say vs, but first God, and next to God, satissie her Maiestie our dread soueraigne and his, who pretendeth not by her selfe, nor her lawes, to make any of her subiectes to be of her Religion, but vs altogether with her selfe, of Gods true, certayne, and most holie Religion. Shee sitteth in no mans conscience as doth the Pope ywis, in doing this, shortely to say, he shall shewe himselfe to bee a faythfull and good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt to GOD, and her Maiestie, bearing a duetifull minde, lyke a true subiect, to her godly lawes in euery respecte, a profitable member also shall hee shewe him selfe to bee in Church and common wealth, and most of all (which hee hath to consider of) his owne friende; all which benefites, hee quite spoyleth himselfe of, in following the course these men sette hym in who as blynde guydes conducte him in the darkenes by bywayes of traditions, forefathers, custome, multitude, good intentes, and meaning, as they call them, and all without the light of Gods holy woorde, or any good warrant.</p>
   <p>Nowe as there are two partes of this booke, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle dedicatorie to her Maiestie, and the treatise or reasons, where vnto accordingly I haue to answere, so for the matter, the drift wherto this booke tendeth, &amp; the manner of handling
<pb facs="6"/>
the whole, generally to speake, it so bewrayeth it selfe as the indifferent Reader may and will (I doubt not) easily espie out the treacherie.

from publique Church assembles here (wherein to Gods glorie are vsed the preaching of Christes Gospell, the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of his sacramentes, godly prayers, &amp;ct.) And againe, to refuse the othe of alleageance to her Maiestie, alluring other to the like: they drawe men (as much as in them is) from the ordinarie meanes whereby God beginneth, aduaunceth, and continueth faith and Religion in his, they dishonour his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, in swaruing from the rule of his holy woorde, they pine away and slaye their owne soules, and theirs that hearken vnto them. Besides this offence to God, and priuate hurt to thē selues and others, they induce them further to disobey in the highest degree, their gracious Soueraigne and ours, and to break her wholsome lawes made for the aduauncement of Christes syncere Religion, and the suppressing of Idolatrie and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for the maintenance of her Royal estate and most law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dignitie among her subiectes, they offend moreouer all the godly minded, &amp; weake ones also, by their euil exāple and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. That I speak nothing of vtter enemies to the truth, which can learne no good hereby. Finally, they seeke to make a schisme, and to maintaine heresie in this holy Congregation, and sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously disturbing the peace and quiet here, they make a way to a newe rebellion, if it bee possible for them, infecting other with the same opinion and obstinacie, whiche are not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto so hot and forward, or peruerse and frowarde in this matter.</p>
   <p>These and such like things are sought to bee iustified, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and defended, by coloured reason and false perswasion, and all vnder pretence of conscience, in this booke.

For, least those of their companie that are left, after the suppressing of the rebelles among vs, shoulde be dismaide and discouraged, setting a good face on the matter, they comfort them with such wordes and motiues, as they may in so bad a matter, and least when they can not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in person goe abroade, their well willers and friendes, whereof they bragge of moe here, then I trust they shall finde, shoulde want their ayde in aduauncing the proude prelate of Rome, and his religion against the eternall God of heauen and her Maiestie, our naturall and dread soueraigne and Prince: here vpon they print and cast abroad this and such like libels, full of holownes and vauntes, contayning litle or no other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as such doe easily and at first fight perceiue, which vntaught by them, are none of their disciples, but through Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnder her Maiesties happie gouernement, haue been now many yeeres trayned vp in the schoole of the holy ghost, where (if wee haue grace) wee haue learned ynough to confirme and stablishe our mindes in the trueth of God, and to repell and ouerthrowe all deuises of men.</p>
   <p>Now, because they haue by their euill desertes, iustly brought themselues farre into hatred, least they shoulde seeme common enemies, all their cunning of Rhetorique and persuasion muste be applied for the auoyding of this blot, hence commeth the dedication of this treatise to her Maiestie, and the allegation of conscience.

Howe the breache is made vp againe among the Papists herewith, or howe this salue and plaster serueth to cure them.
