<pb facs="3"/> entred into it, by laying many stumbling-blocks in the way, or insnaring them with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring baites of the lying and deceiueable vanities of this fading and perishing world, with which many are so strangely inchanted, that whiles they fondly thinke therein to finde felicitie, they runne on head-long vnto vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine and destruction. Hence it is, that many moued with the <hi>zeale</hi> of the <hi>glory of</hi> GOD, and the <hi>good of others,</hi> (the welfare of whose soules was deere vnto them) haue imployed themselues in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to <hi>remedy this euill,</hi> by seasoning the affections of

And this indeede it was, that <hi>first induced</hi> mee (being also mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thereunto by the often and importunate request of godly &amp; wel-disposed friends) to <hi>publish</hi> this Treatise for the benefit of others, and to <hi>proceede</hi> in the course which vpon the like considerations,
<pb facs="4"/> I had formerly enterprised.
