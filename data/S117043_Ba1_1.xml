   <head>¶ An aunswere to certen <hi>rebukes, &amp; ambushemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> deuysed, and daylye practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by myne aduersaries, agaynst me.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>NE vpon a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me asked of <hi>Cleobulus,</hi> what thinges speciallie were to bee aduoyded: The enuye (sayth hee) of frendes, and the craftie fetch, ambushemē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, &amp; conspiracies of enemies. Here touching the firste, J am nothinge of <hi>Cleobulus</hi> his minde. For howe can he be a frend vnto him, whose good happe, and prosperitie, he doeth grudge, murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and enuie at? concerning the other, that is, of the subtile wiles of enemies to bee forseene, J see, and J fynde it by experience true, that if the entrappinges, and crafte vsed by aduersaries, be not, and that with good heede, and in tyme looked vnto, the harmeles may seme hurtefull, the innocente may seme giltie, the offender shalbe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited, &amp; the true man shallbe condemned. For, not to speake of others, J perceaue towardes my selfe so manye deuises pretended, so manye wayes assayd, and so muche subteltie imagined, that yt is in a maner, but in vayne to goe aboute to
<pb facs="35"/>withstande their dartes, gonne shotte, &amp; assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Yet, as the olde, &amp; true saying is, if God bee with vs, who can be against vs? If the truethe be on my syde, then let Satan doe what he can, let whisperers out with their deuises, let all subtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be vsed, J recke not, J care not, J passe not. But what is yt that moueth them herevnto? or what thing is it, that they deuise against me? moued they are therevnto, throughe self lyking, self loue, selfe will, throughe hate, throughe spight, throughe enuie: The thing it self, that they deuise agaynst me, is this: they laboure as earnestlye as they can, to bring my name into contempte, and my doinges to be disdeygned. And why? forsooth not for any matter they haue to <hi>Euans,</hi> but it is, that so in him, they might the rather oppresse the trueth, that so they might refiste godlynes, &amp; set vp, and that nayled vnto walles, their blinde Poppettes, their pretie litle goddes, their dumbe Babes, &amp; deafe wodden Angels. But howe goe they aboute to bring their practise against me to effecte? you shall heare, for J doe heare, &amp; see them. Fyrste co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the stationer, he hydeth my Booke, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be asked for, it may in no wise be set furth to be sene. And yet when money cometh, then out it goeth. <hi>Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, sacra auri fames?</hi> Well, my Booke is in the ende solde, God knowethe, with a grudging, and
<pb facs="35"/>a heauie hart, &amp; if he know well the byar, thē ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth he the booke by names, he rayleth agaynst the autor, he vseth asmuch humanitie as may be. Oh leaue your lewdenes, J know your wordes, &amp; who you are. Now when the stationer hath playd his parte, then cometh in the pagente other personnes, and thereof some not of lowe degrees. Euery one playeth featelie his parte, one sayth, J am a foole, one affirmeth that J am yong, &amp; rashe, one allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that J am vnlearned, one telleth that J am waxen madde, &amp; an other reporteth that J am blynded. And thus goeth this foolishe, yong, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>she, vnlearned, madde, blynde pagente forwarde. To what purposse sholde J shew, what frownin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they make, what staringe they kepe, what noddinges they vse, and what thoughtes they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue? And is this all? no. For there is one sorte of men, that haue ioyned handes in this conspiracie, but they maye not be sene in the tragedie. These will playe with suche iugling their parts, that they wilbe both players, and lookers on, and that at once. <hi>Tantae artes, solertia tanta nocendi:</hi> Suche subteltie they haue, suche secrete deuises they vse. But who are they? for nonne are so to bee feared as these. They are suche, to be playne with youe, who in outewarde demeanure seme to bee earnest Protestantes, for they defie the Pope, they will take, if they be required, double othes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
<pb facs="36"/>him, they will sweare, &amp; forsweare him, they will insweare, &amp; outesweare him, they will seme to deale with nonne of his syde. But in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete doinges, and in priuie dealinges, <hi>Sinon</hi> is a suttell fellowe. These kinde of men are they, whom J feare, and therefore J geue you warning of them. For they hauing on, the countenance of Protestantes, &amp; then vnder the collour of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne zeale, sometymes commending me, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes myslyking me, what good Protestante can, excepte he know eyther thē, or me well, but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto them, and repoarte then after them? as it is no poynte of humanitie for these thus to deale, so it is no modestie, for me to speake anye thing in myne owne commendacion. This J may saye: a synner J am, J can not iustifie my self. Yea, to aunswere their sclaunders, J maye further saye that for yeares, J am as olde as some of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes were: for my lyfe, let it be layd in balance with their Doctors, and chiefe, J aske no fauour, let it be fifted, and well weyd. Vnwilling J am to saye thus much, yet the cause cōsidered, it may be sayd. For learning, let a whole synode of their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Syr Johns confute, if they can, my doin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: touching madnes, it was some madde bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne that sclaundered me: for J thanke God, J ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knewe what it meante, except when J offered to ydoles, when J kyssed blinde blockes, when J
<pb facs="36"/>reuerenced candels, when J honoured their false earthe, and when J adoured their counterfaicte bloud. For, oh in how many Churches haue J se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, that say: that they had their deceapteful earth from Jerusalē, their feyned bloud made by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, &amp; that alleage that they haue, <hi>Praeputium Domini,</hi> his coate, his crosse, nayles, hammer, and all? what is deceapte, if this be not? what is madnes, if this is not? howe manye coates had Christ? howe manye crosses suffered he on? howe long shall wee be feade in blindenes? Oh, howe long shall we be lead in suche lewdenes? well, God make vs all learned if we be not, God make vs all good if we are not, God lende vs eyes if we see not. God lende vs eares if we heare not, and God gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unte that frendelye, charitablye, and willinglye. we maye seeke the truethe, and exhorte one an other, that lyuing here in perfecte charitie together, we maye in the ende lyue in heauen, and enioye that rest, which God for hys hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Amen.</p>
