But why write I this, or to
your Honour? surely as one
who euer reuerenced your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

craue leaue to expresse my selfe
one of <hi>the Citie,</hi> reioysing
and praising God in your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
prosperity and aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and the rather, because
my selfe was an eye-witnesse
how God led you through some
of your yonger yeeres, which
were so studiously and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably
passed, as this your
latter time fitly answereth
that expectation which was
then conceiued of you.</p>
   <p>You were then deare to our
common mother that famous
Vniuersity of <hi>Cambridge;</hi>
which for your eloquence and
grace of speech and perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
appointed you her Orator:
<pb facs="5"/>
for your wisdome and graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in gouernment, chose you
her Procter: for your sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in all kinde of fruitfull
and commendable litterature,
tendred you all her honors and
degrees: and for your sober,
studious, and vertuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
worthily held now
her great Ornament. And
now as riper for greater em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiments,
the same God (whose
priuiledge it is to dispense pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,
for he pulleth downe
one and setteth vp another)
hath moued his Maiestie not
onely to set your seat among
the honouroble, but to admit
you (as it were) into his breast,
and betrust you with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of this great state and
Kingdome: an office not more
ancient then honourable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
<pb facs="5"/>
onely men of rarest
wisdome, fidelity, and fitnesse
to stand before so great, so wise
a King. This was a most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
office among the most
ancient Kings of Israel: for
King Dauid had his two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Secretaries,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 8. 17</note>
      <hi>Seraiah</hi>
and <hi>Iehonatham,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Chro. 27. 32.</note> whom the
text commendeth for a man
of <hi>counsell and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:</hi>
and King <hi>Salomon</hi>
his sonne had other two, <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horeph</hi>
aud <hi>Ahiah,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 King. 4. 3</note> who
were in chiefe place neere the
King. Wee read also of

to King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> of whom
<hi>Iunius</hi> saith; he was <hi>fecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus

being a seruice of such honour
vnder his Maiestie, cannot
be without an answerable
<pb facs="6"/>
waight and charge. Your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
easily conceiueth that the
Lord chargeth you with a
chiefe care of honouring him,
who hath honoured you: that
you stand charged to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty
with great trust and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity:
that the <hi>Church</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth
that by your authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
you should promote her
causes, and stand in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of pure religion: that
the Common-wealth claimeth
her part in you, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
of peace within her
wals, and prosperity within
her palaces: that the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
looketh you should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
her iust causes, promote
learning, and encourage her
students, by helping them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the roomes of the ignorant
and vnlearned Ministers:
<pb facs="6"/>
in a word,<note place="margin">Pro. 11. 11.</note> that the <hi>whole
City hopeth to be exalted
by the prosperity of the
righteous.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And now if your Honours
thankefull heart shall call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, and say, <hi>Quid retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buam
domino?</hi> you will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
fal into frequent thoughts
and desires,<note place="margin">Tota vita Christiani <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>anctum desiderium est. <hi>Aug. in Ioh. tract</hi> 4.</note> of discharging all

counseller is that <hi>great
Counsellour,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Esa. 9.</note> who is daily to
be consulted by feruent praier.
The next is the word of God,
which as it giueth no lesse cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
direction in difficult ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
than the Oracle did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Israel, or then did the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of the cloud, and of fire by
day and night for their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or station, while they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
through the wildernesse:
so the daily consulling with
Gods statutes, by reading and
meditation (as with so many
learned counsellours) made
holy <hi>Dauid</hi> wiser than the <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psa. 119. 98 99, 100.</note>

to that, is to conuerse
and consult with such as doe
feare God,<note place="margin">Pro. 10. 32.</note>
      <hi>whose lips speake
iust and good things:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a man shal become both wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
and better. This is the
high way to attaine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
grace and reputation
with God and good men; for
this is an inheritance not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with greatnesse, but with
goodnesse: the former cannot
force or compell affections, the

them: the former may
