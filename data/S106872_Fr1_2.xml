   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR THOMAS EGERTON KNIGHT, LORD Keeper of the great Seale of England, Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine of the Countie Palatine of Chester, <hi>and one of his Maiesties most honourable priuie Councell, grace and peace</hi> be multiplied.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I consider (right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) the estate of England in these our dayes, I cannot better compare it, then with the estate of the kingdome of Iudah vnder K. <hi>Iosias,</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed shortly yet effectually by <hi>Sophonie</hi> the Prophet, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; preached in that time. For as then God gaue to that people that worthy &amp; godly King, who zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously<note place="margin">2. King. 25.</note> rooted out Idolatrie, and planted Gods true worship agreeable to his law▪ so God in great mercy hath giuen vs our most gratious Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by whose godly meanes Idolatrie hath beene aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, Gods true religion and seruice restored, his holy word truly and sincerely preached, and peace and tranquilitie among vs long maintained. And as in those daies vnder King <hi>Iosias,</hi> notwithstanding that godly and zealous reformation, there was great wickednes among the people, as the said <hi>Sophonias</hi> sheweth. For there were then which worshipped<note place="margin">Sopho. 1. 5.</note> vpon the rouffes of their houses the host of heauen: and which worshipped and sware by the true and
<pb facs="3"/> onely God <hi>Iehoua,</hi> and by <hi>Malcha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> their Idoll: and<note place="margin">6.</note> such as were turned backe from after the true God, and sought him not, nor inquired after him: and<note place="margin">8.</note> that did weare strange apparell: and others that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their maisters houses with robbery and deceit:<note place="margin">9.</note> and such as were frozen in their dregges, and said in<note place="margin">12.</note> their hearts the Lord will neither doe good nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. And Ierusalem was then a filthie and spoyling<note place="margin">Chap. 3. 1. 2.</note> citie, which heard not Gods voyce, receiued not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, trusted not in the Lord, and drew not neere vnto her God, &amp;c. Euen so how these sinnes abound at this time in this land, I thinke there are but few, but doe see: and none that truely feareth God, but doth lament. To omit other sinnes here mentioned, as then there were which worshipped <hi>Iehoua</hi> the onely true God, and <hi>Malcham</hi> their Idoll: euen so there be now not a few, which to please the Prince and State pretend outwardly to like of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion established, and yet inwardly in their hearts fauour Idolatrie and wicked worshippings repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the same. And as then many were turned backe from after God, and sought him not, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after him: euen so now there are many which be reuolted from Gods holy worship agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his word, and vtterly forsake the holy assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies where Gods word is truly preached, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are according to Christs institution rightly ministred, and Gods holy name faithfully called vpon. These with <hi>Lots</hi> wife looke backe vnto<note place="margin">Genes. 19. Numb. 14.</note> Sodome: and are with the Israelites in heart turned back into Egypt, desiring rather to eate onions and garlike there, then to feed vpon the heauenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na of Gods blessed word.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>Of these thus turned backe from seeking after God, they be most dangerous, which being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themselues, endeuour by all meanes both by speaking and writing to seduce and deceiue others. Such be the Seminarie Priests and Iesuites, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be at this present time (at leastwise in outward apparance) at deadly fewd among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, writing most bittely one against another: yet they all agree in resisting Gods truth, seducing the simple and in labouring most earnestly to set vp againe their Dagon of the Masse fallen downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arke of Christs Gospell. To this end they write lewd, lying, and slanderous Pamphlets, wherein they traduce the truth, and faithfull fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers thereof, deceiue the ignorant, and confirme in error their ouer affectioned fauorers, who without triall or examination ouer rashly receiue, and ouer lightly beleeue whatsoeuer is broached by them.</p>
   <p>Of these lying Libels there came one to my hands a yeere past and more, pretended to be printed at Antwerpe 1600. wherein is boldly affirmed, but faintly proued, that we haue no faith, nor religion: that of vs both the learned, and ignorant of the Greeke and Latine tongues be Infidels: that wee know not what wee beleeue: that we are bound in conscience both neuer to aske forgiuenesse of our sinnes, and also to auoide all good workes: that we make God the author of sinne, and worse then the diuell. These and such other shameles assertions and false slanders when I read, it came into my heart, that Master <hi>Thomas Wright</hi> (with whose spirit I had beene acquainted) was the venter of this ware. In which opinion I was afterward confirmed, for that
<pb facs="4"/> both some of his fauourers could not denie it, and in a written copie therof taken in a search in Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire and sent vnto me, these two letters, <hi>T. W.</hi> were set in the end of it.</p>
   <p>This lewd Libell although in respect of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter voide both of truth and learning, deserued ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be despised, then earnestly answered: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the author of it, thinketh so highly of himself, and so basely and contemptuously of vs, giuing out in certaine written conferences, which he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed abroad in this land, and some faithfull men haue seene, that wee be vnlearned, and so giuen to wordly affaires, that we bestow no time, or but little in studie: I (although the meanest and vnmeetest of many) was moued to wtite this answere, thereby to confute these calumnies, to cleere the truth, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the faithfull, and if by Gods gracious blessing it might be, to reclaime and reforme the ignorant and seduced. Whereof I haue the lesse hope, for that as they imitate those wicked Israelits, <hi>which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to hearkē, turned away their shoulder, stopped their</hi>
      <note place="margin">Zach. 7. 11.</note>
      <hi>eares that they might not heare, &amp; made their hearts as an Adamant stone, least they should heare the law &amp; the words which the Lord of hosts sent in his spirit by his Prophets:</hi> So they doe fully follow the peruerse Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, which most obstinately refused to read godly bookes written by Christians, as that ancient elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Christian <hi>Lactantius,</hi> in these eloquent words declareth: <hi>Non est apud me dubium, Constantine Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lactant. lib. 5. cap. 1.</note>
      <hi>Maxime, quin hoc opus nostrum, quo singularis ille rerū conditor, &amp; huius immensi operis rector asseritur, si quis attigerit ex istis inepte religiosis (vt sunt nimia superstitione impatientes) insectetur etiam maledictis:
<pb facs="4"/> vt vix lecto fortasse principio, affligat, proijciat, execre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, se{que} inexpiabili scelere contaminari atque astringi putet, si haec aut legat patienter aut audiat.</hi> One Bee or egge is not liker to another, then to these Pagans be our peeuish Papists, in shutting their eies from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding godly and learned bookes, tending to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of their errors, &amp; the instruction of them in the truth. Whom yet I am to intreate with <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> words immediatly following: <hi>Ab hoc tamen,</hi>
      <note place="margin">si Idem ibidem:</note>
      <hi>fieri potest, humanitatis iure postulamus, vt nō prius dā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net quam vniuersa cognouerit. Nam si sacrilegis &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditoribus, &amp; veneficis potestas defendendi sui datur, nec praedamnari quenquam incognita causa licet, non iniustè petere videmur, vt si quis erit ille, qui inciderit in haec, si leget, perlegat: si audiet sententiam differat in extremū.</hi> This reasonable request I would that I might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine at our Romish Catholickes hands, that they would first read and examine this my answere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they condemne it. For what is more vniust, then to condemne that which a mā doth not know. Howbeit I doubt least with the same <hi>Lanctantius</hi> I must say: <hi>Sed noui hominum pertinaciam, nunquam</hi>

      <hi>impetrabimus. Timent enim ne à nobis reuicti, manus dare aliquando clamante ipsa veritate cogantur. Obstre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punt igitur &amp; intercedunt ne audiant: &amp; oculos suos opprimunt, ne lumen videant quod offerimus</hi> Euen so our vntruly termed Catholickes doe follow this froward peruersitie of the Pagans, in whom that saying also of the Prophet (as it is alleaged by Saint <hi>Luke</hi>) is verified: The heart of this people is waxed<note place="margin">Act. 28. 27.</note> grosse or fat, and their eares are dull of hearing, and they haue shut their eyes, least they should see with their eyes, and heare with their eares, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb facs="5"/> with their hearts, and should be conuerted, and I might heale them. The which is a fearefull iudgement of God; when men refusing the loue of the truth that they might be saued, be giuen vp to a<note place="margin">2. Thess. 2.</note> strong delusion to beleeue lyes.</p>
   <p>But if these blinded with errour and ignorance, for whose sake especially I haue written this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, will not vouchsafe to read it, nor make any vse and profit of it: yet if it may some what serue to edifie the faithfull, and confirme the weake, I shall thinke my labour not altogether lost. The which how small or simple soeuer it be, yet as I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it for the good of Gods Church: so I haue bin by your Honours curtesie incouraged to offer and present it vnto your Lordship, as a true testimony of my louing heart and dutiful affection towards your Honour, for your fauour shewed me. The God of all grace and mercy blesse your Lordship and all yours, increase his good graces and gifts in you, and long preserue you to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of this Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, Amen.</p>
