TO THE RIGHT
Worshipfull and vertuous
Lady, the Lady Anne Bacon, sole
heire to the Worship. Edward Buttes
Esquire, her Father, as also to her Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
the right worthie Syr Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Buttes Knight, and
Thomas Buttes E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squire,
deceased.</head>
   <head type="sub">The Name of this Booke.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Painter (Right
worshipfull) fain
woulde make a
speech to great
<hi>Alexander,</hi> and
(for that being a
meane man, and
vnknowne to the King, small notice
and lesse respect would bee had of
<pb facs="3"/>
him) he procured <hi>Alexanders</hi> owne
cloake or princely robe, and therein
presented himselfe before the King.
The same deuise my selfe am forced
to put in practise, for being vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
or at least not knowne worthie
to be knowne vnto your Ladiship,
I do partly cloake me with the large
Mantle of common Homage: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cloath me with the proper coate
of my Ancestors: who as they were
a litle nearer then my self vnto your
blood, so were they much nearer to
your thoughts, and better knowne
vnto you. Thus hauing put on my
cloake with the Painter, I begin my
speech.</p>
   <p>Madame, as the admired perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all excellent indowments,
wherewith God hath inriched you,
necessarily plucketh from the hearts
of all that know you, due reuerence;
so the naturall league of mutual loue
and friudship betweene your and
<pb facs="3"/>
my Ancestors, (while they all liued
togither in <hi>Norffolke</hi>) more neerly
vrgeth mee particularly to deuote
my selfe vnto you. And yet not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
your Ladiships proper name (now
cancelled and concealed in you, by
participation of another) is thus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull
to commaund my thoughts;
but infinit cause (me thinkes) I haue,
highly to respect and honour you,
euen in, &amp; by that name, which (but
for my fathers progeny stil continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Norffolk</hi>) had put our name to
silence. Yea, who most gladly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth
not the glorious name of
that thrise worthie and renowmed
wight of famous memory, Syr <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas
Bacon,</hi> Lord Keeper of the
great seale of England, while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
whose magnificent bountie to
our Vniuersitie, and especially to
<hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge (whereof
himself sometime was, as I am now)
hath purchased him a perpetuitie of
<pb facs="4"/>
glory, to be celebrated for euer a
principall Benefactor. The chiefe
Ofspring from this so excellent a
roote (into whom the whole acoom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of all that worth is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
and deriued) is your Ladiships
rightly right Worshipfull Knight,
of the same name, now liuing. Who
is wel knowne to be the vndoubted
heire, not only of his fathers wealth,
but of his vertues and glory also. All
these premised words (excellent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)
inferre thus much: I most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
acknowledge, either of you
both may iustly claime interest in
the Fee-simple (or rather simple fee)
of my best indeuours, studies and
praiers, for the preseruation of your
health, and continuance of your life.
The which least I should seeme on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
idlely to wish, I haue not onely
bene Votary to <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sickes
great Grand-father, but Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
also to <hi>Dyet,</hi> healths kindest
<pb facs="4"/>
Nourse. To whose frugall Table, I
inuite your Ladiship.</p>
   <p>But afore you come, I think it my
best course to tell you what kind a
feast you shall finde. In three words
I describe it thus: <hi>Dyets dry Dinner.</hi>
That is, varietie of Fare: prouided,
prepared and ordered, at <hi>Dyets</hi> own
prescription: whose seruant and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
at this feast I professe my
selfe. Thus far (perhaps) not disliked
of any. A <hi>Dry Dinner,</hi> not only <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnum
Prandium,</hi> without Wine, but
<hi>Accipitrinum,</hi> without all drinke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Tabacco,</hi> (which also is but Dry
Drinke): herein not like to be liked
of many. What ere it be (as he saith
in the Comedie) <hi>Habeas vt Nacta,</hi>
take it as you finde it, and welcome.
More then which I cannot perform.
And therefore most humbly I kisse
your hand.</p>
