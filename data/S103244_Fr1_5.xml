Copie of a letter sent from
Oxford to the Authour of this
booke, and thought good in his
absence to be set down by those
to whome the publique al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance

   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Aster Sutton,</hi>
I haue peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,
which
seemeth to mee in my
simple opinion, very
deuout, diuine &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
The subiect of
your booke, I greatly
<pb facs="25"/>
approoue, for to teache
to die well, is the forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
perswasiue to liue
well, which alas are in
these wicked times,
both little thought on:
for in deede, men liue
as though they neuer
made accompt to die:
and they die as if they
neuer thought on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life. Your seuerall
treatises are very Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
&amp; most necessary
in this dying age, to all
goodnesse: your phrase
and vaine of penninge
sweete and patheticall:
your allusions diuine &amp;
comfortable. I say at
<pb facs="25"/>
once, and I thinke, <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
in illo libro spiritum
dininum olent.</hi> Wherfore
my counsell vnto you
is, that you woulde
make this your booke
liue by printing, which
may make many liue
frō sinning. Gods good
spirite hath not moued
you to take this good
paines, now to bury the
fruite, so soone as it is
borne, and none profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but that it shoulde
be presented vnto the
worlde, to liue, when
you are dead: <hi>Foelix &amp;
formosa proles est:</hi> be not
then so vnnatural now,
<pb facs="26"/>
to stifle it in the cradle,
or cast it with <hi>Moyses</hi> to
drowning: it is worthy
the nurcing, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
vp of a Princes
daughter, and your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
patronesse.
The Church looketh
to haue good seruice
of it: the Vniu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>rsitie,
your Colledge, your
mother, your frendes
expect credite &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
by it: your
selfe the father of it, will
no doubt haue great
ioy of it. Goe forwarde
then on Gods name,
and christen it to the
world. And so I leaue
<pb facs="26"/>
with my hartiest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,
longing to
see that faire printed,
which is now so neere
written, I could s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
