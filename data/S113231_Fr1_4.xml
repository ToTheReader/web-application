<pb facs="4"/> in this matter by his own reading, meditation, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, with sundrie learned men, had long before finished a great volume, and wayted but his opportunity to furnish it to the presse, though I neuer read one leafe of that booke, whome I did for iust cause so highly reuerence, that I was vnwilling to preiudice any of his godly proceedings, especially in this thing, wherein I knewe he had trauailed aboue most of his time: and thereupon suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my purpose for a time, when I had imparted vnto him what I had done, he gaue me this aduise, to take his booke, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with mine owne, and to make one of them both; which I refusing, as being vnmeete for such a purpose, and not knowing how I should well sorte out to the Reader such varietie of matter, as was like to arise out of them both, nor cunningly to fit the one to the other, as it were to put a new piece of cloth to an old garment, determined wholly to suppresse mine own, expecting the comming foorth of his in time: whereunto also I solicited him by writing, and that also was my iust defence to those that still called vpon me, for the comming foorth of mine owne. In which expectation I continued, vntill most vntimely, I vnderstoode to my great grief, and to the vnspeakable losse of the Church of God, that hee was fallen a sleepe in the Lord: And then I reuiued my former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and reuised mine owne labours, in which hauing at the first contented my selfe, with the bare proofes out of the scriptures, which I then thought sufficient, especially for that auditorie, to whome they were first ment, did now compare the seuerall positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein contained, with the doctrine of former times, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, as I found the same set downe in the writings of the fathers Greeke and Latine, new and olde, so many as I had, or could conueniently get, and as I had time to reade them: whom I finding to agree with me in the same points, or rather my selfe with them, was thereby the rather confirmed therin, and thought that by their testimony and consent, as it were by the pillar of truth, I might sustaine and defend the same against al those that should oppugne, or gainsay it. Thus hauing so many learned men on my side, managing the same cause with me, or rather my selfe fighting vnder their colours, haue at the last brought foorth this treatise vnto the view of the world, and haue adventured it vnto
