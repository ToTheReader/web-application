   <head>THE LIFE OF SOLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVS,

CAMERTES.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
left in writing by them
that are skilfull, in what
time <hi>Iulius Solinus</hi> florish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
which thing I beleeue
to haue happened because
the monuments of such as
writ after him perrished al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
vniuersally, at such time as the barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions
made hauock of all things. I maruel that the
cōpiler of the Supplement of Chronicles (in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respectes a base wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ter.) hath reported that
this <hi>Solinus</hi> floris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed in the time of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>
to whom he surmiseth him to haue dedicated hys
Polyhistor. For it is euident that in this woorke,
<hi>Solinus</hi> maketh mentiō of the Emperor <hi>Vespasians</hi>
dooings. Furthermore, hee speaketh of <hi>Suetonius
Paulinus,</hi> whō <hi>Plinie</hi> saw as he witnesseth himself.
Besides this, <hi>Solinus</hi> hath drawn almost all his mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
out of <hi>Plinies</hi> fountaines, and yet neuerthelesse
in wryting these things, hee desireth hys freende
<pb facs="3"/>
in the beginning of his worke, to beare wyth hys
simplicitie. But forasmuch as he no where maketh
mention of <hi>Plinie,</hi> (by whom he was furthered) I
coniecture that <hi>Solinus</hi> wrate this work while <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi>
was yet aliue. And therevppon (by likelihoode)
it comes to passe, that hee made no mention of hys
author at that time liuing. By like reason it might
fall out, that <hi>Plinie</hi> no where maketh mention of
<hi>Dioscorides</hi> a famous wrighter of the same time
that he was, when notwithstanding it is apparant,
that <hi>Plinie</hi> borowed many thinges out of him into
his work. The same fault also might bee imputed
to <hi>Dioscorides</hi> (for it might bee founde in <hi>Ammon</hi>
which of them purloyned from other) if hee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
the name of <hi>Plinie,</hi> haue filched so manie
thinges out of him. They that haue written moste
precisely of the liues and manners of <hi>Xenophon</hi> and
<hi>Plato,</hi> and sundry other things of thē, report that in
al the nūbers of Volumes which eche of thē wrate,
neyther <hi>Plato</hi> made once mention of the name of
<hi>Xenophon,</hi> nor <hi>Xenophon</hi> of the name of <hi>Plato.</hi>

      <l>The sting of Enuie stints, and hath no poison more to shead.</l>
   </q>
   <p>VVhich saying of <hi>Naso</hi> is very true. VVhat
may be sayd of <hi>Macrobius,</hi> who diuers times ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
whole leaues out of <hi>Gellius?</hi> Or of <hi>Placidus,</hi>
who boroweth of <hi>Ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ius?</hi> or of <hi>Acron,</hi> who stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb facs="3"/>
from <hi>Porphyrio?</hi> What shall wee say of sixe
hundred others, who in long treatises, suppressing
the names of them from whome they borowed
them, haue word for word attributed all things to
themselues? No mā doubteth but that <hi>Aulus Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
the very Diamond of the Latin tongue, profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
greatly by reading <hi>Liuie,</hi> and yet he wil not in
any wise that <hi>Liuie</hi> the prince of Latin Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers,
should be partaker of his Nights. Yet
am I not of the opinion of some mē, which thinke
that <hi>Solinus</hi> made no mention of <hi>Plinie,</hi> in hope
that <hi>Plinies</hi> works should vtterly haue perished, &amp;
so his collections onely haue remained, and in
processe of time no mā shold haue bin able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
his filchings, as <hi>Florus</hi> &amp; <hi>Iustine</hi> are thought
to haue trauelled to the like end &amp; purpose▪ would
God there were none other cause then this of the
losse of so many good Authors. Then to passe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Greekes by the way, the monuments of
<hi>Cato, Varro, Nigidius, Salust, Higinius, Celsus, Enni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Furius, Varrius, Actius, Neuius,</hi> and <hi>Pacuuius,</hi> all
noble Authors, (which now are perrished, to the
great hinderaunce of Students) shoulde haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
vnto this day. But howsoeuer the case stā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<hi>Solinus</hi> courteously confesseth, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he hath comprehended in hys Polyhistor, pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceedeth
out of most allowable Authors, &amp; hecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
nothing for his owne, in as much as (sayth
he) the diligence of men in olde time hath beene
such, that nothing hath continued vntouched to
<pb facs="4"/>
our dayes. And againe he sayth plainly, that hee
leaueth the auouchi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>g of the trueth of thinges, to
such Authors as hee hath followed in this worke.
Neither is it to be vpbraided to <hi>Solinus</hi> as a shame,
that hee hath euery where followed <hi>Plinie,</hi> more
then <hi>Virgill</hi> is to be found fault with for translating
into his worke the verses of the auncient Poets, &amp;
specially of <hi>Homer.</hi> For it is no small commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to counterfet singulerly a singuler Author.</p>
   <p>That <hi>Solinus</hi> was a Romaine, it is to be coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
both by his phrase of wryting, and also for that
commonly when occasion serueth to speake of the
Romaines, hee is wont in most places to call them
our men, or my countrymen. Not onely the latter
wryters, (as <hi>Sipontinus, Perottus, Domitius, Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,
Angelus Politianus, Hermolaus Barbarus, Ianus
Parrhasius,</hi> and diuers others such like, whom not
without cause a man might account among the
auncient wryters.) But <hi>Seruius</hi> also in his seconde
booke vpon <hi>Virgills</hi> Husbandry, and <hi>Priscian,</hi> two
of the sixe notable Gramarians, haue cited the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of <hi>Solinus</hi> by name. Also the interpreter of
<hi>Dennis,</hi> (whither it were <hi>Priscian</hi> or <hi>Rhemninus</hi>)
hath oftentimes put whole sentences of <hi>Solinussis</hi>
in his verses. If I be not deceiued, all that which
<hi>Macrobius</hi> reciteth of the diuision of the yeere, and
of the odde dayes, are <hi>Solinussis.</hi> Moreouer, the
Doctors of the Church, <hi>Ierom, Ambrose,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ten,</hi>
and other Doctors also, haue many times bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
sentences worde for worde out of <hi>Solinus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>There are some that terme <hi>Solinus</hi> by the name
of <hi>Plinies</hi> Ape, in like manner as <hi>Iulius Capitolinus
Plinius Caecilius,</hi> and <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris</hi> reporte,
that <hi>Titian</hi> was called the Ape of the Orators, and
<hi>Arulen</hi> the Ape of the Stoiks. But these men consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not, that such are wont to be called Apes, as ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
repeate things writtē by others altogether in
the same order without alteration, or els such as
counterfet, not the Authors but theyr shadowes.
But <hi>Solinus</hi> hath so followed <hi>Plinies</hi> phrase, that
(vnder correction bee it spoken) there may scarce
any other be found, that hath approched neerer to
the maiestie of <hi>Plinies</hi> stile. He intitled his Booke
(as is found in certaine old Coppies) to his freend
<hi>Autius,</hi> to who also he deliuered it to be corrected.
Some hold opinion, that he left other monumēts
also of hys wyt, which eyther by force of time are
perished, or els perchaunce lie hyd in some blinde
corner among Mothes.</p>
