Whereunto is annexed a briefe relation of the Turkish present strength, both of horse and foote: with al the victories the Turkes have prevailed against the Christians these last three hundred yeares. As also what glorious victories the Christians have wonne against the Turkes, till this present yeare. 1638. Published by authority</title>

   <p>stigations of Sathan, there hath none prevailed so much for the enlarging and increase of his Infernall Kingdome, as the setting of Christian Kings and Princes at variance one against the other, and the whilst they have beene by the eares (as it were) and infesting each other with deadly hatred and bloody Warres, the <hi>Turke,</hi> their common Adversary, hath taken advantage of their unnaturall dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by force taken from them (in little more than three Hundred yeeres past) more Kingdomes, Empires, Principalities, large Territories and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niories, from the Christians, than all the rest of Christendome besides. His force and power I will partly relate in the latter end of this Treatise, and also how the Christians have oftentimes had the better of him, when they have beene at Unity and peace amongst themselves: but first let the Reader peruse the true Coppy of an insulting proud Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, lately sent from the Grand Signior from his Court at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to the King of <hi>Poland</hi> now Reigning; the Contents of the <hi>Letter</hi> were as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
