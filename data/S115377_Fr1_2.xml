   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM SAINTMAVRE, LORD BEAVCHAMPE, EARLE OF <hi>HERTFORD:</hi> AND TO THE MOST Vertuous and truly Religious Countesse; my very good Lord and Ladie, IOHN ATKINS wisheth all grace, and peace from our LORD IESVS <hi>Christ.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Vstome (which with vs is another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) hath euermore claymed by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription (Right Honourable) that such Bookes, as are publikely committed to the Presse, whither they bee small or great, should be sent abroad to the open view of the World, with some Epistle Dedicatorie going before them. Which if they haue not, they may then bee questioned by the Readers, whither that the Authors and Writers of these Works, haue any worthy good Friends abroad: or else, whither that the Workes themselues may be thought well worthy of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage.
<pb facs="3"/>In due regard whereof, I haue here in bent my selfe to tread the common path, and now at this present to vsher forth into the Vineyard of Gods Church, these first Fruits of mine imprinted labours in my publike Ministerie, vnder both your Honours most worthy Patronage (which are now but one in the Lord.) Most humbly crauing your Honours fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable acceptance of the fame, <hi>as our Sauiour once did of that poore Widdowes Farthing.</hi> And although I may most truly confesse and say, in the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, of that <hi>Centurion</hi> in the Gospell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.8. I am not worthy to bee graced here in by your Honours greatnesse (knowing right well mine owne vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) yet the very little matter, and argument it selfe, of this little Booke of mine is it, which I haue heere made bold to commend vnto you, to wit, <hi>The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians Race:</hi> A Race indeed, which the Wisemen of this World doe vtterly refuse to runne, because they are yet but Worldly wise: and what our ignorant ones dreame not of, because that their eyes as yet are blinded: and what our Naturalists know not of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that this Race is spiritually discerned, and what our Earth-wormes thinke not of, because that all such are but earthly minded: and which all our prophane ones vtterly despise, because that as yet they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together irreligious: and which all our vngodly ones as yet regard not, because that their hearts are hard and stony, and which our Hypocrites know right wel, but yet will not runne, vnlesse it be only in the sight of men for a season, to haue the applause and prayse of men: and lastly, which all our truly Religious ones striue to runne; albeit, with many faintings, failings,
<pb facs="3"/>and desertions. And therefore (now Right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to this only end, that all our Worldly wise <hi>(bene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dictione diuina)</hi> may be yet more truly wise vnto their owne saluation: and all our ignorant ones may be the more enlightned, and all our Naturalists may bee the more renewed, and all our Worldly ones may the more haue their minds set on heauenly things, and all our prophane ones may yet proue the more pious, and all our vngodly ones may come at last to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: and all our Hypocrites may be much more zealous, so many as are found within the ranke of Election. And finally, all our Religious ones may be much more strengthened, and animated in that good course which they haue hither vnto begunne, that so constantly and comfortably continuing to the Goales end, they may reape that rich price of eternall blisse.</p>
   <p>I haue heere made bold for the publike good of Gods Church, to commit this short Sermon of mine to the Presse: teaching both your Honours in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and all true Christians else in generall, so to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, hold on, and continue this our true Christian Race, vnto the very end and vpshot of our liues: that in death we may enioy eternall life.</p>
   <p>Vouchsafe therefore (Right Honourable, I beseech you) to permit this little Worke of mine, to passe into the World vnder your Honours Name, which in truth will not only be euen as a shield to protect it against the bitter and biting Tongues of all our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and captious Ones, but also bee as an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment powred out, yeelding a most sweete and redo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent sauour, for to make it so much the more odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb facs="4"/>indeed, in the hearts and minds of all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Readers, and Hearers of the same. And thus most humbly crauing pardon for this my boldnesse, and not being willing to detayne your Honours any longer, least I should be too tedious. I commend you and yours to that most gracious God, whom you daily serue, and to the Word of his grace, which is able to build further in you both, and to giue you an inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all them that are satisfied.</p>
