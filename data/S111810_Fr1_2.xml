   <head>TO THE WORSHIPFVL,
his approoued good Master, and
Friend, Master Henrie Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolles,
Esquire.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Spying by apparant
shewe (worshipfull Syr)
the greate good will you
beare vnto those that abā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
idlenes, and applye
themselues to some kinde
of exercise, where, by often frequenting, it
may bring vnto them (hereafter) such praise
and profite, as they shal haue singular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to pray for those friendes, which lende
them ayde in the same. It is not materiall
to amplify, or glose vnto such, whose iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
is vniuersall, whose foresight in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
hath great foreshewe of silent interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
I am to craue at your worshippes
handes, three things. First, not to condemne
my boldnesse. Secondly, not to repulse my
rudenesse. And thirdly, to accepte my sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
good wil, who wrote this with as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb facs="3"/>
affection, as euer <hi>Paris</hi> bare vnto faire
<hi>Helena.</hi> This simple peece, which by my
simpl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> industry I haue pēned, is vtterly voyd
of eloquence: For why, it was neuer (as yet)
my chance to haue any conuersatiō, where
such societie accompanied together. For
<hi>Pallas</hi> will not be seene to intermeddle her
selfe where <hi>Pan</hi> so peartly preaceth in place.
I am perchance too tedious vnto your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe,
and make a long Oration vnto litle
effecte. But as a shameles crauer hath not
the ciuilitie to make an end: So I the skilles
writer haue not the perseuerance of inough.
I therfore to be short, make this my present
vnto you, intituled, <hi>The Castle of Courtesie,</hi>
whereunto is adioyned, <hi>The Houlde of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie,</hi>
a matter not so worthie, as you are
worthy to be a Patrone off. But fame hath
so spread your courtesie and humility, your
ciuilitie and humanitie, as it abasheth me
to speake: because I wante the skill accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
I beseech your worship not to weigh
the worke but the wil: not the matter but
the maker: vvho vvil during life, rest at your
<pb facs="3"/>
commandement, vvishing vnto your vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe
vvith vnfayned faith, your hearts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
(in vvhat soeuer,) and eternall felicitie
in the vvorld to come, Amen.</p>
   <signed>Your worshippes seruant dayly
at commandement:
<hi>Iames Yates.</hi>
