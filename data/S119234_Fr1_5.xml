      <l>And with preiudicacies too prophane,</l>
      <l>Passe <hi>Homer,</hi> in your other Poets sleights;</l>
      <l>Wash here. In this Porch to his numerous Phane,</l>
      <l>Heare ancient Oracles speake, and tell you whom</l>
      <l>You haue to censure. First then <hi>Silius</hi> heare,</l>
      <l>Who thrice was Consull in renowned <hi>Rome;</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Whose verse (saith <hi>Martiall</hi>) nothing shall out-weare.</l>

      <l>HE, in <hi>Elysium,</hi> hauing cast his eye</l>
      <l>Vpon the figure of a Youth, whose haire</l>
      <l>With purple Ribands braided curiously,</l>
      <l>Hung on his shoulders wondrous bright and faire;</l>
      <l>Said, Virgine, What is he whose heauenly face</l>
      <l>Shines past all others, as the Morne the Night;</l>
      <l>Whom many maruelling soules, from place to place,</l>
      <l>Pursue, and haunt, with sounds of such delight?</l>
      <l>Whose countenance (wer't not in the Stygian shade)</l>
      <l>Would make me, questionlesse, beleeue he were</l>
      <l>A verie God. The learned Virgine made</l>
      <l>This answer: If thou shouldst beleeue it here,</l>
      <l>Thou shouldst not erre: he well deseru'd to be</l>
      <l>Esteem'd a God; nor held his so-much breast</l>
      <l>A little presence of the Deitie:</l>
      <l>His verse comprisde earth, seas, starres, soules at rest:</l>
      <l>In song, the Muses he did equalise;</l>
      <l>In honor, <hi>Phoebus:</hi> he was onely soule;</l>
      <l>Saw all things spher'd in Nature, without eyes,</l>
      <l>And raisde your <hi>Troy</hi> vp to the starrie Pole.</l>
      <l>Glad <hi>Scipio,</hi> viewing well this Prince of Ghosts,</l>
      <l>Said, O if Fates would giue this Poet leaue,</l>
      <l>To sing the acts done by the Romane Hoasts;</l>
      <l>How much beyond, would future times receiue</l>
      <l>The same facts, made by any other knowne?</l>
      <l>O blest <hi>Aeacides!</hi> to haue the grace</l>
      <l>That out of such a mouth, thou shouldst be showne</l>
      <l>To wondring Nations, as enricht the race</l>
      <l>Of all times future, with what he did know:</l>

      <l>And as when bright <hi>Hyperion</hi> holds to vs</l>
      <l>His golden Torch; we see the starres disperse,</l>
      <l>And euery way flie heauen; the pallid Moone</l>
      <l>Euen almost vanishing before his sight:</l>
      <l>So with the dazling beames of <hi>Homers</hi> Sunne,</l>
      <l>All other ancient Poets lose their light.</l>
      <l>Whom when <hi>Apollo</hi> heard, out of his starre,</l>
      <l>Singing the godlike Acts of honor'd men;</l>
      <l>And equalling the actuall rage of warre,</l>
      <l>With onely the diuine straines of his pen;</l>
      <l>He stood amaz'd, and freely did confesse</l>
      <l>Himselfe was equall'd in <hi>Maeonides.</hi>

      <l>Next, heare the graue and learned <hi>Plinie</hi> vse</l>

      <l>Another <hi>Homer;</hi> but euen to rehearse</l>
      <l>And number them: they did so much exceed;</l>
      <l>Men thought him not a man; but that his verse</l>
      <l>Some meere celestiall nature did adorne.</l>
      <l>And all may well conclude, it could not be,</l>
