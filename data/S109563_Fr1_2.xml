   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not (noble Gentleman) the titles of
Honour that allureth me, nor the nobilitie
of your Parents that induceth me, but the
admiration of your vertues that perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
me, to publish my pore trauailes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your vndoubted protection. Whom I
most humbly intreate, not onely in so iust a cause to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
me, but also in these Primordia of my studies, after
the accustomed prudence of the Philosophers, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
with fauourable acceptaunce, and continuaunce as
the equitie of the cause requireth. I haue set downe in
these fewe lines in my opinion (Right Worshipfull) the
image of a licentious Vsurer, and the collusions of diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
incrochers, and herevnto was I led by two reasons:
First, that the offender seeing his owne counterfaite in
this Mirrour; might amend it, and those who are like
by ouerlauish profusenesse, to become meate for their
mouths, might be warned by this caueat to shunne the
Scorpion ere she deuoureth.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>May it please your Worshippe, to fauour my
trauailes, and to accept my good will: who incouraged
by the successe of this my firstlings will heereafter in
most humble signe of humanitie continue the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
I haue begunne, commending the cause
and my seruice to your good liking: who
no doubt compassed with incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
vertues, will commend
when you see occasion, &amp;
not condemne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a cause.</p>
