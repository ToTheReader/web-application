   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen he had handled (that honourable knight, Sir <hi>Thomas Smith)</hi> in his <hi>Repub. Anglorum,</hi> amongst other things, the generall consent and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as well of the Prince and nobilitie, as the commons of this land togither; that is to say, the Parliament, <hi>i.</hi> the whole head and bodie of this Realme, as also the authoritie of the Prince apart, and had descended to the point, <hi>viz.</hi> How he doth, this head, distribute his authoritie and power to the rest of the members, for the gouernment and common-wealth of the politique bodie of the same, and (in the prosecution of that) had discussed as well at large the maner and forme of the trials or iudgements that be absolute, here, and definitiue by Parliament, Battell, and the great Assise: the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he obserued, and the argument that he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therein, brought him (at the last) and his stile, to the court which is spirituall, or ecclesiasticall here in England: so termed in the books of law, the Court Christian, or <hi>Curia Christianitatis.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
This hath equally (with the other) it force, power, authoritie, rule, and iurisdiction. Briefly it is descended from the same stocke: namely, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall crowne of this land. But this neuerthelesse, though parcell of the same gouernment or pollicie, he hath passed ouer, onely with a bare mention.</p>
   <p>Neither is it anie maruell: for being (when hee wrote that worke) in the midst of so weightie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, ambassadour in the court of France: it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seemes, than contrarie, his businesse, there, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented him: how could he otherwise, or at the least be iudged so, by any probabilitie, being (as he was) of that authoritie in his own profession, <hi>viz.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the ciuill law, haue pictured (as he did) that course so liuely, where least hee was experienced, and omitted the other?</p>
   <p>The Archbishops (he saith) and Bishops haue a certaine peculiar iurisdiction in testaments, lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tithes, mortuaries, marriages, adulterie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, orders, religion, &amp;c. These (he saith be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their courtes, after the fashion and maner of the law ciuill, or rather cōmon by citation, libel, <hi>contestationem litis,</hi> examination of witnesses priuily, by exceptions, replications apart, and in writing, allegations, matters by sentences giuen in writing, appellations from one to another, as well à <hi>grauamine,</hi> as <hi>à sententia definitiua.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
Their names he addeth and titles of Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, aduocates, assessors, ordinaries, commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c. far from the maner (as he saith, and as it is indeed) of our order in the common lawe of England, that part of the policie or gouernment of the land that hee handled at large, and this is all the light he hath left of the spirituall course, the other.</p>
   <p>I haue therefore aduentured (gentle reader) to imitate that worthy learned man in his secular tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als there, in this spiritual cognisance, <hi>The triall of Bastardie</hi> here.</p>
   <p>Neuerthelesse, because it ariseth, the question of Natiuities in the secular courts, but incedētly: and the Ordinaries iurisdiction (by consequence) not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie in that triall, but <hi>delegata</hi> (as it followeth more at large in this treatise:) it must, this part of that second part of gouernment, be alwaies vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as the iurisdiction to the Ordinarie is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandata</hi> from the prince, and not otherwise. I haue therefore composed it, and not (I hope) vnaptly, atreatise of it selfe: and that because the iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this triall is diuerse from the rest. This is therefore presented vnto thee heere: the rest thou shalt haue, if God permit, in the tractat of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In the meane time (if it please thee to accept it) this thou shalt haue withall, <hi>viz.</hi> How the lawes,
<pb facs="5"/>
how the canons, haue and do either of them esteem of Bastardy diuersly: and how they haue and do, the laws and canons, make their computations (in degrees of consanguinitie) diuersly.</p>
   <p>This computation (verily) in degrees in this kind, inconsideratly, that is to say, without regard of the laws, and canons, how they repute the same, begat in former ages no small error in Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, the laws of Matrimonie, the holy Fathers numeration, and auncient Computation of the Church.</p>
   <p>Of such an effect as this, that infringed so long ago the prohibibition of marriage, commended also vnto thee here in euery kind, where both the tree, and forbidden fruit is pictured, <hi>Estimandum est,</hi> or rather to be feared it is, of such coniunctions had, a base kind of people, ignoble, and licentious to be begotten, apt to prouoke in time, euen the rest to naughtinesse also, and make them become in fine, nor manly in war, nor stable in faith, nor honoured of men, nor beloued of God.</p>
   <p>But let no man be here too seuere a iudge: for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue somtimes springs from lawlesse knowledge, and vice againe from lawfull: neither let me flatter nor offend: the one is no defence of sinne, nor the other impeachment of lawfull matrimony: for neyther doth the adulterous child that is vertuous, nor shake
<pb facs="5"/>
off, nor shadow his adulterous parents crime, nor the legitimat that is vicious, dishonour the vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led bed. And to this effect it is written, <hi>Sicut boni filij adulterorum, nulla est defensio sic mali filij coniugatorum, nullum est crimen nuptiarum.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Let him therfore neuer feare to sincke, that hath this rest to beare him, namely, vertue: for though his parents be the worst, their vilenesse shall not blemish him at all, if vertue beares him vp: for if themselues (if conuerts afterwards) their former life destroys not, much more their off-spring dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with his proper vertue shines, and shall not be eclipsed with the oprobrious liues of his parents; and why? <hi>Non est eius culpa qui nascitur,</hi> It is answered thus, it is not his default that is borne, <note place="margin">Hierom. in Epist. cont. Ruph<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> dist. 56. c. nasci.</note> but his that doth beget him, the seed it selfe is not reputed euill: for nature receiuing hir owne, shee bestowes it, she frames it next a bodie, the seruing members ensue, <hi>Et inter illas sacri ventris an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustias, dei manus semper operatur:</hi> Hence is the flesh, wilt thou condemne it now? looke at the fleshly meanes: <hi>Non peccat terra quae confouet, non semen quod in sulcis iacitur, non humor, vel calor, quibus temperata frumenta in ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men pullulant, sed (verbigratia) fur &amp; latro:</hi> Temper thy iudgement therfore in this behalfe, <hi>Quia non in seminibus, sed in voluntate</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>nascentis, causa vitiorum est, atque virtutum.</hi> And if a law were made, that such might inherit, the vertuous I meane in the one, before the vitious other, why should not that law be iust? the other I call not vniust, but yet it is but temporall, and within the libertie of Princes, iustly to be altered by the times, though iustly they cannot stand in one common wealth together: for that that is in present beeing bridles now the parent to be father of Legitimation, and the other should bridle (if it were) the sonne to furnish himselfe with vertues, least happily his father shuld haue begotten a better sonne abroad, than all the world can finde at home.</p>
   <p>I would be loath in mouing a charitable iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the sonne, to seeme to giue hope to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or libertie to offend, Godforbid. The happiest off-springs they be, and nearer vnto hope (let all mentake me so) that be borne <hi>De legitima paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum coniunctione, approbata perleges,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more at large in this treatise: for leauing the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous bedde: or knowledge had without solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nised marriage, which also we haue touched in the same, that knowledge had (in marriage) in consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinitie and affinitie, haue been, is, and wilbe in all christian ages to come, reputed for no lesse, for sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie reasons. And first because that naturallie a man
<pb facs="6"/>
doth owe a certaine honour, reuerence, and feare to his parents, and therefore vnto others of his kinne, which come verie nigh of the same, in so much that in old time (as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> sheweth) it was not lawful for the sonne, to bath in one place with his father, least he should see him naked.</p>
   <p>Secondlie, such persons must needes be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, and in companie together: if nature therefore abhorred not knowledge in such, they should haue too much opportunitie to licentious liuing, whose neerenesse remooueth all suspition from the world. And behold the heathen Philosopher here. <hi>Where</hi>
      <note place="margin">Arist lib. 2. polit.</note> (saith he) <hi>a man doth loue his kinswoman by nature, if there should be put to this the loue of bodily medling, there should be too much heat and feruentnesse of loue, and too great prouocation to fleshly lust, which is contrarie to the chastitie of marriage.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, such marriages shall hinder that mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all loue and friendship, that is both profitable and honest to human societie, for when a man doth take a wife that is a stranger to him, all the kinred of his wife be knit vnto him by a certaine league of friendship and loue, as if they were his owne: this hath nature ordeined alreadie in blood. Hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the prohibitiō of the Canons, That men and women, to whom loue and concord was thought
<pb facs="7"/>
both profitable and honest, should be knit together by sundry degrees of kinred, and not that one shuld haue many in one, <hi>sed singulae spargerētur in singulos,</hi> the Canons tearme them <hi>necessitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> which they would haue dispersed. In the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the determinations of the most famous and most excellent vniuersities &amp;c. fourth Chap. after the authour (whosoeuer he was) had cited, touching such vnlawfull marriages, the doctours of the church of Christ, that were of greatest authoritie, fame, and renowne, he descended to others, which, though not of so great authoritie, yet their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their credit, learning and grauitie, was receiued worthely, amongst whom he affirmed (to this effect) of an Archbishop in this land, <hi>viz.</hi> being asked by what reason the forbidding we should not marrie in cōsanguinitie nor affinitie, had so great strength and power in the church? answered. <hi>The laws and Canons of the church, be full of this commandement, and there be many decrees of the old fathers also, that we should not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with any of our blood, &amp;c. and as for the cause and reason of this commaundement, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I might say that the simple and plaine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, to obey the power and authoritie of them to whom Christ said, It is not you your selfe that speaketh, but the spirit of your father</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>which speaketh in you, &amp;c. yet for all that, by the consideration and marking also of holy scripture, I am woont to thinke thus with my selfe, amongst the old &amp; ancient people of the Iews, it was not lawful for any person to marry with any out of his tribe: and when I doubted and sought a reason why so, the daughters of</hi> Zelophehad, <hi>came to my remembrance, &amp;c. But in this case</hi> Moses <hi>gaue an answere to their carnalities, That they should not marrie out of their tribe: but the goodnesse and perfection of vs that be Christian folke, is not on this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, for seeing our heritage is God, of whom it is spoken, God is loue and charitie, as the Iewes vsed a law agreeable to their heritage, so we ought to maintaine a law for ours, which is the law of loue and charitie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>There is light &amp; darknesse, good and euill, there be lawfull and expedient, lawfull not expedient, nor lawfull, nor expedient marriages; these be seen in diuers families, in outward degrees, in nigh kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: with this, I commend to the reader the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the English church, that is, to consider in contracts of matrimonie, what is lawfull, what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, what expedient.</p>
