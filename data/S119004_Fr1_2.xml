   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>T is not in vaine that our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sauiour giues such a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Item to such as enioy most of earthly things, that it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier for a Camell to enter through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heauen: not inferring thereby an impossibility that any rich man should be saued, because wee heare of poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> in rich <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; and riches are such blessings, as God bestowes on his children, and by his grace proue furtherances to lay vp a good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō against the life come: But rather implying some difficulty and aduenture hereof, &amp; that arising rather from our abuse thereof, then
<pb facs="3"/>
the things themselues: For so hee expounds himselfe else where, concerning trust and confidence in riches, and not of the simple enioying of them. And so the blessed Apostle comments vpon this text charging rich men that they be not high minded, though they enioy much aboue others, that they trust not in riches, because they are vncertaine, and so will deceiue our trust reposed on them, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs that it is not the vse but the loue of money, which is the roote of all euill; and therfore because som (not al) do lust after thē they haue erred frō the faith, &amp; so do pierce thēselues through with many sorrowes. And therein also wisely discouering vnto vs, two mayne &amp; principall causes of our endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by these blessings, and so by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, instructing vs in such a sober estimate &amp; vse of them, that so they may prooue furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances to eternall life. The causes of our abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of worldly blessings, is our ouer-rating them in our vaine conceits; as if they were speciall fauours of God, &amp; vndoubted pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of true happinesse, so that whosoeuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyes them aboue others, is more highly in Gods esteeme, and so more truly and perfitly happy. And this produceth those dangerous
<pb facs="3"/>
effects of vnsatiable desires and strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in them, as if we could neuer haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of happinesse, as if such strong holds could neuer deceiue vs. Which though it bee a most erroneous and peruerse conceit, and the effects more desperate, as arising from a deceiued heart blinded by the god of this world, that it cannot looke vp higher to things to come, but only doats one these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent shadows, because the very nature &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory conditiō of these things wil not beare it, besides dayly experience to the contrary which might lesson euen fools: yet it is most fearefull to obserue how the minds of many are bewitched therewith, and sing a <hi>Requiem</hi> to their soules, as that foole did in this slippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry estate which on the sodaine may be taken away from them, or they from it. And yet such is the power of this delusion, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they dayly see rich men dye as well as the foolish and ignorant, and leaue their riches to others; yet many thinke that their houses and habitations shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for euer, and therefore thee blesse their soules in this vaine happinesse, and that the rather because they are applauded of others, as the onely happy men, euen because they
<pb facs="4"/>
make much of themselues, and take their fill in these broken Cysternes. And this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maine cause of their ensnaring by these things, euen because they ouer-valew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in regard of them, and so being puffed vp with their fleshly minds, are desperately carryed to the abuse of them, either by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching and scraping still to themselues, as if none were worthy of them but they: that so they may liue peerelesse and vncontrowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of any, or else by lauishing and excesse of riot they wallow like swine in the filth &amp; puddle thereof, and so drowne themselues in euerlasting perdition. Behold the way of worldlings and greedy earth-wormes. And doth not this way vtter their folly, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their posterity delight in their talke, and counts thēselues happy in the misery of their ancestors. And doth not this their happinesse prooue their greater vnhappines, that ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten goods molter like snow against the Sun, what is so lightly come by, is as vainly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with: the third heire seldome knowes the place of his breeding, or enioyes a foot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. A meditation as too too experimentall in this citie, so the rather to be layd to heart by the wise &amp; prudēt, that he may see the plague
<pb facs="4"/>
and hide himself, &amp; reape some durable fruit of these momētany trees. And this is the sum of that which followes: which I do in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility tender vnto your honor &amp; worships, as knowing your slippery states, and fearing what may follow, that you would learne yet more &amp; more to be faithfull in your steward ships, that so you may be ready to giue vp a cōfortable account for the same. I doubt not but you are wise to discerne the face of the sky, &amp; see that the element is full of stormes abrode, &amp; may not the winde turne &amp; blow thē hither. The Lord also make you wiser to discerne the time of your visitation: and so I heartily cōmend your honor &amp; worships to the grace of God, that in mercy hee would cleare the ayre againe, &amp; scatter the black tē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest that our sins haue gathered, and dayly threatēs on our heads as terrible lightnining to break the sword, though it spare the scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, to endanger the soule by depriuing vs of what glorious liberty wee haue abused, though our outward man may lesse feele the blow, as being senslesse therof, or giuing way thereto: And that euen for his sonne Christ Iesus sake, in whom I rest</p>
