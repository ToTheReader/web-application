   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EING appointed by those vnder whose gouernement I haue put my selfe, and to whose direction I haue wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly committed whatsoeuer facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or abilitie is in me, for the benefite of our countrie and reducing to the fold of Christs Catholike church the soules of our poore countrymen so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably seduced: appointed I say by such my Superiors to examine and answere M. W. booke of Antichrist, first &amp; principally so far forth as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched this Seminarie, that is, the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the new Testament lately published, with the Annotatiōs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and M. Martins Discouerie of their heretical corruptions, next and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the other argument concerning Antichrist: I confesse my self to haue bene so loth to take the matter in hand, as ether my duetie and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence suffered, or the loue and charitie of my countrymen and brethren per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
   <p>One reason was, because I sawe many in this societie, for good zeale
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
and forwardnes, as willing, and for ripe knowledge in diuinitie more able, to vndertake and dispatch a greater matter then that. An other reason was, because I thought I could not without some iniurie done to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,<note place="margin">Contra Sand. pa. 5. in fine.</note> dispute against that sauage &amp; barbarous paradox, making sometime <hi>the order &amp; successiō of Popes to be Antichrist,</hi> as M.<note place="margin">Ib. pa. 6. in principio.</note> VV. doth in one page, sometime the whole Catholike and vniuersal <hi>Church vvhereof the Pope is head, to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,</hi>
      <note place="margin">M.W. know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not wel what that Antichrist is, against whom he writeth.</note> as he affirmeth within 5. lines after: ether of which in the iudgment of any Catholike, is as notorious and palpable a lie, as any of Lucians <hi>True Histories.</hi> So that, as if a man would with sage reasons go about to disproue some of those toies which he reporteth,<note place="margin">Lucian de vera histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria. lib. 1.</note> As that his ship being taken vp with a strong wind, &amp; caried in the ayre seuen dayes &amp; seuen nights, thē arriued at an Iland in the middest of the ayre, where he saw a terrible battayle fought, and many a thousand slayne, and yet the field whereon both camps pitched was nothing els but the web or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of spiders, which is not to be marueiled at, spiders being as big there as prety Ilandes are with vs here:<note place="margin">Cyclades.</note> that
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
afterward he came to a land where mē tooke their eyes out of their heads at night time, or otherwise whē they meāt not to vse them, &amp; put them vp in cases, at other conueniēt seasons they tooke them out thence &amp; put them on againe: &amp; such like stuffe, of riuers of wine; &amp; seas of milke, and Ilands of cheese &amp;c. as if (I say) a mā would go about with sober reasons to refute these reports, he should thereby note his auditory of smale wit &amp; discretion, who nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded helpe to find out such incredible fables:<note place="margin">Lucians historical verities &amp; the Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical veri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties are of like nature and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.</note> the very like is to be deemed of this idle inuention concerning An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist in the iudgment of al Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes: Lucians fables being no more false, vnreasonable, and vnprobable against nature and philosophie, then this deuise is peeuish, lying, absurd, vncredible and vnpossible, against Christian faith and diuinitie.</p>
   <p>A greater reason was,<note place="margin">Much good time spent in reading or refuting heretical bookes.</note> for that I vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abhorred in the middest of my course of studies and better exercises, to spend any good houres ether in reading or refuting heretical bookes, which neuer edifie to vertue, deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and saluation, but distract mens mindes from the meditation of al
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
such religious spiritual and heauenly exercise, and fil their heads only with contentions, disputes, and brawles of wordes,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note>

And of this I make the more sure reckening, if at this present I write ought against our English aduersaries, because by certaine expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of things past, I see assuredly what must be looked for in time to come.<note place="margin">Heretikes are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally proude and ignorāt. 2.

and offered sacrifice to his father according to his diuinitie.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Fulke con. Mart. pag. 64, 65. in sine. Supra. pa. 4.</note> vvherevnto may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>The succession of popes is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> or if that like you not, then that <hi>The vniuersal Church is Antichrist.</hi>
      <note place="margin">A strange proposition to say, the church is Antichrist.</note> such strange articles in our religion, that Christian men ought rathet to stop their eares and shut vp their eyes from hearing them or reading them, then expect any ansvver or refutation of them. And vvho vvould not be gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to put pen to paper, whē he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he shal be troubled vvith multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiō of such vnreasonable assertions? of such old, rotten, &amp; execrable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies? such propositions, as euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man naturally doth abhor, al aū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient stories &amp; monuments vniuersal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vvithout exception reiect and refel, al aūcient churches and coūcels since the time of Arrius vvith one vniforme consent haue accursed &amp; cōdemned.</p>
   <p>But the chiefe and maine cause why I most of al lothed this maner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, vvas,<note place="margin">In the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>testants faith there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie.</note> because I find in our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries doctrine no kind of stay or assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, no maner of certaintie or sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes, their vvhole faith being like Maie flovvers, for some few monethes or yeres florishing and in estimation,
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>
vvhich vvithin a short space after wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth avvay, &amp; is of them selues neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, changed, and forsaken. And thē vvhereas to dispute seriously of any matter, requireth some certaine groū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, fountaines, or heads of disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vvherevnto euery man of learning ought to stand,<note place="margin">In their writing and disputing there is no ground.</note> as we see in al other sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, of Logike, Philosophie, Law, any kind of learning humane or diuine, these men haue quite remoued and abolished al such, and haue brought the whole course of their diuinitie, to an idle, lose, vaine, &amp; fantastical kynd of talking, consisting most in denial of principles of religion, where he is counted best diuine, that can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine talke longest: he is counted to beare the bel away, that most arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly can preferre him self before al other, be they few or many, old or new, particular Synodes or general Councels, yea many times &amp; common<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly before the vniuersal and Catholike Church, the holy scriptures, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God him self. So that as the first of these two, that is, their mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in faith, withdraweth me frō al dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them, as men altogether irreligious, vnchristian and godles,
<pb n="9" facs="5"/>
so the second, that is, the want of al sound arguments of disputation, as much discourageth me from writing vnto them, as men altogether vngroū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, vnlearned, &amp; contentious, such as loue to mainteine an endles talke of al things, but haue no order or forme to cōclude &amp; resolue of any thing.<note place="margin">That the Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes haue no certaine fayth.</note> These two partes I wil declare and make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by a fevv examples.</p>

For when as vpon their first breach from the church, &amp; spreading of this new here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, they were reproued by their cheefe pastor and gouernor: vpon malice, and spite, and desire of reuenge, they brast forth into this rayling, to cal him Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, not meaning for al that to cal him Antichrist in such a sēse, as the church and faith of Christian men vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, vvhen vve speake of Antichrist vvhich shal come in the end of the vvorld, and of vvhom S.

That is, the Romane church of late so sound and perfite, sodaynly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came most corrupt and impure. she approued the vniuersal authoritie of the Romane Bishop, and appointed no boundes or limites to his iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was mere Antichristian. she tooke from Princes their Supremacie, she brought in the sacrifice of the masse, and highly aduaunced it against the death and sacrifice of Christ. she acknowledged iustification to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede not of only faith, but of workes

Next that the later Romane church hath not departed from the former, but hath kept inuiolably the self same faith without chaunge or alteration.

   <p>Which argument of his, if we marke wel, and euery part thereof, it is easely perceaued, that he concludeth those thinges not to haue bene performed in the Church of the new testamēt, which al prophetes foretold should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the comming of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias. For whereas he driueth the summe of al to one of these three necessary consequentes, ether that God is a lyer, ether that the Church erected by Christ should euer stand in the sight of the world, and euer florish with most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundāt knowledge of the wil of God, or that such a Church shal be founded hereafter by the Messias: and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueth the first, which the nature of euery man abhorreth to heare, then denieth the second, according to the general scope of the protestants doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which affirmeth the Church for these thousand yeres passed to haue bene drowned in palpable darkenes, su<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perstition, and idolatry, what remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth but to approue the third, vz, that
<pb n="70" facs="36"/>
the things foretold to be wrought by the Messias, are not yet accomplished, but shal be hereafter. which is as much as in euidēt termes to say, that the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias is not yet come, or Christ is not the true Messias, who hath performed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that which was his part and office according to the oracles of the Prophetes.</p>

      </note>This if I would prosequute at large by shewing into vvhat straightes, and shameful and miserable shiftes some principal Protestants, for example Caluin and Luther disputing vvith the Iewes haue bene brought, by reason of this detestable supposition, that the church so many hundred yeres hath failed, the reader could not but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre and detest euen to the gates of hel this damnable heresie, which vpon pretense of reforming the church and making al thinges pure and perfite, doth in deede ioyne with the Turkes and Iewes, and thrust men headlong to the very denial of Christes Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

so few yeres after his departure was suppressed &amp; trode vnder foote by the Pope. And this one reason, to passe by al other, wil iustifie the same to their eternal confusion: that whereas by the incarnation and cōming of Christ the church of Christians should be enlarged infinitely in al kingdomes,<note place="margin">Esa. 49. per tot. ca. 2. v. 3.4.</note> prouinces, and cities, aboue the sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goge of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Esa. 54. v. 1. cal. 4. v. 27. see before pag. 59</note> which after that time should be narrow, contemptible, remayning in a few, and nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that other, by the Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants faith this is turned cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For in any age or time of these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thovvsand yeres, it is easie to shew by sufficient authoritie of cronicles &amp; histories, that the Ievves haue had their knovven and visible sinagoges in the most notable places and prouinces of the vvorld, in Greece, in Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, in Germanie, in Mantua, in Venice, in Paris, in England, in Spaine in Portugal: vvhereas for many ages they can not name vnder the cope of heauen any kingdome, prouince, citie, tovvne, village, house or sheepecote, where the church of christ hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if we esteeme the same according as they now by their preaching and

   <p>And therefore whereas M.

<pb n="73" facs="37"/>
assured of euerlasting damnation of body and soule. Yea as appeareth by the course of their doctrine, the drift of their preaching and writing, and experiment of their brethren, vnder the veile and shadow of this their Antichristian doctrine, they induce mē to beleeue that al scripture is false, that the prophetes were lyers, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were deceauers, that Christ was a false teacher and seducer, &amp; not the Messias described by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, that Iudaisme standeth vpon better groundes then Christianisme: which conclusion they can neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyde, except first they abandon and reuoke this their doctrine of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ suppressing the Church, as false and execrable.</p>

   <p>I come now to speake of the secōd part, vz, the want of religion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science which M. W. sheweth in this his answere, wherein I must be the shorter, because I haue stayd somewhat long in the first. His want of cōscience as in sundry other pointes, so in this I note especially, that whereas he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to set downe M. D. Sanders arguments fully and entierly, and so to frame his answere accordingly, he in many and the same of best moment performeth nothing lesse then that which he most pretendeth.</p>
   <p>M. Iewel amongst many false practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, vsed this as one very apt to beguile the simple, and whereby I thinke at this present very many learned men are deceaued. That is,<note place="margin">M. Iewels maner of answering D. Harding.</note> frō the discourse of his aduersary, he would cut out &amp; remoue frō the sight of the reader, the principal strength, were it Scripture, Councels, Fathers, or reasō, whereby the aduersary iustified his cause, &amp; after shufle vp some od talke &amp; impertinent allegatiōs against the rest. For exāple
<pb n="76" facs="39"/>
let the Defence of the Apologie of the English church serue, vvhere there is no matter seriously handled, from the first beginning to the last line of the booke, but the very pith and most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible partes,<note place="margin">He leaueth out the best part of D. Hardings booke.</note> as it vvere the ioyntes and sinevves are thus taken avvay and left out of the booke: sometime vvhole and many pages together, sometime half pages, sometime fovver or fiue lines in a side, sometime vvhole sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences or peeces of sentēces, according as he thought requisite for the bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his cause, and disgracing of his aduersarie: &amp; yet notvvithstanding, he peeceth and patcheth vp the rest, as though it vvere the ful and perfite dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of D. Harding. This is as much as if some bragging Thraso appointed to combat vvith his enemy, should at the time of fight, cause his enemy to be tied vp in prison, and shevve his chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualry vpon a man made of cloutes. this is in steede of a body, to fight with a shadovv. I vvil not exemplifie this by any particularitie, because I can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the reader by certaine experiēce, let him in that booke fal vpon vvhat place he list, he shal hardly misse an example.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="77" facs="39"/>This very practise hath M.W. lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of him, and putteth it in vre in this his answere to D. Sanders demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For wheresoeuer D.S.<note place="margin">An vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering.</note> disputeth most firmely out of scriptures and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons grounded there on, &amp; multitude of fathers agreing in the exposition of the scriptures, wheresoeuer he preuē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the cauils of the aduersaries and forestoppeth the common arguments which they make for the cōtrary parte, there M. W. diligently and carefully taketh order to cut and leaue out al such peeces, that he may haue the more libertie to runne at randon, and talke his pleasure of the rest. So for example,<note place="margin">Apud. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. pa. 764.</note> in the seuenth demonstration he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth out in the middle, almost halfe a side of D. Sanders, a pece of very good importance for the fortifying of his argument. In the tenth demonstration where D. Sanders preuenteth and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth their obiections,<note place="margin">Sander. pa. 767.</note> and where in deede he fully cōfuteth before hand the substance of M. W. replie,<note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 770.771.</note> there a whole page is leaft out. And the self same part he plaieth in the thirtenth demonstration, leauing out almost two entier pages where in like maner his replie was before hand thoroughly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.
<pb n="78" facs="40"/>
So in the sixtenth demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he omitteth almost a side of the argument,<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>g. 774.</note> where D. Sanders conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Protestants of contradiction to them selues, and proueth them to play the part of Antichrists for corrup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting the verie letter of scripture at their pleasure.</p>
   <p>And to passe by the like false demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure in other places, and to make a litle stay vpon one only example, in the 36 demonstratiō he so wickedly beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him selfe, as the reader can neuer otherwise iudge of him, then that he is a mā wicked, vnconscionable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out al feare, of God. or regard of man, geuen only to continue talke and serue the time, without any care to search out the truth. D. Sanders there disputeth thus. <hi>Christ instituted a true &amp; real sacrifice at his last supper.</hi> This he proueth by scriptures, reasons drawen out of the scriptures, &amp; fathers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the scriptures. <hi>This sacrifice An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shal abrogate &amp; take avvay.</hi> This he proueth also by fathers expoūding the scriptures, and gathering so much of Daniels Prophecie. These be the parts of which he concludeth the Pope not to be Antichrist, who taketh
<pb n="79" facs="40"/>
not away that sacrifice,<note place="margin">Vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and falsifying.</note> but defendeth &amp; wel alloweth it. Nowhere wōderful it is to note, what mangling, and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and peecing, and patching he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in setting downe this demōstratiō. In the first paragraph of D.<note place="margin">Apud San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. pa. 785.</note> Sanders fiue lines he leaueth out, wherein is compared the state of the Iewes and Christians touching the law and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Then shufling in fower lines, he furthwith leaueth out almost a whole side of a leafe, where D.S. by good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, conference of Scriptures, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, proueth the Masse to be the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the new testament. and then putting in one line of S. Ireneus cited by D.S. and leauing out many lines folowing of the same author, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining as much to the matter, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting withal D.S. discourse therevpon, he furthwith ioyneth an other place of S. Ireneus cited likewise by D.S. but after his maner cutting of at the least the one halfe: and omitting D.S. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therevpon, as also a notable place of Hippolitus the Martyr (wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that in the time of Antichrist the holy churches shal be like vnto poore cottages, and the pretious body and bloud of Christ shal not be extant in
<pb n="80" facs="41"/>
those daies, the Masse shal be abolished &amp;c. al which he saith is nothing to the purpose) whereas D. S. bringeth in a large place of S. Hierom, he setteth downe one peece of a line, and leaueth out ten times as much ensuing, and the same most to the purpose. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally vsing the like treachery tovvards S. Chrysostom (cited as the rest by D. S.) from vvhom he croppeth the greater part and the most necessary, thus he maketh vp his ansvvere to the 36. demonstration.</p>
   <p>And that the reader imagine not the places of those fathers, S. Ireneus, S. Hierom, &amp; S. Chrisost. to be ydle &amp; needeles, let him know, that they are such, as whereby D. Sanders proueth directly one of his principal proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Apud Sand. pag. 789.</note> that Antichrist shal abrogate &amp; take away the sacrifice of the nevv te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament according to the prophecie of Daniel. Finally in the 38 demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where the argument is framed, that the best princes haue alwaies fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured the Sea of Rome, as Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Magnus, Theodosius, Martianus, Carolus Magnus, Ludouicus Pius, &amp;c. &amp; persecutors, tyrannes, and wicked princes haue most dishonoured it, as
<pb n="81" facs="41"/>
Constantius, Iulianus, Valens, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasius, Theodoricus &amp;c. the answere is made, by cutting away al this out of the booke, and thrusting in a tale of a tub, that Cardinals &amp; bishops be kings who much honour the Pope.</p>
   <p>This maner of answering is not to search out the truth, as becometh Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, or to bring men into the right way, as is the dutie of Christians, but only to keepe mens heads in musing &amp; expectation of new bookes, to make them mispend their time, to keepe the printers occupied, and as it were to walke and talke on a stage for no other purpose but to passe away the time. This is truly to be <hi>Carnifex papiri, A murderer of paper,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Illyr.</note> as Illyricus cōmonly calleth the Zuinglians. this is in deede to be <hi>Miserabilis librifex,</hi>

   </p>
   <p>And no doubt it proceeded of some like crafte, that M.W. against vs &amp; our English translation of the Testament, wrote his reprehension in latin, to the end pardy, that nether our common countrimen vnderstanding only the English, should know those faultes which he reproueth in latin, nor straū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers vnderstāding only his latin, know how iustly he refelleth that which was written in English. Whereby notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he might obtayne thus much, that both sortes should heare tel of some errors noted and refuted, but what they were, and how wel, how truly and substantially the refutation was made, nether the one nor the other should be able to examine, much lesse to iudge: the rest that vnderstand both tonges (vvho only may espie his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust

accusations, defaultes, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances) being not so many, nor alwaies so diligent, nor at any time so free, as to compare his latin pretensed reprofe vvith the truth set dovvne in English.

   <p>These (Christian reader) are the false fleightes, of lying, of dissembling, of bragging, of remouing groundes of disputation, of denying sundry principal partes of faith, of continual altering their faith, of preferring thē selues before al men, of taking to them selues in particular, the supreme iudgement both of al scriptures, &amp; the true sense thereof, these be the difficul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties,
