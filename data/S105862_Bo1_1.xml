And Peter sayth y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> christ suffred death for vs whē it was onely his manhed that suffred it,<note place="margin">Ion̄. vi.</note> But because of the inseperable vnite of the
<pb facs="7"/>
persone / it is sayde verely. That the sone of god had suffred / &amp; the sone of man forgaue synnes. For euen Christe whiche is the sone of god and man one persone / as concernīge the propertie of his diuine nature and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed / forgyueth synnes, As whē we saye / this man is wyse / whiche consisteth of bodye and soule / but as concerning his body / there is no wysdome in it at all / but his bodye is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poyson and impediment both vnto wys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome knowledge and all vnderstanding. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne / we saye the same man to be woūded / whē only it is his body that may receyue the wounde / and the soule can not be towched. Because of this maner of speche / yet noman sayth that two {per}sones be made of one man, when thus (as ye maye se) vnto eyther parte in man his owne propertye be referred and attributed / neyther can they say that both y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> natures / that is to wytte the bodye and soule be both mixte &amp; confounded togyther / when that thyng is spokē by the hole man because of the vnyte of the parsone / whiche because of the propertye of the one parte alone / par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth but to the one part. Paul sayth, whē I am syke / then am I most strong. Vvho is here syke: Paul. And who is it that is also so stronge▪ Paul. But is not here great repug<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nance
<pb facs="7"/>
and contradiction in Paule to be both syke▪ and hole / both at once? No verely. For Paule though he be but one parsone, yet is he of two natures. Vvherfore▪ when he sayth I am syke, verely the same persone speaketh which is Paul: but that same syknes is not appropriated vnto both his natures, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely vnto his body. And where he sayth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. I am stronge, albeit the parson of Paule speke it, yet is it his soule onely whiche is in the syknes of his body so stronge. So we say the sone of God is deade, euen the very sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me which for that so perfyte vnite of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone is both god and man, but yet as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning onely his humanite and manhed, he dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed. Thus, not I alone do beleue, but so dyd all the catholyke faythfull both olde &amp; newe beleue bothe of the Godhed, of the persones and humane nature taken and assumpte of the sone of god oure sauyoure Christe.

Of whiche thynge we shall treate in tharticle folowynge. For who so are elect of euerlastīge, are elect doubteles before theyr fayth. They ought not therfore to be so temerariously dampned of vs, whiche yet for lacke of age haue not fayth. For although as yet they haue not fayth, yet is the election of god hyd from vs, with whō yf they be electe, we be to hasty to iudge y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we knowe not.

Vvherfore it is playne that he had fayth or he receiued the sacramēt of baptisme. And thus it appereth manyfest that fayth is not gyuē by baptisme And yf an infante be offred to be christined, it is asked whyther his parentes offer hym to be baptised, &amp; when they answere by the wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that so is theyr wyll: then is the chylde baptyzed.

Vvhiche thynge as it is pronounced and promulged togyther with the wordes of Gods promyse in the action of the wordes and sacrament so is it with hyghe relygion, feare, and reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to be honoured. For yf we shuld any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse thynke and beleue of the sacramentes: that is to wyt, that they outwardly adhibited and admoued, shulde pourge vs within, then were there nowe cōmen agayne amonge vs the very Iudaisme &amp; ryte of relygion of the Iewes.

The dores shutte, Iesus came &amp; stode amonge them, what nede were it for a bodye to come and to go from place to place, that is in all places? what nede was it for hym to saye I shall go before you into Galile syth his body was there already, yf suche a body shulde be euery where, &amp; that but inuisiblye? He shuld haue left out these wordes, he came and I shall go before you, and haue sayd, I beynge euery where presente wyll shewe my selfe visible here &amp; there, &amp;c. But awaye with these tedious sophisticall vanites, which take awaye from vs the verite, both of the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite of Christe, and also of holye Scripture. These testimonies proue euydently christes body to be nowhere present but in heauen to speake orderly and ryghte accordynge to the scriptures of the nature &amp; properte of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of christe adsumpt &amp; taken vnto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

Also, that the naturall bodye of Christe is not eaten with our mouth, himselfe declareth it when he sayd (the Iewes stryuynge &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murīge vpon the bodely eatyng of his fleshe) The flesh, whose eatyng ye mysse vnderstād profytethe nothynge at al,<note place="margin">Onely the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> that is to eate it na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turally, but to eate it spiritually by fayth it {pro}fyteth moche for it gyueth lyfe. Vvhat soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is borne of fleshe, it is but fleshe, &amp; what is borne of the spirite, is spirite. Nowe yf the naturall bodye of Christe be eaten with oure mouth, what els but fleshe is it that cōmeth of that naturall fleshe so eaten / &amp; least this ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gumēt seme but lyght to some mē, let vs hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the tother parte, what so euer is borne of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> spirite, is spirite: ergo what soeuer is spirite, it must be borne of the spirite: yf thē the fleshe of christ be so holsom and suche saluacion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the soule, it must nedes be eaten spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not carnally, that is to say with fayth and not with oure teth. And this pertayneth vnto the matter &amp; substāce of the sacramētes that the spirite is begotē by the spirite, &amp; not
<pb facs="23"/>
by any bodely thynge, as we touched it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Paule warneth vs of this thīge in that he sayth.<note place="margin">ii. Cor. v.</note> Albeit he knewe christ somtyme af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleshe, yet nowe he knoweth hym no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more concernyng the fleshe.

This is my bodye, must nedes be taken not naturally but sygnificatiuelye sacramē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallye &amp; in sygne as are these. This is the pas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ouer or passynge fore bye: spokē of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call lambe. For that same lambe so eaten year<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in that solempne feste holden, was not the selfe passynge foreby, but it dyd sygnify that passage and oyntynge of the Hebrews som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme done. Vnto this agreith well, the succes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion &amp; imitacion, for the supper succeded the lambe. Vvhiche thynge teacheth &amp; warneth vs that Christe dyd vse lyke wordes in a lyke phrase, for the succession obserueth the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Vnto this agreeth the selfe same cōpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicion and ordre of the wordes, the tyme also speaketh &amp; cōsenteth to the same &amp; maketh all for it, so the olde passouer is but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and the newe thankes gyuyng is institu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, also the very propertie of all the memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alles and remembraunces, all make for this same sence, whiche callyng them the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the same thynge wherof they make the

memoriall or remēbraunce. So dyd the Athe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nienses call thalleuacion or the easmente of theyr cōmon dette, not as though yerely their dettes shuld be eased or paid: but because thei celebrated that thynge perpetually that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon had in tyme past made, and the selfe same celebracion or feaste they orned and honested with the name of the selfe thynge. And euen so the thynges whiche are the sygnes and me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morials of the verye body &amp; bloude of christe are called his bodye and bloude. Now here fo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loweth argumētes. Lyke as the body can not be fed with any spirituall thīge, nomore can the soule be fed with any bodely thyng.
