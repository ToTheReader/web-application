   <head>The Preface, shewing in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner this Kalender or Prognostication is to be vnderstood.</head>
   <p>TO come to our Almanacke and Prognostication, which hath aboue two hundred declarations or points, and therefore if the one halfe, or the fourth part, be but true it will be well.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, it is to bee vnderstood, that the things happen not iust the same time, houre, or day they are predicted, but are deferred sometimes for a little while; for you know that water in a Kettle hanged on the fire boyles not presently, and euen so is it with the operation of the Planets or Signes of the Firmament.</p>
   <div type="part">
      <head>A small proofe of the last yeare. 1623.</head>
      <p>Sayd hee not what was to happen betwixt the <hi>Rhyne, Elbe,</hi> and <hi>Weser,</hi> and in the Northerne parts of the world?</p>
      <p>Did he not likewise speake of a Match, as also where the warre should be, and how farre it should extend?</p>
      <p>Hee predicted likewise a battell of a certaine Prince, and the defeat of his souldiers vpon the thirteenth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, of which the Boers of <hi>Westphalia</hi> should tel strange things.</p>
      <p>Likewise he talked much of treason, and of a simul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated peace, as is knowne to <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Hungary.</hi> And
<pb facs="3"/>
made also mention of the Forces that should march vpon the frontier of <hi>Turky</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> designing the inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Bethlem Gabor.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Moreouer, hee predicted also that the plague should reigne mightily in the Northerne Lands, as hath after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards beene seene in <hi>Polonia, Lituania, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>East-Friesland,</hi> in which lands there died aboue 200000 persons of the Sicknesse.</p>
      <p>Obserue likewise what he saith of the dearth, the like being hardly knowne by any man now liuing.</p>
      <p>And concerning the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> haue not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants made such an inuasion in it as was neuer done before.</p>
      <p>Likewise we will not forget that which he told of the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and of the great alteration in the Romane Empire.</p>
      <p>Moreouer, hee predicted that the Northerne Lands should want both bread and wine, which seemed to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, seeing it was a fertile yeare, and that all the fruits of the field were ripe, and caried into the barnes, and there was also great store of fish catcht, vpon which acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the prices of al other victuals are vsed to fal, but the dearth increased dayly against all expectation.</p>
      <p>He sayth also that about the Haruest or August, many should be slaine vpon the frontiers of <hi>Hungary.</hi>
