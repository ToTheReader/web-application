In his hygh magnificence, almightynesse, etermtie, great power and maiestie: to loue him in his benignitie, in his myldenesse, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, faithfulnesse, truth and greate mercie: to feare him in his lordly dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, princely gouernment, statelinesse, rough countenance, wrathefulnesse, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere iustice and iudgement: and to offer daily vnto him, the acceptable sacrifice of faithfull and hartie prayers, in the name of his sonne Iesus Christe, as hee himselfe most healthfully taughte thee: and for whose onely sake, promyse is made to heare thee, that his myghtye hande may ener preserue thee, vphold

If thou desire to enioy all these and suche lyke blessings as are moste needefull for thee (both for body and soul) from the hand of God, and according to the measure of the gift of Christ: O hearken then vnto the voyce of the Lord thy God:

O bond thy body of earth, downe to the face of the earthe. Grone in thy selfe to God with greefe, and lay open simply before him, the felt secretes of thy sinful hart. Call daily vppon him, and so aduisedly trie him, as thou hast assured trust in him. And before thou duetifully at temptest thy godly contemplatiōs, prayers, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and thanks giuing to God: prepare thee earnestly a sitte soule, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sence of so high and great a God.<note place="margin">Certaine spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial cautes fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, that are to be cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidied by gods childrē: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the selues before prayer and receyning of the holy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramintes, to auoid his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy iudgemēts.</note> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not before whome thou presentest thy selfe, and vnto whome thou doste minde to talke.

   <p n="1">1 Examine therfore thy selfe before with indgemente. Descende deepely into thine owne bowells, and see there, whether thou be (as of ryghte thou oughtest) truely penitent for thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sinnes and wickednesse.</p>
   <p n="2">2 Whether thou determinest (thence forth) from thine hearte, not to tourne againe vnto them, as dothe a cleane washed swine, which newly defiles hir selfe, in the lothsome and foule stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mire.</p>
   <p n="3">3 Whether thou bee in his sighte a louble faced or deepe dissembling hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, touching thy dealings with him and the worlde, as thy booke in thee of records moste playnely witnesseth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</p>
   <p n="4">4 Whether thou bee (as by name thou professest) a zelouse fauorer of

   <p n="5">5 Whether thou (with the Prophet Dauid) vnseinedly hatest all super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticiouse vanities, contrary to the word of life.</p>
   <p n="6">6 Whether thou (with the said pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete) feelest in thy selfe to be grieued with the enemies of God, and with all such as rise vp ageinst him, or to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the word of life.</p>
   <p n="7">7 Whether thou weyest wyth thy selfe, that like as thy body, being but of an earthy and corporall substaunce, cannot possiblie liue without the vsual nourishmente of materiall bread and meate: so the soule, in the spirituall state therof, cannot liue but be sterued and dye (euen the eternall and euerlasting deathe) withoute the spirituall nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and heauenly sweete tast of the woorde of God, whiche to the soule is the onely breade of lyse, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after thou shouldest hunger, too vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
<pb facs="10"/>thy lyfe.</p>
   <p n="8">8 Whether thou stedfastly beleue to be saued, by the only merites, death and bloudshed of Christ crucified vpon the crosse, withoute thyne owne and other mens merites, eyther their most dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and idolatrous deuised vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

   <p n="10">10 Whether thou at the receyuing of the holy mysteries of Christes body and bloud, vnderstandest them to bee his owne only ordinance, for the vse of his holy churche, and to bee witnesses therein of the open and publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the true saithe whiche thou haste in him, and to be saued onely by his bodilye death and the bloudy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vppon the Crosse, once for all
<pb facs="11"/>offered vnto God his heauenly father, for thine, for mine, &amp; for al the sinnes of the whole worlde, euen so many, as haue this acceptable saithe of God in them.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>11</hi> Whether thou haue regarded by the word of God (touching the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christes body and bloud) the difference therin, betwixt the Diuelles faith and thine, either the saithe of an Hipocritishe and dampnable repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>

All these things, the Diuels beleeue and confesse with thee: but yet vtterly vnperswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to be his onely sufficient sauioure and redeemer, by his precious bloude shedde and deathe: euen as those saith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse wickednesse, which in theyr vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soundnesse, stubbornesse, &amp; vnstayed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse, touching the couenant of God in his sonne Christe, for their saluation, accompt the price of his precious bloud to be insafficient for them, withoute the very absurde and most fond annexing of their owne and other mennes me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites: and so to make Christe vnto them selues, to be at the moste, but a mingled, peeced, botched, and patched Sauioure.</p>

I know full wel thy malice and stoutnesse, which hath ben in thee from the beginning, bothe agaynste the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted of God and all his. Experiēce teacheth me, of thy not slumbring, of thy wandring about, and seeking wat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chefully to deuoure and to spoyle mee of my faith, wherby I must be saued. I tell thee thou most wicked one, thy tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uell is all in vayn. I am none of thyne, nor nothing inclined to thyne affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or motions. I am Gods I tell thee,
<pb facs="12"/>and the perswaded childe of God by his spirit of truth, who by grace pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing me, and by his power mightily working in mee, hath moste graciously planted in my harte, the frutefull tree of pictie, of true and perfect fayth, fast roted in me, deply stayed, and surely set<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led, euen with the finger of god my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, touching the dignitie, price and true estimation of his sonne, and mine onely sauiours most preciouse body, for mine only health and eternal saluatiō. And though I haue falne or fainted, as traiterously thou hast tripped me, yet of frailtie haue J falne, &amp; not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of malice, as thou haste most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously tempted me: which God hath seene in me, in mercy therfore hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me vp ageyne, and wil stil vpholde me in spite of thee. Art thou ignorant of this (thou griseled and foule helly monster) that I am not such a one as thou art, or as thou woldest haue mee,
<pb facs="13"/>to bee doubtefull of my faythe, as the wicked are, to leaue the freedome of Gods spirite, and to bee entangled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne in thine infernall filthy bands? Thinkest thou, that I beeyng nowe called to the lighte and knowledge of the sweete woorde of life, whereof I haue truely tasted, and haue in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation mine olde conuersation, will be newly agayne deceiued, offer to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche, eyther once nibble or smell to thy beslubbered, brackishe, and most filthy embrued baytes? Notest thou me of suche slipperinesse, that ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyng farre entraunce in the spirite, and feele the incomparable ioyes ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of, that I will nowe ende in the greefes and sorrowes of the fleshe? to sette so lyttle by the Kyngdome of Iesus Chryste, that taking holde of the Plough, will now looke backe agayne, to bee as a Dogge, and to returne agayne to my vomite, or as a beaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="13"/>Swyne, to beraye my selfe agayne in the myre, to defourme the Image of God, and to defile his holy Temple? No no Sathan thou arte deceiued, I tell thee truely for thy discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, I am now better schooled, well armed, and better warned, to let thee goe for naughte. Knowest thou not that I haue put vppon me to endure for euer, my Lorde and God, my Chryste and Sauioure? Art thou forgetfull (O thou enemie) that I in true faythe professing his name, and receyuing woorthily hys bolye and most blessed Sacraments, by the onely rule of his word, am armed ouer all, with his only healthful, and most mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull merites, to strengthen me mighti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ageinst thee: who is made mine with all that he hathe: and I am onely hys, hoth body and soule: one bodye wyth him: fleshe of his fleshe, and bone of his bones. Ah Sathan, this certeinty and
<pb facs="14"/>truth in faith considered, wastefull are thy wretched wandringes and wylye waightings to wreck and vex my soul. Away from me, away J say thou cursed and spightfull spirite: or stay if thou lust to offer boldly vnto mee (as thou darest) thy very blashlesse and bragge attempts of malignitie. I yet tell thee, they shall not hurt me: neither do I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing esteeme thee: J regard not thy force: J feare not thy fury: The Lorde is my God: he is the God of my strēgth and considence: thou hast of thy selfe, no powre at all ageinst me: For what so euer thou attempteste or seekest to performe, therin to thy wil thou wantest powre. But that which thou doest, is by his onely omnipotent hande and sufferaunce that is my God: whose waight and mightinesse, thy broosed braines hath selte, to make thee stonpe for euer, to hamper thee at his will to thine owne irons, to ouer throwe thee
<pb facs="14"/>soone in thine owne tourne, and to blowe thee backewarde at will, euen with the breath of his mouth, into the bailesse and deepe botomelesse pitte: whose bonde slaue thou art and a drudge en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced: and in thine outrage by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, a knowne peerelesse paricide, a very restlesse, pitilesse, and most grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse raunging roge, the only ring lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and infectuouse ranke roote of all reproch, of all mischieues and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation vnder the sonne.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>14</hi> O beloued Christian: Whether art thou in this wise armed with saith too stande too the face of the Diuell, sharply to reproue him, and put him to flighte?</p>
   <p>
      <hi>15</hi> Whether hast thou in thine harte through this saith, heauenly mirth and melody, inward reioicing, and thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne with triumphe, exalted the name of thy God, felt in thy selfe to bee doubtlesse his childe, and too loue (as
<pb facs="15"/>thou lawfully oughtest) the lawe of thy deare and most louing father?</p>
   <p>
      <hi>16</hi> Whether hast thou considered or not, this heauenly mistery aforesaid to be the Sacramente of true pietie, the Character of perfecte vnttie, and the most assured band of frutful and chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian charitie?</p>
   <p>
      <hi>17.</hi> Whether thou, being a subiecte in any estate (borne to be ruled vnder thy soueragne and not to rule) bearest vnto hir thy dere and natural Prince as also to thine natiue countrey (by the bloud of Goddes woorde) a naturall, saithfull, and true louing harte.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>18</hi> And finally, whether thou bee christianly charitable, or a cleere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter of all thy neighbours offences as thou thy selfe woldest of God be clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remitted. And so foorth in all other thinges, as best behoueth thine holye profession: least to the cōtrary (in gods sighte) all thy conceyued holinesse by
<pb facs="15"/>orater or whatsoeuer, beeing but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vbane, hipocritish, childish, mere dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse and very folly, there be founde in thee, but the only title, or vnauailable bare name of christianitie: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore verie perniciouse, burifull, and to be tourned into sinne ageinst thee: and so in stead of healthfull, very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and beautifull blessings (which thou daily huntest after) the banefull, most bitter, and blacke curses of God, doo sodeinly fall vppon thee. Beware then J exhorte thee, looke well to thy selfe: in time: flatter not thy selfe vainly or rather dampnablie: be not longe a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, in the schoole house of daliaunce: be not alwayes a fondling, a weakling, or a suckling, a milkesoppe, or babish infante in Chryst: weye truely the vertue of healthefull, manfull, and strong nourishmente in Chryste, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to the tyme: thou shouldeste nowe bee a strong man in Chryste:
<pb facs="16"/>thou art now as a man most grationsly visited, for the highest doo seeke thy company: than the which, what shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou more desire. O remember then, how very reprochfull, how vnmā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, vnhealthfull, hurtfull, miserable, and discōmendable, is thy seruile state, in such wise to be pind in, not to growe out in time, nor get from thy rockinges, thy wearisome wrappinges, or swad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling bandes of extreame weakenesse: but alwayes to be lulde in the armes of vntimely tendernesse, wherby thou art barred from thy highest and moste chiefe solicitie. Way warely by the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, thy due danger and discommē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, of suche thine insensibilitie and wearishnesse. Shouldest not thou rather reioice, to be calde as a man of strength to the felowship, ripe age, and strong manhode of Christe, and to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in his presence, of his most frende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, healthfull, strengthfull, and heauē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="16"/>banket? whereunto, al things are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prepared, and therunto art thou now called. God also graunt thee, to be in the number of his electe, that thou maist with saith set forwards thy fote, hungerly with zeale to striue for thy place, &amp; to beleue by Gods only word, that the lord of the seast fauoreth thee. Be not hindred, hinder not thy selfe, let excuses be farre from thee, deferre not the fauouring of thy soules refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, loke to thy turne in time, open to day thine eyes, and be not yet blinde to morowe, least with the blinde, in thy wil of blindenesse, thou be sone blindely led, into the irrecouerable, deepe, and most damnable dungeon of blindnesse, darknesse &amp; horror, with the diuel, the Prince of darknesse and death foreuer. Consider this, he that seeth thee (euen as in deede thou art) is a God of moste cleare sighte, bright lighte, truthe and rightuousnesse. Call to minde towardes

Jgnoraunce cannot excuse thee, it shall not excuse thee: thou oughtest not be ignorant, thou nedest not be ignorant: what so euer is writtē, is writtē for thy learning: thou readest it, thou hearest it, or thou maist if thou luste: It is not farre from thee: It is before thine eyes &amp; in thine hart, if grace be with thee towardes it, and is most truely pronoū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vnto thee, by the eternall spirite of truth, &amp; that most miraculously with al simplicitie, by his zealous ministers, inwardly to pierce thee, to lighten the

What are slanderous brutes to thee, if thou be of god &amp; a louer of the truth: of which truthe, let thine owne conscience be the iudge, if it be not vtterly dead, or most damnably benūmed. Whē thou hearest the truth, in time take hold of truthe, let not occasion slip from thee, with hir turned baldnesse towardes thee: for shee flieth swiftly, and to cal hir again back wil not help thee: yea, the truth wil thē reproue thie, be iuste iudge ouer thee, and condempne thee to thy face, for thy moste folishe and late repentaunce
<pb facs="18"/>Jf truthe therefore offer hir selfe vnto thee, stand most amiably before thee, and sound most heauenly words vnto thine eare: O attend then to the truth, haue good opinion in the truth, slie not from the truthe, feare not the truthe ioyne to the truth, be familiar with the truth, beleue the truthe, confesse boldly the truthe, and stand stedfastly to the truth: for truthe is of high excellencie a glorious ladie, a dame of noble fame and of great antiquitie: she is euer gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious vnto the frendly, of full power al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so, of great maiestie, and familiar with the highest. Thinke well therefore of truth, entertaine hir reuerently, shee shineth with glory vnto thee. O let hir alwayes possesse thee, reioyce in hir cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panie, and vse hir very frendly, for she wil highly againe requite thee, &amp; shen thee sone most freely, hir natural vsage &amp; propertie: which shalbe, all inward<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to serch thee, thorowly to purge thee
<pb facs="18"/>most clerely to pollish thee, most beuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to adorne thee to breake thy bāds of impietie, to make the spiritually free and prefer thee, through true saithe to possesse the high presence of the deitie. This is truthes nature, to deale kindly with thee, if thou most vnkindly, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectest not hir companie. Of whiche truth, the Apostle thus wryteth vnto thee, that without al contradiction she must nedes be vnto thee, either the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure of life vnto life: or the sauoure of death vnto death. Such iudgemēt will truth haue ouer thee, and stand in full effect, there will be no meane, but to be either with thee, or else flatly againste thee, as it shall truely finde thee, at thy fal frō this life. there wil be no daliāce: it will for euer saue thee, or eternally damne thee, how so euer thereof thou makest thine account, or leanst of will to the contrary, with thy very blinde, wicked, and peruerse hart. Feare ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb facs="19"/>harken to the truth in time, haue sure confidence in truthe, thine helper is at hand, be and the truth are one, he is grateful, he is faithful, dout thou not double not, nor wilfully withstand not, the offred graces of thy mylde master, thy iust Lord, and moste louing God: and be not before him, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his holy Angels, vnprepared, or a dallier, a man indifferent, a slacke Simme, a drousie one, a lyngrer, a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deaier, a wanton, or a carelesse one, among the reiectes and wretches of this worlde: that in their coldenesse, darkenesse, hopelesse houeryng, vayne deuising, wilfulnesse, tolitie, forgeiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, contempte of God and Godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, tempteth so hygh, so magnificent, terrible &amp; great God of maiestie, most deadlily to danger them, elues: who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly in a moment, and in the twin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling of an eye, is able by his iustice to destroy thee, to cracke sodainely in
<pb facs="19"/>sunder the thred of thy life, &amp; to twine strōgly the cordes of thy perdurable &amp; eternal death. Therfore as he ought, in his mightinesse, of euery wighte to be feared: so he shold not of any one, either presumptuously or vainely be tempted. But for thy part, obey him in his will, and suffer him with all pacience, to try thee through aduersitie, cōmitting thy selfe wholely vnto his only wil &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: for surely he will (beholding in thee the power of saithe) not suffer thee to be tempted aboue thy strengthe, or yeelde thee so farre to fall, but with his owne right hand, will raise thee quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vp againe. And I exhorte thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to take heede, that thou possesse not in his sight at any time, an vnstayed, ofte wauering, and winde shaken hart, through Sathans blustrings, stormie and tempestuous blastes, stirred vppe daily and hourely againste thee, and that by Goddes permission for good:
<pb facs="20"/>least by thine impaciencie, diffidente trembling, and sore shakes of thine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christen inconstancie, thou be sodainly turned to thy shiftes, put to thy faultie flight, and so be dispossessed of thy verie healthful, safe, and most sure holde: or else spoiled with reproche of thy chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten armor: or be occasioned by despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate pursute, to starte from the face of the ennimie, to stacker fearfully at his offered blowes, and in hazarde to take hurt by some dangerous and sodain fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> greatly to dishonor thee before Christe thy captaine: and with him infinite armies of heauēly soldiors: whose tents (to encourage thee) are pitched round about thee. I say therefore vnto thee (O Christian) stand thou cherefully to thy charge in all things, and defende manfully thine owne: dismaie thee not J say: for the Lorde God him selfe will be thy defender and keeper, and wil stand by thee to strengthen thee,
<pb facs="20"/>and to deliuer thee from all daungers. And if legions of diuels should copasse thee, trench thee in round about, plant their power, and bēd forcibly their shot agaynst thee: well may they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly thunder far frō thee, rore, rattle and rumble in the aire ouer thee, tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble terribly about thee, parche some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thy tender skin, and wonderfully in such sort amase thee: yet shall they not preuayle agaynst thee, hurte any member of thee, or once remoue thy fast fixed soote, but shalt stād sure fer euer, euen as the highe, mightie, steadie, and strong mounte Sion: for Gods arme stayeth thee, who by his power hathe ouercome the diuell, euen the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell Sathanas him selfe, he holdeth him at will by his infernall chaynes, his whole cursed armie also, hell gates, and al the powers of hell. O praise therfore thine almightie God: exalt his glorious name for euermore, watche and pray
<pb facs="21"/>continually: pray with vnderstāding, pray at al times, and in al places, as his holy spirite shall moue thee, for the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of thee, and for the auoyding of the engins, sleights, and tēptations of the enimies: that God himselfe may be pleased, thy soule strēgthned, the diuels chased, vāquished, or put to flight. And when thou prayest, deceiue not vaynly thy selfe: be not blinded with the proud Pharisie in thine owne conceite, boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of thy righteousnesse in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, neither glorying in any thing: for he throughly beholdeth thee, and seeth that truely in thee, euen thy secrete and hidde sinnes (a masse of all abhomination) as thou oughtest chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly therein to be thine owne iudge. But humble thy self before him, with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and poore wretched Publicane, confessing thy sinnes and wickednesse: and feare not then to attayne grace, through suche true faith &amp; hūblenesse.
<pb facs="21"/>Moreouer, forget not, that as God is a moste highe, heauenly and diuine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and a spirite of al goodnesse and truth: so wil he also of thee be spiritually worshipped, praysed, and prayed vnto, euē in the truth, by the word of truth, and frō the depth and bocome of thine hart. This also I put thee in remēbrāce of (a thing greatly requisite) that in the tyme of thy prayers, which thou daily consecratest to god (be they more or lesse, long or short) thou be not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen with the snarling suggestions, secret twitches, inward motions, or wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie sleightes of the enimie Sathan, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the abuse of thy senses and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde bodily members, as thine eyes, thine eares, and suche like: that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest thy tongue onely oft babbleth, and vaynely wastest muche breath: thine hearte, whiche God chiefely respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, and dothe very gladly desire, bee fardest off, and bee moste vaynely
<pb facs="22"/>turned another way, gretly to displease him, to vexe sore thine owne conscience, and to make vtterly frustrate al thine attempts, or importune sutes of greate necessitie. This I say also vnto thee: If thou desire to be the child of God, and voyde of al doubts so in dede to be, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour frō thy hart Christ thy forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and sauiour, by whose onely grace thou arte adopted the childe of God. Make not towards him, thy fidelitie, crased, mingled, or patched: let it goe soundly and al whole togither, both frō thy body &amp; thy soule. Let him alwayes enioy frō thee the whole &amp; perfect mā, the man regenerate &amp; new borne, and made by his spirit the child of light, ful of agilitie and liuelinesse: whose soule mounting with felicitie still vp to the heauens, is there resident with Chryst the sauiour, and alwayes conuersant in heauenly things. And let him also bee euermore vnto thee, thine onely, whole,
<pb facs="22"/>ful, perfect, and sufficient redemer, ear nest petitioner and ready pacifier of the diuine fury against thee for al cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: who with great glory (as thou shol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest confesse) is ascended on high, and sitteth with almightinesse, power and maiestie, on the right hand of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, with open and fresh blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wounds (the many fest marks &amp; impressions before him for euer) of the purchased &amp; most preciouse redeemed inheritance, euen for thee, most notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse and deadly sinner, by the secrete testimonie of thine owne conscience. These things &amp; such like, of thee thus christenly considered, thou mayest bee bold with thy most merciful and louing God. But yet agayne I say vnto thee, hold thee sure vnto thy sauiour christ, swarue not frō him, nor frō the vertue of his onely merites, wherby thou must be onely saued. Cleaue then close to the rocke of assurance: leane to no loose nor
<pb facs="23"/>sandie safetie. Trust not to the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our humane deuises, labour not to languish in a maze of vncertaintie. Bemoyle not thy selfe in suche myre of mortalitie, and shun soone such shoures as wil wrecke thy soules fidelitie. Then cry (as J sayd) and ceasse not to craue pardon of God thy father in his sonne: name, 'Doubte not of thy sute, what so euer it be, for it shal by good motiō be so vpright, so reasonable, so acceptable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him and allowable: and shal touch therwith so neere the tendernesse of his mercy, his truthe and fidelitie, that of necessitie graunt muste bee made vnto thee: he wil not denie thee the requests of thy lippes: yea, he will so graciously tender thee, that foreseing thy cause of inwarde complaynte, he wyll pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare quickely thine heart most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to call vpon him. Beleeue therfore faithfully, trust of assurance, and thou shalte surely obteine thy desire, with
<pb facs="23"/>greate mercy and fanour at his holy hande. Thy sinnes shal not be imputed vnto thee, thou shalte bee blessed and righteouse in the sighte of God all the dayes of thy life, so happily shall thine hart be prepared: so mightily shal thy prayers preuayle for thee: they will forcibly pearce the celestiall and high heauens: approche neare to the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throne of grace and maiestie: cry incessantly for thee, &amp; will not returne from the presence of God, nor once be satisfied, before the full graunt of their humble sute, for thy sauing health and cōmoditie. To conclude in all thy god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attemptes, whether in praying, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, geuing of Almes, frequenting the holy Sacramentes, or rendering moste hartie thankes vnto God, for his infinite Mercies, Graces, Blessinges and Benefites bestowed vppon thee, and vppon his whole Churche, from the beginning vntill this present day:
<pb facs="24"/>and what soeuer in holinesse thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendest daily vnto him: let it always be done vprightly, orderly, with chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian comelynesse, and modestie, with peace of conscience, faithfully, constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cherefully, and in charity, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worde of God moste straitely byn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thee. Which I pray to God may clerely shine into thee by the power of his holy spirite: who quicken thee this day, to morow, and for euer, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in thee towardes him, the firie flames of his true loue, throughe his sonne Chryst Iesus: who speedely graunt thee the same signement of his holy hand, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thee with inward ioy, in all thy moste lowefull and diuine desires. Amen.</p>
