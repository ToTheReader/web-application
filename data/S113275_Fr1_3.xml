         <hi>Arist. l. r. Eth. cap.</hi> 1.</note>
      <hi>Philosophy,</hi> thought all his endeauours well bestowed, if he might profit (as he saith) any one thereby; much more if Townes, and Citties: How happy then
<pb facs="3"/>
may I thinke my labours imployed, if by these small paines I may rightly instruct some few of You, not in <hi>Morall</hi> Vertues, but in <hi>Diuine</hi> and Heauenly Verities: not in Precepts of Manners only, but in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, in <hi>Mysteries</hi> of true Beliefe, on which, I will not say the ciuil Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or gay Deportment of the outward man, but the inward Carriage, &amp; Grace of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the life of your Soules, the loue of God, and hope of all eternity dependeth. By instructing You, I shall cleere the beames, which giue light to thousands: I shall purifie the Waters and purge the Fountaine of which many must drinke. You are the Seedes, you are the Lights of the Kingdome: you are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whose treasures are to be dispensed, &amp; riches of learning hereafter deriued to the whole body of the Realme. Wherfore least you should both beguile others, and be your selues deceiued with counterfeite drosse, in lieu of true and perfect mettall; I haue opened vnto you these veines of Gold, with which, if you couet to enrich
<pb facs="3"/>
your soules, two things I request at your hands. The one is, not to frame an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening conceit, or beare too partiall Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the men of your own side: the other, to peruse this Treatise with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and single eye, and with a greedy zeale of imbracing Truth, from whose mouth soeuer.</p>
   <p>2. You are not (I hope) of <hi>Agesicles</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> his mind, who taking great pleasure to heare smooth &amp; eloquēt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, would not intertaine <hi>Philophanes</hi>

Much lesse can I thinke you bewitched with <hi>Philostor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> the <hi>Eunomian</hi> his folly, who was so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted of his Maister <hi>Eunomius,</hi> as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired his very naturall defects, &amp; set the glosse of vertue on them. For, his faltering tongue (as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> writeth) he vainely<note place="margin">

If any of you shold be infected with these bastardly humors, if you would heare none but those, in whose bosomes ye haue beene bred, or be so farre enamoured of your first Teachers wits, as to loue their errours, applaud their forgeries, &amp; praise the beauty of their deformed writings; little hope should I haue to gaine your soules. But if yee be (as I trust ye are) lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of truth, enemies of falshood, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of your owne saluatiō; then here you may discouer that <hi>Euangelical Pearle,</hi> which<note place="margin">

      <note place="margin">Greg. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zian. in Laudem Athanas.</note>
      <hi>First, that he had commanded his Sonne- in law to be slaine: The other, that he had nominated</hi> Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>the</hi> Apostata <hi>to succeed him in his Imperiall Throne: The third, that he had giuen eare to new deuised Doctrines. And with these words he yielded vp his ghost.</hi>

   <p>9. O yee flourishing <hi>Academians!</hi> But what should I restraine my speach to you? O England, my dearest Country, I would to God this fearefull president might so mooue thy Heart, as to make Thee, now whilest time serueth, and grace is offered, more fruitfully bewaile the like, or more grieuous crimes committed by Thee! Thou perchance hast not murdered thy carnall Kinsfolkes or Allies, but thy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb facs="6"/>
Pastours, Guides, and Curates of thy soule. Some thou hast spoyled, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, imprisoned, and pined away with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamest misery: some thou hast arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, executed, and barbarously massacred as Rebels to thy Prince, and Traytours to thy Crowne: their <hi>bloud like water thou</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal. 78. v.</hi> 3.</note>
      <hi>hast powred forth, round about Hierusalem:</hi> &amp; their quarters thou hast set vp as preyes to be deuoured by birds and foules of the aire. Thou hast vniustly nominated and entitled others to inherite their roomes, possesse their benefices, discharge their functions; many of them reuolted Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata's; many mercinary Hirelings; all tyrannicall Vsurpers; who seeke not so much to oppresse the bodies, as exercise their tyrannie ouer the soules of thy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and pittifully enthral them to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting seruitude. Lastly, thou hast dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vp the passage, by which the cleere waters of Antiquity should flow into thy Kingdome, &amp; thou hast opened the sluse to the puddles of nouelty, to new flouds of Doctrine, new fayned Sacraments, new
<pb facs="7"/>
Articles of Faith, new worship of God; which I beseech his Diuine Piety thou maist haue grace to detest, &amp; learne of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> (who would not permit any strang merchandise, or vnusual wares to be transported into their Citty) to banish and abandon these vnwonted Doctrines: and imbrace againe that ancient Faith, which once thy whole Realme, then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie Iland, daughter of God, and Dowry of the B. Virgin, deuoutly sucked from the breast of <hi>Rome;</hi> which all thy former Kings and Princes, vntill now of late, supported, thy Lawes established, thy People honoured, thy Vniuersities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. To this end I present you (Noble Students) with these first fruits of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and will not cease to sacrifice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, my continuall praiers.</p>
