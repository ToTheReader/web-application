   <head>TO THE HONO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and vertuous Knight,
Sir Thomas Bromley.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>YR:</hi> If I haue a (hart which is the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of loue) it must vndoubtedly be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
full of you, or empty of all goodnes:
You taught me once how to goe, by your
strength, and gaue me so sufficient a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
from your fauour, that I might very well neglect
those threatning gusts which spake any losse vnto mee.
This, when my memory forsakes it must forsake the world,
for whilst it is, it is but a Cabinet to keepe your vertues
in me: And hence it comes I am bold to present vnto you
this oblation of my Pen, which when you haue read, if
you please to burne, they shall draw nearer to the nature
of a Sacrifice: for I doe not present them to you as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
(your owne sleightest conceits <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lye millions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
beyond them) but as messengers, to tell you that the
Author, wheresoeuer hee liues, doth dearely loue you.
There be some of them that concerne Honour and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
passages, betwixt noble aduersaries: I know you
will imbrace and alow them, and though your selfe in
your particular haue done much better, yet he that shall
walke in the path I haue limited, shall without doubt not
erre in any gentlemanly course of well doing.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
The motiues which vrged me to this, was the cruelty
of those ignorant angry ones that loue to vent their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in foule words, and spend their execution with the
coldest action, whereas indeed true vertue should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for vertue, and like <hi>Alexanders</hi> dogges, with a
noble dispisingnesse, not looke on the smaller beasts, but
with an ouerflow of courage, ceaze vpon Lyons and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants.
The matter being then so familiar both to your
knowledge and experience, no man can correct me with
better authoritie, or aproue me with a iudgement which
shall better please mee. These <hi>EP<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>STLES</hi> I present
but as imperfect offers of those larger essayes and tastes
I meane to pursue in another Treatise seconding this: in
which I intend (God being pleased) to omit the nature
of no Epistle needfull, with a discourse of Combats, and
the presidents both of our owne and other nations, euen
from the first vse of the English Rapier to these times.
In all which mine ambition shall be that you will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
when you looke on the booke to remember mee, who
will euer liue to obay you.</p>
