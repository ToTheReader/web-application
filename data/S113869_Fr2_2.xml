      <salute>Right Worshipfull,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Earles are small in
quantitie, but great
in their quality, and
smaller often in the
weight than in their
worth▪ such an one is this which
<pb facs="4"/>
I haue presented vnto you as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of my due respect and vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
loue to your selfe, and the
Church in your familie. Pearles
from earth fit not common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
but this from heauen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to al who meane to partake
in the common saluation. As this
Pearle is yours in the common
right of Saints, so this offer of it
is yours by a second and more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
right, as who first helped
it out of the darke into this light.
Your earnest and often desires of
some of the written notes of this
Treatise, drew from me a promise
the thought of the paiment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
was my first thought of this
publication. And now this Pearle
being yours, weare it as your
chiefe ornament, the price of
which ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>seth your owne price and
recko<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ing in the eyes of God and
<pb facs="4"/>
good men, <hi>aboue the Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
and Rubies.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Pro. 30. 10</note> Other orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
seuered from this, are but
beautifull vanities. The largest
reuenues, the richest estates, the
most ample treasures, the costliest
cabinets, filled with pearles and
precious stones, sets the person
wanting this pearle, in no higher
reckoning than common flints, or
other contemptible stones, with
him to whom the <hi>Nations are
but as the drop of a bucket,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Isa. 40▪ 15,</note>
      <hi>or as the dust of a ballance.</hi>
So of all naturall endowments,
we may compare them (as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
doth beantie) to a ring of
Gold, which outwardly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the wearer; But the iewell
of this ring is this pearle of the
Gospell, or the life of the Gospell,
in the life of the Gospoller. Let
this Iewell be lost once, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
<pb facs="5"/>
the ring may be gilded and
glistering without, but the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
and triall will finde that it
was neuer gold. And because
I know that <hi>you haue no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ioy than to see your
children walke in the truth,</hi>
      <note place="margin">3 Ihh. 4.</note>
I am assured, you will gladly
afford them an equall share with
you in this so precious a commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and therefore haue I taken them
into this dedication. Blessed are
you that <hi>haue your quiuer full
of such louely arrowes.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psa. 127. 5.</note>
      <hi>Of
the vertuous woman is said,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Pro. 31. 21.</note>
      <hi>Her
children praise her.</hi> Were this
a verbal praise of the mouth, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
might seeme <hi>testes e sinu,</hi>
and the spreaders of the partiall
praises of their mother; but this
is an astuall and solid commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and vnsuspected, when
the shining vertues of the feare
<pb facs="5"/>
of God, sobrietie, and modest
conuersation of children, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
the grace, pietie, and
care of the mothers education. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
that rich store of earthly

you, you haue none co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>parablie
gracefull to this, if you except your
sweet societie with your graue and
religious husband.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>And now to you three daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
worthy of such a Mother:</hi>
When I call to remembrance
the vnfained faith, which
dwelt, &amp; yet dwelleth in your
Grand-mother <hi>(whose reuerend
old age is crowned with an ancient
and honorable profession and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of holy Religion aboue any
I know in these parts)</hi> and in
your deare mother; and am
assured it dwelleth in you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
I could not but put you
<pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>in remembrance, to stirre vp
the gift of God that is in you:</hi>
And exhort you, as you haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
begun, to hold on in the way of
grace, and see that your workes be
more at last than at first. God
hath aduanced you into the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of religious and compleat
Gentlemen your husbands, to faire
estates and portions in this world,
but especially to a sure expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hereafter, by meanes of your
inseparable coniunction to your
Head and Husband Iesus Christ.
You must now aduance him who
hath thus aduanced you, and love
him for himselfe, who hath loued
you in his Sonne: and hold euery
new sense of mercy, a new spurre
and prouocation vnto dutie. In the
way and pace in which you goe, I
must acknowledge I passe and slip
an opportunitie, by passing oner in
<pb facs="6"/>
silence so many commendable parts
in you all, which make you <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

fearing God.<note place="margin">Pro. 31. 30</note> But my praises can.
lift you no higher than your owne
vertues doe, whose diligent paines
in gaining knowledge of holy
things, conscionable practice of
sound religion, charitable refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of the poore members of
Christ, and whose humble, sober,
wise, modest, and louely carriage,
(especially in these loose dayes) are
as so many tongues, and mouthes,
and pens (without mine) to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
your due praises: and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that you will be better pleased,
that I turne my praises into prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
for your progresse and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
in the good way, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
to supplie that want this

the power of his grace, who onely

can further inrich you with the
Pearle of the Gospell: who also
