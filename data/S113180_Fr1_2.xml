      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orshipfull, and Gentlemen (my good friends) Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, I well know, might
<pb facs="3"/> seeme to be vnseasonably of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in a world of securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but that also I am not ignorant, that in a secure world, many sleepe not in the cradle of security. There is a righteous <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> in a world of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, &amp; a iust <hi>Lot</hi> among the Sodomites, vexed in heart with their vncleane conuersation. Where many (as one of the Prophets spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) eate the Lambs of the flocke, and Calues of the stalls, faring, as it is said of <hi>Diues,</hi> deliciously euery day; there may bee some (like poore <hi>Lazarus</hi>) lying at their gates begging food,
<pb facs="3"/> for preseruation of life. While some, perhaps, may bee chaunting the song, to the sound of the violl, and be singing merrily the tune of worldly contentment: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, peraduenture, may be sad in heart, and set downe heauily mourning for their miseries. What if a <hi>Gallio</hi> relish not religion, nor doth care any thing at al, though <hi>Paul</hi> be smitten wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet must we think, there be such as do not forget, but truely take to heart the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of <hi>Ioseph?</hi> While some are whole, not needing the Physician, as in their owne conceits they foolishly
<pb facs="4"/> imagine; some other neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse may feele their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall maladies, yea and groane vnder their burthē, desiring to be eased. Albeit full stomackes tread vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot the hony combe: yet the hungry soule is glad of the crummes which fall from the Lords Table. Indeede, the carnall libertine, if he may enioy worldly wealth, &amp; earthly rest, he feeleth no want of spirituall comforts, nor taketh any notice of his spiritual bondage; but a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Paul,</hi> a true conuert to God, though hee haue out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward contentments, yea &amp; inward peace; yet because
<pb facs="4"/> he cannot doe the good hee would, but often the euill, which he would not, he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out; O miserable mā that I am, who shall deliuer mee from the body of this death!</p>
   <p>Therefore to those that stand in need of cōfort, and desire the words of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refreshment; to those that are troubled in mind, in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit wounded and in their conscience afflicted: to those that are assaulted by Satan, vexed by ill men, disquieted in their outward estates, crossed in the honest course of their callings, or any waies tempted; to all those, and for their sakes haue I
<pb facs="5"/> laboured in this worke of Comforts, that they may find (if God please) some so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace hereby to their poor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted spirits. I send it not to gybing <hi>Ismaels,</hi> mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the children of the promise, but to obedient and faithfull <hi>Isaacs;</hi> not to prophane <hi>Esaus,</hi> but to religious <hi>Iacobs:</hi> to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> in prison and bonds, not to his brethren at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie at home, and vnhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: to the oppressed <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> and not to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing <hi>Egyptians.</hi> I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it not to proud and hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>Hamans;</hi> but to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and mournful <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/> clothed in sackcloth: to <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Amos</hi> the true dealing Prophets, and not to <hi>Amaziah</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shur</hi> the flattering Priests: to <hi>Abedmelech</hi> a godlie Courtier, and not to <hi>Zibah</hi> the sycophant and cousiner: to a constant <hi>Ruth,</hi> not to a backe-sliding <hi>Orpha:</hi> to an <hi>Hannah,</hi> a womā trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in spirit, pouring out her soule before the Lord, &amp; not to a Peninah, a vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and vpbrayding aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary: not to a <hi>Michol</hi> moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her Lord and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; but to a contemned and despised <hi>Leah.</hi> In a word, it is to the heauie loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb facs="6"/> that I wish refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the sorrowfull glad tidings, health to the sicke, rest to the troubled; soundnes of comfort, to the broken in heart, strength to the weak and feeble soule, and full supply of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is wanting for true ioy to euery one of the Lords e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected people.</p>
   <p>Oh (my worshipfull, and worthy good friends) I wish the spirit of the Lord God vpon me, to publish power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully good tidings to the meeke, to binde vp the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearted, to proclaime liberty to the captiues, the o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pening of the prison to them
<pb facs="6"/> that are bound, to declare the acceptable yeere of the Lord, &amp; to comfort all that mourne: this is my desire, this is the true intendment of this my labour. If God so blesse it, how ioyful &amp; glad shall I be? and that it may be, I intreat the Lord, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point and giue vnto them that mourne in Sion, beauty for ashes; the ioy of oyle, for mourning; the garment of praise, for the spirit of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, that they may bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the trees of righteousnes the planting of the Lord, that hee may bee glorified. This mercy I craue also of God for you, and doe desire
<pb facs="7"/> that this my worke (which here I present to you) may bee both friendly accepted of, as I offer it for a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my true and hearty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and also so diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perused, as you may reape the ioyfull fruit thereof, &amp; speake from experience the praises of God; and thus in my best well-wishes, not doubting of a kind accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and your continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of loue, I heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take you to the protection and louing mercies of our heauenly Father.</p>
