   <head>What a faithful subiect is, together with his reward.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>
      </hi> Good subiect next to the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem that adornes a Princes head, is the chiefest ornament that decores his dignitie. He is as the precious Baulme that annoints his browes, and is nearer to his heart then his Scepter in his right hand: as sweete in his nostrels as the groues of <hi>Gilead,</hi> &amp; more precious in his sight then <hi>Salomons</hi> Iuory throne couered with purest gold.</p>
   <p>His heart is clothed with peace, like mount Oliuet: and his eyes as harmelesse as the sight of a Doue.</p>
   <p>His tongue sounds like the harp of <hi>Dauid:</hi> and his lips deliuer the happinesse of loyaltie.</p>
   <p>His eares are the portals that receiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding: and all perfection from thence
<pb facs="4"/>
is conducted to the heart.</p>
   <p>His hands are ready to fight the battels of the Lord: and his feete (shunning the steps of bloud) are bent alwayes to walke in the paths of innocencie.</p>
   <p>Thus excellent in the sight of his Prince shines a faithfull subiect, more gorgeous then the Ephod of <hi>Aron,</hi> and more sumptuous then <hi>Salomon</hi> in all his royaltie.</p>
   <p>Whoso is thus to his Prince and countrey, the Lord wil prosper him, and he shall be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in an euerlasting generation.</p>
   <p>And for one of these benefits he receiues on earth, he shall haue a million in heauen.</p>
   <p>For one of these perfections he partakes of in this world, numbers aboue number shal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him in the world to come.</p>
   <p>And his Prince shall thus pray for him, and blesse him as <hi>Salomon</hi> did his subiects.</p>
   <p>And the King turned his face, and blessed all the congregation of Israel, and said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who spake with his mouth to <hi>Dauid</hi> my father, &amp; hath with his
<pb facs="4"/>
hand fulfilled it.</p>
   <p>And though my selfe may say with <hi>Esay,</hi> I am as a worme and no man, yet (I speake it in despite of vaine-glory) I would with all my heart, as an <hi>Isack</hi> in the hands of <hi>Abraham,</hi> serue as a sacrifice to do my Prince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey good.</p>
   <p>For surely he cannot be the true seruant of God, that is not a faithful subiect to his Prince. Neither wold I iudge any felicity in this world answerable to that, if once my soule might be employed to please my Prince, and benefite my countrey.</p>
   <p>For all the offices of humanitie depend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon those principall performances.</p>
   <p>For I know by that meanes there comes a blessing from a far, a reward full of ioy, which none else are worthy to obtaine: which reward I heartily pray the great Rewarder of all to send to the true loyall and faithfull subiect. And so with one voice, proceeding from one vnity of heart, let vs all say faithfully, God saue the King.</p>
