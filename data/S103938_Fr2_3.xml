   <head>❧ The preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>IT is wel knowen to a greate number, partly by presence in hearinge, partely by wrytinge set forth of the same, that a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy learned man and Bishop of this Realme, stoutly in dede, as the matter required, and clerkly also, as learning and knowlage taught him, did openly protest in certaine Sarmons not to the furtheraunce of vntrueth, as malice carpeth, but to the confusion of falshodde; as the ende proueth: that, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those things, which he then rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, could be proued of the contrary side by any sufficient authoritie of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, olde doctours and auntient coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, or by any alowed example of the primatiue church, then he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to subscribe, and yelde to their doctrine. This his doynge, as no lesse was to be loked for, sum men depraued, many dispraised, all they misliked, that mainteined suche superstitious errours, as false teachinge hath trained people
<pb facs="30"/>in, the space of certaine hundred yeares. And in dede, seinge they harde their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine so plainely defaced, and their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full misleadynge of Christian men so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to be noted: a man maye thinke they had good cause to startle at the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and somewhat to loke aboute them, leste they seemed altogether carelesse. Wherfore, as dyuers haue dyuersly she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed theyr mislikinge, so one of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath in writing priuely spred abrode an answere to the forsaide offer or prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statiō for priuate masses: wherin he both perswadeth him selfe, and would haue other also to beleue, that he hathe so fully satisfied the parties request, as it maye seeme greate folly, and as he termeth it, impudencie, any longer to staye vpon it. One of the copies of this answere by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion as it fortuned, not many mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes sence lighted into my hands: which, I vnderstande, is so spred abrode in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of this Realme, as there be fewe mislikers of the trueth, but they haue it, and make such accompte of it, as a greate number of the vnlearned sorte staie their consciences there vpon. Who the aucthour is, or what maner of man, I neither knowe, nor can gesse more,
<pb facs="30"/>then he witnesseth of him selfe in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce of this treatise. Where he signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, that once he imbraced that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he now detesteth and writeth against. In that parte me thinketh he doth deale, as fonde men sometime are wonte to doe: which to displease their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, sticke not to hurte them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues also. So he, to discredite the doctrine that he is reuolted from, geueth such te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of his owne naughtie life and conscience, as he would be lothe to heare at any mans mouth but his owne. All that time (saieth he) &amp; neither regarded god, nor good relygion, nor any good conscience beside. What malice it is to charge the doctrine, that by hipocrisie he professed, with the cause of his euill doinge, I will not declare with suche wordes, as the matter requireth. This muche I will saye, that he learned this of olde Adams greate councellour: Who at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge, beinge blamed for his disobedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, seemed to bourden God him selfe with the cause of it: and excused his owne folly by that thinge, whiche his maker had geuen him to his comforte and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie. In like manner, when this mans conscience, as it seemeth by hys
<pb facs="31"/>owne wordes, accused him of lewde li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge and lacke of the feare of god, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse his owne ill disposed minde, he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth the faute vpon the doctrine of the gospell, whiche God did open vnto him vndoubtedly to his great commoditie, if he would haue taken it. And vnder this pretence, bothe forsaketh it him selfe, and by his example exhorteth other to eschew it. But as the wicked life of a man, to his owne greate harme, may be a blotte to the religion, that he professeth: so God forbidde it should be compted a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profe of the same, or a iuste cause to be of all other reiected. If it were so, men should refuse Christianitie, because dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, not of the basest sorte, but of the heades of the Churche, as their owne hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories witnes, haue ben of horrible and wycked life. But we muste thinke, that the hipocrisie and traiterous couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Iudas and his felowes is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion to them selfe, but no iust reproche to Christe that they folow, or to his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that they seeme to professe. I will iudge and hope better of this wryter, to whom with all my harte I wishe much more good: trustinge that god shall once agayne open his hearte to receiue the
<pb facs="31"/>trueth, which I cannot but thinke God hathe taken from him in punishment of that naughtie conscience, that hee wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth hath ben in him selfe. But, what soeuer he be, let him stande or fall to his lorde god, I will not take vppon mee to iudge him, neither would I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this much of him, but that hee doeth odiously excuse his owne euill mynde by the good doctrine of Christes gospel. My purpose is to confute his doctrine, I wil not meddle with his person. I intende to answere his cauelinge at other mens wordes and doinges: I minde not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite or deface his estimation or hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie. And yet in this pointe I know some maye iudge me presumptuous and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, that I seeme to take vppon me his quarell, who is farre better able to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere for him selfe then I am. But I would desire those, whiche so thinke, to consider: Firste, that this is a common quarell, touchinge not only him, that is named, but all other that either teacheth or beleueth as he doth. Secondly, that he against whom this writing is directed, either knoweth not that any such thinge is spred, or if he doe know it, either thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it not worthy answere of it selfe, or
<pb facs="32"/>els hath not at this present such leasure, as he may intend to answere it. Thirdly and chiefely, that by priuate conference with certaine persons, I vnderstande, perhappes more then either he or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth thinke, how much this treatise is estemed amonge many, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise happely mighte bee perswaded to imbrace the gospell. Therefore I haue bene moued the soner my selfe, in suche sorte as I might, to shape an aunswere vnto it. For, to all suche of the contrary opinion, as haue feare of God, and staye vpon conscience rather then selfe wil, I acknowlage my self in christian charitie to owe this muche of dutie, as that I should, to my power, trauaile to lift this stumbling blocke out of theyr way, that it maye not be a let or staie vnto them to come vnto Christe, at this daye by his worde callinge them. Wherfore gentle Reader, seing thou doest vnderstand my meaning and the occasion of my doinge, I will cease any more to trouble thee, and will tourne the residew of my talke vnto the aucthour of this wryting: with whom I will make my entrie there, where he first beginneth to confute the reasons, that were alleged, why ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte
<pb facs="32"/>should not bee made to Docter Cole of that religion that now is taught. In this parte I wil be the shorter, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because those thinges bee sufficiently answered in the conference already published, althoughe this wryter seemeth to dissemble it: partly, because the questions haue more captiousnes of words then profit of good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
