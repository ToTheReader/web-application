There is no part of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity more expedient in these our contentions and misbelieuing Times, which threaten shipwrack of our auncient Christian Faith, then the study of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies. There is no Controuersy more to be insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted vpon, then the question concerning the Iudge of these Controuersies; since the proofe of it inuolues within it selfe, by force of necessary illations, the proofe of all other controuersiall points. For wheras most of the doubts betwene the Protestants and vs, being conuincingly demonstrated for certaine &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; yet such proofes do but force the iudgment of the Reader only in those particulars.

what, or who is this Iudge, it then ineuitably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that all those articles of faith are most true and Orthodoxall, which are found to be decreed, and defined by the sayd Iudge.

In so much as that we may iustly pronounce the question of this Iudge to be both the <hi>Center &amp; Circumference</hi> of all other questions; since no lesse the lynes and deductiōs of all controuersies do (for their last resolution) meet and concurre in this one common poynt; then that it selfe being cleared and made euident, doth include &amp; containe by demonstrable inferences, the proofe of al the rest, within the capacity and largnes of its owne <hi>Orbe.</hi>

<pb facs="4"/>
fayth, but what hath it expresse warrant from the wrytten Word of God.</p>
   <p>The sentence of the Catholiks in his Controuersy I forbeare to handle in this Treatise, since it is already discussed very painfully by diuers Catholike writers, and particularly in seuerall <note n="(c)" place="margin">
         <hi>Tract.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 4. <hi>subd</hi> 14. <hi>&amp; tract</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 7.</note> passages of that most learned worke of the <hi>Protestantes Apology of the Roman Church;</hi> the very store-house of reading, or the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, wherin are layed vp the weapons vsed by vs, and taken from our Aduersaries owne sides. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will spend these ensuing leaues in refutation of our Aduersaries Doctrine, which consisteth in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Scripture the sole iudge of Controuersies; a subiect not so frequently written off in particuler, though otherwise the reprouall therof be potentially and implicitly included in the confirmation of the Catholike contrary Doctrine.</p>
   <p>Now <hi>(Graue &amp; learned Sages)</hi> the reason embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me to dedicate this Treatise (otherwise vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy your iudiciall view) to your selues, though of a different religion from me is the consideration of the subiect here discussed, which is indeed of that nature, as that you may iustly seeme to challenge a particuler interest therin: for since you are worthily placed in the ranke of those, who (to speake in the Psalmists <note n="(d)" place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.</note> phrase) <hi>In vij institiae ambulant, &amp; in medio semitarum iudicij;</hi> And since a true apprehension of temporall Lawes maketh way for the better vnderstanding of Gods eternall and immutable law; those being but as branches deryued out of this, and as it were certaine adumbrations of the same, according to those words, <hi>Vnus</hi>

<pb facs="5"/>
law of God, which principally consisteth in this sacred writ, and disputeth who is to iudge therof, &amp; to determine difficulties according to the square of the same: Therefore who can better iudge of this point (speaking of the Laity) then you, who are Iudges? Or who can with a more cleare &amp; impartial eye discerne the may ne absurdities attending on our Aduersaries Doctrine, then you, if you will but vouchsafe to glasse the same, or like (by supposall only) in the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of your owne lawes?</p>
   <p n="1">1. You (for example) acknowledge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for your particuler worthines are deputed to the honour and dignity of Iudicature, that in regard of the ambiguity of your owne law, there must be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Iudge or Interpreter distinct from the law it selfe, for the manifesting of it true sense: Our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries <note n="(f)" place="margin">Luth.

   <p n="5">5. You hold it most dissonant to reason to iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, that when you vnfold and deliuer the meaning and sense of the law, you in so doing, are aboue the law, but you doe willingly acknowledge, that the law is law, whether your sentence be giuen of it or no; only by your learned <hi>Demurres,</hi> you pronounce your iudgement, not that therby, that which afore was not law, should by your sentence giuen become the law, but only that others not learned in the law, should by such your <hi>Reports,</hi> take notice and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the true meaning of the Law, from all obtruded and mistaken senses therof: Our Aduersaries <note n="(l)" place="margin">Luther. l. de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilijs, Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus l. de norma &amp; prax.

And heereupon they auerre, that the Pope, or a generall Councell by assuming this prerogatiue, presumes to make that Scripture by such their declaration, which afore was not Scripture; and to disauthorize that for not Scripture, which afore was Scripture; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to impose that sense of Scripture for the meaning of the holy Ghost, which before such their imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="6"/>
was not his meaning: wheras indeed all that the supreme Bishop or general Councel performes (both which reuerently submit themselues to the Scripture) is, to declare Canonicall Scripture from Apocryphal and forged wrytinges; and among many adulterate and false senses of confessed Scripture, to manifest which is the genuine and true sense of it; all which prerogatiues that the Church and her Head do enioy, is euident both from the words of our Sauiour <note n="(m)" place="margin">

   <p n="6">6. You voluntarily confesse, that besides your lawes left in wryting, our Realme enioyes (as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good States and Commonwealths do) certaine vnwrytten and customary lawes (as I may tearme them) which receaue their force from an vndiscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued practise and long hand of tyme.

   <p n="7">7. To conclude you would repute it most strāge, to fynd any man, that should affirme the present lawes of England to be the only square, according to which all suites ought to be decyded, and yet the same person withall to auerre, that at this tyme we
