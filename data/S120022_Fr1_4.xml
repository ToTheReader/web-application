      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Dout not but some man of seuere iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so soone as he hath ons read y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of this boke wyl immediatly sai, that I had more need to exhort men to worke, then to teach thē to play, which censure if it procede not of such a froward morositie that can be content with nothing but that he doth himself, I do not only well admit, but also willingly submit my self therto. And if I could be persuaded that men at mine exhortation wold be more diligent to labour, I would not only write a treatise twise as lōg as this, but also thynke my whole time wel bestowed, yf I
<pb facs="7"/>
did nothing els, but inuent, speake, and write that which might exhort, moue, &amp; persuade them to the furtherance of the same. But if after honest labour and trauell recreatiō be requisit, (and that nede no further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation because we fauour the cause wel inough) I had rather teach men so to play, as both honestye may be reserued, their wittes exersised, they them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues refreshed, and some profit also attayned, then for lacke of exercise to see them either passe the tyme in idlenes, or els to haue pleasure in thyngs fruitles and vncomely. And if great Emperours and mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narches of the world haue not bene ashamed by wryting boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to teache the art of Dyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing,
<pb facs="7"/>
of all good men abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and by all good lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: haue I not some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of defence, to teache the game, which so wyse men haue inuented, so learned men fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, and no good man hath euer condemned? The inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ascribed to Pythagoras, it beareth the name of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, prudēt men do practise it &amp; godly men do praise it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many herein (as in a play) haue challenged much authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they haue filled this game with much diuersitie. In which as I could perceiue the most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferens of playing to cōsist in thre kindes, so haue I playnly and briefly set thē forth in Englishe not as though there might not more diuersities be espied, but
<pb facs="8"/>
that I thought these to them whom I haue written to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. yet for that I woulde be lothe, frō playe &amp; game, to fall to earnest contention, if any man in this doing or any part therof shall think I haue done amisse, and will do better himself, so far am I from enuying his good proceding, that I wil be right glad, and geue him heartye thankes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
