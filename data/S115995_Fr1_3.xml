      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>EADER, if the Title of this
Booke, being <hi>The Anatomy of
the English Nunnery at Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
doe make thee expect some
Chyrurgicall mysteries, or profound Lecture
vpon a dissected bodie, let me satisfie thee, and
saue thee a labour of reading it; for thou art
much deceiued: the Author hereof is a man of
no such Science; being better skilled in Ta<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>kes,
Sheats, Braces, Bowlins, &amp;c. (strange words
perchance to thy vnderstanding, and yet no
canting) then in veines, sinewes, muscles, and
arteries. Yet what hee promiseth by the Title,
hee hath performed in the Treatise, and hath
truly anatomized this handmayd of the Whore
of Babylon; laying open her principall veines
and sinewes in such sort, that hee is bold to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the proudest Doctor of her acquaintance
to traduce his worke, or to taxe him of the least
vntruth in what he hath written: for here is no
<pb facs="5"/>
thing published, but what his owne experience,
being <hi>optima magistra,</hi> hath taught him, and
whereof he hath beene <hi>oculatus testis.</hi> Onely
the phrase he vseth is like himselfe, blunt and
vnelegant; for <hi>ex quolibet ligno non fit
Mercurius:</hi> winke therefore a little at the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
and suruey the matter it selfe with the
wide open eyes of thy vnderstanding, and spare
not. And if thou be not already addicted too
much to Poperie, thou mayst peraduenture find
a preseruatiue against it. Howsoeuer, here it
presenteth it selfe to the view of the world; bee
it well or ill accepted, it maketh not much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
for the Authour will alwayes carry this
comfort about him, <hi>A good Conscience is a
continuall feast.</hi> Vale.</p>
