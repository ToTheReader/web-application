   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ehold here a <hi>Post-humus:</hi> a Child brought into the world after the <hi>Own-Father</hi> was taken out of the world. A <hi>Foster-Father</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon required for it: but certenly, more for custome, than need. Such was the Own Father, as it is commendation enough for the Child to say, <hi>This is the Child of such a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And such is the Child, as for its owne sake it will find good entertainment, though the Father of it were unknowne.</p>
   <p>Adistinct narration of the life and death of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor you have truly and punctually (as becommeth such a narration) premised.</p>
   <p>All his Workes do shew that he was <hi>full</hi> in what he undertooke: so full, as he leaves scarce any thing (if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing at all) for another Author to add, more than he hath done, to what he hath done.</p>
   <p>He had a very searching and diving gift: whereby he was able to <hi>anatomize</hi> and lay open the severall parts and nerves of the points which he handled, and to set out pertinent signes, rules, meanes, and motives thereabout.</p>
   <p>His expression of his mind by fit words and phrases
<pb facs="8"/>
was answerable to his invention. Both very copious, full of variety.</p>
   <p>Take for instance this ensuing <hi>Treatise:</hi> the maine scope whereof is to furnish a Christian against the evill day.</p>
   <p>Therein you may observe, how, on the one side he discovers the false meanes which most use; and how, on the other side he revealeth the <hi>true meanes</hi> that are of singular use to the end intended: yea, and how he enforceth the same with <hi>reason upon reason,</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to demonstrate the equity of the point: how also he infers all sorts of <hi>Uses</hi> thereupon, <hi>as, Reprehension, Exhortation, Direction,</hi> and <hi>Consolation:</hi> and finally, how he takes occasion from thence of an exceeding large discourse upon <hi>the foure last things, which</hi> (to use his owne words) <hi>have beene ever holden very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall and of speciall moment to make us (by GODS blessing) more humble, un-worldly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and prepared for the evill day.</hi> Those foure Heads are, <hi>DEATH, IVDGEMENT, HELL, HEAVEN.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To add more to what he hath set out thereabouts, were to powre water into the sea. First read, then judge: and the <hi>LORD</hi> add his blessing.</p>
