      <salute>Madam,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oure yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, I preached upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of spirituall desertions, not having then the least thought to put it to the Presse. But a strong streame of importunities hath borne me downe. My love to my friends hath subdued me to them. They
<pb facs="3"/>besieged me so strongly, that they have entred and taken away the keyes of the City, and pillaged me of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and this little thing, which they cal good booty; but they are mistaken: But now they have it, much good may it doe them; I stood out against them, not because I prized it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I thought it not good enough for them. It shall much please mee, if they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a prey of it, find it worth their having. Since it doth fall into their hands,
<pb facs="3"/>the good blessing of GOD goe with it, that it may bee better to them than the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest spoyles. <hi>Madam,</hi> in this businesse, the next thing that I desired was to reserve the first for you; and to stamp upon every one, some small impresse of my obliged respects unto you: Ladyship. Besides mine owne engagements, which are neither few nor meane; your great worth was sufficient to wheele my thoughts in this kind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>Among other excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, your charitable dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, like a rich fountaine, running with large streames of goodnesse many wayes, renders you deservedly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured of all. It is true noblenesse to bee of a large and diffusive spirit. He that is all for himselfe, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all his thankes from himselfe; but to doe good to others, begets a strong reflexion of true honour. Selfe is a poore center of a mans actions. This is right earth: All things that have
<pb facs="4"/>affinity with the Heavens, move upon the center of another which they bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. <hi>Madam,</hi> I beseech you seeke to bee still more blessed in a close conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and sociall operation of true charity, and sincere piety, that these may stand as unwithering Crownes upon your head: and when your old age shall give up to approaching death, you may goe to Heaven full of faith, and full of workes. These asunder are dead; but where they meet they
<pb facs="5"/>have life in themselves, and give life to their owners. This life, when your life shall end, he wisheth to you, who is and will be</p>
