                 <title>The grand imposture of the (now) Church of Rome : manifested in this one article of the new Romane creede, viz: the holy, catholike, and apostolike Romane Church, mother and mistresse of all other churches, without which there is no saluation. Proued to ba a new, false, sacrilegious, scandalous, schismaticall, hereticall, and blasphemous article (respectiuely) and euerie way damnable. The last chapter containeth a determination of the whole question, concerning the separation of Protestants from the present Church of Rome: whereby may be discerned whether side is to be accounted schismaticall, or may more iustly pleade soules saluation.

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Maiesty may bee pleased (most gratious Soueraigne) to call to minde the Dedicatory Preface of <hi>Saint Luke,</hi> by him prefixed before the <hi>Gospell of Christ,</hi> and directed to a Lay-Magistrate, in these words; <note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Luke 1.3.</hi>

      <hi>I thought good to write vnto thee, most excellent Theophilus.</hi> Where, the name <hi>THEOPHILVS,</hi> signifying a <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="3"/>
of God,</hi> manifesteth the interest that euery De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout Christian, as well Laick as Ecclesiastick, hath in the <hi>Gospell of Christ,</hi> to reade, and enioy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort therof, as the foundation of his Faith, and diuine <hi>Charter</hi> of his <hi>Saluation.</hi> And the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of <note n="*" place="margin">[<gap reason="foreign">

      </note>
      <hi>MOST EXCELLENT,</hi> being ascribed to Temporall <hi>Gouernors,</hi> pointeth out his Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; to note the Obligation, that bindeth euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Gouernor</hi> to professe the same <hi>Gospel</hi>; and, according to his power, to promote and protect it. As soone therefore as I thought to finde a Parallell to this so honourable an Example, no-one appeared in this age of Christianity either more Worthie, for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Deuotion, of the name of <hi>THEOPILVS</hi>; or, for Protecting the <hi>Gospell of Christ,</hi> more deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Attribute of <hi>MOST EXCELLENT,</hi> than your Sacred Maiesty.</p>
   <p>For I could not conceiue where to finde a more faithfull Professor among (I say, not onely <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> but) euen Persons Christians, than Him, who, in a time of Iealouzie and greatest extremity, resolued to resigne his dearest Choice, his inheritance of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Scepter, yea and life it selfe, rather than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrall his precious Soule to Romish Superstition. And as for the protection of the same <hi>Gospell</hi> of Faith, to none can this be more proper than to Him,
<pb facs="3"/>
who (not to question the first beginning thereof) most iustly possesseth the Royall Title of <hi>DEFEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER OF THE FAITH.</hi> Now hauing said thus much of this <hi>Right,</hi> I beseech your Maiestie gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously to vouchsafe a briefe, yet cleare Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation thereof.</p>

And although Some few of Them had obtained an opinion of <hi>Probability</hi> in the daies of antiquity; yet can it not be shewed that any one of them had stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on it the opinion of <hi>Necessity of Beleefe, vpon losse of Saluation.</hi> Which is a Character as proper to the <hi>Gospell of Christ,</hi> as was to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar's coyne</hi> the <hi>Image of Caesar.</hi> Wherfore, euery

      <hi>Serpent of Aaron deuoured</hi> the <hi>Serpents of the Magitians in Aegypt</hi>; euen so That one <hi>Anathema</hi> of S. <hi>Paul</hi> must needs cōdemne all the <hi>Anathema's</hi> which they denounce in Defence of That, which is not <hi>THE FAITH once deliuered to the Saints,</hi> in the dayes of the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But because, as the first mooueable Sphere aboue turneth by it's rapture all the inferior Orbes daily about the world; so one Romish Article, to wit, <hi>The Catholike, ROMANE, Mother, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse Church, without which there is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,</hi> carrieth and maketh current, by the violence thereof, all other Romish <hi>Articles,</hi> albeit otherwise neuer so New, False, Idolatrous, or Pernicious: and for that this One is found by Experience to bee, in that Profession, their strongest Enchantment; This this <hi>ARTICLE</hi> therefore haue I selected to be the Subiect of this Treatise. Proouing her Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word <hi>(ROMANE)</hi> to the <hi>CATHOLIKE</hi> or <hi>Vniuersall CHVRCH,</hi> to be (by many confessed Propositions) the Deprauation of that our Christian
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Article</hi> in the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> viz. <hi>THE CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOLIKE CHVRCH:</hi> Her pretence of an <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Motherhood,</hi> to all <hi>Catholike Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> to be a manifest Derogation to diuerse ancient <hi>Churches</hi> (among others, the <hi>Church of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi>) which are confessed to haue bene, before that euer <hi>Rome</hi> had so much as any face or name of a <hi>Church</hi>: and her Challenge of <hi>Vniuersall Mistris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> and Dominion thorow-out all Christendome to bee, in effect, a blasphemous Condemnation of most godly <hi>Generall Councels, Churches,</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> of Primitiue ages (diuers whereof are by name Registred for <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> in the <hi>Calendar</hi> of the, now, Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe:) who, as is Confessed, haue consented Some to impose Lawes vpon the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> Some to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne her <hi>Excommunications,</hi> and All to haue denyed absolute <hi>Subiection</hi> vnto Her, euen in the times of her purest Integrity.</p>
   <p>And because all Temporall Estates at this day are included in the same <hi>Romish Article</hi> of <hi>Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Dominion,</hi> therefore both <hi>Regall Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie</hi> ouer <hi>Ecclesiastiques</hi> is in this Treatise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, by the confessed Examples of the first and best <hi>Christian Emperours;</hi> and also the <hi>Ciuill Subiection</hi> of the <hi>Clergie</hi> vnto Them is iustified,
<pb facs="5"/>
by the Confessed Obedience performed by the first and best <hi>Popes</hi> of the same Times.</p>
   <p>After this Suruey thus taken of the <hi>Churches Christian,</hi> in the Primitiue ages, followeth a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the State of <hi>Christendome,</hi> as it is at this present: wherein appeareth a world of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches</hi> of remote <hi>Nations,</hi> reduced to these Generall appellations, to wit, <hi>Grecians, Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Aethiopians, Aegyptians, Armenians, Russians,</hi> with diuers other <hi>particular Churches,</hi> for <hi>Time</hi> as ancient, for <hi>Faith</hi> as fundamentall, for <hi>Succession</hi> as Continuall, and for the <hi>Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> thereof (because daily suffering grieuous pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and afflictions for the <hi>name of Christ</hi>) as much, or rather, in that respect, more constant than the Romanists haue bene for many ages: All which (notwithstanding the <hi>Romane</hi> Article of <hi>The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Romane Church, without which there is no Saluation)</hi> stand as opposite to the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>; contemning her <hi>Excommunications,</hi> and abhorring <hi>Subiection</hi> vnto her, as they euer did. A perfect Argument of the Falsity, Nullity, and Impiety of that <hi>Romish Article,</hi> which wee now impugne.</p>
   <p>In the last place is presented the <hi>Separation</hi> of all <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> from the <hi>Church of
<pb facs="6"/>
Rome,</hi> proouing from the Testimonies of diuerse Romish Writers, the <hi>Beginning</hi> thereof to haue bene Iust, and the <hi>Continuance</hi> Necessary. Nor can they say, that their Arguments, for defence of that <hi>Romane Article</hi> (although most specious) are not answered; which herein are iustly retorted vpon them. As to call for the <hi>Names</hi> of any <hi>Protestants</hi> before <hi>LVTHER</hi>; whose names they themselues could relate in <hi>Martyring</hi> of them: As to Challenge those to haue broken their <hi>Vow,</hi> in Departing from that <hi>Church</hi> (namely, a superstitious <hi>Vow)</hi> which they did, to preserue their Christian <hi>Vow ìn Baptisme,</hi> which requireth sinceritie in the Faith· As to obiect <hi>Schisme,</hi> vpon that Article of <hi>Necessary Subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Romane Sea</hi>; by which she her selfe (diuiding her selfe from all <hi>Christian Churches</hi> in the world, and all others from her selfe) is prooued to be, of all other, the most <hi>Schismaticall:</hi> As to impute vnto vs the guilt of <hi>Damning</hi> all our <hi>fore-Fathers,</hi> by reason of that her former Article, whereby are necessarily Damned most of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Fathers, Confessors,</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Times; besides the Innumerable professed <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> of <hi>Remote Nations</hi> (as hath bene said) yea and many Thousands moe, who, though otherwise <hi>Romish,</hi> yet do not belieue all her <hi>Tridentine faith</hi>;
<pb facs="6"/>
(Not to speake of infinite numbers of <hi>PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS</hi> farre, more sincerely Professed in the Christian Faith than They:) Finally, as to assume a <hi>Priuilege</hi> to her <hi>Romane See</hi> of not-<hi>Erring</hi>; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that <hi>Church</hi> is prooued to be, of all Others, most subiect to <hi>Errour:</hi> and her <hi>Seate,</hi> which is <hi>ROME,</hi> to be the onely <hi>Citie</hi> prophesied off by the Spirit of God, in Scripture, (accordingly as her owne <hi>Iesuites,</hi> from the testimonies of Antiquity, and the light of <hi>Gods word</hi> acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues bound to belieue, and professe) is to become the <hi>Seate of ANTICHRIST.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The Manifestation of all which Points (Most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noumed Soueraigne) I do subiect to your gratious Patronage, not in any spirit of Malignancie, to make the <hi>Schisme</hi> and breach, which is now betweene <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Vs,</hi> bigger; which I intend to perswade against thorrow-out this Treatise, by reueiling and remoouing the onely Bar and <hi>Partition-wall,</hi> which is her Doctrine of <hi>Necessary Beliefe</hi> of the (now) <hi>Tridentine Creed,</hi> and <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Necessary Subiection</hi> to the <hi>Romane See</hi>; the onely Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a free <hi>Generall Councell.</hi> An Impiety and Perniciousnesse, which was the very <hi>Cordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium</hi> of the most Iudicious of <hi>Kings,</hi> your Maiesties late Father, and our Soueraigne Lord and King
<pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>IAMES,</hi> of euer blessed and suruiuing Memorie▪ in whose heart God had first imprinted that <hi>Blessed Motto</hi> of Christ, <hi>BEATI PACIFICI,</hi> before it was stamped in his Coine; being euer desirous to keepe Ciuill Vnion, Commerce, and Contracts with Them with whom naythelesse (the Case so standing) <note n="*" place="margin">

      </note> He held it <hi>Impossible</hi> to haue any <hi>Spirituall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thus not doubting but that the <hi>Father's</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious heart dwelleth in the <hi>Sonnes</hi> brest, I pray <hi>GOD</hi> so still to protect your Maiestie, in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that <hi>THE FAITH,</hi> whereby your Throne may be established vpon earth, and your Soule euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly blessed in heauen.</p>
