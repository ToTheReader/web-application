      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Emembrance of vndeserued fauour, (Right worshipfull) is a present spurre vnto me to continue deserued dutie: in consideration whereof, not knowing otherwise to seale an assurance of my thankful seruice, I haue (after my maner) employed my pen in translating a pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, though breefe and compendious, yet pithie and profitable: whiche with wonted will I dedicate to your worship, in hope of accustomed courteous accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Prudent and learned was he, by whome it was compiled: puissaunt and mightie, to whom it was presented: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous and vnskilfull, by whome it is translated: politike &amp; graue, to whom it is exhibited. The first was a Bishop of great reuerence, the second an Emperour
