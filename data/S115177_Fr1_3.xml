Cor. 11. 23.24. &amp;c : Wherein the nature of this sacrament is faithfully discussed, the matter of it, together with the necessity of often receiuing, truly declared; the words o consecration embowelled, and errours with the cauills of papists soundly confuted.

   <head>The Epistle to the <hi>Reader.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I make little doubt but thou hast often either from thy owne experience beene brought to consider, or by the mouthes of Gods Ministers hast bin instructed, how wise wee are in casting for our temporall commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and how carelesse on the other hand, in the matters appertaining to God, and our owne peace: Yet suffer thy selfe once againe to be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed of this point, which may so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficially be thought vpon. A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb facs="13"/>whereunto I will not fetch any farther, then from what thy eies looke vpon, and thy hands handle. Here is a Treatise, the very title whereof doth draw thy respect to it, as dealing in a Theme so weighty, and needfull, as is the meditation of the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. This somewhat affecteth thee, yet neuerthelesse thou are not ouer willing to part with thy siluer to purchase it, vnlesse thou maist haue some good ground to buy a good pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-worth. Well, I discommend not thy temporary warinesse, but wish thee sutable circumspection in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall businesses. Sticke not, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader, to bestow two or three groates vpon a booke bandling so worthy a subiect as this present Tractate doth. Let no preiudicate opinion fore-possesse thee, when cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorily ouer-looking it (as buyers
<pb facs="13"/>vse to do,) thou findest not the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and bottom of the leaues taken vp with quotations of old and new writers, as if forsooth therefore it were of no worth. Euery laced, and garded robe is not the substantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest, neither is euery booke be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with allegations, most sound, &amp; materiall.</p>
   <p>The Author is farre hence (as I am informed) and wanteth oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to contriue his Epistle to the Reader: My selfe requested by the booke seller, according to the truth of my apprehension, will say a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the booke. Thou shalt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Christian Reader, if I bee not much deceiued, finde a portion of Scripture familiarly, and soundly opened by way of doctrine, backed with reasons, pressed on the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with applications able to moue affections, if the fault bee not thy
<pb facs="14"/>owne. Thou shalt find a great aime according to the seuerall matters on seuerall occasions to build thee vp in holinesse, and to plucke thee off from yeelding to such corruptions as thy own euil heart, or the wicked times may too much incline thee to. In a word, thou shalt meete with signes of some graces, and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to other Christian practises; and (which I would not forget) euery where where occasiō is offered, thou shalt perceiue a true Protestant spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit breathing, as if the times too much charitablenes toward Popery, had, by a certaine antiperistasis, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled the godly Authors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion against it, so much the more. The numbers of men of which tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Lord increase, granting for one such tenne, and for tenne an hundred, that many hands pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
