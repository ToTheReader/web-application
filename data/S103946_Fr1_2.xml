   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Am not ignorant, how aduenturous
it is to entermeddle in those controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
wherein the minds of men being
stiffened in conceite, and possessed with
preiudice of opinion, they esteeme a man
in that degree learned or vnlearned,
wise or weake, according as hee doth either iump or iarre
with them in iudgement. But in these high controuersies of
state, it is dangerous also for a priuate man to deale; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for that he may be assured not to escape the blowes of
them, whose enuious disposition cannot looke right vpon
any thing, nor endure the burthen of another mans deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
well; but especially, for that diuers times he engageth
his safetie vpon vncertaine euents, wherein his hazards do
very farre surmount his hopes.</p>
   <p>And yet, because in ciuill differences we cannot but hold
such for enemies, as, either through negligence, which is ill,
or through feare, which is worse, stand in shew of Neuters,
expecting the issue with an idle eye; for that it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth,
that by withdrawing our selues in the beginning of
dissentions, we are afterwards able to affoord no other ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
comfort or reliefe, but to mourne with the rest in the
publike miserie; I haue aduised, and thereupon aduentured
to thrust my selfe into the common throng: being rather
assured than in hope, that howsoeuer I be both priuate and
meane,<note place="margin">Opera <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>nesti <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 span">
            <desc>〈…〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> yet the paines of an honest Citizen is neuer vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
   <p>And hereof I haue the more reason to presume, for that
<pb facs="3"/>
I finde not my selfe caried by any peeuish humor of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
which will ruinate so many as it doth rule; nor
by any seruill desire of pleasing or flattering, which I haue
alwaies esteemed more base than begging; nor by any false
and foolish ouerweening, whereby many doe conceiue that
nothing can be well either determined or done, except they
haue a finger in it: but first, for loue to the good of the state,
whereto we are by all true rules most neerely tied; and next,
in dutie toward his Maiestie, to whom we are not onely in
conscience but in necessitie bound to bee loyall. Touching
whom, it concerneth vs also to consider, in what state of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
he shall stand, and how others will be encouraged
to vse insolencie against him; (the thoughts of men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing
by degrees) if in his first purposes, hauing reason
and equitie concurring with his power, he shall not finde the
meanes to preuaile.</p>
   <p>It behoueth vs to be, as resolute and constant for the
good of the state, so wise in discerning what is good; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we are not resolute but rash, and our constancie is no
other than an ill grounded obstinacie. It behoueth vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
not to be more wittie to frame feares, than wise to
iudge them, assuring our selues, that those things which
seeme dangerous and are not, doe daily decline and demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
by degrees; and that those counsailes which proceede,
not from iudgement well grounded, but from some distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of affection, after they haue a little throwne vp
their fume and fire, doe sodainly dissolue, and vanish as
vaine. Lastly it behoueth vs to foresee, that a time may
come, which will manifest how profitable it might be, not to
haue been negligent in things which seemed to be small: for
that oftentimes vpon matters appearing of little weight,
things of great consequence doe depend.</p>
