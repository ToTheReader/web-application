      <hi>TO THE HIGH AND myghtye Prince, Thomas Duke of Northfolke, Earle Marshall of Englande, knyght of the most noble order of the Garter, and one of the Queenes Maiesties priny Counsel, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> VVhitehorne, wys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth longe lyfe with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VHat great commoditye</hi> and profytte (ryght worthy Prince) hath alwayes redounded to the weale publy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes and gouernours of the same, which in warlike discipline haue chiefly delited, and taken greatest care, and to what excellent fame and renowine, it hath alwayes broughte and exalted (yea from vile and abiect fortune) those that haue moste trauayled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuored
<pb facs="3"/>them selues therin, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by also womē, haue made notable and wonderful conquestes, of such as haue lytle regarded Marshiall knowledge, the Historye of the Amazons, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> infinite other, doth manifestlye and plainelie declare. And specially the same of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, who firste from poore shepeherdes, throughe their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent skil in feates of Armes, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased their kyngdome, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, that in shorte time, they became Lordes, and Emperours of all the world. For by suche sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vndoubtedly, not only forren Countreis are brought in subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but also their owne proper kyngdomes are kept from outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious crueltie, &amp; rauenous spoyle of the ennemies: and good lawes there establyshed, are quietly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted vpon offenders, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious disturbaunce. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="3"/>the comming vp of the Turkes and the occasion of their maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous victoryes, is well to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande to haue happened by no other meanes, but onelye, for that there is no nation in al the world, with whome they haue warred, whiche in all kinde of Marshiall affayres and doinges, so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth, and imitateth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous antiquitie, as they: whiche partlye I am able to witnes, by that I haue sene, when I was in Constantinople, and in Turkie. Which thing consideringe with my selfe, and of late happening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my handes, the copie of thys booke, called Onosandro Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico. Who many yeres agon, most excellentlye in the Greke tounge, wrote of the offyce of a Generall Capitaine, whiche longe agon I didde translate out of the Italion tounge for mine owne exercise, and
<pb facs="4"/>for the great delight that I haue alwayes had in the studiynge of the arte of war, I haue thought good at this present, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vtilitie of my countreymen, who delyte in warlyke skilfulnes, to sufter the same to be publyshed in printe. In whiche booke is to be founde, as good aduises, and counsels, for a Captayne, or man of warre, as can possibly be inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or imagined. Wherefore, for as muche as youre Grace, right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye and valiauntly, hath hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore executed the office of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, wherin also the worthie actes of youre Noble Graundfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is of moste shynynge and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous remembraunce, I could not deuise with my selfe, vnto whom this my labour and trauaile, was more meete to be dedicated vnto, then to your Grace, who in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiall feates, and in the profounde
<pb facs="4"/>knowledge thereof, is thought moste expert. And although my trāslation herin, be very rude and grosse, yet because my good wyll with the effect and worthines of the matter is chiefly to be wayed and considered, my truste is, that accordynge to youre accustomed gentelnesse, you wyll accept the same in good part: consideringe that grosse phrases, cannot in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitye maime a good meaning, no more, then the exellent entent of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lawes of this Realme, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whit abased through the vnsauery lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, wherin they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
