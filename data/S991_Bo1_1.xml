Clifton &amp; Iohn Smyth, concerning true Christian baptisme of new creatures, or new borne babes in Christ: &amp;nd false baptisme of infants borne after the flesh. Referred to two propositions. 1. That infants are not to bee baptized. 2. That antichristians converted are to bee admitted into the true church by baptisme</title>

   <p>It may be thought most straung, that a man should oft tymes chandg his Religiō: &amp; it cannot be accounted a commendable quality in any man to make many altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; chandges in such weighty matters, as are the cases of conscience: but if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy be commēdable in any thing, it is most cōmendable in the best things which is Religion: &amp; it inconstancy be worthy reproof in matters of inferior estimation, it is much more blameable in matters of Salvatiō: In respect wherof the wisest &amp; most Religions men have been alwayes most constant in ther profession &amp; faith: &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant persons cannot escape the deserved imputatiō of folly or weaknes of judgment therein.</p>
   <p>This must needs be true, (&amp; we confesse it) if one condition be admitted, that the Religon which a man chandgeth be the truth: For otherwise to chandge a false Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is commendable, &amp; to retaine a false Religion is damnable. For a man of a Turk to become a Iew, of a Iew to become a Papist, of a Papist to become a Protestant are al commendable chandges though they al of them befal one &amp; the same person in one yeere, nay, if it were in one month: So that not to chandg Religion is evil sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: &amp; therfor that we should fal from the profession of Puritanisme to Brownisme, &amp; from Brownisme to true Christian baptisme, is not simply evil or reprovable in it self, except it be proved that we have fallen from true Religion: If wee therfor being formerly deceaved in the way of Pedobaptistry, now doe embrace the truth in the true Christian Apostolique baptisme: Then let no mā impute this as a fault vnto vs: This therfor is the question: whither the baptisme of infants be lawful, yea or nay: &amp; whither persons baptized being infants must not renounce that false baptisme, &amp; assume the true baptisme of Chr: which is to be administred vppon persons confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their faith &amp; their sinnes: This being the controversy now betwixt vs, &amp; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration commonly called Brownists: For the glory of God, the manifesting of the truth to our own nation, &amp; the destruction of the man of sinne, wee have thought good to publish this present treatise, wherin the whole cause is handled: Let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different reader jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ayned to give glory to God in acknowledging the error of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising infants, to have been a cheef point of Antichristianisme, &amp; the very essence &amp; constitution of the false Church, as is cleerly discovered in this treatise: Now happily some man wil wish that the controversy had been with the Rabbyes of the Seperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; not with Mr. Clifton whom thy calūniate to be a weake man, vnable to deale in so great a controversy wel, let the Reader take notice, that although it be Mr. Clif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tons p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>n, yet it is not only Mr. Cliftons cause &amp; defence, but his allegations &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are the best p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>wer to their reasons: we do challendg al the Seperation in special to the combat. Be it knowne therfor to all the Seperation that we account them in respect of their constitution to bee as very an h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>ot as either her Mother England, or her grandmother Rome is, out of whose loynes she came: &amp; although once in our ignorance we have acknowledged her a
<pb facs="3"/> true Chu. yet now being better informed we revoke that our erroneous judgment &amp; protest against her, aswel for her false constitution, as for her false ministery, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, &amp; government: The true constitution of the Chu. is of a new creature baptized into the Father, the Sonne, &amp; the holy Ghost: The false constitution is of infants bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tized: we professe therfor that al those Churches that baptise infants are of the same false constitution: &amp; al those Chu. that baptize the new creature, those that are made Disciples by teaching, men conse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ing their faith &amp; their sinnes, are of one true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution: &amp; therfor the Chu. of the Seperation being of the same constitution with England &amp; Rome, is a most vnnatural daughter to her mother England, &amp; her grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother Rome, who being of the self fame genealogie &amp; generation, (that of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet being true of her, as is the Mother so is the daughter) she dare notwithstanding most impudently wipe her own mouth, &amp; cal her mother &amp; grandmother adulteres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses. Hee in therfor we do acknowledg our error, that we retayning the baptisme of England which gave vs our constitution, did cal our mother England an harlot, &amp; vppon a false ground made our Seperation from her: For although it be necessary that we Seperate from England, yet no man can Seperate from England as from a false Chu. except he also do Seperate from the baptisme of England, which giveth England her constitution: &amp; whosoever doth retaine the baptisme of England doth with al retaine the constitution of England, &amp; cannot without sinne cal England an harlot as we have done: &amp; this we desire may be wel minded of al that Seperate frō England: For if they retaine the baptisme of England, viz the baptisme of infants as true baptisme, they cannot Seperate from England as from a false Chu. though they may Seperate for corruptions▪ &amp; whosoever doth Seperate from England as from a false Church, must needs Seperate from the baptisme of England, as from false bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme: For the baptisme of England cannot be true &amp; to be retayned, &amp; the Chu. of England false &amp; to de rejected: neither can the Chu. of England possibly be false ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the baptisme be false, vnlesse a true constitution could be in a false Chu. which is as impossible as for light to have felowship with darknes: It is impossible that con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>traryes or contradictions should be both true: &amp; so it is impossible that a false Chur. should have a true constitution or a true baptisme: To say thus:
<list>
         <item>England hath a false constitution.</item>
         <item>England hath a true baptisme, is as much as to say thus.</item>
         <item>England hath a true constitution.</item>
         <item>England hath a true constitution, which is to contradict:</item>
      </list>
   </p>
   <p>But the Seperation they say England hath a false constitution, &amp; is a false Chu. &amp; to be Seperated from: &amp; yet they say also: England hath a true baptisme (that is a true constitution) which is not to be Seperated from: For a true constitution &amp; true baptisme are one &amp; the same: So is a false constitution &amp; a false baptisme: So that the speeches &amp; actions of the Seperation are cōtradictory in this particular. Finaly, they that defend the baptisme of infants cannot with any truth or good conscience Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate from England as from a false Chu. though they may seperate for coruptions: &amp; they that do Seperate from England as from a false Chu. must of snecessity Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the baptisme of England, &amp; account the baptisme of England false, &amp; so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the baptisme of infants false baptisme: Therfor the Seperation must either goe
<pb facs="3"/> back to England, or go forward to true baptisme: &amp; al that shal in tyme to come Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate from England must Seperate from the baptisme of England, &amp; if they wil not Seperate from the baptisme of England their is no reason why they should seperate from England as from a false Church: &amp; this is more at large proved in the second question of this discourse, whither the Reader is to be referred. Now concerning this point of baptising infants we do professe before the L. &amp; before al men in sincerity &amp; truth that it semeth vnto vs the most vnreasonable heresy of al Antichristianisme: for considering what baptisme is, an infāt is no more capable of baptisme then is any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable or insensible creature: For baptisme is not washing with water: but it is the baptisme of the Spirit, the confession of the mouth, &amp; the washing with water: how then can any mā without great folly wash with water which is the least &amp; last of baptisme, one that is not baptized with the Spirit, &amp; cannot confesse with the mouth: or how is it baptisme if one be so washed: Now that an infant cannot be bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tized with the Spirit is plaine, 1. Pet. 3:21. wher the Apostle saith that the baptisme of the Spirit is the question of a good conscience into God, &amp; Heb. 10.22. wher the baptisme which is inward is caled the sprinkling of the hart from an evil consciēce: seing therfor infants neither have an evil conscience, nor the question of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, nor the purging of the hart, for al these are proper to actual sinners: hence it followeth that infants baptisme is folly &amp; nothing. Againe: Iohns baptisme was the baptisme of repentance: infants have not repentance: &amp; therfor cannot have the bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisme of repentance. That infants cannot have repentance is evident, seing repentāce is knowledg of sinne by the Law, sorrow for sinne by the gospel, mortification of sin &amp; new obedience, al which are as much in the basen of water, as in the infant bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Now I confesse the Pedobaptists have many showes of reason for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their heresy, &amp; one man shapeth them into one forme, another man into an other, as every mans wit &amp; learning teacheth him, but indeed they are al built vpon the self same sandy fondacions, the wresting of some places of Scripture: al which (in a manner) are discovered in some measure in this treatise: whereby the reader may perceave the manifest perventing of the scriptures from their true sense: Now bicause men cal for antiquity, &amp; except they see antiquity they wil not beleve, though the Scriptures be the most auncient, I have thought good therefore to propound two pregnant testimonyes of Antiquity (besides that which is alledged in the pag. 30. &amp; 31. of this treatise) against baptisme of infants: that men may know that this truth al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so hath her footsteps among the Fathers.</p>
   <p>
      <bibl>Tertullianus lib. de baptismo adversus Quintillam.</bibl> hath these wordes: Then which nothing is more playne.
<q> Itaque pro cujusque personae conditione, dispositione, etiam aetate cunctatio baptis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mi vtilior est precipue tamen circa parvulos: Quid enim necesse est, si non tam neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, sponsores etiam periculo ingeri? qui &amp; ipsi per mortalitatem destituere promissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes suas possunt, &amp; proventu malae indolis falli.

   </p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p> That is to say in English.
<q> Therfor to defere &amp; not to hasten baptisme is more profitable for the condition, disposition &amp; age of every person: but especialy as concerning yong children: For what necessity is ther to bring suertyes into daunger for the baptising of infants, if ther be no such necessity of hastning the baptising of infants: Seing the suerties oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes are disabled to performe their promise both by reason of mortality, &amp; of the evil disposition of some children whē they come to yeres, for wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>me they promised in baptisme. Indeed the L. saith, forbid them not to come vnto me: Therfor let them come to Chr. but let them come when they are growne, when they learne, &amp; when they are taught to what they come. Let them by baptisme be made Christians when they can know Chr. by instruction: why doth the innocent age hasten to the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes: we deale more safely in worldly matters: Shal we commit heavenly things to yong children vnto whome we dare not commit our earthly substance? let thē first know how to ask salvation that so we may seem to give to him that asketh.</q>

   <p>
      <bibl>Euseb. Ecclest. Hist. Lib. 10. Chap. 15.</bibl>
      <q> Athanasius his baptising of children in spirit that answered according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Catechumeni, is aproved by Alex. lib. of Alexa. &amp; his Clerks: whence it is to be noted that these children baptized by Athanasius were vnbaptized, &amp; yet knew the manner of baptisme, as being children borne in the Chu. So that by this place &amp; al other places of the Eclesi. Hist. wher like mention is made of the childrē of Christians first Catechized &amp; then baptized, it may easily be discerned that baptisme of infants was not yet vniversaly receaved, but by litle &amp; litle prevailed, as other An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tich heresies have done: in respect wherof Origen, August.

   <p>And thus much for the Testimonyes of Antiquity which hereafter shalbe produ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced more plentifully vpon further occasion offered: if the Seperation or any other dare adventure the tryal of the matter out of Antiquity: but ther is one, &amp; indeed but one argument which the seperation principaly stand vpon, &amp; that is the covenāt which say they if it be āswered they must ned<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

For we proclaime against them as they proclaime against their owne mother England: That the Seperation the yongest &amp; the fayrest daughter of Rome, is an harlot: For as is the mother so is the daughter: Now furthermore we desire the Sepera. &amp; al men that they would not im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pute vnto vs vntruths, &amp; condemne the innocent without cause: For we disclayme the errors commonly, but most slaunderously imputed vnto vs: we are indeed tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the world as Atheists by denying the old Testament &amp; the Lords day: as Trayters to Magistrates in denying Magistracy: &amp; as Heretiques in denying the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Christ: Be it knowne therefore to al men, first that we deny not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old Testament, but with the Apo: acknowledg them to bee inspired of God &amp; that wee have a sure worde of the Prophets wherevnto wee ought to atend as vnto a light shining in a dark place: &amp; that whatsoever it written aforetyme is written for our instruction, that wee through patience &amp; comfort of the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res might have hope: &amp; that wee ought as Christ counselleth to search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old Testament, as the men of Berza did, bicause that in them wee may find everlasting life, &amp; that they do testifie of Christ: This wee beleeve according to these Scriptures.

   <p>Thirdly, concerning Magistrates, we acknowledg them to be the ordinance of the L. that every soule ought to be subject vnto thē: that they are the ministers of God for our wealth: that we ought to be subject vnto them for conscience sake: that they are the ministers of God to take vengeance on them that do evil: that we ought to pray for thē that are in authority: that we ought not to speake evil of thē that are in dignity: nor to despise government: but to pay tribute, tol, custome, &amp;c. &amp; that acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to these Scriptures, Rom. 13.1-7. 1.
