      </head>
      <l>WHen I perus'd thy smooth and lofty straines,</l>
      <l>In this thy <hi>Search,</hi> th' invention of thy brains,</l>
      <l>Thy curious language with thy pleasing stile,</l>
      <l>How thou dost praise the honest, lash the vile:</l>
      <l>And how thy verses meet, how neatly pointed,</l>
      <l>How cleanly limb'd, and how exactly joynted;</l>
      <l>I could not but commend them; all may see</l>
      <l>That Nature hath been prodigall to thee.</l>
      <l>The best of wit is thine, 'tis still thy bent</l>
      <l>To shame the shamelesse, cleare the innocent.</l>
      <l>Thou dost in all, so lively act thy part;</l>
      <l>Mine eyes did brive mine eares to steale my heart.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Thou hast not borrow'd what was at a stand,</l>
      <l>Nor tooke up fancies at the second hand;</l>
      <l>Nor vamp't an old conceit; nor didst thou sit</l>
      <l>To stuffe in empty words, in stead of wit.</l>
      <l>Thy wealthy winged raptures breathe delight</l>
      <l>To modest minds; thy end is to affright</l>
      <l>All from those odious sinnes: thou hast displaid</l>
      <l>The various wayes how Young lings are betraid,</l>
      <l>Not like to those that sufet with their bayes,</l>
      <l>Whose names are far more lasting than their praise.</l>

      <l>The ancient Poets live in thee agen,</l>
      <l>To adde a lasting glory to thy pen.</l>
      <l>Grace beautifies thy parts; but why didst hide</l>
      <l>Thy worth so long? 'cause thou wouldst not be try'd,</l>
      <l>By this decrepit age? rich is thy rime;</l>
      <l>Thy wisedome speaks thee old, before thy time.</l>

      <l>Whose tongues are dipt in the infernall lake:</l>
      <l>The best will honour thec; and thou shalt finde</l>
      <l>Their breath perfum'd; thou art not turn'd with winde,</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>I thought to chide, but this is all I'le say</l>
      <l>Thou camst behind, to steale the wit away.</l>
      <l>But I forgive thee: for I doc discerne,</l>
      <l>Conceited Witts may come to thee and learne.</l>
      <l>Though of our name time should the ruine be,</l>

      <l>Is for the most part laid to rest.</l>
      <l>They only, whom black night applauds,</l>

      <l>WHen I took pen in hand to write of thee,</l>
      <l>An ague took my joynts, no part was free:</l>
      <l>I would thee and thy Work with praise commend,</l>
      <l>But that I knew not when to make an end.</l>
      <l>I thought again some pall'd conceit would fall</l>
      <l>Into my quill; then not to write at all</l>
      <l>I thought it best; but by and by again,</l>
      <l>Me thought I had a fancie in my brain.</l>
      <l>With that my barren Muse began to spring,</l>
      <l>She somewhat needs would speak, &amp; this's the thing.</l>

      <l>How richly is thy Muse adorn'd, that she</l>
      <l>Can sound out things that thou didst never see!</l>
      <l>She hath reveal'd the plots of hell. By kinde</l>

      <l>To be supprest by hard relentlesse stones.</l>
      <l>So full of fancie, deck'd with rich conceit,</l>
      <l>Is all thy Work, by measure, and by weight:</l>
      <l>I thinke that by it daily many a one</l>
      <l>Will be reclaim'd when thou art dead and gone.</l>
      <l>He that doth read thy booke, will hate the evill,</l>
      <l>And speake thy praise, unlesse it be a devill.</l>
      <l>So much is found by thee, that all may say,</l>

      <l>Preventing all that may be thought or said</l>
