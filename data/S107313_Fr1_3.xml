   <head>The Aucthors
Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a little booke
for my comfort
sake, certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute
sentences, the better so
to commit them to memorie;
I haue also disposed them as
into a plesant orchard, set out
with all sorts of trees, and bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with al varieties of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
flowres, where-into I might
now and then enter both for to
chuse and behold at my neede
such matter as my hart desires
for the refreshing of the minde,
grieued at anie time, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with pensiuenes.</p>
   <p>Now the more cleerlie, and
readilie to finde vnder which
arbor I might repose my selfe,
or which floure were best to be
culled out, I haue made the
<pb facs="5"/>
heads of euery Chapter to glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(as it were) with red titles.
I haue likewise with varietie of
words, as nowe talking, nowe
reasoning, praieng nowe, nowe
conferring, now in mine owne,
now in another mans person,
bewreathed about the text
with a sweete, and delightsome
stile.</p>
   <p>Wherefore I entreate them
whosoeuer shall reade it, first
that they be not moued with
indignation at that which the
writer hath doon, for it was his
minde wholie to talke (with his
God.) Next, that theie wil par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the imperfectiō, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the stile, considering that
God is more delighted with
words that be simple and pure,
than with those that be artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall.
And if happelie the sense
in anie place appeare either not
sounde, or not cleere enough,
<pb facs="5"/>
my desire is to haue a godlie
corrector of the same, telling
him withall, that what fonde
matter soeuer he shall espie, it
hath escaped from me not of
purpose, but rather for that I
was not heedie enough in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
what I writ.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, forasmuch as man
in that iudgement of his which
is most probable, maie be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued,
vnto thee, ô God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie,
and father of lightes,
doo I thine humble disciple
make recourse, and this Sole-talke
(of mine) doo present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy diuine Maiestie, to the
ende that thou maist both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
the things well said, and
disproue what is doon amisse,
and insinuate also either into
my selfe, or some other faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
seruaut of thine, more
rightlie to obserue whatsoeuer
things are offensiue.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
My request is also, holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that I thy poore seruant
may obtaine at thy hands both
time and space to abide in the
all plentifull pastures of the
Scriptures, which be and shall
be my chiefest comfort, vntill
that daie of aeternitie appeere,
and the shadowe of mortalitie
doo decline awaie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
withdrawe thou fro me all
vnprofitable cares, worldlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
hurtfull affections, and
what else may hinder mee fro
my desired leisure. For he must
haue a free minde and a quiet,
that would meditate of hidden
and heauenlie matters. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that I maie be worthie to
attaine my sute, vouchsafe thou
(my God) to endue and fill me
with the grace of thine hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
ioie, that I maie speake
to thy glorie, and to some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of my owne soule.</p>
