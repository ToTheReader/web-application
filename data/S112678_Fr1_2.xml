   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Curious Superstition of Ancients in old times, desirous
with too great Affectation to know Fortunes and Aduentures, caused them to
inuent and discouer an infinite number,<note place="margin">Diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinations.</note> or manner, of diuinations, or deuises for the same. As
some by the foure elemēts, whereof came the <hi>Geomantie, Piromantie,
Hidromantie</hi> &amp; <hi>Areomantie:</hi> Others by Animals, whereof came the
<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spices, Augures,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aruspices:</hi> Others by Idolatrous
Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherof proceeded the <hi>Arioleans, the Pythonisseans,
Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, Vaticinateurs,</hi> false Prophets, &amp; such like: Others
haue taken Argument or matter of Diuinatiō vpon the shape or delineaments of
man, whereof proceeded the <hi>Physiognomie, Metoscopie,</hi> and
<hi>Chiromancie:</hi> others by Constellation and Superstitious Annotations
of Signes, and the houses Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, portending generally thereby things
to come; as also par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly vpon the natiuitie of any person, the
course and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of his life; Some also by numbers, whereof came
a sort of <hi>Pithagoriques:</hi> and some by the Letters of the Alphabet,
or Poeticall verses, as the <hi>Homeriques</hi> and <hi>Virgilians:</hi>
O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by Figures, Caracters, and Inuocation of spirits, as <pb facs="3"/>
Magicians, Necromancians, and the Caballe of the Iewes. Besides a number of
waies and meanes by men and euill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the most part of which hath
beene most curiously sought and published by the <hi>Rabelays</hi> in
his <hi>Pantagouelisme.</hi> And although that iestingly, as mockes, hee
puts them out, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thelesse hee speaketh not without a purpose
and meaning. There is also yet another kinde of diuination that hath beene
vsed,<note place="margin">The Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of lots.</note> and that is by lottes,
the which hath not beene deemed so ill and pernicious, as those aboue
named. For wee may finde that some of the auncient fathers did vse to
cast lots for the finding out of matters in question and doubt: And it is
also found in the Ancient law, that <hi>Iosuah</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a lot to
discouer him that had broken the Commandement of God, which lot fell vpon
<hi>Acan,</hi> who confessed the fact, and was stoned to death.
Likewise <hi>Saul</hi> vsed a lot, by the which he knew that
<hi>Ionathan</hi> his son had made publike offence, for the which he wold
haue put him to death, but the people saued him. The lot also fell on
<hi>Ionas</hi> in flying from the Lord, who was thrown into the Sea and
receaued by a Whale. And Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> was called and Elected by a
lot to be an Apostle. And yet neuerthelesse, such kinde of lots, though
the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vsed them, is now iudicially reprooued and forbidden by
the Canon of the Church, for that it might in time, grow to superstition,
such as that the faithfull might erre, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come idolatrous to the breach
of the first commandement of God. But now againe to returne to our purpose;
I finde that besides the said diuinations and lots, the ancients had diuers
playes and Inuentions of <hi>Fortune</hi> for recreation &amp; pleasure,<note place="margin">Plaies fortune.</note> more then for any certainty or beleefe of
trueth they had in them, the which were called plaies of Hazard and Aduenture:
as these; The <hi>Tessarae, Talorum,</hi> or <hi>Taxillorum,
Doctohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron</hi> and <hi>Dodecahedron,</hi> the forme and fashion of the
figure <pb facs="3"/> being sundrie according to the diuersity of the play:
Not onely in the forme and squares of the dye, but likewise in the markes
thereof. For in some there was prickes, or points, in other nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
figures, in some letters, and in some entire words, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
Signes. For I haue seene the play called the Dodeche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, marked with the
twelue Signes of the Zodiaque, in the throwing whereof they were perswaded of
some truth or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine euent to their demaund. But I will not so
perswade you. Because it cannot bee so, that these sports of lots,
dice, or such like things of chance which we vse, can bee such or like
those which the ancients vsed, which they termed Tessara and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum,
notwithstanding that the forme and figure be the like. And yet I am
perswaded that then with them, if there had not bin more matter of effect
then in these we vse, they had not beene so curious, nor vsed them so
much. For it is found writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen in the life of the Emperour <hi>Claudius
Caesar,</hi> that he was so affectionated thereto, they caused to bee
made, or himselfe made a booke thereof. Also <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>
was blamed for too much spending his time thereabouts. <hi>Plato</hi> in his
dialogue of the Republique, doth there so esteeme or extoll his play of
Talorum, that hee maketh comparison of it to the life of man. Therefore I
will not take vpon mee to shew you the manner of Octohedron, an Dodecahedron
as the ancients v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them. For I must freely confesse vnto you, I am
ignorant thereof. But for this play called Dodechedron of fortune,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the play called Dodeche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron.</note> It is the
meere inuention of one Master <hi>Iohn de Meum,</hi> one of the most famous
French Poets of his time, the which hee dedicated and presented to King
<hi>Charles</hi> the fift then King of <hi>France,</hi> as I found by an
Ancient Superscription in the booke, when first I found it in a librarie of
a friend of mine, who as well for the antiquitie, as the raritie of the same
made great account thereof, keeping it being a written <pb facs="4"/> booke euer
secret to himselfe, vntill that ouercome by my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest he was content to
let it come abroad, &amp; for that we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the knowledge and direction of
the die being strange, and the authors direction therein; wee were forced to
seeke by the frequent communication of manie Doctors, for the vse and
discouerie thereof. The which by the onely industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labour and learned
Search of the worthie Master <hi>Iohn Moreau,</hi> Signieur of
<hi>Monliger,</hi> both the vse of the dye, and manner of the booke was
found, as hereafter. Then first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Authour Master <hi>Iohn de
Meum,</hi> it is knowne that he was one of the most famous in the practise
of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematickes and Philosophie of his time. And so concerning this
his booke hee hath proceeded therein according to Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, diuiding the
questions into twelue chapters answerable to the twelue houses
celestiall, directly obseruing the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and significations of
them: for euerie chapter or rather house, hee hath propounded twelue demaunds
or questions. And the booke contayning twelue replies or answeres to
eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one, so that the Questions are in all <hi>144.</hi> And the
answers are to them in all <hi>1728.</hi> If I should hereupon take
occasion to describe vnto you the Significations and properties of the
ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall houses, and what planets raigneth in them, it would be
superfluous, tedious, and nothing at all fit or appertaining to this Subiect.
It onely a little shall suffice mee to giue a taste concerning the twelue
houses. And to begin with the first house which is called
<hi>Horoscope</hi> Angle of the orient <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> doth signifie
the beginning of life and workes. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Succedent,</hi>
signifying goods, trafficke, riches, and other things necessary for life.
The third is termed <hi>Cadent,</hi> of the <hi>Ascendent,</hi> portending
Brothers, Sisters, cosens, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, associates, Iudges, prelates, and
such like. The fourth is called the Angle of the earth, and so hath his
signification to <pb facs="4"/> fathers, possessions, houses, hid
Treasures, and things secret. The fift house <hi>Succedent,</hi> being
good fortune, signifying sons and daughters, and their inclinations,
Embassadors, Messin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and profit to bee had by husbandrie or land.
The sixt house is called <hi>Cadent</hi> or euill fortune, noting
banishment, seruitude, sickenesse, false accusations, and false
witnesses. The seauenth house is the Angle of the <hi>Occident,</hi>
signifying mariages, quarrels, warre and things lost. The eight house
<hi>Succedent,</hi> the house of death, doth signifie sorrow, troubles,
long torments, poysons, and qualities of death. The ninth house
<hi>Cadent</hi> of the orient Angle, the house of God, doth signifie
voiages, nauigations, faith, religion, ceremonies, diuinations, dreames,
prodigies, and presages, of diuine punishment. The tenth house called the
heart of the heauens, or the Meridionall Angle, signifieth honour, dignities,
gouernment of Kings, and great men. The cleauenth house being
<hi>Succedent,</hi> Meridio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or the good Angle signifieth loue, companie,
good Aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, fauour, aide, and succors. The twelft and last house,
called <hi>Cadent</hi> meridionall, or the euill spirit, doth signifie and
denote Enemies, prisonings, Captiuities, vengeances, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, deceauings,
horse to sell, and a consummation of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons inquired for, which
twelue houses the Ancients of olde time compiled together in these verses
following, 
<q>
         <l>Natus, Vinci, Fratrem, Filium, Infernus, Vxorem,</l>
         <l>Mors, Ambulat, Regnat, Fortuna, Incarceratur.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>And thus it appeares that the Authour hath apropriated his
questions to the propertie and qualities of these houses, the which are
very cunningly found by meanes of this dye, called <hi>Dodecaedron</hi> or
Dodechedron. By the which in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this sport is as subtil and
ingenious, as the points of the geomancy. And that you may the better
vnderstand the fashion and manner of the dye, it is a geometricall bodie,
composed <pb facs="5"/> of twelue faces, or sides, which are
<hi>Pentagones</hi> directlie equal, for otherwise it would neuer fall
perfect:<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>he forme
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>f the Die.</note> the which sides
or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces must bee ioined together close and equally, as in the Figure
following heere vnder appeares, the which cut in squares and then ioined
together, carrying the one peece to the other, the body, called
<hi>Dodecaedron</hi> or <hi>Dodechedron,</hi> will bee a geometricall figure,
like vnto the lesser peeces heere vnder.</p>
   <p>
      <figure>
</figure>
   </p>
   <p>This figure <hi>Dodechedron</hi> was much celebrated among the
Ancients, comparing it vnto the round circle of the world or heauens. For like
as in it is contained twelue Signes, diuided in <hi>360.</hi> degrees, so
this <hi>Dodechedron</hi> is composed of twelue faces, <hi>Pentagones,</hi>
euerie one of which doth part or diuide it selfe into fiue
<hi>Isopleures,</hi> or triangles. Then those againe subdiuided into
six <hi>scalenes,</hi> which are triangles vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall; Added together make
iust <hi>360. Scalenes.</hi> And thus being performed, this must be
obserued, for making the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers on the dye, which is, that euer the
<hi>2.</hi> sides opposed containe thirteene together, so that if the
vndermost bee marked with eight, then the vppermost must be fiue: if with
nine, then the other with foure: if with twelue, then the otherwith one, and
so of the rest.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">The order of the play</note>And now let vs
beginne to shew you the order of the play, which will bee verie easie to
doe, if you but obserue and marke <pb facs="5"/> the directions. Therefore you
must first note that there is twelue leaues, vpon the which are twelue
chapters containing the questions which any one may enquire for, being
diuided into twelue spaces. Now if you desire to know the answere or
fortune of any of the said questions, then obserue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely in which
of the said houses your demaund is in: for euery of the said leaues are
numbred at the top: then you must obserue which of the spaces you haue
chosen, for they bee numbred in the margent: then keeping in your memory the
said <hi>2.</hi> numbers, first of the house, then of the question;
with these two num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers resort to the table, which on the other side is
prepared for that purpose, being square containing twelue diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or
spaces both waies, which is <hi>144.</hi> spaces in all. Then you shall
find another particular number written, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at the vpper corner on
the left hand, &amp; goes down thwart to the lower corner on the right hand,
continuing his number to twelue, which are the numbers of the twelue houses.
So that first seek among these numbers the number of the house where
your question was, and there set your finger or marke it wel: then remember
your second figure as I told you before, which is the number of the space
in the houses chapter, that your demaund is in. And with this beginne at your
number where you held your finger, and what number soeuer it bee you must
call it one, and so tell forward the squares toward the right hand, vntill
you haue told to the number of your questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or so manie squares, as
the number of your question was; Saying, <hi>1. 2. 3. 4.</hi> and so forth,
for you know the number of your question cannot exceede twelue. Now if it
chance that the house be in the middle of the square, as is the figure
<hi>6.</hi> or <hi>7.</hi> and that you haue told to the end of the last
Square, you must then goe on to the other end of the same space,
continuing your telling vntill you come to the number of your question, I
meane, <pb facs="6"/> to tell so many roomes or squares, as the number of
your question was. So that if your number were the <hi>5.</hi> or <hi>6.</hi>
you must tell <hi>5.</hi> or <hi>6</hi> squares from the number, counting
it for one, till you come to your number, and there now againe rest your
finger,<note place="margin">The vse of the dye.</note> for that you haue done
with the first square. And now for your chaunce throw the dye
<hi>Dodechedron,</hi> and marke truly what number stands vppermost on the
dye. And then in the table where you held your finger, say one, telling
downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the spaces, as before you did thwart or side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies betweene
the lines, and so continue telling vntill you come to the number that was on
the dye. And if you come to the bottome before you haue your number, goe vp to
the vpper end in the same space, continuing your telling till you come as
is said, to the number on the die. And there in that square, where your
number ends, marke the number or figures that you finde there, for that will be
the number of the leafe or folio, where the answere of your demaund stands.
And the number that was vpon the die, is the number of the verse in that
leafe, which will answere directly your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>As for example.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I haue chosen the seauenth house which pretendeth
Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and there the fift question, which you shall find to be this
following.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Whether there be cause of Iealousie or no.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Here now you see as I told you before, the seauenth house,
and the fift questoin. Now goe vnto your table for the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth house
which you shall finde marked in the square ouer seauentie nine, and now
proceeding sidewaies towards the right hand, call this Square of <hi>79.</hi>
but one, then tell <hi>91.</hi> for <hi>2.</hi> then <hi>103.</hi> for
<hi>3.</hi> then <hi>115.</hi> for <hi>4.</hi> then <hi>127.</hi> for
<hi>5.</hi> which is the number of your question. And now vpon this number 
<pb facs="6"/> put your finger, and throw the die <hi>Dodechedron,</hi> which
chaunceth with eight vpon the top. And now againe beginne at your finger, or
the number <hi>127.</hi> descending downewards, telling <hi>127.</hi> for
<hi>1.</hi> then <hi>128.</hi> for <hi>2.</hi> then <hi>129.</hi> then
<hi>130.</hi> then <hi>131.</hi> then <hi>132.</hi> for <hi>6.</hi> then being
at the last, goe vp to the top to <hi>121.</hi> for <hi>7.</hi> and
<hi>122.</hi> for <hi>8.</hi> which is the number you seeke for, therefore
goe to the leafe <hi>122.</hi> the <hi>8.</hi> verse which is there thus.</p>
   <p>122 
<q>
         <l> Be not Ielous nor misdoubt not thy wife,</l>
         <l>For shee shall be true all daies of her life.</l>
      </q>
8</p>
   <p>By this example the rest are easily practised to answere
you truly your demaund. But how direct I cannot say, for the intent is only
for pleasure. So that if by chaunce it hit right and say true, yet adde not
the more beleefe, for it is vnpossible but that in so many questions
and replies, some must hit. And if also it be apparant amisse, be not
offended, for the intent is only for pleasure. And concerning the strange
words which are at the top of euery leafe. I know not the meaning nor what
language they are, hauing found them in the first originall from the Authour,
so that I esteeme them inuented words, rather then to signifie any
import. And because I so found them I haue set them downe, least any
other might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce finde more in them then I can. And so with my
la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for thy pleasure, and my good will to thy acceptance, </p>
   <closer>Inter Vtrumque, <hi>I rest.</hi>
