      <hi>Although the Authour (gentle Reader) by publishing this his Treatise so late,
<note place="margin">This is spoken of the first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> may seeme to haue obserued no oportunitie of time; yet I can assure thee, that it was two yeeres since readie for the presse, and much against his will hath all this while, vppon some occasions, been differred. But seeing that the Oath is still proposed by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and by some few also (who feare more the losse of a Temporall, then an eternall estate) taken, and moreouer defended; he
<pb n="412" facs="211"/>shall not be like to that Phisition, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth Phisick after the disease is cured, but rather to him, who expecteth till the disease cōmeth to maturitie and ripenesse, that so shewing it selfe more euidently, he may apply the better remedie. Receaue it therefore (how late soeuer it come) and vse it for thy good, according to the Authours desire, and sincere intention.</hi>
