With all sinceritie and dutifulnesse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating this my labour vnto your Wor. and wishing that as many of you are known to be patterns of good and godlie life; so the rest may take example by you,
<pb facs="3"/>to frame themselues to a well disposed course: and if besides example they want instructions, this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise may serue to leade them vnto vertue. For you that doe alreadie knowe that this worldlie pleasure is onely good in this respect, to serue as a spurre to prick you forward to the search of true felicitie, whereunto euery one is inclined; it may helpe to confirme your minds and settle them, that they be not shaken by anie stormes or assaults that vice can make. To the weake it may be as a staie, and to the strong a comfort. And albeit I confesse, it might by diuers haue beene hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with more elegancie and finenesse of phrase: yet thus much I will auerre, that I haue done it faithfullie, and trulie, according to the meaning of the Author, though in plain termes. And for my selfe, as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ende of my labour (next vnto your Wor. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and commoditie) was the common profite of my countrey menne: So do I nought expect from them but thanks; and from your Wor. that this my labour may be as fauourablie accepted of you, as it is freelie offered: and so do wish you here in this world a prosperous successe in al your enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises, and in the world to come, the fulnesse of all ioy and blessednesse.</p>
