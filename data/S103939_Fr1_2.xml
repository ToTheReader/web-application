   <head>TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT <hi>MAIESTIE.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost Gracious and most sacred Soueraigne, It is not without diuers reasons, that I haue not boldly made a Dedication to your Maiestie, of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise put foorth for the good of your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties subiects, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing so much neede to be strongly armed, now, while as (like vnto a weake Barke vpon a raging sea) it entereth on the Theater of the World, to speake of the peace and vnion of the holy Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, amidst so many furious Giants of contradiction as are now in the Church of God: This heauenly voice of Christian harmony hath neuer bin heard, but followed with a malignant <hi>Echo</hi> of proud and vehement Spirits, <hi>qui pascuntur syllogismo sicut boues feno,</hi> who delight to feed vpon Disputes as Oxen
<pb facs="3"/>
on hay, in such a desperate Paroxisme, that they will not lose the reputation of one crooked syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme for the peace of whole Christendome, yet the world doth neuer want some <hi>Phaenix,</hi> who is content to burne her earthly fame to ashes, in that pure fire of Christian loue, to bring foorth some seedes of peace: So that I do expect no other, but to heare my cries contumeliouslie re-echoed, that my conceptions of the reconciliation of Rome shal be esteemed not only Paradoxall but smelling of atheisme, and that my proiects for perfect vnitie in matter of Ecclesiasticall policie and ceremonies within your Maiesties kingdomes, shalbe said to be a craftie and cunning preparation for superstition to re-enter into the Church, of which vnchristian oblatration, the first <hi>alarmes</hi> haue been sounded in my eares so hardly, while my Copie was newly deliuered to the presse, that I would haue retired it if I had bin one of those, who liue in the aire of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular applause, as in their naturall element, &amp; who (like to <hi>Narcissus)</hi> will rather die for loue of their owne image, then suffer one blow for so noble a common cause. But when I consider how many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious calumnies our Sauiour and his Apostles did suffer, for plantation of this peace of the Gospell, I hold it a mans truest commendation and comfort, if for the sake of the same he may say with S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, that he fought with beasts in the maner of men.</hi> Seldome is it indeed that goodnes is made the scope of our actions, and in this corrupt age, this vpright vertue of pacification hath neuer bin seen vpon the stage, but waited with an infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Genius,</hi> wee may witnesse those sweete in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, of <hi>Cassander,</hi> of <hi>Erasme,</hi> of <hi>Iunius,</hi> of <hi>Paraeus,</hi> of <hi>Causabone,</hi> and other Pacificators: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely I thinke it is a sillie vertue, that for so braue an end, cannot in the conscience of an honest deed, with a sterne countenance out-face a guiltie Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator, for such a Treatise as this can neuer be altogether fruitlesse, if it were but to giue aire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for discouering and venting of malicious humors that lurke in ill affected men. And howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the matter shall worke, two things did migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily encourage me, first knowing that vnder the godly and gracious Reigne of your Maiestie, in whose eares Moderation and Wisedome do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly dwell, an <hi>Aristides</hi> will be permitted to breath freely without feare of <hi>Ostracisme</hi> or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: Next, the priuate testimonies which I haue had of the presence of Gods holy Spirit, to informe and to confirme my conscience, whiles I did labour about these, do giue me great hope that they shall haue sufficient auctoritie with good men, to purge me from these vglie and odious as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persions. And therefore, for the first I did rather chuse to betake my selfe to the candor and nobility of my cause, &amp; to the patience of those benigne and blessed Spirits, who haue mooued before me this diuine argument, <hi>de amahili Ecclesiaconcordia,</hi> then presumptuously to thrust in your Maiesties bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some my hazardous endeauours, the chiesest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection whereof must be, to be acceptable of God, whiles they are vngracious to men. Alurements to Chatholike pacification, Inducements to absolute
<pb facs="4"/>
vnitie within the Church of this Ile, Defence of the Orthodoxall policy of the Church gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Apologie of the most lawfull authoritie of my soueraigne Prince, Perswasions to so worthy and so deare a Nobleman, to vendicate himselfe from the bondage of Idolatry, and such like sacred theames as be treated heere, are able to preserue my reputation from blemish or suspition, vnlesse that Archiecalumniator the Iesuite doe edge his bloody pen against me, who seeing hee doth not spare to bend his murthering tongue against your Maiestie, who is the Mirror and Miracle of the world, his malediction or malscription can procure nothing but glory to such as I am. The second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of my non dedication to your Maiesty is, that, although, it be <hi>ingens materia, superba inscriptio,</hi> a most stately and glorious subiect, to write of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian harmony, yet it commeth in my hands, as an excellent Lute to vnskilfull fingers, in which res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect I knew my paines to be vnworthy of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, as also by reason of my base and humble stile, which flieth low, <hi>inter aues palustres,</hi> and is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of those Aquiline penns, which can soare neer vnto the Sunne. Thirdly, I did not wish that any peintured dedication to your Maiesty should hide the true face of my labours, and make that to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steened mercenary which is most sincere. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the whole treatise it selfe is no other then a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of my deuotion to your Maiesties seruice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of the most cleane and costly peeces, that I could chuse to offer, all tending to perswade your Maiesties people, that the prosperity of the Church
<pb facs="4"/>
and the felicity of this kingdome haue no sure fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament now, but such a firme coniunction, as doth reserue, no sparkle, color, nor pretext of seperation hereafter. If that Great King out of the conscience of his Tyrannie and proud ambition did say in his time, that he was none of his, who did not fauour the Monarch asmuch as <hi>Alexander,</hi> how much more need haue Princes now adaies, that we should all insinuate, vrge, write, preach and crie, that he is not an vpright Subiect, who doth not loue both the Royall person and the Royall Maiestie, in these dangerous times; while as a spirituall ambition hath so poysoned the soules of men by this <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mique</hi> Theologie of the Iesuite, who presumeth, as it were to Metamorphose nature, and superinduce a new face vpon the World, spiritualising the grounds of State, and temporalising the condition of Religion, making Popes absolute ouer Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narches, and vsing Kings like to the Shepheards dogs, who are beaten and chased away, when they are not vigilant and barking to his pleasure; that it is to be feared, lest in time (if the oppositions were wanting which are made by your Maiesty) the iudgements of men should become <hi>Pyrrhonicall</hi> and <hi>Problematicall,</hi> as if there were no truth in things but all were indifferent, as if it should be as easie for them, hauing once subiugat the temporall power to the spirituall, to refine S. <hi>Peter</hi> and by a new Alembication to make him Monarchall Priest and Monarchall Prince ouer the whole vniuerse: And seeing this discourse containeth a discouerie of those abominable maximes, which Hell it selfe
<pb facs="5"/>
hath vomited to prepare the spirits of men to shake off the diuine yoke chiefly of your Maiesty, Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes (alas for pity) whereof when we consider the deplorable euents, that partly haue come to passe, and partly haue been shot at, what <hi>Clements,</hi> what <hi>Chastels,</hi> what <hi>Rauilliacks,</hi> what pouder Traitors, they can neuer be sufficiently charactered, but with teares of blood: These I hope will suffice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Dedicatory intercession to make your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties eyes propitious and fauourable ouer my faithfull sacrifice of peace and vnity, that none of these Rauenous foules shall haue any power to spoile it, or to trouble my oblation; And lastly since by your Maiesties Gracious permission, I am to publish these, for a triall, of what true Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and true wisedome is in the hearts of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Subiects, I haue not neither sent them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, but presidiat with the fauours of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and vertuous Prelate whom your Maiestie hath worthily preferred to be the chiefest <hi>Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> and Pilate in the shippe of the Church. God grant in his mercy, that they may teach your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties people, to draw their light from no other Sunne but from your Maiestie, and that they haue nothing before their eyes, but Gods true worship, the glory of this great and fortunate Ile, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of your Maiesties person and crowne, and the stability of your most Royall succession.</p>
