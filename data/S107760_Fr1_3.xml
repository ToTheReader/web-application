   <p>To apply this to my present purpose: A man that shall seriously poize and
<pb facs="4"/> ponder the life of <hi>Origen,</hi> as he is thoroughly described by <hi>Eusebius</hi> in many chapters: by <hi>Pamphilus</hi> the Martyr in his Apologies for him: by Saint <hi>Jerom</hi> the translator of many of his workes, the trumpet of his Fame, and admirer of his learning, chiefly in his Apologie against <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> and in his Epistles to <hi>Pammachius,</hi> and to <hi>Ocean:</hi> by <hi>Erasmus,</hi> the Collecter, Corrector and Censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of his labours; in his Preface before his first Tome: by <hi>Grineus</hi> and <hi>Rhena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> the Heralds of his Prayses, and defenders of his vertues, in their Epistles to their friends prefixed before <hi>Origens</hi> workes. He that shall seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lustre and eminencie of his gifts, the promptnesse and dexteritie of his wit, whom the great Critick, <hi>Erasmus,</hi> compares with the chiefe and choise wits of Rome, Athens, Italy, or all Graecia, able so to swimme without a corke, that he attained to the perfection of Artes without a Teacher and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: of memory so tenacious, in vtterance so plausible, in elocution so fluent, in discourse so readie, in apprehension so quicke, in vnderstanding so deepe, in dispute so subtill; besides the perfecting of his naturall parts by Art, so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute a Logician, so eloquent a Rhetorician, so profound a Philosopher, so deepe a Mathematician: that euen his enemies, <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> and other Heathens and Heretickes could not but applaud and approoue him: but aboue all, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite a Diuine, that Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> in his Prologue before his Homilies vpon <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> feares not to call him the Master of the Church, after the Apostles, (that howsoeuer in some places he doe sharpely taxe his errors,) yet in his Preface vpon his Questions vpon <hi>Genesis,</hi> hee wisheth himselfe to haue that knowledge of the Scriptures, which <hi>Origen</hi> had, together with the enuie of his name. <hi>Athanasius</hi> withall esteeming of him, as singular and laborious, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vsing his Testimonie against the Arrians, <hi>Socrates lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. Hee that shall consider him withall, so laborious, that (except the necessarie times of his parsimonious eating, and moderate sleeping, for refreshing of nature) he was continually imployed eyther in reading, conferring, disputing with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, Catechizing, Preaching, writing, or dictating (in which he was so copious, that daily dictating as much as seuen Scriueners could write, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting on all the Scriptures; besides other Tractes in positiue and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Diuinitie, with many things in Humanitie, writing as much, saith Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> as <hi>Varro</hi> amongst the Romans: the number of his bookes comming to seuen thousand volumes, (most of which are perished:) I say, hee that shall seriously consider these excellent mixtures of Nature, Arte and Grace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in this one man, together with his excellent zeale and sanctity of life, that many times to the ieoparding of his owne life, he would incourage, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and kisse the Martyrs as they went to their deaths: hee himselfe so desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of Martyrdome, that besides his incouragements to his Father <hi>Leonides</hi> (the first Martyr in <hi>Decius</hi> his time) he would needs be martyred with him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen when he was a childe, if he had not been restrained: the graces of God euen in those yeeres so budding out in him, that oft when he was asleepe his Father would bare his brest, and kisse it, as being the lodge and the Temple of the Spirit of God: as Master <hi>Fox</hi> notes, <hi>Part.</hi> 1 <hi>Martyrol. pag.</hi> 49. out of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> and <hi>Antoninus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>He that shall truely and dexterously compare these many and manifold gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="4"/> of this <hi>Origen,</hi> with his infirmities; his drosse with his gold; his falls and slips with his vertues; the errors of his iudgement, in broaching, holding, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending so many vntruths, bundled vp by <hi>Osiander</hi> and other Authors; chiefly the Heresie of the Millenaries<note n="m" place="margin">Osiana.

Let vs rest and rely vpon the Lord, and not vpon man: let vs not make flesh our arme, nor trust to the reed of Aegypt; for he that rests on man, rests but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a broken staffe, a staffe of reeds: he that builds on man, builds vpon a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, vnsure and clay foundation; man being but clay, a blast, a bubble, a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, a winde, whose breath is in his nostrils.</p>
   <p>And thus much, according to our first proposed method, for the subiect or matter vsefull, which is historicall.. Now I desire, without preiudice of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixitie to Apologize for the manner (which perhaps will bee more excepted) being Poeticall; for the lawfulnesse or laudablenesse of Poetrie, if I should speake much, I should call in question that which is not controuerted: if I should spend much in the praise of it, I should write <hi>Jliads</hi> after <hi>Homer:</hi> since

For first, since it hath pleased the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, to indite and pen some of the holy Oracles in Numbers, as the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> the booke of the Psalmes, the Prouerbs of <hi>Salomon,</hi> his Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astes and Canticles, &amp;c. Secondly, Since our Sauiour himselfe makes the Psalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi> one part of the Scripture, diuiding the whole into the Law and Prophets, and booke of Psalmes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.44. Thirdly, since some of these Numericall Scriptures, so pleasingly, so plentifully and powerfully, in that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated, sublime, and refined stile and straine, describe the great and glorious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God, as Psal. 103. <hi>The Mercie of God: Iob</hi> Chap. 37.38.39.40. <hi>The Power, Glory and Maiestie of God shining in the creatures; the Leuiathan, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noceros, the Lion, &amp;c.</hi> Ecclesiastes Chap. 12. describing the approching of old Age, as other Scriptures other things in as apt similitudes, in as sweet meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors, yet in a greater heate and height of spirit, and sweetnes of eloquence, then either <hi>Virgil,</hi> or <hi>Homer,</hi> or <hi>Tully,</hi> or <hi>Demosthenes</hi> euer attained vnto. Yea, fourthly, since the holy men of God, vpon speciall mercies receiued, of ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or preseruation, to the better exciting and stirring vp of themselues and others, haue praised God in spirituall songs and holy Hymnes, as <hi>Moses</hi> and the Israelites deliuered from <hi>Pharaohs</hi> pursuite, Exod. 15.1. <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Baruch</hi> after their victorie ouer <hi>Jabin</hi> and <hi>Sisera,</hi> Iudges 5. <hi>Iudith</hi> and the Elders of Israel, for the ouerthrow of <hi>Holofernes: Dauid</hi> and all his host, after his foure great last battels ouer the Philistims, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. <hi>Moses</hi> in his Cygnae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or Swan-like song, as also that good old <hi>Symeon,</hi> a little before their deaths, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.19.22. and 32.1.2. &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.29.30.

Then sure who euer speakes against Poetry, in it selfe and owne nature, is either witlesse or wicked, wanting either a sound braine or good heart, in so much that I may say, like other parts of learning, it hath no enemies, but either the ignorant or malicious.

Thus, I know, it may be abused; so may the best blessings of God, women to vncleannesse, wine to drunkennesse, as indeed they both are by the <hi>Ers</hi> and <hi>Onans,</hi> and the <hi>Baltazars</hi> of our dayes: licencious men, whose belly is their god, and whose goddesse is <hi>Venus;</hi> so may meate to gluttony, yron to wounds, or vnlawfull blood-shed: Tobaccho from a Physicall vse, to a vaine phantasticke, hume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous abusiue profuse prodigalitie: Apparell to pride and luxurie: Wit to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiuillian policie: Authoritie (as <hi>Ahabs</hi>) to crueltie: Magistracie to Iniustice and briberie: the Artes and tongues, sophistically to colour Schisme and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie: so all the rest of Gods creatures, blessings, graces, to superfluity, pride, arrogancie, vanitie, villanie, and the most egregious iniquitie.</p>
   <p>Euen so I say of Poetrie, because many vaine vicious men abuse it; some, euen of the sonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> doe prostitute it as a Baude to sensualitie: may it not therefore be moderately vsed (as a man lawfully his marriage) for the forming and framing the diuiner issues of his soule, and the mentall concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his vnderstanding? Yea indeed, the more that the world abuseth this, the more are they to be applauded and approued, that seeke to refine it, and bring it to the true vse: like as <hi>Erasmus, Melancthon, Agricola</hi> and others, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue well of all posteritie, for refining the Latine tongue in Belgia, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rusted, and barbarously corrupted by the inundation of the Gothes and Vandals.</p>
   <p>I know not what more can iustly be obiected against me: vnlesse, first, the grauitie of my place and function, in intermedling: or secondly, my defects in handling: or thirdly, my enlarging and adding more in the Poeme, then is in the Prose, Greeke or Latine. For the first, if any aske or maruell, as once, why <hi>Saul</hi> amongst the Prophets? so now, why a Preacher amongst the rancke of Poets? To stoppe the mouth of this exception, I might answere, that one Swallow makes no Summer, nor one action a habite, to giue a denomination to the doer, no more then to play one straine of a Lute, make a professed Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian. Secondly, if to Poetize were a disparagement, then the grauest Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines that euer the world had, are culpable. For to omit the Poems of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> Prophets, of <hi>Salomon</hi> a Preacher, before specified; haue wee not the Poems of many of the Fathers<note n="q" place="margin">

   <p>Now is Poetry commendable in them, worthy of their paines, their parts, their spirits, worthy the grauity, the greatnesse, the graces, the places of those eminent men, famoused Diuines, great Schollers in their places or graces: and shall it be culpable and blamable in me, or any other in my Ranke, to bee employed in this course and kinde?</p>

   <p>Thirdly, if any obiect that I haue exceeded my bounds and limits, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king so great a fire or smoake from so small a sparke; adding so much in ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauating the sinne or sorrow of <hi>Origen,</hi> in so many circumstances, more then was either done or said: herein I take that <hi>Licentia Poetica</hi> (as they call it) which both <hi>Virgil</hi> vsed in his <hi>Aeneidos; Statius</hi> in his <hi>Thebaidos: Homer</hi> in his <hi>Iliads;</hi> and our <hi>Spencer</hi> (our English <hi>Homer</hi>) in his <hi>Fairie Queene;</hi> yea, which the exquisite Poet <hi>Siluester</hi> vseth in his <hi>Dubartas;</hi> and in his owne little <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bartas,</hi> running all descants and Poeticall diuisions (in this best minde musick of numerous versifying) from some positiue, reall (or else only fictious or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie) grounds: and indeed, as <hi>Virgil</hi> makes his <hi>Aeneas, Homer</hi> his <hi>Achilles</hi> and his <hi>Ʋlysses,</hi> but images and patternes of a martiall Worthie, and a wise Polotitian, <hi>Zenophon</hi> his <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the patterne of a true Prince: <hi>Tully</hi> his <hi>Orator,</hi> the rule of Oratory. So I desire onely in my aymes and ends, that my <hi>Origen</hi> may be a patterne and a president of a true penitent.</p>
   <p>In which aymes and hopes resting; crauing pardon for my prolixitie (the paines being mine (Ingenious Reader) as well as the patience thine, my er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror being an error of loue, not a loued error:) desiring the God of all Grace,<note place="margin">Error ex amere, non ex more.</note> euen he that is the Author of euery good gift and grace, who giues repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance vnto Israel<note n="m" place="margin">Acts 5.31.</note>: that who euer reades this, hauing committed any sinne against conscience, either actually in his conuersation, or subscribed to any Popish vntruthes (for feare, or sinister respects) against the light of his knowledge, and the illumination of his iudgement, imitating <hi>Origen</hi> in his horride sinne, may much more imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and exceed him, in his happie, speedie, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Repentance: which hoping, and for which instantly praying; I rest.</p>
