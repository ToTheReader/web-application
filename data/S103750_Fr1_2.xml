   <p>AFter that I had cōsidered the great &amp; horrible blasphemy presently commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted agaynst the holy institution of the supper of Iesus Christ, In the steade wherof to vs is proposed a thynge that is fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and found to the great dishonor of Iesus Chryste and of his churche, we haue obteyned thys present boke of the author for to declare the ignoraunce and simplicitie of many. And to put away the abuse &amp; presūpcious assertion of other. But for as much as the said treaty is submitted to the iudgement of all persones, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge whom is great varyaunce in gyuynge sentence at a blusshe, as wyllynge to esteme of the porcion as of the hole boke. But fyrste to reade it al through, vnderstande it, and examin it, and that by the holy scripture, by the which al thyng ought to be ruled, estemed and weied and than to iudge Or els as sayeth the Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consulte in the treaty <hi>De segibus.</hi> It is a thing inciuile wythout to haue seen all the lawe to iudge or answere to a parte therof. Also saynt Hilary in the boke of the <hi>Trinitie</hi> desired that it shoulde not be condempned before that they had read that whiche he had wrytten, and also not to haue regard to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fautors of the errours whyche are here vanquished. For as sayth the Cann. suspect .iii. quest. The foes and aduerse parties ought not to be iudges, by meane wher of it is necessary they learne to iudge them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and as before god, estemyng that the same is veritie, after the which we shalbe al iudged by Iesus Christe from the hygh estates to the lowe.</p>
