   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst other vanities and vexations of spirit, Solomon observed <hi>all travell, and every right worke, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour, Eccles.</hi> 4. 4. And against this kind of worke of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the Scriptures, there have at all times beene Carpers and Opposers, of whom Gods Labourers have complained. To me therefore it is not strange, that being the least of Gods servants, and having so many ignorances and infirmities, such things have befallen mee. And had the exceptions beene against my labour onely, I would have made use of them, and kept silence: but when the Adversarie (besides the wounds which thorow my sides he giveth unto many worthy men) striketh at the very Text it selfe, so weakening our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith, I could not but speake, and helpe to remove the stumbling blockes, whereat the ignorant might be offended.</p>
   <p>There are above eight hundred words in the Hebrew Bible, which have marginall readings, differing from the words in the line, some of great and good use in all translations, other some of speciall use for the Hebrew Tongue and Grammar. The words in the line have usually the prickes or vowels of the words in the margine, and so the marginall words are noted to be read. Some have judged this to bee a corruption of the Text through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or oversight of the Seribes that wrote out Copies, whiles Printing was unknowne: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>thers of better judgment (as I suppose) esteeme both line and margine to bee of divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
   <p>Vpon this occasion, difference and seeming contrariety sometimes are to be seene in trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, while some follow the line, some the margine, as they thinke best, and sometime note <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap>th, yea, and translate both as the authenticke text: and the same Interpreters (revising their owne labours) doe change the one for the other, otherwise than they did at first. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

      </gap>gine, <hi>If shee please not her Master, who hath betrothed her to himselfe:</hi> The ancient English
<pb facs="456"/>
in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 51. readeth, <hi>Which sheweth great salvation for his King:</hi> The Geneva, and our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test version read, <hi>Hee is the tower of salvation for his King.</hi> In <hi>Iob</hi> 6. 21. the Geneva saith, <hi>Surely now you are</hi> like <hi>unto it,</hi> following the Hebrew margine: but our late version, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the line, rendreth it thus, <hi>For now yee are nothing</hi> (or <hi>are nos.)</hi> In 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 11. the Geneva version, following the margine, saith, <hi>the chiefe among thirtie,</hi> as the Greeke also of old translated it: our latter Bibles respecting the Hebrew in the line, say, <hi>the chiefe of the Captaines;</hi> which may be confirmed by 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 8. In <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. the Geneva translating the line, saith, <hi>and to seale up the sinnes:</hi> our new version, according to the Hebrew margine, giveth it thus; <hi>and to make an end of sinnes:</hi> yet noteth in the margine, Or, <hi>to seale up;</hi> and sundry the like. Examples in the same translatours, are these. Tremeilius and Iunius, who joyntly laboured in setting over the Hebrew into Latine, and are esteemed among the best; in their first Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, following the margine, say, <hi>Abi, dic ei,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Goe, say unto him, thou maist certainly recover, 2 King.</hi> 8. 10. but Iunius in his latter worke, chuseth rather the line, saying, <hi>Abi dic non,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Goe say, thou shalt not certainely recover.</hi> So in <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 2. their first version hath, <hi>&amp; eidem sacrificamus; and we sacrifice unto him:</hi> the latter thus, <hi>non enim</hi> (alteri) <hi>sacrificamus; for we sacrifice not</hi> to any other: that, according to the margine; this, to the line. In 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 20. it was first rendred, <hi>erat{que} nominatissimus, and he had a name</hi> among these three: in the last edition, <hi>Sednon</hi> (fuitei) <hi>nomen, but he had no name</hi> among these three. In 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 48. they first followed the margine, <hi>Iehoschaphas paravit classem, Iehoshaphat made ships:</hi> afterward Iunius keepeth the line, <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphato decem</hi> (fuerunt) <hi>naves, Iehoshaphat</hi> had <hi>tenships:</hi> and sundry other of like sort, where the latter version differeth from the former, by reason of the difference betweene the line and the margine in the Hebrew Text.</p>
   <p>These things, not commonly knowne, may cause the Readers to marvell and be offended at such varietie and seeming contrarietie, both in these and other common versions set forth in vulgar tongues: for no traslation almost in any language, but followeth sometimes the one, and sometimes the other; and afterward sometime varieth from it selfe, upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. Now I, (without prejudice to any of better judgement) setting downe both, as the Reader may see, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 8. <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. 21. and 25. 30. and otherwhere: and according to the measure of knowledge which God hath given me, endevouring in the Annotations to cleare the Scripture of that seeming contradiction, am publiquely taxed, as setting downe that which the Hebrew hath not; as making <hi>God like unto Ianus Bifrons, the Idoll with two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces, to looke two divers wayes at once;</hi> with other like hard imputations: and this diversity of writing and reading, is from the authoritie of some late Rabbines, said to arise <hi>from corruption, confusion, doubting and uncertainty of Scribes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
   <p>I will set downe the reasons of my contrary judgement, without purpose of further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; let the discreet Reader approve of what liketh him best.</p>
   <p>If those divers readings, which the Hebrewes call <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Cethib,</hi> be corruptions of the Scripture, they have beene many of them done voluntarily and purposely, as is apparant to all of understanding that looke upon them. For beside that the <note n="*" place="margin">

Besides that those words in the line, have there &amp; usually the pricks or vowels of the words in the margine, after which they were read.</p>

So that whether we respect the latter, or the most ancient Translators, we shall finde these marginall readings to be many of them regarded as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentike text: and if we may not refuse them all (except we will goe against all that ever inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted Scripture) what warrant have we to condemne any, being all of like authority?</p>
   <p>
      <q>Object. <hi>But if these translate according to the margine onely, or according to the Text onely, then doe they afford unto us not both the divers readings, but one onely, &amp;c.</hi>

   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> Were it so, that they never yeelded us but one onely, yet seeing they take that one sometime from the Text in the line, but most commonly from the margine, it may teach us not to reject those marginall notes, as the Rabbines fictions; unlesse we will say, that all men, in all ages, have delivered the Rabbines traditions in stead of the pure Word of God. And it would be known of this Excepter (for he hath not shewed his minde) whether he would have men alwaies to follow the word in the line, or that in the margine, or to take that which they thinke best of either, and to condemne the other; and what warrant men have so to doe. But many of the best translations doe afford us both, if not in the line (which is not easie to be done) yet by an <hi>or</hi> in the margine, as may be seene in our last Englished Bible, where in many of the places before alleaged they doe by a marginall note compared with a line, give vs a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and sometimes (in seeming) a contrary reading: and the like (though perhaps not so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently) is done by Bibles in other languages. Yea sometimes (when both readings may be joyned in one) they doe give us both jointly for the Text of Scripture.

      <q>Object. <hi>many Hebrew Bibles want thes readings you speake of; as that by Sebast. Munster; the great Edition by Plantine; those by Rob. Stephanus, Raphelengius, and R. Isaak bar Shim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>on: so that we may say with as good reason as you, that the Hebrew hath them not.</hi>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> It followeth not, because some have printed the Bible without these marginall notes, therefore they were not in the originall Copies. Some of our latter small English E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions have none of the marginall notes, or signification of both readings: to say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Translators affixed no notes of those divers readings, (as in the former Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be seene,) were to doe them wrong. 2 Many Hebrew Bibles are printed also, and heretofore written without any prickes, vowels, or accents: if wee shall hereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, therefore the Hebrew hath them not, and they are not of Divine authority; we mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Iewish Rabbins greatly, in accepting their expositions for Scripture. For all men that know that tongue, know also, that without the vowels and accents, many words and senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may otherwise be interpreted than they are. And all Translators in all languages doe now follow the Hebrew as it is vowelled. 3. The Editions spoken of by Munster, Plantine, and the rest, such of them as I have seene, have the vowels which properly belong to the words in the margine, and agree not with the words in the line, as in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 25. and 10. 27. and 18. 27. and many other places, which argue those bookes to be unperfect, which have vowels to be read with consonants that are not expressed, or fit for them. 4 If the marginall readings be omitted, some Scriptures will not easily be read with any true and perfect sense, as in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. 42. 16. five cubits,</hi> for <hi>five hundred:</hi> so 2 <hi>Chron. 11. 18. 1 King. 12. 33. Psal. 22. 17. 1 Sam.</hi> 4. 13. and other like, which no Interpreter that ever I saw hath expounded without the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. 5 Munster (who is first named) omitteth not the marginall readings wholly; for in the Hebrew Bible which he set forth with his Latine version and annotations, there hee conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth both line and margine in his translation, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 13. and 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 48. and often he expresseth both the line and margine in his Hebrew, and translateth after the margine, as in 2 <hi>Sam. 23. 18, 20, 21. 2 King.</hi> 19. 31, 37. and elsewhere.</p>
   <p>
      <q>Object. <hi>But the Massorites Bible have a thousand superstitions more, which by like warrant are there recorded unto us as divine traditions, &amp;c. The Thalmudists also have another vile pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, their</hi> al tikri, <hi>in changing and altring the reading of the Scripture according to their lust, as in Gen. 2. 4. Psal.</hi> 3. 7. and 68. 18. &amp;c.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> It cannot be shewed (for ought that I know) that ever the Iewish nation received the other Masoriticall notes, or the <hi>al tikries,</hi> for part of the Canon, or text of Scriptures, as they have done all the bookes of the old Testament, with the <hi>Keries</hi> in the margine, which they reckon 848 in number. Neither can it be shewed that Translators old or new, have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them for divine Scripture, as I have before shewed all of them to have translated the <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> or marginall readings in very many, yea in the most places. Neither are those notes and <hi>al tikries</hi> approved by the Holy Ghost in other Scriptures, as sundry of the margina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>l rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings are before shewed to be. Neither have the Thalmudists, or any Iew (to my knowledge) put the <hi>al tikri</hi> for the word in the Text: but leave the Scripture intire as it is, &amp; give the other but as their glosse or exposition, after that their manner of phrase, which is not to be approved. And the Massorites many notes, have their Grammaticall use for the Hebrew tongue: though the Bible is perfect without them, and translations in other languages neede them not.</p>

      <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This reason (if it be of weight) woundeth not me alone, but thorow my sides, all ancient and latter Interpreters, that have read, noted, or expounded some of them, as is formerly manifested; for none hath ever read or noted them all. Though this be no excuse for me, wherein I have done amisse.</p>
   <p n="2">2 Those marginall readings doe many of them concerne the Hebrew tongue and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, which however they may be of great and good use for the Hebrewes, and such as know that tongue; yet are they not of such use in other languages. When <hi>Arjeh</hi> a <hi>Lion,</hi> is noted to be read <hi>Ari</hi> a <hi>Lion,</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 20. it sheweth in the Hebrew tongue an agreement with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 22. where it is written onely <hi>Ari:</hi> but in other tongues which write the name of a <hi>Lion</hi> but one way, it hath not such use. When <hi>Shenajim</hi> (in <hi>statu absoluto,</hi> as Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans call it) is noted to be read <hi>Shene</hi> (in <hi>statu constructo,) 2 King.</hi> 17. 16. both which in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish signifie <hi>two,</hi> which word with us varieth not the forme as doth the Hebrew: when <hi>Anu</hi> is by the margin to be read <hi>Anachnu</hi> in <hi>Ier.</hi> 42. 6. both which in our language signifie <hi>Wee:</hi> when <hi>in the night, Lam.</hi> 2. 19. is by the letters in the line <hi>belel,</hi> and by the vowels and margin <hi>ballajlab,</hi> both which signifie one thing; and many the like; as in 1. <hi>King</hi> 18. 5. and 19. 4. and 21: 8. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 12. and 11. 20. and 15. 25. <hi>Esay</hi> 54▪ 16, &amp;c. these differences may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably observed by them that know that first tongue; but in other speeches cannot so be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. So the order of the Hebrew Alphabet is set downe of God in some Psalmes, and in Ieremies Lamentations: which when the Hebrew is turned into other tongues, will not so appeare. And thus <hi>Hotse</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 17. being to be read by the vowels and margin <hi>Hojtse, bring forth; Gojim, nations,</hi> being written in the line with <hi>jod,</hi> and read in the margin with <hi>vau,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 23. and sundry the like; because they so specially belong to the Hebrew tongue, and vary not in our English, I have therefore omitted to speake of. And if this reason be not of weight, let me beare my deserved blame: but let not the booke of God be accused of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And let the judicious and learned Reader judge of that which hath been said.</p>

      <head>Of the Hebrew Records.</head>
      <p>WHiles the Iewes Common-wealth did stand, they had besides the writings of Moses and the Prophets, (which were of Publike and Divine authority) other civill Monuments, and private Records, (as all Kingdomes for the most part have,) for their use; some of which are mentioned in the holy Scriptures, <hi>Ios. 10. 13. 1 Kin.</hi> 11. 41. and 14. 19, 29. But those ancient stories are now lost; some that were written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the times of the last Prophets, and the Apostles, yet remaine; as the two bookes of the Maccabees, and that which Iunius calleth the booke of Simeon (others, the third of the Maccabees,) the writings of Iosephus, Philo, and the like. When the second Temple was destroyed by the Romans, and the Iewes Common-wealth overthrowne, and their people scattered, about the yeere of Christ 150. R. Iudah hannasi began to gather the private wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, notes, records and observations which were in the hands of the Doctors of his time, and to compile them in one volume: others after him added moe unto them, with their own Commentaries; which worke they called the <hi>Thalmud,</hi> or Doctrinall. In which they have recorded the practise of the Law from old time, in their Common-wealth and Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their understanding: but so, as many Iewish fables, vaine traditions received from their fathers, and false expositions of the Scriptures, are mixed with other things of better note and use. The Thalmud called <hi>Ierusalemi,</hi> was finished about the yeere of our Lord 230. and the other called <hi>Babeli,</hi> about the yeere 500. according to the Canons and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions whereof the Iewes live to this day. These longsome volumes were after abridged by Moses sonne of Maimon, (called Maimony, and Rambam) who lived 1200. yeeres after
<pb facs="460"/>
our Lords birth; and he set downe in plainer Hebrew, the expositions, canons and traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according to which they had interpreted the Law of God given by Moses, and practised the same: omitting the discourses, fables, disputes, &amp;c. wherewith the Thalmud is re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>erced And this Maimony is of such esteeme among the Iewish nation, that of him it is said, <hi>From Moses</hi> (the Prophet) <hi>to Moses</hi> (sonne of Maimon) <hi>there was none like this Moses.</hi> Other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors they have, some ancient as the Chaldee paraphrasts, of which Ionathan that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the Prophets, is reported to be the Scholler of Gamaliel, at whose feet our Apostle Paul learned the Law: and Onkelos who paraphrased on the Law, was not long after him. Their latter Writers follow for the most part the Thalmuds: and notwithstanding the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fables and falshoods that are found generally in them, yet for the many good things and probable truths which from elder daies they doe record, they have beene and are regarded of Christian Writers heretofore, and at this day: that of them it is said, <hi>When they doe well, they are the best Expositors; and when they doe evill, they are the worst.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Now whereas I have alleaged many of their interpretations, especially from the Greeke and Chaldee, and Maimony the chiefest of esteeme among them; I am for this blamed, those Writers generally condemned; and to make them the more odious, their heresies, fables, falshoods are displaied, by him, that from two or three late Rabbines, and one Papist, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted against the sincerity of the Hebrew Text, as before is to be seene. I will not speake of the things by me noted, but leave them to the judgement of the indifferent Reader; nor justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my selfe for all their allegations, because they being taken from that confused heape of the Iewes traditions, some of them may haply savour too much of their leven: They that have laboured in this kinde before me, have had their second thoughts, &amp; altered both their own Annotations and translations in sundry points, as their publike writings manifest. But that such a generall censure should passe upon them all, (for my sake) and the Wheat should bee plucked up because of the Tares, seemeth not to proceed from love, nor from, a sound judgement.</p>
      <p>And first, the esteeme which all Christian Churches have had, and yet have, of such books of the Iewish Rabbines as were written in Greek, and so came to be knowne more easily than other Chaldee and Hebrew workes, might somewhat allay the rigour of this sentence. For the storie of the Maccabees, Ecclesiasticus, Wisdome, and the other Apocryphall writings of the Iewes, notwithstanding the evils in them, have beene, and are translated, commented upon, and commended to be read for instruction.</p>
      <p n="2">2 Other of the Rabbines, as the Thalmud, Maimony, and the like, have beene also by Expositors of the Scriptures (and those of the best esteeme) occasionally alleaged: as Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius in his notes upon his version of the New Testament out of Syriak, sundry times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth them. Beza in his large Annotations on <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. noteth from Iosephus, Paulus Burgensis, Tremellius, and Scaliger, sundry rituals of the Iewes about the Passeover, and some such as I am taxed for, because I name them on <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. Vatablus often recordeth the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of the Chaldee and learned Hebrewes. And how many other have done the like in their Notes and Commentaries, all men of learning and reading doe well know.</p>
      <p n="3">3 To object the Iewes heresies, fables, and false expositions of many Scriptures, is no sound reason to condemne the good things which are found in them. For even among Christian writers (and those of the ancients) sundry such things are to be seen: yet many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable things are found in them for the opening of the Scriptures. In the Apostles daies the Iewes were guilty of these sinnes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. and 23. chap. <hi>Rom. 10. 3. Tit. 1. 14. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 16. Yet Christ commanded to heare the Scribes &amp; Pharisees sitting in Moses chaire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 1, 2. Now the eare trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat, <hi>Iob</hi> 34. 3. and as by hearing their speeches, the godly wise might discerne when they taught according to Moses, and when they spake of themselves; so by reading their writings, men of understanding may doe the like at this day.</p>
      <p n="4">4 The Apostles also in alleaging sometimes the testimonies of the Rabbines, doe teach us that their writings are not wholly to be despised. Paul nameth <hi>Iannes and Iambres</hi> the chiefe sorcerers of Egypt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 8. out of the private Records of the Iewes, as may yet be read in their Thalmud. He rehearseth the persecutions of the godly under Antiochus, recorded in the booke of the Maccabees, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35, &amp;c. Others speake of the contention between Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael and the devill, about the body of Moses; and of the prophesie of Enoch, <hi>Iude v.</hi> 9.

      <p>I Will onely annex a few words about a place of Scripture, for the interpretation whereof I am specially blamed. It is for expressing the Hebrew <hi>Iahalom,</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 18. by the Greeke name <hi>Sardonix,</hi> as I understand the Holy Ghost to expound it, in <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 20. I am asked for <hi>proofe or shew of proofe, that Iohn did translate all the 12. stones from Aarons breast, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
               <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
            </gap> the heavenly Ierusalem,</hi> (in Rev. 21.) and am charged with <hi>presumption in obtruding my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits upon the Holy Ghost, and taking the name of God in vaine:</hi> &amp; it is affirmed, that <hi>Iahalom</hi> should be translated <hi>the Adamant or Diamond, according to the example of the best Translators both new and old.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>All men of any reading doe know how diversly those 12. stones in <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. are expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Interpreters, that scarcely any two agree together; if then among many I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where missed in interpreting them, it might be imputed to humane infirmity, rather than to <hi>presumption,</hi> especially seeing I ground my exposition upon that other Scripture, <hi>Revel. 21. My proofe, or shew of proofe,</hi> that the holy Ghost there translateth the 12. stones from <hi>Exod</hi> 28. is this:</p>
      <p n="1">1. The continuall course of the Spirit of God throughout that booke of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which is to take matters, words and phrases, from Moses and the Prophets, and apply them to the things there prophesied. As in <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. the Church is described from the ancient fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure the Tabernacle of Moses, and from the visions of other Prophets, <hi>Esai. 6. Ezek.</hi> 1. The number of 24. Elders, according to the lots and divisions of the Priests and Levites by Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 3,—19. and 25. 7,—31. The foure living creatures answerable in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to the foure standards in the campe of Israel, <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. in shape, to the living creatures, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. Christ is shewed like a Lambe slaine, according to the sacrifice under the old Testament. In <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. Gods administration is set forth by the similitude of horses and riders, as in <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. and 6. and with such judgement as the Prophets threatned of old, <hi>Esai.</hi> 34. 4. In <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. Gods people are sealed on their foreheads, according to <hi>Eze.</hi> 9. 4. and the twelve tribes of Israel are expressed by their names. And so in other things throughout that booke, as the studious Reader may observe, which for brevitie I will now omit. If then the whole tenour of that Revelation be to prophesie of matters from former types and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, it is consonant and proportionable that the like is done in <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.</p>
      <p n="2">2. And that 21. Chapter foretelling the restauration of the Church, after the fall of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, and withall (as the best Expositors have opened it) of the calling againe of the Iewes, according to the prophesies of old, and of our Apostle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. it is not likely, but the holy Ghost, who throughout those visions, and in matters concerning the Gentiles, alludeth to the old Testament, would much rather doe the like where he prophesieth of the Iewes.</p>
      <p n="3">3. Many particulars in that Chapter confirme this; as when the Church is called by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      <p n="4">4. It will not be denied (I suppose) by men of under standing which compare the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that these last visions of Iohn have reference in many things to the last visions of Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. As the gates of the Citie have their names of the tribes of Israel, which there are expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, one of <hi>Reuben,</hi> one of <hi>Iudah,</hi> one of <hi>Levi,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

         </gap> which Iohn saw, have at them the names of <hi>the twelve tribes of the sonnes of Israel, Rev.</hi> 21. 12. There, waters issue out of Gods house, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

So that the state of the Church there being described from Israel, and the possession of the tribes by name, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48. yeeldeth strong probability of the like al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions here; and consequently of the twelve precious stones, to the stones of the tribes, which are no where named but by Moses in Exodus.</p>
      <p n="5">5. And this the rather, because as Aarons ornaments were for glory and beauty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 2. so these stones are for garnishment to the foundations of the walls of the Citie, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 19. And the Tabernacle of Moses was walled (as we may say) with the twelve Tribes which compassed it in a square, <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. Now, seeing the Saints are compared to precious stones, <hi>Lam. 4. 1, 2, 7. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 5. unto what company rather than to the twelve tribes, described by their precious stones in Aarons Ephod, may we thinke hath the Lord reference in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.</p>
      <p n="6">6. Againe, seeing the <hi>names of the Lambes twelve Apostles</hi> are in the foundations of this wall, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 14. which Apostles are answer able to the twelve Patriarchs of the tribes, both in number (so noted by the Spirit of God, <hi>v.</hi> 12. 14.) and in propagation of the Church spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 15. Gal. 4. 19. 3 Ioh. v.</hi> 4. as the Patriarchs were fathers of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, both in the flesh, and in the Lord; and in government, as the other governed the Tribes, <hi>Psal. 45. 16. Matth. 19. 28. 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 19, 21. besides other things wherein they may be compared, it seemeth most fit, and according to the things both in this Chapter, &amp; whole Booke, that the precious stones by which these twelve foundations are described, should be answerable to the twelve precious stones whereon the names of the Patriarchs were graved, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. for there is no place else in the Scripture whereto they can have reference.</p>
      <p n="7">7. Moreover, there is in the Prophets another name of the <hi>Adamant,</hi> or <hi>Diamond,</hi> called in Hebrew <hi>Shamir,</hi> which is noted of the Holy Ghost to be hard, even <hi>harder than flint, Zach. 7. 12. Ezek.</hi> 3. 9. and to be of use for graving, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 1. so that the speciall things which mine Opposite observeth from <hi>Plinie</hi> an heathen writer, of the nature of the Adamant, are by the testimony of God found in this <hi>Shamir.</hi> And it is translated the <hi>Adamant,</hi> by consent of the most Interpreters both old and new, and by the Greeke version in <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 1. that if the voices of learned men may end this controversie, there be as many or moe for <hi>Shamir</hi> to be the <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi> than can (I suppose) be brought for <hi>Iahalom.</hi> And the same Prophet which useth <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi> for the <hi>Adamant,</hi> when he hath reference to the stones on the Ephod, retaineth the names in Exodus, &amp; the <hi>Iahalom</hi> among them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 9. and 28. 13. Wherefore if <hi>Shamir</hi> be the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew name of the <hi>Adamant,</hi> the stone <hi>Iabal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>m</hi> in <hi>Exo.</hi> 28. may well be another than it; and if another, where may we safer seeke it than in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. for the reasons before shewed?</p>
      <p>That which is alleaged for the contrary, from the notation of the word <hi>Iahalom,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of many Interpreters, and the like, hath (I confesse) probability; and were it not for the causes above shewed, I would thinke it to be the <hi>Adamant,</hi> though the notation likewise of <hi>Shamir,</hi> and agreement of Interpreters, may also perswade it to be the Adamant; and for <hi>Plinies</hi> testimony of the <hi>Adamants,</hi> that <hi>they are desired of engravers,</hi> it accordeth to this <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir,</hi> as we may learne of the Prophet <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 1. And for the price of the <hi>Adamant</hi> above the <hi>Sardonyx,</hi> or any gem, or <hi>other humane things,</hi> as the same Plinie reporteth, it will not (though so it be) end this question; seeing it is not necessary to conclude, that God would chuse the most precious thing to signifie grace in men, which have it but in part; especially, seeing hee putteth this stone not in the first, but in the sixt place, as the <hi>Iahalom</hi> is ordered in <hi>Exo.</hi> 28. 18. Yea, it is plainly without likelihood, that God would impart the most precious thing among the Patriarchs, and take it away from among the Apostles, (for it is sure, no <hi>Adamant</hi> is to be found in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.) This were to preferre the old Tehament before the New, the Law before the Gospel, Moses before Christ, contrary to the Apostles doctrine in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and to make

the <hi>holy Ierusalem, the Bride the Lambs wife,</hi> (which is said to have <hi>the glory of God,</hi> and her <hi>wals garnished with all manner of precious stones,</hi> and many other like excellencies, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 9, 10, 19. &amp;c.) to be inferiour in glory to Moses Sanctuary, and the earthly Ierusalem, and those that ministred in the same; which a man of sound judgement will not easily beleeve. And whatsoever <hi>Plinie</hi> saith of the preciousnesse of the <hi>Adamant,</hi> we are assured from God that the <hi>Sardonix</hi> is precious, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 19, 20. and Plinie himselfe confirmeth it, by the example of the <hi>Tyrant Polycrates,</hi> who so greatly esteemed the Sardonix in his Ring, that he valued the losse thereof, with all his wealth and felicity, which he confessed to be exceeding great, <hi>Nat.

      <p>The reason alleaged from <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 5, 8. that the tribes are there <hi>reckoned up by the Holy Ghost, with omission of Dan, otherwise than they are reckoned in any place of the old Testament;</hi> weakneth not, but rather confirmeth that which I have said. For as there is no new person put in stead of any tribe, or new name given to any tribe, but such as was given before in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: so neither is it likely that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. any other new stone should be placed, than such as agreeth with the description of Moses; so that the <hi>Sardonyx</hi> should be looked for in <hi>Exo.</hi> 28. among the rest. Againe, the omission of <hi>Dan</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. accordeth very well with the old Testament; for though Iosephs sonnes Ephraim and Manasses made two tribes, <hi>Genes. 48. 5, 6. Num.</hi> 1. 10, 33, 35. so that after a sort there were thirteene; yet the Scripture usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally nameth and reckoneth them but twelve, that the name of <hi>the twelve tribes</hi> is famous also in the new Testament, <hi>Luke 22. 30. Act. 26. 7. Iam. 1. 1. Rev.</hi> 21. 12. And when they are reckoned by the Prophets, one commonly is omitted; for either Ioseph is named in stead of his two sonnes, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. or if they two be mentioned, Levi (for his separation to the Lords service in the Tabernacle) is omitted, as in <hi>Num.</hi> 13. and often; or if both hee and they be expressed, some one of the other is let passe, as Simeon is unnamed in the blessing of the tribes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. Accordingly the Spirit of God in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. naming Levi, and Manasses, and Ioseph for his sonne Ephraim, was to omit the name of some other; unlesse hee should have counted 13. tribes, contrary to the course of the Scriptures, and scope of the matter there in hand. Why <hi>Dan</hi> is not named in <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. or <hi>Simeon</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. belongeth not to this question; it sufficeth that there is no new practise in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. differing from the Prophets; neither need we looke for any innovation among the precious stones, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.</p>
      <p>Thus have I, according to the measure of knowledge which God hath given me, and as the extreme infirmity of my body would permit, made answer to the chiefe matters obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, especially such as concerne the Scriptures, and may by them be decided. Other things wherein I have shewed either mine owne, or other mens judgement, I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about. Let not any thing which I have written be accepted without triall, or further than it agreeth with the truth. The learned which have interpreted and opened the Scriptures, have had their second thoughts, and altered both their versions and Expositions in sundry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>, as all men know but in part. For things wherein I have missed, I humbly crave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of God, and of his people; to such as have the spirit in them that lusteth after envie, I wish a better minde; to such as love the truth, encrease of knowledge and grace: and for ought that is good and profitable in my labours, the praise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be unto him that is Authour of every good gift and worke; the benefit thereof unto those that love his Name, which be blessed for ever,</p>
      <closer>Amen.</closer>
