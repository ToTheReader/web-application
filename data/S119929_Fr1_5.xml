   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VHEN I had finished this my collection of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes (gentle Reader;) and presented the same in writinge vnto my Lorde, presentlie before his Honour passed the seas into the lowe countries: I was after, earnestlie required by somme that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used the same, to haue it imprinted: whose reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste, when I had well considered, althoughe I did perceiue the charge was verie heauie for mee, (waighinge my owne weakenes) I meane my wante of learninge, and iudgement, to set forth any thinge vnto the viewe of this age, wherein so manie wise &amp; learned doe florishe, and must haue the scanninge thereof. Yet knowinge their fauours to bee such vnto mee, as in dewtie I mighte not denie them any thinge I can: I did rather choose to vndergoe any burthen, and almoste fainte in forwardnes to satisfie them, then to shewe anie wante of good will, in denyinge their continuall desires. wherefore, licence beinge ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for the publishing thereof, I offer it heare (good Reader) to thy viewe, in the same sorte as I presented it before. Onelie this excepte: That I haue now in diuerse places, quoted in the margent some sentēces in Latin, &amp; such verses as I thoughte did beste fit the seuerall matters I wratte of. And also haue written somme of the Emblemes, to certaine of my frendes, to whome either in dutie or frendship, I am diuers waies bounde: which both weare wantinge in my firste edition, and nowe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded herevnto, for these reasons insuinge. Firste I noted the same in Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, to helpe and further some of my acquaintaunce wheare this booke was imprinted, who hauinge no taste in the Englishe tonge, yet weare earnestly addicted to the vnderstandinge hereof: and also, wheare I founde any verse, or sayinge agreable with the matter, I did gather the same of purpose for my owne memorie, not doubtinge but the same may bee also frutefull to others.</p>
   <p>For my intitulinge them to some of my frendes, I hope it shall not bee misliked, for that the offices of dewtie and frendship are alwaies to bee fauored: and herin as I followe my auctors in Englishinge their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises, So I imitate them, in dedicatinge some, to such persons, as I thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the Emblemes doe best fitte and pertaine vnto, which order, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Reusnerus, Iunius, Sambucus,</hi> and others: as by their workes are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parante, Confessinge my faulte to bee chiefly this, in presentinge to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and worthie men, meane matter, farre to simple for their deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges: yet trustinge my good will shalbe waighed as well as the worke, and that a pearle shall not bee looked for in a poore mans purce, I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my doings herein to their censures.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, wheare there are diuers Emblemes written of one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which may bee thoughte superfluous. As against Pride, Enuie, Concupiscence, Drunkennes, Couetousnes, Vsurie, and such like,
<pb facs="8"/> againste euery one of them seuerally, sondrie deuises: thereby the sondry inuentions of the auctours may bee decerned, which I haue collected against those vices especially, bycause they are growē so mightie that one bloe will not beate them downe, but newe headdes springe vp like <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra,</hi> that <hi>Hercules</hi> weare not able to subdue them. But manie droppes pierce the stone, &amp; with manie blowes the oke is ouerthrowen, So with manie reprehencions, wickednes is wounded, and sinne ashamed and giueth place vnto vertue. It resteth now to shewe breeflie what this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Embleme signifieth, and whereof it commeth, which thoughe it be borrowed of others, &amp; not proper in the Englishe tonge, yet that which it signifieth: Is, and hathe bin alwaies in vse amongst vs, which worde being in Greeke <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, vel <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> is as muche to saye in Englishe as <hi>To set in, or to put in:</hi> properlie ment by suche figures, or workes, as are wroughte in plate, or in stones in the pauementes, or on the wau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, or suche like, for the adorning of the place: hauinge some wittie deuise expressed with cunning woorkemanship, somethinge obscure to be perceiued at the first, whereby, when with further consideration it is vnderstood, it maie the greater delighte the behoulder. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe the worde dothe comprehende manie thinges, and diuers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters maie be therein contained; yet all Emblemes for the most parte, maie be reduced into these three kindes, which is <hi>Historicall, Naturall,</hi> &amp; <hi>Morall. Historicall,</hi> as representing the actes of some noble persons, being matter of historie. <hi>Naturall,</hi> as in expressing the natures of creatures, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the loue of the yonge Storkes, to the oulde, or of suche like.<note place="margin">Pietas Ciconiae erga parentes.</note>
      <hi>Morall,</hi> pertaining to vertue and instruction of life, which is the chiefe of the three, and the other two maye bee in some sorte drawen into this head. For, all doe tende vnto discipline, and morall preceptes of liuing. I mighte write more at large hereof, and of the difference of <hi>Emblema Symbolum, &amp; Aenigma,</hi> hauinge all (as it weare) some affinitie one with the other. But bicause my meaning is to write as briefely as I maie, for the auoiding of tediousnes, I referre them that would further inquire therof, to <hi>And. Alciatus, Guiliel. Perrerius, Achilles Bocchius</hi> &amp; to diuers others that haue written thereof, wel knowne to the learned. For I purpose at this present, to write onelie of this worde Embleme: Bicause it chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie doth pertaine vnto the matter I haue in hande, whereof I hope this muche, shall giue them some taste that weare ignoraunt of the same.</p>
   <p>Lastlie if anie deuise herein shall delight thee, and if some other shall not please thee, yet in respect of that which doth like thee, passe ouer the same fauourably to others, with whome perhappes it maie be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re agreable: For what one liketh, an other oftentimes doth not regarde: and what some dothe lothe, some other doth chieflie esteeme: whereof came the Prouerbe, <hi>So manie men, so manie mindes.</hi> But what? Shoulde I thinke that my simple trauaile herein should scape scot-free from the tonges of the enuious, who are alwaies readie with a preiudicate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb facs="9"/> to condempne, before they vnderstande the cause. No? thoughe the verse weare (as I maye saye) written by the pen of <hi>Apollo</hi> him selfe? For in the former times, when the whole worlde was almoste ouersha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with the mantle of ignoraunce, If then, the learned and excellent worke of <hi>Homer,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Martialis.</note> could not shielde him from the stinge of <hi>Zoilus.</hi> If <hi>Marcus Varro,</hi> was taunted by <hi>Remnius Palemon.</hi> If <hi>Cicero</hi> had sixe bookes written againste him,<note place="margin">Textor in officin.</note> by <hi>Didymus Alexandrinus.</hi> And if <hi>Vergill</hi> weare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied by <hi>Carbilius,</hi> who wrat a booke <hi>de Virgilianis erroribus,</hi> which he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>Aeneidomastix.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Petrus Crinitus de poëtis Latinis.</note> and diuers others whose workes weare most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler, if they coulde not escape the bites of such Basiliskes broode: Then howe maye I thinke, in this time which is so blessed, generallie with most rare and exquisite perfection in all knowledge, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: that this slender assaye of my barren muse, should passe the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes without pusshing at: where thousandes are so quicke sighted, they will at the first, behoulde the least iote, or tittle, that is not rightly placed. And althoughe, perhappes it maie bee embraced a while, for the newnes thereof, yet shortlie it shalbee cast aside as thinges that are vnsauerie &amp; not esteemed. For the nature of man is alwaies delighted in nouelties, &amp; too much corrupte with curiousnes and newfanglenes. The fairest gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, wherein is greate varietie bothe of goodlie coulors, and sweete smelles, can not like all mennes fancies: but some gallant coulours are misliked, and some pleasant smelles not regarded. No cooke, can fitte all mennes tastes, nor anie orator, please all mennes humors: but wheare the tasters are too daintie, his cookerie shalbe controlled: and wheare the auditors are to rashe and careles in regarding, his Rethoricke shalbe condempned: and no worke so absolute perfecte, but some are resolute to reprehende. Yet trustinge the learned, and those that are of good iudgemente (whome I doe chiefelie desire to bee the perusers hereof) with indifferencie will reade, and then fauorablie yeelde their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicte. I offer this my worke, suche as it is, vnto them; wherein I hope the greater sorte shall finde somethinge to delighte them, and verie fewe of what age, or condition they bee, but may herin see some deuise, auns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werable to their inclinations; trusting they wil so frendly accept thereof, That I shalbe rather incouraged thereby, to assay some further matter, as soone as I shall haue leasure: then throughe their sinister interpreting of my good will, to discorage mee from the same, and to wishe I had not yet communicated this, vnto all: which I might haue kepte priuate to a fewe. Yet hereby I haue satisfied my frendes requestes, and haue in some parte discharged my dutie vnto them: Therfore if they shalbee well pleased with my paines, I shall the lesse care for anie others cauillinge. Thus wishing thee the fruition of thy good desires, I leaue thee vnto the same. At Leyden in Hollande, the 1111. of Maye. M.D.LXXXVI.</p>
