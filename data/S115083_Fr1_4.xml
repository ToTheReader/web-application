   <head>THE
PREFACE
to the Reader.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>CHRISTIAN READER,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the late dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Visitation,
when <hi>the waies
of Sion mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
because
none passed by
them;</hi> and the <hi>gates of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
lamented,</hi> because almost
none entred at them; Religion her
selfe for the most, forbearing the
Church, and keeping her closet, and
there finding sufficient employment
to complaine of, &amp; bewaile the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and desolation of her solemnest
assemblies: I fell into a serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the vse and most vrgent
necessity of <hi>PRIVATE DEVO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION.</hi>
And to the end I might
<pb facs="5"/>
accord with my <hi>brethren in their
groanes and cries,</hi> being smitten
my selfe with a dangerous (though
not infectious) disease; I gaue ouer
those <hi>waters of strife</hi> wherein I
had met with the <hi>Romish Fisher,
intangled in his owne Net;</hi> and
sought after the <hi>waters of Shiloah
that runne softly,</hi> which at that
season farre better relished with me
then the other. Not that I altered
my iudgement touching the studie
of controuersies, which (without all
controuersie) is not onely most neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but delightfull also to them
that are therein exercised.</p>
   <p>It is an easie taske, and almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
ones labour now a dayes to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
flowers of Paradice, and make
Posies, or Garlands of them for
Christ's Spouse. But it is not for
euery hand to meddle with those
<hi>thornie</hi> difficulties, which yet must be
carefully <hi>handled</hi> by them who will
make a strong <hi>hedge</hi> or sure <hi>fence</hi>
for the <hi>Lord's Vineyard.</hi> The more
perplexed, and intricate the difficulty
<pb facs="5"/>
is, the greater is the contentment in
beating out the truth in points of no
lesse consequence then difference.
Children are not so much delighted
with smiting flints one against the
other to see the sparcles, as mē of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
vnderstāding &amp; discourse, by
<hi>collision</hi> of contrary arguments, to
strike out the fire of diuine Truth.
And this fire as well as that other
which the naturall heate of <hi>Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
kindleth, yeeldeth much warmth
to the conscience euen of a dying
man. Witnesse <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi>
whose last words were these: <hi>Now
I goe cheerefully to the tribunall
of Christ, where it shall appeare,
that I haue not seduced God's
people, but haue sincerely taught
the truth of God.</hi> I might instance
likewise in <hi>Doctor Whitaker's
Cygnea Cantio,</hi> his <hi>swanlike
song</hi> before his death, wherein hee
warble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>h sweetely vpon those at this
day most <hi>Vexed questions</hi> of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
grace and freewill. And his
<hi>contemporary,</hi> the eye of the other
<pb facs="6"/>
Vniuersity, <hi>Doctor Reynolds,</hi> when
hee lay on his death bed, called for
<hi>Doctor Abbots</hi> (after the Lord
Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>) Reply to <hi>W.</hi>
Bishop, then newly come forth, and
heard much of it read vnto him
with great contentment.</p>
   <p>But being (as I said euen now)
<hi>out of tune</hi> in my body, I listed not,
nor in that <hi>shaking</hi> weakenes could
hold fast the peggs to streine and
tune the <hi>iarring strings</hi> of c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ntro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersed
opinions in point of Religion.
That which I then most desired, was
to settle my thoughts and affections,
and compose my soule to rest by liste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the <hi>sweete songs of Sion,</hi>
set to <hi>Dauids</hi> well-tuned harpe, and
runs vpon in exquisite <hi>diuision</hi> by
some of our excellent <hi>Asaphs</hi> in their
pious Treatises, Soliloquies, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Meditations, and Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
This heauenly musick so rani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
my senses, that I found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in the twylight, betwixt
the day of life, and night of death,
that inlightened thoughts affoord
<pb facs="6"/>
nothing like comfort to en flamed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
Now the oyle which feedeth
this sacred flame (next to the inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
holy Scriptures) floweth most
abundantly in Treatises of Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In which kinde of writings, the
Romanists for the most part exceede
in bulke, but our Diuines in weight.
The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (like <hi>Leah</hi>)
is more fruitfull; but her Deuotions
(like <hi>Leah</hi> in this also) are <hi>blea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed</hi>
with superstitiō. But the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our faith (like <hi>Rachel</hi>) is not
altogether so fruitful, yet she is more
comely, and beautiful, and I hope wil
be also here after as fruitful. Verily
if euer <hi>Priuate Deuotions</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
thēselus forth in brinish teares,
were in season, now they are. Neuer
losses so great to be bewailed; neuer
iudgements so fearefull to bee auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
neuer hearts so hard to be mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified;
neuer consciences so fowle to
be rinsed by teares as now. Nature
hath prouided a soueraigne remedy
against the sting of the Scorpion
in the oyle of the Scorpion. When
<pb facs="7"/>
thou feelest the sting, it is but <hi>brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Serpent,</hi> and rubbing it on
the place, and the moisture present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Serpent killed, destroyeth
the venome of that Serpent. I would
to <hi>God</hi> our soules were as deare to
vs as our bodies, and that we tooke
as much care for remedies against
sinne, as salues against enuenomed
wounds. Then would we, as soone
as we feele the sting of sinne in our
consciences, bruise the Serpent by
true <hi>contrition;</hi> destroy the sinne,
and apply the oyle of teares issuing
from it, to cure the wound before it
festered. But among other iust cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of teares, this is not the least that
wee misspend our teares, and spill
that heauenly dew, and profane the
<hi>Font-water</hi> of our second baptisme
(as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> calleth it.) Wee
haue teares at our owne will in
worldly losses; but none at <hi>God's</hi>
command for the losse of his grace.
Wee take on for the death of our
friends departing frō vs; but cannot
wring out a teare for the spirituall
<pb facs="7"/>
death of our soules departing from
<hi>God.</hi> Yet all our fretting and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
all our weeping and howling
cannot fetch our friend backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
or repaire our worldly losses:
whereas on the contrary (as Saint
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> piously noteth) <hi>the
afflicting of our soules, and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
bewailing of our sinnes, by
God's grace, shall reuiue our
soules, and recouer all our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
losses, and that with aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</hi>
What pittie, nay what folly
is it, to powre costly eye-water out
of a Venice-glasse into a vile pot or
basen to wash our feete withall? Do
we not the like, when we turne <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sorrow</hi> into <hi>worldly,</hi> and abuse
<hi>pretious</hi> teares to the bewailing of
<hi>vile</hi> &amp; base losses? haue we suchstore
of them? or such want of better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploymēt
for them? See we not wrath
is gone out against vs, and the fire
long agoe kindled, and not yet quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by our teares? <q>Lord, thou
hast <hi>shewed thy people terrible
things; thou hast giuen vs a
<pb facs="8"/>
drinke of deadly wine,</hi> and hast
caused vs to <hi>suck out the dreggs
of it,</hi> because we (<hi>Moab</hi> like) are
<hi>setled vpon our Lees.</hi> As <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
saw the hugh of his bloodie
minde in the <hi>waters of Aegypt
turned all redd as blood:</hi> so
we may see the crimson colour of
our <hi>sins</hi> in the vialls of thy wrath
powred of late vpon vs. We trade
not spiritually for the <hi>pearle of
the Gospell,</hi> and therefore our
Merchant's returnes faile. Wee
would not weepe for our sins, and
therefore the heauens did weepe
for vs a long season in continuall
showers. We haue bin hard hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and <hi>barren in good works,</hi>
and therefore thou madest here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
the <hi>heauen aboue vs as
brasse, and the earth</hi> vnder vs
<hi>as Yron.</hi> By drunkennesse and
gluttony, by euill perswasions
and worse examples, one soule
hath infected another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou hast sent a Plague
whereby one body infecteth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb facs="8"/>
Such a Plag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>▪ as our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
neuer heard of, and our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
will scarce belieue. The
chiefe of our Cities haue beene
ploughed vp, and sowed so thick
with dead corps's that one could
scarce lye by another. Against this
and all other iudgements which
thy law threatneth, and our sins
prouoke, wee haue no weapons to
contend with thy iustice but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and teares. We haue no meanes
to clense the infected aire but our
<hi>sighs and groanes. O Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
our sins as a clowde, and
iniquities as a mist,</hi> and then
this dreadfull bloodie clowde
which lately powred downe, but
now onely droppeth, will vanish of
it selfe. Consummate the worke
of mercy thou hast begun, and
quite remoue this iudgement
through thy tender compassion in
the <hi>bowells of Christ Iesus,</hi> wee
beseech thee. But remoue this
iudgement in mercie, not in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Take not thy hand off of vs
<pb facs="9"/>
to fetch a greater stroake at vs.
Deliuer vs not from one Plague
as thou diddest <hi>Pharoh,</hi> to send
a worse in steede thereof. Put vs
not out of <hi>thine hands into
which we are fallen, to giue vs
ouer into the hands of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
Saue vs not from the
Sword to kill vs with Famine;
neither preserue vs from a corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
to starue vs with a spirituall.
Take not away one plaister, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a smarter in the place; but
perfectly heale our wounds. Bee
absolutely <hi>reconciled vnto vs</hi> in
him, vpon whom thou hast alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>layed the chastisement of
our peace. O remember not
our our old sinnes, but haue
mercy vpon vs, and that soone,
for wee are come to great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.
Helpe vs, ô God of our
saluation, for the glory of thy
name; ô deliuer vs, and bee
mercifull to our sins for thy
names sake. O thinke vpon thy
congregation, and Mount
<pb facs="9"/>
Sion wherein thou hast dwelt.</hi>
Looke vpon the hands of many
thousands that haue beene lifted
vp to thee in Publike, and many
more in Priuate, to iustifie thee in
thy Iudgements, and blesse thee
for thy mercies, and intreate thee
for this Land, and thy disconso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Spouse yet weeping in teares
of bloud in diuerse places.</q>
   </p>
   <p>To strengthen and support the
weaker of these hands, and fill their
mouthes with continuall <hi>Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
I haue furnished and repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
this <hi>Manuel,</hi> which I name
<hi>THE HAND-MAID To
PRIVATE DEVOTION,</hi> to
waite on her in her Chamber, or
Oratorie. The purtraying of her
Mistresse I leaue to the pensill of
some Diuine Apelles, whose taske
will be the harder, because she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
commeth abroade. All that my
intention aimeth at, and my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
promise, is but to lay open a
priuate way, and set vp certaine
<hi>Stages</hi> for thy holy race, and pricke
<pb facs="10"/>
thee on forward in it. Farre better
helpes in this kinde the pious chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and zeale of religious and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
persons hath afforded thee; of
whom yet I may truely say, as <hi>Tully</hi>
spake of the Emperours that dealt
with <hi>Mithridates</hi> before <hi>Pompey,
Laudandum quod secerunt, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noscendum
quod reliquerunt:
They are to be commended for
that they haue done, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
for that they left.</hi> What
they haue left, I labour to supply;
and if I cannot supply it, yet I
thought fit to implie and intimate,
that the Authors themselues, or
the Publishers of their workes,
might adde what they finde wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First my thinkes I see in their
bookes of <hi>Deuotion</hi> and prayers,
<hi>Salomon's temple,</hi> without the
gate called <hi>Bewtifull;</hi> I meane, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
meditations, and orizons,
without an entrance thereunto by
preparation. With that part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I begin; and it taketh vp the
<pb facs="10"/>
more roome in my booke, because it
hath beene so scanted for place, or
rather quite excluded in theirs. In
it if thou finde some tertnesse, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
thee (Courteous Reader) to
remember with me the precept of
the Lord Iesu, <hi>Haue salt, and haue
peace.</hi> If I <hi>haue salt, haue thou
peace,</hi> the rather, because Hymnes,
Prayers, and other religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
are spirituall sacrifices; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
sacrifice by the Law was to be
<hi>seasoned with salt. Et quoniam
mel in Dei sacrificijs non offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
nimia dulcedo arte mutata
est, &amp; quâdam piperis austerita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
condita apud Deum nil tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
suaue placet, nisi quod ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
in se aliquid mordacis veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis.</hi>
It is <hi>S. Ierom's</hi> obseruation
vpon the legall sacrifices, that <hi>God
neuer appointed hony to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
vnto him.</hi> And the morall
truth vailed vnder that shadow, was
that <hi>in our spirituall oblations,
nothing pleaseth God that is
onely sweete, and hath not some
<pb facs="11"/>
smacke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">

         </gap> it of biting truth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Next I haue much maruelled
what the reason might be that they
vndertaking to fit prayers and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>tions</hi>
to seuerall seasons, and
speciall occasions, baulked the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
faste and feasts. For albeit the
Saints dayes might fare the worse
with them, because Popish super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiō
ouer cloyed them. Which yet is
an abuse of arguing to argue from
the abuse to the abolishing the right
vse. By this meanes they might
take from vs the vse of all <hi>Gods</hi>
creatures, because they haue beene
superstitiously or profanely abused
some way or other. But admit there
might be a <hi>legall caueat</hi> put in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Saints <hi>Plea,</hi> what haue
the feasts of our Lord and Sauiour
deserued, that they should be struck
out of their Callender, or sleightly
passed without the honour of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
Hymnes, or Prayer on
them? They cannot pleade want of
president, authoritie, or direction:
for they haue Coppies faire written
<pb facs="11"/>
in golden characters by <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
in his Homilies, <hi>Chrysolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,
Leo, Augustine, Bernard,</hi> &amp;
other deuout Fathers in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
vpon these dayes. If they saw
not them, why did they not follow
the excellent patterne in the booke
of Common Prayer? Which laying
before me, I haue drawne formes of
exhortations, hymnes, and prayers,
carying throughout a manifest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of the feast to which they
are dedicated. And before them I
haue prefixed a Paralell of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
of the old, and the Historie of
the new Testament compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that thou mightest haue an
ocular demonstration of that
which <hi>S. Austine</hi> writeth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
both. The new Testament is
vailed in the old, and the old is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
in the new.</p>
   <p>After the feasts, or before as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
preparatiues to them, the Church
fasts should haue beene ranked. But
there being in their Deuotions no
spirituall dainties allowed for the
<pb facs="12"/>
festiuals, I nothing maruelled at it
that Christian fastes were vtterly
vnprouided for, and (if I may so
speake) fast with them. Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
fasts of humili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>inent
iudgement they take notice of, but
the ordinarie fasts of <hi>Deuotion,</hi>
they mention not at all. Yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely

Fast with him on good-friday, as
well as feast with him, and for him,
on Easter day. If any teares of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
are the <hi>wine of Angels,</hi> I am
perswaded they are those teares of
<hi>Deuotion,</hi> which after much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
and Prayer, and meditation,
spring out of the serious apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Christs infinite loue testified
to man-kinde by his fasting, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
praying, weeping, bleeding, and
dying for vs on the Crosse. But they
wil say, these are the sacred fewell of
euery dayes deuotion. Yet it is more
<pb facs="12"/>
proper to remember the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>orke of
the day, in the day wherein it was
wrought. And albeit the Iewes
were bound alwayes to remember
<hi>Gods</hi> wonderfull deliuerances; yet
more stricktly were they bound on
the very day for that end appointed
to be kept solemne. What though we
finde no expresse commandement
for them? The practise of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church, and the religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of the present, ratified by
Supreme authoritie, should sway in
a matter of this nature, according
to that golden rule of <hi>S. Bernard:
Obey him as God who is in the
place of God, in those things
that are not against God.</hi> These
fasts therefore should not haue bene
forgotten.</p>
   <p>I come now in the last place to the
weekely Deuotions, wherein I finde
Prayers for each seuerall day of the
weeke. Yet as it is noted by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of <hi>S. Gregories</hi> Comment vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
Iob, that <hi>It is an excellent
Commentarie fraught with rich
<pb facs="13"/>
learning especially in matter of
moralitie. But it might haue
beene wrote almost, as well vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
any parcell of Scripture, as
vpon Iob.</hi> So you shall finde that
the Prayers for each day may serue
for any day as well as that to which
they are intituled. For example,
Munday's Prayer well fits Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and Tuesday's Wednesday;
and all three, Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday. No day hath more
interest in the <hi>Deuotion</hi> for it
then another.</p>
   <p>When <hi>Timothie</hi> found fault
with <hi>ALEXANDER</hi> for stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a stroke amisse vpon the
Harpe, and <hi>Alexander</hi> demanded
of him; <hi>Is it not all one whether
I strike it this way, or that way,
with these fingers, or these?</hi>
True, answered <hi>Timothie,</hi> It is all
one to an Emperour, but not to a
Musitian, It is no error in stale to
strike as you doe; but it is an error
in art.</p>
   <p>I confesse in like manner, it is
<pb facs="13"/>
no error in Religion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> set a godly
Prayer for the day which hath no
interest or relation at all to the day;
yet it is an <hi>indecorum</hi> and blurre
in Art. It is all one as if they should
set a marke before them, and
shoote no more towards it then any
other white, To auoid this impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie,
if not incongruitie, in the
Morning Hymne and Prayer, I
haue an eye to some worke of <hi>God</hi>
the Father in the Creation wrought
on that day: In the Euening Hymne
and Prayer to some worke of God
<hi>the Sonne</hi> wrought (or by the
Church remembred) on that day
in the Passion weeke.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>For the admonitions and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
