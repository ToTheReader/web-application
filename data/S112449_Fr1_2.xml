   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM not ignorant</hi> (Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen) how hard a matter it is for any one man to write that which should please and satisfie all persons, wee being commonly of so diuers opinions, and contrary iudgements. Againe, <hi>Tully</hi> affirmeth it to bee a very difficult thing to find out any matter, which in his owne kind may be in all respects perfect: wherefore I trust, of your owne iudgements J ought the rather to be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in that I seeke to please many with the varietie of matter: the Discourses being fower in number: Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, Hunting, Fowling, and Fishing: being so briefly set downe, for the recreation of tedious time, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for all those that take pleasure or delight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: which if it please you to accept my good will, you

shall not only incourage mee to amend thats amisse, but also hereafter present you with such matter, as shall better counteruaile your courtesies, and saue mine owne credit. Thus being loth to bee ouerlong in so breife a matter, I commend you to the protection of the celestiall powers, and this to your friendly acceptation.</p>
