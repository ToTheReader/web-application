   </head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eynge the pricke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto</hi> the Lyne of oure lyfe guydeth vs, is knowledg of thynges wherof we are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant: &amp; that of all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, none is more estima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble or worthy for those that acknowledge them selues by the names of men, then the Science of the Natures and qualyties of thynges: and of Natures, the best &amp; moste excellent is the acquaintaunce with Mankind, and knowledge of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions. I haue thought it good (gentell Reader) to set before thyne eyes Thistorie of Theseus &amp; Aryadne: the whiche, though the Style and Meetre be to base for so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte a Paterne of so many thynges: yet by the perswasions &amp; earnest request of diuers and those my verye frendes, I haue gyuen it thee: wherin thou maiste beholde, as in a Glasse almoste all maner of dealynges for sundry kindes of purposes. As if thou seeke for true loue, looke vpon Ariadne: who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uētured her fame, body &amp; goods to go with Theseus. If thou seeke for good counsell,
<pb facs="4"/> howe to eschewe the blasynge brandes of the fyerye flames of loue, see Phedra. If Crafte, Dissimulacion, Perfidye, Periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, or forgetfulnes of good turnes: behold Theseus. If thou craue an Example of vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naturall lust, lechery: or as I mought say, incest: let Phedra come before thyne eyes: who hauynge no respect to honestie, fame, ire of the Goddes, nor kynred: entysed the vnconstant Theseus to forsake her Sister, and loue her. Certaynly in that she was a woman, she deserued pardon: but in that shee was a Sister, shee deserued perpetuall ignomynie and euerlastynge shame &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. And seynge the Sister maye not truste her Sister, sithe bothe came oute of one belye, and sucked of one pappes: what other wyll be so mad, or so muche without reason as to trust a woman? whose disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest partes haue hitherto, and yet do so pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perlye playe their Pageantes, as no tonge can tell, no Pen can wryte, nor any harte comprehende: I wyll not that any honest and vertuous Woman be towched with that I mynde to saye: but they onely who in readynge hereof, shall by anye meanes fynde them selues agreeued. And I wyll touche no poynt, but onelye Beautie.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>For yf I shoulde saye, what I haue seene, reade and harde, a yeare were to lytell to tell of their trickes.</p>
   <p>Assuredly, he that desyreth a fayre woman armeth him selfe to a right great and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous aduenture: and why? a fayre wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is nothynge but a gasynge stocke of ydell folkes: an earelye wakynge for them that bee lyghte: and she that is desired for her Beautie in her youthe, maye hope too haue but a sorye lyfe in her age.</p>
   <p>An infallyble Rule it is, that shee that is desyred for her fayrenesse, is hated for her sowlenesse: and Beautie of trouthe is not perpetuall, but fadeth as the flowers and greene grasse. Also he that hathe a fayre woman must suffre her pryde: for Beautie and Pryde go alwaye together. Also hee must suffre her expences: for beautie in the face, and folye in the head, be two wormes that fret the lyfe, and consume the goodes. Also hee must suffre her Ryotes: for a faire woman wyll, that none but shee haue her commaundementes in the Howse.</p>
   <p>Also bee muste suffre her nyce Mynions: for a fayre woman wyll passe her time in pleasures. Also hee muste suffre her Presumption: for euerye fyne and
<pb facs="5"/> fayre womā wyll haue preeminence before all other: &amp; at a worde, he that hath a fayre woman is apparelde with as great peryll as euer was Cartha with Scipio, Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem with Titus, or Rome with Brennus: No man complayneth that the Goddes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his destenies haue giuen him a foule wife: let euery man chuse as him lyst. The noble Armynus of Carthage for the space of fourescore yeres wherin he ruled the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth there, was as straunge to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as famyliar to his Bookes. And this age passed, his frendes desired him instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to take a wyfe, that the memorye of so perfyte a wyse man might remayne to the posterytie: and the more earnest they were, the more he resisted &amp; sayd: If she be fowle, I shall abhorre her: if she be fayre, I must take hede to her: if she be ryche, I must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her: if she be poore, I must mayntayne her: if she be a shrew, I can not forbere her: and the least plague of these is sufficient to slaye a. M. men. But let vs see how they of olde tyme passed their dayes, &amp; let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whither the Grafts that were slipped from these trees, be any whyt degenerated from the olde stocke. Myrrha lay with her father. Byblys caused her brother Cannus
<pb facs="5"/> for vniuste and vnnaturall lust to be bany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Medea slewe her Brother Absyrtus, therby to scape her fathers danger▪ &amp; folow Iason into Grece: and this our Phedra left her sister in a vast forest a pray to the fierce and cruel Beastes, and ran away with her Husbande. I speake not of any light fault, but of suche, wherby the fawties haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them no lesse reproch in their time, thē shame with vs by beynge Examples of so filthy factes. As for those that lyue nowe with vs I feare me, thei shalbe as yll repor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted of tyme to come, as they be hated nowe with wise and auncient men: their lookes be so loftie, their gate so stately, their appa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rell so disguised, their courage so hawtye, that you may muse to here of their maners gestures and behauiours, no lesse then thei were Monsters, or thinges wherin Nature eyther had erred, or woulde not shewe her force. And where in time passed, all that was done otherwyse then honestie permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted was done very secretely. Now (I know no cause why) they that be dyffamed do as muche reioyce in their naughtines, as they aforetime were ashamed of their misdedes: I can alledge no reason why suche thyngs shoulde come to passe nowe, rather then in
<pb facs="6"/> tymes paste: but that oure women lyue so yedellye, that they eschewe all honeste laboure, and whollye addicte them selues to vnhonest ydlenesse. For this is certaine: where the handes is occupyed: there, the harte muste needes do somwhat: and if I saye not true, let any man alleadge when euer there were moe ydell Women in the whole worlde, then is nowe in the small Circuit of Englande. I reade, howe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers haue ben cōmended for kepynge them selues close in their Howses, vsynge them selues discretelye with companye: mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratelye with their Housholde: decentlye with their Husbandes. But neuer was any lauded, for leadynge of an ydell lyfe. You ydle Dames whersoeuer you be, tell me I praye you? what was the cause that Penelope was so muche honoured in her tyme, and left eternal memorie of her good renowne to vs after her death? What trade of lyfe led shee when Vlysses was at the Siege of Troye? shee beynge a Quene dyd paynfullye spyn and keepe her howse, and for all the knot of gentell Woers that she had, she neuer left her worke to dallye and toye with them, thoughe her Husband were awaye .xx. yeares? What dyd the
<pb facs="6"/> wicked Torquyne fynde the good Ladye Lucres doynge when he came to rauysshe her? If ye knowe not (O ye amorous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes to you I speake) I wyll tell you: shee sat spynnyge with her Maydes: and beyng deflowred: shee neither gaue Torquyne thankes for his good wyll, nor reward for his paynes, but flewe her selfe, because her Husbandes bedde was defyled. Let these to Ladyes be Examples, to you (O ye La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes enamorous) howe you shall occupye your selues in your Howses: they were no vyle women, for the firste was Quene of Ithaca, thother a Consuls wyfe of Rome. But I suppose you cannot away with spin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge, for that vtterlye taketh awaye all vayne thoughtes, and occupyeth the minde with honest studyes: for all the Senses be moued by it: the eyes with seyeng that the threde be well twyned: the eares with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge the sownde of the wheele: the hands with turnyng it aboute, so that no place is voyde of doing somwhat: wherby no yl can tary or raigne in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hart: thus much I haue said because Ariadnes idlenes caused al her griefe: for if she had not bē idle, she had not gone out of her chamber: if she had not gon out of her chamber, she had not come to the
<pb facs="7"/> Laberynthe wherein Theseus was: if shee had not gone to the Laberynthe, she hadde not hard his complaint: if she had not hard his complaint, she had not loued him: if she had not loued him, she had ben safe frō the chaunce whiche happened to her: as in the Historye shalbe declared. Ydlenes is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ground of all vice, &amp; ouerthroweth quyte all the foundations of Vertue. But as I haue said of these two, I might speake of many mo: but this is ynough if it be wel vnderstanded. But to leaue this, and come to the Historye agayne, from the whiche I haue a lytle dygressed: if thou looke for an example of paynfulnes, take them all, and thynke with howe great paines they slewe and subdued the fel Monster Mynotaurus: If thou desire to here of vnmercyfulnes of Parentes, cast thou eyes to Theseus, who lost his father Egeus through his defaut. But because it is but lytle touched in this Historye, I wyll pretermyt that: Yf myse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, call to mynde Aryadne left in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse: and to be short of all vnhappynes let her be a Paterne. I might apply eche of these to diuers other cōmen places: but thē I should make my Entry greater then my whole Howse. I wyll therfore leue the rest
<pb facs="7"/> to be scanned of thee (gentle Reader) &amp; if I shal perceiue that this is welcome to thee, hereafter as occasion shall serue, thou shalt encourage me to do the more: Thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge that thou wilte take in good parte whatsoeuer is said herein, I byd thee fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well: desirynge thee if oughte bee amysse, frendlye to correcte it, or gentlye to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysshe mee therof. Farewell.</p>
