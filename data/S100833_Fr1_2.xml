   <head>THE PREFACE TO <hi>THE READER.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Lorious thinges are spoken of the grace of graces Faith in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, God setting himselfe to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that grace that yeelds vp all the honour vnto him in Christ; who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the life of our life, and the soule of our soule. Faith only as the bond of vnion bringeth Christ and the soule together, and is as an arterie that conueyes the spirit from him as the heart; and as the sinnewes which conuey the spirit to mooue to all dutie from him as head, whence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> maketh Christs liuing in vs, and our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by faith all one, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Now that which giueth boldnesse and libertie to faith, is not only Gods assigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this office to it in the couenant of grace to come vnto Christ, and vnto him in Christ to receiue grace, but likewise the gracious promises whereby the great God hath ingaged himselfe as a debtour to his poore creature, for all things needfull to life and godlinesse, vntill that blessed time when we shall be put into full possession of all things wee haue now only in promise; when faith shall end in fruition, and promises in performance. Faith first lookes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o this word of promise, and in the promise to Christ, in whom and for whom, they are yea and <hi>Amen,</hi> both made
<pb facs="3"/> and performed. And in Christ it eyeth God in whom it last resteth, is its proper center and foundation, otherwise how should wee weake sinfull creatures dare to haue any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with God that dwelleth in that light that none can attaine vnto, if hee had not come forth and discouered his good pleasure in Christ the substantiall Word, and in the word inspired by the Holy Ghost for the good of those whom God meant for to make heires of saluation. Now these promises whereon all our present comfort and future hope dependeth, lie hid in the Scriptures, as veines of gold and siluer in the bowels of the earth, and had need bee laid open, that Gods people may know what vpon good grounds to lay claime vnto. Those therefore that search these mynes to bring to light these treasures deserue well of Gods Church. We commend, (and not without cause) the wittie industrie of those that from Springs remote bring Riuers to Cities, and by Pipes from those Riuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue water to euery mans house for all domesticall serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: much more should we esteeme of the religious paines of men that bring these waters of life home for euery man his particular vse, in all the passages and turnings of this life. In which regard, I doe not doubt, but the paines of this godly, painfull, and learned man will find good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of all children of the promises that hope to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit them, who hath with great paines, and with good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of spirituall vnderstanding, endeauoured to cleare most matters concerning faith; and likewise discouered the varietie and vse of the promises with teaching Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians how to improue their riches in Christ heere spread before them, how to vse the shield of Faith, and the sword of the Spirit vpon all occasions, that so they might not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be belieuing but skilfull Christians, knowing how to mannage and make the best aduantage of their faith, and the word of faith. Which if they could doe, there would another manner of power and beautie shine in their liues then doth. Hee is a man that hath formerly deserued well
<pb facs="3"/> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but in a more speciall manner fitted for a Treatise of this nature, as hauing beene put to it, to know by experience what it is <hi>to liue by faith,</hi> hauing in sight for matters of this life very little whereupon to depend. Those that are driuen to exercise their faith, cannot but find God faithfull, as neuer failing those that trust in him, they see more of God then others doe. If it be obiected that others of late time haue digged in the same mine, and laboured in the same field, and to good purpose and successe: I answer, it is true, the more this age is bound to God that directs the spirits of men to so vsefull, so necessarie an argument, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without faith wee haue no communion with the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of life, nothing in this world that can yeeld setled comfort to ground the soule vpon, seeing without it the fairest carriage is but emptie and dead moralitie, neither finding acceptance with God, nor yeelding comfort to vs in our greatest extremities, and by it God himselfe, and Christ with all that he hath done, suffered, conquered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth ours and for our vse. Besides none that I know haue written in our Language so largely of this argument, and such is the extent and spiritualnesse of this heauenly point, that many men &amp; of the greatest graces &amp; parts may with great benefit to the Church, diue and digge still into this mysterie. Neither let any except against the multitude of quotations of Scriptures, they are brought vnder their proper head, and set in their proper place, and the matter it selfe is cut out into varietie of parts. Store (as wee vse to speake) is no sore, we count it a delight to take out of a full heape, the more light, the conuiction is the stronger, what sutes not at one time will sute our spirits and occasions at another, and what taketh not with one, may take with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But the full and well handling of matters in this Treatise carries such satisfaction with it, that it frees mee from necessitie of further discourse, and mine owne present weaknesse of bodie taketh mee off. Only I was willing to yeeld that testimonie to the fruitfull paines of a faithfull
<pb facs="4"/> labourer in Gods Vineyard, that I iudge it deseruedly. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it therefore, Christian Reader, with thankes to God that stirreth vp such helpers of that faith by which wee liue, stand, conquer, and in which we must die, if we looke to receiue the end of our faith, the saluation of our soules.</p>
