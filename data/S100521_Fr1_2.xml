   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE MY VERY ESPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall good Lord, Thomas Baron of Buckhurst, Lord high Treasurer of England, one of the LL. of her Maiesties most honorable Priuie Counsell, Knight of the honorable Order of the Garter, and Chauncellour of the Vniuersitie Of Oxford.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now more then a whole yere, Right Honorable, since that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the slendernesse of that abilitie, which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto me, I brought to an end these few Lectures vppon the Prophet Ionas. In all which time being doubtful, whether I should publish this small Treatise to the view of the world, or no; &amp; sometimes in mine owne mind resoluing for it, and sometimes against it, I haue at the last aduentured to let it see the Sunne, by an open imparting thereof vnto other. VVherein my assured hope and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is, that the same holy and gracious Spirite which first moued me to vndertake this worke, and by litle and litle hath enabled me to bring it to this passe, will also giue that blessing thereunto, that it shall not be vtterly vnprofitable to the Church, but that such as are indifferent Readers,
<pb facs="3"/>
may some in one kinde, and some in another, reape such frute, as that thereby they may be strengthened to continue on their iourney to euerlasting happinesse. For the better accomplishing whereof, according as the text hath yeelded me occasion, I haue laboured seuerally: sometimes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ignorant, sometimes to comfort the weake, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to settle the doubtfull, some other times to encorage on to vertue, and oftentimes to beate downe vice and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, which in this later age euery where aboundeth. To which purposes as God did diuerse wayes make me know in the first vttering thereof, that it returned not altogether frutelesse, so I trust that it wil please the same guide of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth farther to blesse it, that in this course now intended by me, it may yet also be a meanes, to multiply and increase the Lords seruice in some persons more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully.</p>
   <p>But being now to commend it to the consideration and perusing of manie other, I do first present it to the good and fauourable acceptation of your Lordship, as hauing the principall and most speciall interest therein: for besides that it had his birth and growth in that Vniuersitie, vvhose sterne vnder our most gracious Soueraigne your Lordship doth with great wisedome rule, and therefore may cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it for the places sake, as belonging in a generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to your Lordships protection: The Authour thereof is in dutie so specially and particularly bounden to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that in right he must acknowledge the continuance and progresse of his studies, for these manie yeares to haue rested and relyed solely on your Honourable fauour. In which respect he amongst manie others, hath great cause to giue praise and thankes to the Almightie for your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships high aduauncement in this State; in as much as he
<pb facs="3"/>
apparantly findeth, and by experience knoweth, that after a desire to do faithfull seruice to her sacred Maiestie, to administer iustice to the Subiect, and to be as a father in hearing the complaints of the poore, it is not the least care which your Lordship hath, to helpe and preferre in Church and Common-wealth, such as haue or do depend vpon your Honour. Amongst whom I should be verie forgetfull and vnthankfull, if I did not to my vttermost let all men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, with how honourable regard your Lordship hath bene pleased now for diuerse yeares to looke vpon me, and of your Lordships owne disposition, at euery first occasion so to thinke on my preferment, as I had no reason in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to looke for, or any way expect. But in this as in many other matters, your Lordship doth let the world see, that there is nothing more proper to personages truly honorable, then to do honorable deedes: and thereupon it is, that with this extraordinarie respect your Lordship hath both inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and affected not a litle for my good. An example for the matter verie rare, in this barren age wherein we now liue: but to the maner of the happie accomplishing thereof both my selfe and diuerse other are so priuie, that we must confesse it to be a singular consideration of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, so to begin and consummate the same, that all men might see the thankes, only to belong to your Lordship, and that no second person hath had anie finger, in that which hitherto I haue receiued.</p>
   <p>In gratefull representation of my remembrance herein, I bring this litle gift: and as thereby I conceale not from anie, how deepely vnder God and my Soueraigne I am obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to your Honor, so otherwise I shall euer be readie with all my power to do your Lordship seruice, thinking my selfe happie, when I may perfourme anie thing, which may te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
<pb facs="4"/>
my respectiue and dutifull affection.</p>
   <p>God Almightie long preserue her most gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, the onely fountaine vpon earth of all our felicitie. God Almightie blesse your Lordship, that the Common-wealth for many yeares may enioy such a Counseller, and this Vniuersitie so Honorable a Patrone.</p>
