   <p>Concerning the Ciuile Iusticers the Executours of this Lawe, as it becommeth me not to say muche: so yet I may be so bolde, as to put them in minde, that, what
<pb facs="12"/>
Lawe so euer is vniust, God shal iudge the Promotours, the Makers, and the Ministers of the same. I wish harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they would deepely consider of that God saith by his Prophete Esaie, which among other thinges he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth to be cryed out alowde, as with the sounde of a trompet.<note place="margin">

      <hi>Dissolue the bandes of impietie, loose the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, wherewith men are ouercharged, let go free them that be oppressed, &amp;c.</hi> Certainly it is such a Lawe, as the like was neuer before heard of in any Christian Realme.</p>
   <p>As for the Argumentes, and whatsoeuer other deuises our Aduersaries haue inuented against this Sacrifice, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause al procedeth of falshoode, malice, and ignorance, by reading this Preface, and my Reioindre, the truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declared, I trust al shal vanish away, and seeme wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of no credit in their iudgementes, whom the loue of Heresie hath not bewitched, bereued of wit and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
   <p>And as touching them, that mocke, skoffe, and raile at the Masse, As Moyses, and Aaron standing before King Pharao,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.</note> said, <hi>The God of the Hebrewes hath called vs, that we go foorth into the wildernesse three daies iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and sacrifice vnto our Lord, least perhaps the pestilence, and sworde come vpon vs:</hi> Euen so if we Priestes, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike men be mocked, euil reported, and euil iudged of for that which we doo at the Masse, we confesse plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for so much as we ought not to be ashamed of it: that according to Christes commaundement we offer vnto our Lorde God this Sacrifice in remembrance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes death,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.</note> and for our necessities, and that according vnto the exhortation of S. Paule,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</note> we make <hi>supplications; prayers, intercessions, thankesgeuing, for al men, for Kinges,
<pb n="2" facs="12"/>
and foral that are in auctoritie, that we may liue a quiet and peaceable life, in al godlines, and chastitie. For that</hi> (saith he) <hi>is good and acceptable in the sight of God our sauiour, who wil al men to be saued, and to come vnto the knowledge of the truth. For there is but one God, and one mediatour betwen God and men, the man Christe Iesus, that hath geuen him selfe a raunsome for al men.</hi> These be the thinges, that we do in the Masse. What reproufe they deserue, we see not. Yet these be the thinges, for which we susteine persecution.</p>
   <p>This being so, to thentent they finde cōfort according to the exhortation of Christe in the Gospel, which suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer persecution for the Masse,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Math.</hi> 5.</note> sith it is <hi>for righteousnes sake,</hi> and that the persecutours seing them selues decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, take better aduise, repent, and amende: and that the truth of this point be more clearely knowen: I thinke it good, and profitable, here to say somewhat of Sacrifice in general, and of the Sacrifice of the Masse.</p>
   <p>How be it this muche at the beginning I confesse, that, what is, and euer hath ben in the Churche agreed vpon, as a thing certaine and cleare, thereof reason is, we should not dispute, least by disputing, we make the thing doubteful, that is most certaine. Therefore here, I meane in this Preface, I intende not to bestow my labour, to the intent by Argumēts I may seme to proue a thing, that in the Churche is already defined: but to this ende rather minde I to employ myne endeuour, that as touching this point of Diuinitie, I may confirme it, not so much by way of reasoning, as by way of expounding: whereby it may come to passe, that the truth being declared, the darkenes of errours be put away.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="13"/>
      <note place="margin">VVhat thinges be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</note>That I may procede orderly, which I may not wel do in my Reioindre folowing the course of answering to M. Iewels cōfuse Replie: I wil briefly declare, first, what Sacrifice is: 2 Why Sacrifice is made, as a thing accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and due vnto God: 3 that a visible Sacrifice is most conuenient for our nature: 4 that God hath bothe engraffed in the mindes of men the rite of Sacrificing, and also by the Law commaunded it, and for what cause: 5 then, that for loue towardes vs, Christe hath instituted a Sacrifice for vs at his last Supper, for larger proufe whereof I referre the Reader to this my Reioindre: 6 Furthermore, for so much as in euery Sacrifice foure thinges are to be considered, according to the doctrine of S. Augustine,<note place="margin">
         <hi>August. de Trinit. lib. 4. cap.</hi> 14.</note>
      <hi>To whom offering is made, by whom it is made, what is offered, and for whom any thing is offered</hi>: I wil shewe in what sorte these be in the Sacrifice of the Masse: 7 After this, by what waie this Sacrifice is auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: 8 for what causes, and persons it is auaileable: 9 what effectes it worketh: 10 Lastly, that the Prayers, and the Ceremonies of the Masse, be good and godly, and voide of al superstition. Of these pointes some I wil but briefly touche, of some I wil speake more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the mater requireth.</p>
   <p>Whereas then M. Iewel, and his felowes do so much abhorre and deteste the name of Sacrifice, specially of the Sacrifice of the Masse, as a thing iniurious to the Crosse of Christe, whiche neuerthelesse so much set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth the merite and benefite of the Crosse, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more: I would faine they had once plainely sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to the worlde, that they them selues do rightly vnderstand, what a Sacrifice is.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="3" facs="13"/>What new deuise they haue, and what they imagin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thereof, it skilleth not. Let vs see, what the Scriptures teache vs. The blessed Apostle S. Paule going about to declare, that Christe was a true Priest, and that he offered a true Sacrifice for vs, taketh vnto him selfe this definition,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.</note> saying, <hi>Euery Hye Priest taken from among men, is ordeined for men, in the thinges that apperteine to God, to thintent he offer vp giftes, and Sacrifices for sinnes.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the same Epistle,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.</note>
      <hi>Euery Hye Priest is ordeined to offer vp giftes, and Sacrifices.</hi> Whereof it may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what Sacrifice is,<note place="margin">VVhat is Sacrifice as it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the thing that is offered.</note> specially the condition of these <hi>Correlatiues,</hi> Priest, and Sacrifice, considered, betwen which there is a mutual relatiō of the one to the other, as it is betwen Father and Sonne, Maister and Seruaūt: veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it is, An Hoste, whiche as a gifte and a present, is offered by a publique Minister vnto God for sinnes.</p>
   <p>And thus may Sacrifice be defined,<note place="margin">VVhat is Sacrifice as, it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kē for the action of sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</note> as the woorde signifieth the gifte offered, and the thing sacrificed. For elles, if we speake of Sacrifice, as it betokeneth the action of sacrificing, for the worde is common to both: then we vnderstand a true Sacrifice, and such as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for our nature, to be made and offered, when we doo consecrate any gifte to our Lorde God, by which, some rite and ceremonie according to publique ordinance about the gifte obserued, we professe him to be supreme and chiefe of al, the beginning and ende of our health and saluation, so as by that we submit our selues, and al that is ours vnto his diuine Maiestie. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> what is there, that may seeme iniurious to Christe, or by any meanes vnworthy?<note place="margin">VVhy is Sacrifice made.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Neither doo we thus offer giftes, and Sacrifices vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="14"/>
God, for that he hath any neede of our thinges, who in him selfe is most sufficient, nor for that he desireth ought at our hands for cause of his owne pleasure; as the carnal Iewes thought: but bicause in such giftes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentes, the recognition of his supreme Maiestie, is to him most acceptable. And for so much as of his goodnes he hath created vs after his owne Image,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.</note> and hath ordeined vs to atteine the fruition of his owne blessed presence, where the true blisse is: it is right on our behalfe, and to him acceptable, that to thintēt we may acheue this end, which to vs is profitable, and not to him, we geue him wourship due vnto him, and that by what meanes we can, we stirre our selues duely to do it: and that, if by committing sinne, we haue dishonoured, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, and therefore deserue punishment, so farre as our frailtie stretcheth, we make some satisfaction and recompense.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Sacrifice is the propre vvour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God.</note>And although he be truly wourshipped withe al good workes, that be doone to his glory: Yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly that wourship is due vnto him, whereby, after the manner that is conuenient for vs, we professe him to be Alpha and O, asmuche to say, the beginning and ende of al thinges, for this is propre to his onely Maiestie. For in asmuche as that exceeding greate excellencie hath infinite properties, whiche for the infirmitie of our nature we are forced with distincte considerations to conceiue, and bicause we are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vnto God by distincte vertues with distincte af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes and desires, whiche folow the apprehensions of our minde: that the vertues be not as an vnordered heape confuse in the harte of a iuste man, but that eche

Paule setteth forth distinctly writing to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians) to the consideration,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> by whiche we conceiue him to be verely our Lorde and God, from whom, as being the <hi>Father of Lightes,</hi>

   <p>Therefore the people of Israel were commaunded of God, as soone as they should come into the lande of promise, to take the first fruites of al manner of corne, and to bring them to the Priest, and as he laid them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Aulter,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Deute.</hi> 26</note> to say in this wise. <hi>I professe this day before thy Lorde God, that I am entred into the Land, whiche our Lorde hath sworne vnto our Fathers that he would geue vnto vs. Our Lorde hath brought vs out of Egypte with his mighty hand, and stretched arme, &amp;c. And therefore now I offer vp the first fruites of the corne of the land, that our Lorde hath geuen vnto me.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Euen so King Dauid said vnto our Lorde,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Para.</hi> 29</note> after the greate giftes had bene geuen by him, and by his Nobles, towardes the building of the Temple: <hi>Al things are thine (O Lord) and what thinges we haue receiued at thy hande,
<pb facs="15"/>
we haue geuen vnto thee.</hi> And thus we offer giftes vnto our Lorde, not for that he hath neede of them, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in them, with which mynde the Babylonians offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto their Idol Bel:<note place="margin">
         <hi>Daniel.</hi> 14</note> but bicause in the giftes so offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there is a recognition of his Diuine Maiestie, and a certaine satisfaction for sinnes, that is to say, for the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral paines due vnto sinnes.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But bicause lyuing vpon the earth, and being enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronned with flesh we vse the senses,<note place="margin">That a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is most cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for our nature. <hi>Ioan. 4.</hi>
      </note> and being tied vnto sensible thinges we can not exercise the proper opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the soule perfitely: such a Sacrifice is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for vs, as with which visibly we may confesse and honour that Diuine excellencie of Maiestie. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God, who is spirite, be delited with that wour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which according to the Scripture, procedeth of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and truth, that is to say, of right faith working by charitie, and although it be a certaine acceptable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto him, when the soule with inwarde mouing doth consecrate it selfe to God: yet truth it selfe, that is to say, right faith, requireth also outward wourship, for two causes.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Outward vvour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for tvvo causes.</note>The one is, bicause the soule maketh not that inward oblation of it selfe conueniently, and perfitely, excepte it beholde the same in some sensible oblation of a gifte, as in a signe and glasse, that by this meane it may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and stirred vnto that internal Oblation, there to rest and stay, as when we pray vnto God, and praise him, we doo it not only with the harte, but also with sensible signes: not bicause otherwise he vnderstandeth vs not, but for that so we stirre and prouoke ourselues the more feruently to pray,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note> and praise him. And therefore S. Paule
<pb n="5" facs="15"/>
admonisheth vs, that we exhibite, not only our mynde, vnto God but also our members, to be <hi>armures of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The other cause is,<note place="margin">
         <hi>In Asceti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi>
      </note> for that, as S. Basile saith, we haue not onely our soule of God. And therefore the wour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that is geuen vnto him by the soule onely,<note place="margin">God is to be honou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red not only with the soule, but also vvith the body, and vvith out<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vvard thinges.</note> is vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. And for so much as we haue receiued the body, and al that we haue besides of him: it is right, that we serue him with the body it selfe, and with al things, acknwole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that he is God, and Lorde of al thinges, to whom al thinges ought to doo seruice. In consideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the thirde brother among the seuen Machabees, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth his tong out of his mouth (as he was cōmaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) and holding vp his handes,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Mach.</hi> 7</note> both to be cut of by the tormentour, said, with a bolde courage, <hi>E coelo ista pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideo, sed propter Deileges nunc haec ipsa despicio.</hi> From hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen I haue these thinges, but nowe for Gods Lawes sake, I care not for them. And so gladly he offered his tong, his handes, and al the partes of his body, in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God of whom he had receiued them.</p>
   <p>And so the mother of those seuen Machabees,<note place="margin">The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees.</note> a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of manly fortitude, with free harte offered vp her sonnes vnto God, bicause it was he (as she said) that had created them, and brought them into this light, how so euer they had ben conceiued in her wombe. Therefore she made protestation as before God, and said vnto them, <hi>I know not</hi> (quod shee) <hi>how ye appeared in my wombe: for it is not I, that haue geuen vnto you spirite, and soule, and life, it is not I, that haue ioined together the members of eche of you, but it is the Creator of the worlde. &amp;c.</hi> As much to say in effecte, as this. Lord for so much as I haue
<pb facs="16"/>
had these seuen Sonnes of thee, for thy sake gladly I geue them, and offer them vnto thee.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.</note>That blessed man Iob likewise, tooke the losse of al his goodes paciently, and so with free hart offered them to God, forasmuch as he acknowledged, that he had receiued them at Gods hande.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note> S.

         <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.</note> And in that great and first Commaundement, in whiche the Lawe and Prophetes do depende, we are commaunded to loue God, not only with the soule, but also (<hi>ex omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus viribus</hi>) with al our powers and strength.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Luc.</hi> 10.</note>
   </p>
   <p>And as we sinne against God, not by thought onely, but with outward workes also, and outwarde thinges, as it is euident in fornication, gluttonie, theafte, sacrilege, and in the like: so we be bounde seemely to serue him, not onely with inward motions of the soule, but also with outward thinges, that we haue receiued of his goodnes.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> Therefore S.

For it is not to be thought, that euery oblation is a Sacrifice, as it is wel noted of S. Thomas, Theophylacte, and S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome.

For either they were slaine, as the Beastes, or burnt, as the Incense, or sprinkled ouer with oile, as bread, meale, and the first fruites, and baked in an Ouen, or fryed in a panne, or rosted on a gredyern,<note place="margin">

   </p>
   <p>Now let vs come vnto the fourth point, and declare that God hath both engraffed in the mindes of men the
<pb n="7" facs="17"/>
rite of sacrificing, and also by Lawe commaunded it, and for what cause. This is soone done. The consideration of nature, and general view of the worlde, layeth the one before our eyes, and the bookes of the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the other.</p>
   <p>Natural reason telleth man, that he is vnder some Superiour, for the defectes, which he feeleth in him selfe. In whiche defectes he hath neede to be holpen and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected of some Superiour. And what so euer that is, it is that, as S. Thomas saith, whiche among al is called God. And as in natural thinges, naturally the inferiour thinges are vnder the superiour thinges, euen so natural reason telleth man according vnto natural inclination, that he exhibite to that whiche is aboue man, subiection and honour according to his manner. And the conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manner for man is, to vse sensible signes to expresse some thinges, bicause he taketh his knowledge of sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thinges. And therefore it procedeth of natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that man vse certaine sensible thinges, offering them to God in signe of due subiection and honour, in like sorte as they doo, who offer vnto their Lordes certaine thinges, in recognition of their Lordship or Dominion. This perteineth to the nature of Sacrifice, and therefore the offering of Sacrifice perteineth to the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note place="margin">Sacrifice hath euer ben gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to al peoples. <hi>Cyprian.

   <p>Wherefore there lyueth no Nation in the worlde altogether without Religion, as we may see, and heare, nor is Religion mainteined without Ceremonies. And among Ceremonies, the Nations of al ages haue vsed outward Oblation, as the chiefe. Although for the more parte (as S. Cyprian saith) they abhorred Circumcision,
<pb facs="18"/>
as a thing cruel, and vnfrendly to nature, yet the other Sacrifices they did not likewise abhorre: but <hi>folowing, the lawe of Nature in many thinges</hi> (saith he) they reteined the custome of making Sacrifices. And this was fastened in their myndes by common consent in general, that God onely ought to be wourshipped with outward Sacrifice.

   <p>Thus M.

But now he hath so proclaimed his Chalenge, that besides heresie, and pride, he hath also proued him selfe ignorant, rash, and impudent. And thus is he confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his owne chiefe Doctor, who being conuicte with euident truth, with some modestie confesseth that, he could not denie, though with intolerable pride he disallowed that, whiche he was not hable to disproue.

Neither is preiudice goten vnto the Sonne, or vnto the Holy Ghoste, whiles prayer by him that offereth is directed vnto the person of the Father, the ending of which prayer, whereas it hath in it the name of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoste, sheweth, that no</hi>

   <p>When Christe the Sonne of God, is offered vp ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his body and bloude, that is to say, according to his humaine nature, according to whiche, he is lesse then the Father, then him selfe, then the holy Ghost: he is consecrated vnto the holy Trinitie.

   <p>And hereof Reader thou maist conceiue, what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere is to be made vnto them, that moue this question, which to some, though without iust cause, semeth to be of great difficultie: whether the Sacrifices of the olde Testament, the Sacrifice that our Lorde offered at his Supper, the Sacrifice of the Crosse, and that Sacrifice, which is daily made in the Churche, whether al these
<pb n="17" facs="29"/>
haue a like and the selfe same consideration and being of a Sacrifice (to vtter it more plainely in Latine to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in whiche tongue this mater would more aptly be treated) <hi>an vniuocè Sacrificia dicantur.</hi> For although al these doo commonly agree in this, that they professe a supreme excellencie of the Diuine Maiestie, in deede it selfe, and sensibly: yet bicause, it perteineth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration and nature of a Sacrifice, that after some mā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it be satisfactorie, as with whiche satisfaction may in some sorte be made to our Lorde God, partly for sinnes, and for paines due to sinnes, partly for benefites, whiche we haue receiued, or be desirous to receiue: onely the Sacrifice of the Crosse hath the most perfite, and most propre nature, of a Sacrifice, as being that, by which only al the price of Satisfaction is purchased and paid, and out of whiche al Sacrifices, as also al Sacramentes, as out of their first founteine doo draw, and take their whole force and vertue, and by whiche also onely, it hath ben shewed most fully, as muche as can be done, how great is the excellencie of the Diuine Maiestie, and how great thinges it is conuenient that we doo for the same.</p>
   <p>But the Sacrifice of the Aulter, and the Sacrifice of our Lordes Supper, forasmuche as they offer vp the same thing, reteine the propre, true, and after their sort perfit, though very different consideration and nature of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, bicause the hoste is the same that was offred vpō the Crosse. But the Sacrifices of the lawe, be Sacrifices after a cōmon and vnperfite respect: partly bicause there was litle in them, that was worthy of the Diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, partly bicause, as S.

      <hi>Si esuriero, non dicam tibi: If I happen to be a hungred, I wil not tel thee of it: for mine is the rounde earth, and al wherewith it is filled.</hi> For asmuche therefore, as in this Diuine Sacrifice, the same selfe Christe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, and is sacrificed vnbloudily, whiche in the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Crosse once offered vp him selfe bloudily: we may soone see, for whom, I meane, for what persons, and for what causes, it may, or ought to be offered.</p>

   <p>Now Reader, I trowe that we, to whom a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice hath ben leafte by our Sauiour Christe of so muche a more excellencie, by how muche the body of the Sonne of God, is worthier then an vnreasonable beast, are not in this behalfe in worse case, then the Iewes were, but that the same may also for vs be profitable and auaileable to al persons, to al causes, and to al ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities. This much we finde taught by S. Augustine, <hi>Epist.</hi> 59. By S. Chrysostom also,<note place="margin">

   <p>But whereas a thing, that is good and profitable, is said to profite others by moe waies then one, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, either <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> as the Shcolastical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours speake,<note place="margin">After what way is this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailable.</note> (asmuche to say, of the force, power, and strength of the thing or worke it selfe, which is done or wrought, without respect had vnto the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or merite of the partie that doth or worketh, as the Sacramentes are said to worke <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> and to doo that thing, for whiche they be adhibited vnto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son accordingly disposed, by force and vertue of the worke that is wrought, euen as a man that putteth fier

vnto a house, is said to set the house a fier <hi>ex opere ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato,</hi> by force of that very worke done): or <hi>ex opere operantis,</hi> asmuche to say, by the deuotion, vertue, and goodnes of the partie that worketh, as prayer, fasting, almose, and the like: Or els, by way of merite, or satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, whiche doo claime a certaine right: or lastly, by way of humble prayer, whiche hathe hope in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignitie onely and liberalitie of him to whom prayer is made: whereas, I say, a thing which is good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, may be said to profite by so many sundry waies: Here there ariseth no smal difficultie to discusse, by which of these meanes and waies, the Sacrifice of the Masse is auaileable to them, for whom it is offered: and whereof it commeth to passe, that it profiteth one more then an other.</p>
   <p>To this question hauing consulted the writinges of learned and graue men, thus I answere: that bicause in the Masse many thinges doo concurre and meete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it is auaileable by al meanes and waies, by whiche a good worke may be auaileable: but yet that for the diuersitie of causes, and persons, for whiche the Sacrifice is offered, it hath diuers working. And gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, albeit of it selfe, or <hi>(ex opere operato)</hi> by vertue of the thing offered and sacrificed, it be auaileable: yet not altogether after the same manner,<note place="margin">Sacramē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, and Sacrifices diuers in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</note> that Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes be. For as touching the Sacramentes, they be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes that God vseth in them to whom they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and if they be disposed as they ought to be, and through faith and charitie be capable, they worke health and saluation, and conferre grace. But the Sacrifice of the Masse (as the nature of a Sacrifice requireth)
<pb n="20" facs="32"/>
doth worke after a manner, whiche, though it be of more efficacie, yet is like vnto prayer. Of more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie, I say, forasmuche as it is made in the person of Christe, a most acceptable, and most sufficient gifte being geuen and offered vp, for whose sake God being appeased and pleased, is moued to heare them, that so to him doo sue and pray. Neither is it to be doubted, but that thinstitution of Christe is muche auaileable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the power, which this sacrifice hath to obteine thinges behooful for mans health. For he woulde neuer haue deliuered him selfe vnto vs, to thintent we should offer him with our owne handes vnto his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father: except he had forseene and willed, that great commoditie should redounde too men by this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
   <p>In consideration whereof,<note place="margin">Sacrifice compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended vnder the name of prayer.</note> bicause it worketh an effecte like vnto prayer, the Scripture vnder the name of prayer, oftentimes comprehendeth both Sacrifice in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and also this Sacrifice specially succeding in place of al the olde Sacrifices, as though Sacrifice it selfe also were a certaine prayer, but a singular prayer. So the writer of the storie of the Machabees hauing made a rehersal of the Sacrifice of Iudas, that he commaunded to be offred for them that were dead, bringeth in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sentence,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab.</hi> 12.</note> saying, <hi>It is therefore a holy and a holesom thought, to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from their sinnes,</hi> signifying sacrifice to be conteined vnder prayer, as the Special is conteined vnder the General.</p>
   <p>And S. Paule expounding the definition of Christe as he is a Priest whose duetie is to offer vp giftes, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, faith,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.</note>
      <hi>that he in the daies of his flesh</hi> (asmuche to

So <hi>S.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine in his .59. Epistle taketh <hi>Orationes,</hi> that is to say, Prayers in S. Paule. <hi>1. Tim. 2.</hi> for Oblations and Sacrifices. So in the Actes, <hi>Cap. 6. Nos orationi, &amp; ministerio Verbi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantes erimus.</hi> We wil attende diligently to Prayer, and to the ministerie of the Worde. So whereas it is said of the Priest in the booke of Leuiticus,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Leuit.</hi> 16.</note>

         <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.</note>
      <hi>offeret prose ipso,</hi> he shal offer for him selfe.</p>
   <p>So where it is said in Esaie, <hi>Domus mea domus ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis vocabitur,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Esaie.</hi> 56.</note> My House shalbe called the House of prayer, it is not without cause iudged, that vnder the name of prayer,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.</note> the Prophete comprehendeth Sacrifice. For the Temple was not appointed vnto prayer special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and properly, but vnto Oblation and Sacrifice. For prayer might be made in euery place, but Sacrifice could be made no where but in the Temple. In deede prayer was euermore added vnto the Sacrifices, wherwith they asked that of God, for which they offered. Yet say we not that sacrifice is prayer, as the name of prayer is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken properly, but that oftentimes it is vnderstanded by the name of prayer, bicause in this it is like vnto it, for that it offereth a gifte vnto God, to thintent to receiue some thing of him, wherein it appeareth to be a prayer, not in worde, but in deede. And bicause it geueth to receiue, it hath also the nature of a certaine satisfaction,
<pb n="21" facs="33"/>
as that which geueth one thing for an other.</p>
   <p>The Sacrifice then of the Masse,<note place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uailable <hi>ex opere operato</hi> in vvhat respecte.</note> is auail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>able, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> that is to say, in respecte of the vertue and strength of the thing it selfe that is offred. of the thing it selfe I meane, without consideration had of the priest, whether he be good, or euil, bicause in the person of Christe, and by his commission, the body and bloude of Christe are offered vp vnto God. Whiche oblation it selfe for the worthines, and reuerence of Christe, as a Prayer of greatest efficacie, and moste worthy to be heard, the Father beholdeth, and in regard of it, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that, for whiche the body and bloude of his Sonne are so offred, according to the order of his Diuine dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and as it shal seme conuenient to him selfe, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as al iudgement is geuen vnto him.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Iohan.</hi> 5.</note>
   </p>
   <p>By the same consideration it hath very great force and strength to satisfie for temporal paines that be due vnto sinnes,<note place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth for paines</note> whiche paines oftetimes in Scripture be called by the name of sinnes. For if according vnto the counsel of Daniel,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Daniel.</hi> 4.</note> sinnes, that is to say, paines due to sinnes, are redemed with almose, how muche more with the body and bloude of the Sonne of God offered at the Aulter? If paines were loosed by the sacrifices of the olde Lawe, shal they not muche more be loosed by the Sacrifice of the newe Lawe? For els, what shal we say, that the bloude of Christe is of lesse price in the sight of God, then the bloude of a calfe? Although Sacrifices haue their valour by way of Prayer, yet when they bring a present that is worthy of Gods fauour to remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of paines, and of his giftes, they leane to a certaine right and equitie, as the Price being exhibited, and so
<pb facs="34"/>
they be satisfactorie.</p>
   <p>S. Augustine speaking of this way of working by the name of Christe,<note place="margin">
         <hi>August. cōtra lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras Petili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani. lib.</hi> 2 <hi>cap.</hi> 54.</note> in Sacrifices, and otherwise, saith to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian the Donatist, <hi>Gratias Deo, quia tandē confessus es va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere inuocatū nomen Christi ad aliorum salutē, etiā si à pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toribus inuocetur.</hi> God be thanked, for that thou hast at length confessed that the name of Christe called vpon is auaileable vnto the health of others, although it be called vpon of sinners.

   <p>And therefore no maruel is it, after the teaching of S. Augustin, that good wordes which be said in the publike

Praiers for the people, though they be said of euil Bishops, neuerthelesse be heard, not according to the peruersitie of the Gouernours, but according to the deuotion of the people.

         </gap> Sacrifice</note> whiche of it selfe, and being offred in the name of the Churche, is so good and acceptable a thing vnto God, shal profite them, whiche besides the Priestes with godlines doo offer it, according to the deuotion bothe of them, that with the Priestes doo offer, and of them, for whom it is offred. For true it is that S. Augustin saith to <hi>Petilianus</hi> the Donatiste: <hi>Nos dicimus tale cui{que} Sacrificiū fieri, qualis accedit vt offerat.</hi> We say, that the Sacrifice to eche man is made suche,<note place="margin">

      </note> as he is, that commeth to offer.</p>
   <p>Whereas then the wel disposed people doth offer vp that same very Sacrifice by deuoute affection, whiche the Priest offereth by outward Ministerie: the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Minister bereueth not any deuoute person of the benefite of the Sacrifice.</p>
   <p>Neither is this so to be taken, as though in this case nothing were to be looked for aboue the merite of our deuotion, for then to what purpose were the Sacrifice?
<pb facs="35"/>
But what so euer benefite redoundeth of the vertue of the Sacrifice, ouer and aboue the merite of deuotion: the same is so muche the more abundantly of euery one enioyed, with how muche more deuotion towardes Christe and his Death he offereth.</p>
   <p>This deuoute disposition of the offerers our Lorde prescribed, when consecrating and making his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Priestes,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.</note> he said, <hi>Doo ye this in remembrance of me.</hi> In whiche commaundement,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> whereas there be two thinges conteined, dooing, and remembring, or comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration: this muche our Lorde therein signified,<note place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice profiteth in diuers degrees.</note> that with how muche the more grateful and deuoute memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie they did it, so muche the more by this Sacrifice they should obteine: and againe how muche the nearer any man came vnto that dooing, and action of offering, the more benefite thereof he should receiue. For though al they that be iuste may be said to offer this Sacrifice by a certaine generalitie,<note place="margin">
         <hi>August. Epist.</hi> 23.</note> which <hi>S.</hi> Augustin semeth to meane, for so muche as it pleaseth them al, that it be offered: yet they come nearer vnto this action, who doo it them selues, who heare Masse deuoutely, who serue and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon the Priest to doo that actiō, who susteine him for his ministerie, who with godly desire require Masse of him.</p>
   <p>Wherefore as a prayer profiteth them that pray them selues more, then an other, for whom it is made: so this Sacrifice profiteth more them, that offer it them selues, then it doth them, for whom only it is offered. And as a Prayer profiteth more, that is specially made for one, then that whiche is made onely in general for al: euen so it is in the Sacrifice. But these thinges shal appeare more
<pb n="23" facs="35"/>
clearely by the effectes, whiche we looke for to enioye, by the Sacrifice of the Masse through the vertue of Christes passion, if we reherse them particularly.</p>
   <p>The first effecte by consent of al men is the remission <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> of Venial sinnes,<note place="margin">The effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes that we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Masse.</note> which the very iuste doo daily commit, and also of temporal paines, vnto whiche they remaine thral and bounde, though damnation euerlasting be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen.</p>
   <p>An other effecte is, the increase of righteousnes, and the continuance in good life. These are expressely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Institution of this Sacrifice by the Institutor him selfe, who first offered it. <hi>This is my bloude</hi> (saith he) <hi>of the new Testament,</hi>

      <hi>whiche for you, and</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">
         <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.</note>
      <hi>for many is shed in remission of sinnes.</hi> That the Apostles vnderstood the very same also in the Consecration of the Body, the Masse of S. Iames doth shewe. Where after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of those wordes,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Liturgia Iacobi.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>this is my body which for you is geuen, and broken</hi>: the Deacon forthwith addeth, <hi>in remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionem peccatorum, in remission of sinnes.</hi> By whiche wordes, for so muche as with them Christ to this effecte offered him selfe, (albe it peraduenture they might be more generally vnderstanded) that at least may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which now we haue said of the remission of Venial sinnes, and temporal paines, vnto whiche the Apostles them selues were thral.</p>
   <p>Touching the other, there is a manifest place in S. Iohn. Christe speaking of the Apostles, and of them that should through their preaching beleue in him,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Iohan.</hi> 17.</note> saith: <hi>For them I sanctifie my selfe, that they also may be sanctified in truth.</hi> Whiche saying is truly vnderstanded of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of holynesse, and of continuance, in asmuche as
<pb facs="36"/>
the Apostles were now cleansed, and sanctified.</p>
   <p>And vnto these effectes the Sacrifice of the Masse is auaileable for al the faithful that pertaine to the body of Christe, that is to say, for the iuste, not only by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion and merite of men that offer it, but by the vertue of the Sacrifice it selfe: neither onely by meane of a certaine common Prayer, whiche standeth vpon libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, but of suche prayer, as satisfieth the requestes of Gods iustice with presenting vnto him the price paid for sinnes, and with a gifte geuen worthy to obteine that is asked, whiche is the proper nature of a Sacrifice, which is to be satisfactorie, and to be offered by way of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. And therefore S. Paule specially considering the worthines of this true Sacrifice, said in general, that <hi>euery Bishop or Priest is ordeined to offer giftes and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for sinnes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Of this it is learnedly by the Diuines gathered, that, for so muche as Infidels, and suche wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as be not yet reconciled vnto the Churche, or vnto God, nor so disposed, that for them satisfaction may effectually be made: Sacrifice for them is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly offered. For whether they them selues, or others for them doo offer, God doth not accepte giftes for the wicked, to this ende for whiche properly they be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as it appeared in Cain.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.</note> This is witnessed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in sundry other places.<note place="margin">

of S. Augustine,<note place="margin">Masses common not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, and wherfore <hi>Concil. Trident.

   </p>
   <p>When therefore <hi>Petrus à Soto</hi> that learned man was demaunded in that Councel, whether Chaunte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries might be erected, and Masses appointed to be said for Infidels: he answered, that it was vnlawful, bicause to ordeine Masse for any, is to ordeine, that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for them be offered, and that to them thereby sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction be applied, whiche ought not to be done, bicause satisfaction requireth before a remission of the deadly faulte. Yet wel may it be, (said he) that Prayer in the Masse for their Conuersion be made.</p>
   <p>Our Sauiour him selfe semeth to haue insinuated this propertie of the Oblation, when offering vp his body and bloude at the Supper after the fourme and rite of Melchisedek, not without cause he said, of the one,<note place="margin">

   <p>Yet as it is here before said, and as it is cleare by <hi>S.</hi> Paul,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</note> in a certaine general and cōmon respecte we offer for al, forasmuche as we present the body and bloude of Christe vnto the Father in his person, and by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and beseche his goodnes, that in regarde of his body and bloude he wil haue mercie vppon them. But we doo not presente these giftes for al, as a Price that is exhibited for them (whiche thing the propre nature of this oblation comprehendeth in respecte of release of the paines) bicause al be not capable, that is to say, not apte vessels to receiue suche benefite.</p>
   <p>As touching other thinges, whiche profitably be asked in the Masse,<note place="margin">Benifites redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to vs by the Masse.</note> as victorie, peace, health, ceasonable wether, and such other the like, wherewith mannes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie is releeued and holpen, the Sacrifice of the Masse is auaileable for them, according to the order of Gods eternal disposition, not onely by reason of the merite of the Priest, and of the Churche that offereth: but also, and that more amply, by reason of the qualitie, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sacrifice, whiche is consecrated in the person of Christe, and by his commission.</p>
   <p>But this is by way of Prayer: whiche Prayer, bicause it
<pb n="25" facs="37"/>
is not sitting the wordes of Christe to be frustrate, by whiche he committed this Sacrifice vnto vs: the Father very oftentimes heareth. And whereas he heareth it not, the iudgementes of God be secrete. For great is the vertue of the signes, and Sacramentes of the name of Iesus Christe, vnto whose honour the very powers of the Aier are commaunded to yelde and geue place, though it be called vppon by euil, and for euil persons, as S.

   <p>NOw therfore to returne to thee good Reader, that thou maist the better vnderstand our procedings, when at the first I tooke in hand to answer M. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels Chalēge, and to iustifie the Articles, that rashly, and wickedly he had denied: amnog other things, I brought some of that I haue here said, and what elles then to me semed good, for proufe, of the Sacrifice of the Masse, which in his .17. Article he denieth. Therto, as to the rest of my Answere, he hath made his Replie. In which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie he hath said, what he was hable to say, in disprouse of that singular Sacrifice.

      </gap>, and of how litle substance al is that he hath brought,
<pb n="30" facs="42"/>
how litle he amendeth his common woont of falsifying his testimonies, what other false partes he playeth, and what grosse errours he is fallen into: thou shalt perceiue, if thou vouchesafe to read this Reioindre.</p>
   <p>Whereas against this Sacrifice, by many men many wordes haue ben said, many villanies haue ben wrought, many blasphemous bookes haue ben written (as is before mēcioned) according to the sprite, that Satan the enemie of the Sacrifice hath enspired into their wretched breastes: Out of al M. Iewel, like a Spyder, hath suckte the most venemous iouice, and in his Replie hath vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, as it were spitting forth his poison. Which Replie; as perhaps it poisoneth the lighter sorte, who haue delite to feede thereon: so to the wise, and those that be sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast in the Catholique Faith, al the stuffe of his great booke appeareth, as it were but Cobwebbes. For in dede as with Cobwebbes nothing is holden, but light mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>es, and weake flees: euen so of a light witte, and feeble Faith he sheweth him selfe to be, whom that Replie cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, and holdeth.</p>
   <p>He hath not one Auncient Doctour for him, not one Councel, General, or Prouincial, olde, or newe, not one Example of the Primitiue Churche, not one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the holy Scriptures. Not one I say for him, that is to wit, whereof any cleare conclusion may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red against the Sacrifice of the body and bloude of Christe. These doo I the rather make accompte of, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by his owne appointement, they be good waies and meanes, whereby to trie pointes of Faith in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie.</p>
   <p>Now if M. Iewel haue nothing out of al these for
<pb facs="43"/>
a cleare disproufe of this Sacrifice, after he hath vewed al the bookes that by these newe Maisters haue bene written in defence of his side, after that he hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished him selfe with al that euer Luther, Bucer, Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius, Oecolampadius, Caluine, Beza, and the vpholders of their sectes could deuise against it, after that he hath cōferred with his felow Ministers and Superintēdentes, who most readily ioine their forces together against the Sacrifice yea after that he hath learned the Argumentes of Satan him selfe the first Founder of this new Gospel, wherewith he impugned the blessed Masse disputing with Luther, as he witnesseth of him selfe, if I say after al this, he be hable to bring nothing, whereby this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to any learned man may seeme clearely disproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: hereof thou maist soone conceiue good Reader, how assured and certaine the doctrine of the Catholike Churche is, that teacheth the Body and Bloud of Christ to be offered vp vnto God vnder the formes of breade and wine by Priestes, and the same to be the Sacrifice propre to the new Testament, and how litle there is to be said against it.</p>
   <p>Bicause in this treatise I do mainteine my Answere, and disprooue what M. Iewel hath replied against it, that the whole processe may seeme the plainer, and for that oftentimes I am driuen by him falsly reporting my woordes, to referre the Reader to that I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: I haue thought it necessary to set foorth my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, with his Replie, and my Reioindre together, the order of his Diuisions truly kepte. Wherefore when M. Iewel beareth thee in hande, that I speake ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther absurdly, or vntruly, or that I make a fonde Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument:
<pb n="31" facs="43"/>
it may please thee to returne backe vnto the Answere, and vewing the place diligently, to consider, whether thou finde, as he reporteth. If this be done, I doubte not but the chiefe aduantage he seemeth to take against me, shal in thy iudgement appeare to stand altogether vpon manifest vntruthes.</p>
   <p>Yea if thou wilt not be deceiued by M. Iewel,<note place="margin">How M. levvels vvritings are to be read.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not at the firste, what in proufe, or disproufe of any thing, he reporteth, as out of others. Examine the places from whence he bringeth his testimonies. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not his shewes, beleeue thine owne eyes. Compare the authours texte,<note place="margin">The sleightes he vseth in vvriting against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes.</note> and his reportes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And doubtelesse wheresoeuer he allegeth ought that disagreeth with the doctrine of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Churche, thou maist be assured by diligent searche to finde, that he hath corrupted and falsified the Doctor, either by taking away, or by adding vnto, by exchange of wordes, or by peruerting the order of the sentence, by conceeling the Circumstance of the place, or by applying it to a sense contrary to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters meaning, briefly by one false meane or other, as al merchantes of such false wares, lacke not craftes and sleightes to helpe their vtterance.</p>
   <p>And as his sleightes of corrupting the Doctours be sundry and many,<note place="margin">The sleightes he vseth in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvering to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.</note> so be the meanes also many, and of no lesse crafte, whiche he vseth in answering to certaine their most plaine testimonies, with which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes he is pressed. Some Doctours with him be vtterly refused, some be of doubteful authoritie, some be disliked for their age, some be auoided by a crafty vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, some that speake plainely, be tolde, they
<pb facs="44"/>
speake violently. Whiche is a very poore shifte, and seemeth to haue least weight of Learning, or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
   <p>When al other sleightes be spent, yet this serueth him for the last refuge. He draweth this mater of the Sacrifice, to Phrases of speache, Tropes, and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phores, and alleging some Tropical speache, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth a reasonable vnderstanding somewhat diuers from the literal sownde of the naked woordes, he requireth the place that maketh for the truth of the Sacrifice, to be in like sorte vnderstanded. This is a way whereby one may seme to say somewhat, when in deede he saith nothing. By suche meane the truthe in any controuersie is darkened, it is not discussed, and in the iudgement of the vnlearned, confusion is wrought.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">M. Iewels common Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</note>What shal I speake of the force of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes? Certainely they be suche, as very Boyes that learne their Sophistrie, may be a shamed to make. In manner he neuer maketh Argument against the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but wherein with one truth he excludeth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truth, whiche kinde of reason, of al other is the most childish and fondest. As for example, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Fathers sometimes cal the Euchariste an Image, a Figure, a memorie, a sampler of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that was made vpon the Crosse, thereof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies he concludeth, that it is not a true Sacrifice. As thoughe one might not by suche Logique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Sacrifices of the olde Lawe were not truely, and properly Sacrifices, bicause they were al a Figure of that great Sacrifice, whiche Christe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="32" facs="44"/>
when he died. Both Sacrifices are a signe of that one and the selfe same hoste, that of the Lawe, was a signe of the hoste to come, ours of that is paste. Yet either is a true Sacrifice.</p>
   <p>Likewise of the affirmation of the Sacrifice of Praise, and Thankesgeuing, he induceth the denial of the true and real Sacrifice of Christes Body and Bloude in the Euchariste, as thoughe it were not bothe. But what neede I here Reader, to tel thee of M. Iewels manyfold shiftes and sleightes,<note place="margin">See the Preface before my first Reioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre.</note> sith I haue spoken thereof otherwheres, and other men haue detected them at large? And in deede what elles is conteined in our bookes, but a discouering of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gierdemaine? For how could the truthe haue bene set forth, excepte his lies had ben discried, and his falshoode confuted?</p>
   <p>As for the Vntruthes, that be in his Replie to this parte of my Answere, I haue not curiously no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the number of them, for so muche as that hath bene once doone by D. Sander, and me in parte, and by M. Stapleton more copiously. whereas the number of his Vntruthes founde in foure Articles onely of six and twenty, amount to a Thousand and odde, and the same are not yet discharged of M. Iewels parte: I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to bestow muche time about such a loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some worke. It is more meete for Pinners, Poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Nailesellers, to spende their tyme about telling, and making such accomptes.</p>
   <p>And though I had liked to haue kepte tale of them, yet the Margent of my booke would not haue sufficed to conteine them, the number is so great. Yet
<pb facs="45"/>
that his lyes, falsifyinges, corruptions, and vntruthes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be of smal number, and that the shame, whiche would growe in respecte of the multitude, if al were seuerally tolde, be not to the hinderance of his estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion discoouered: I am content, his whole Replie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this article, be taken (as it is in deede fewe thinges excepted, wherein gladly I agree with him) but for one Vntruth.</p>
   <p>Touching this Reioindre, I haue here defended and confirmed my Answere to his 17. Article, whiche is of the Sacrifice, and al that he hath replied against it, I haue fully refelled. God geue thee iudgement good Reader, to discerne truth from vntruth. If perhaps I shal seme in some places ouer obscure, and tedious, and not to haue framed my writing meete for al mennes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities: thou maist thinke, that either learning failed, or that the mater would not suffer, verely good wil wanted not. To make harde thinges easy to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed, and to geue light to thinges, that of them selfe be darke, and not to swarue from the exact rule of truth, it is a point of great witte and cunning: neither is it lightly perfourmed, but of suche as God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with special giftes. And as excellencie of witte is required to vtter them plainely: so it behoueth the Readers senses be wel exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>cised, to vnderstand them fully.</p>
   <p>The doctrine of this Sacrifice in some parte is harde, and obscure, such, as commonly hath rather ben right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeued, then by many clearely declared. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of holy Mysteries is better saued with reuerent si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, then with bolde opening. Experience teacheth
<pb n="33" facs="45"/>
into what danger of contempte they come, when they are openly reueled to populare vnderstanding.</p>
   <p>Although bothe in the Scriptures, and in the Fathers, we haue most sufficient proufes, and testimonies for the real presence, and for the real Sacrifice: yet they, that liued within the first six hundred yeres after Christe, wrote hereof more secretly, then of other pointes of our Religion.<note place="margin">The cause vvhy the olde Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly of these my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>steries.</note> For reuerence of the Mysterie, they thought it more conuenient, to teache it by mowthe, and by tradition, then by euident, and open declararion to commit muche to publique writing, least so to the Infidels, occasion should be ministred of despite and villanie. As for example, notwithstanding that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious warenesse, we read in S. Augustine, how the Painimes charged the Christians with the wourship of Ceres,<note place="margin">
         <hi>August. cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tra Faust. Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="46"/>
named <hi>Marcomanni</hi> grewe strong ouer him by a great ouerthrowe they had geuen him in bataile, wrote to the Senate of Rome, that (whiche was woont to be done in publique distresse) the Sibylles bookes should be looked in.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Flauius Vopiscus in Diuo Aureliano</hi>
      </note> In his Epistle he hath these woordes. <hi>Miror vos Patres sancti, tam diu de aperiendis Sibyllinis dubitasse libris, perinde quasi in Christianorum Ecclesiá, non in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo Deorum omnium tractaretis.</hi> I maruel at you Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers, that ye haue ben afraid to open Sibyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les bookes thus long, as though ye had to doo in the Churche of Christians, and not in the Temple of al the Goddes.</p>
   <p>By this it appeareth, what secretnesse and silence was vsed in the Primitiue Churche touching these my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and how feareful the holy Fathers were to say, write, or doo any thing, whereby the Miscreantes might come by knowledge of them. For which cause it is not to be marueled, if they spake not so plainely, and so euidently of euery point touching the Sacrifice, as the sawcinesse of heretikes requireth in these daies to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and satisfied withal. Yet they may seme to haue spoken plainly ynough to right beleuers, and for the same we haue no smal number of good and cleare testimonies, as by this Reioindre it shal appeare to them, that be not wilfully bent, either to shutte their eyes, bicause they would not see, or to wrangle contentiously, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p>But after that the Faith was once generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of al where it was preached and professed, and no
<pb n="34" facs="46"/>
Infidels remained among the Christians, that durst open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to worke despite against the holy Mysteries, whiche in sundry Prouinces came to passe before the first six hundredth yere was determined, and thenceforth: the learned Fathers that in those times wrote, as occasiō was geuē, spake of the real Presence of the body an bloud of Christe in the blessed Sacramēt, and of the oblatiō of the same, no lesse plainly, and clearely, then the Churche now teacheth. Whiche thing they finde to be true, that be conuersant in the workes of Cassiodorus, S. Gregorie the Romaine, Isidorus, Gregorius Turonensis, Beda, Haimo, Rabanus, and other about that age.</p>
   <p>If then for this Sacrifice we haue (as in this Reioindre thou shalt finde) the Scriptures, the testimonies of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the first six hundred yeres of sufficient cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the most manifest testimonies of the writers that immediatly folowed that age, besides the authoritie of Councels, that were within, and soone after that age, and so continually vntil the late Councel of Trent: the fauourers of M. Iewels side may see, his Chalenge fully answered, touching this Article. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought they to consider, how safe it is for them to contemne so great authoritie, and to be persuaded with suche <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>clender Argumentes against the blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Masse, as M.

So then if

      <p>This is the Summe of the conference and disputation that Satan had with Frier Luther against the Sacrifice of the Masse, by which Luther was persuaded, not only to say Masse no more, but also to write, preach, and worke against it in suche wise, as became Satans scholer.</p>
      <p>And thus thou seest Reader, that this is not a tale ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously, and sclaunderously blased abroade by Pighius, Hosius, and Staphylus, as M. Iewel saith: but that it is in great sooth reported, and in printed bookes published to the worlde, by Luther him selfe. Though M.

The person of such a Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master he commendeth not, but the Scholer he praiseth, calling him,<note place="margin">In M. Ievvels Replie. pag. 2.</note>
         <hi>that godly man Doctor Luther,</hi> and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he imbraceth.</p>

when he shal come, among whō the doctrine of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil him selfe is so soone receiued, so wel liked, so boldly defended. But ô foolish Frier, whose vnstedfast harte was so soone ouerthrowen by Satans wicked sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, false lyes, and vaine reasons. And ô light, and miserable soules, that sithens with the winde of that lewd Friers doctrine haue ben carried away. For what is there in al Satans tale, in Luthers bookes, in the treatises of al his Scholers of Germanie, of Cranmare, Peter Martyr, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Caluine, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, of al the other Sacramentaries, briefly in the whole Replie of M.

      <head>The chiefe, and most common Argument, that the Protestantes make against the Sacrifice of the Masse.</head>
      <p>S. Paule declareth in the Epistle to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">
            <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.</note> that Christ was but once onely offered, and that he offereth not him selfe oftentimes.<note place="margin">
            <hi>Cap.</hi> 9.</note>
         <hi>By his ovvne bloude</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>he entred in once into the holy place, and founde eternal redemption.</hi> Againe, <hi>He vvas but once offred to take avvay the sinnes of many.</hi> And in an other place, <hi>VVith one oblation he hath made perfite them that are sanctified for euer.</hi>
         <note place="margin">
            <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</note> Ergo, to what purpose is it, that Christe is thus daily offred vp vnto God in the Masse?</p>
   </div>
   <div type="part">
      <head>Solution.</head>
      <p>This Argument is soone solued, if a man consider the scope, marke, and purpose, wherevnto S. Paule di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth him selfe in that Epistle. This muche therefore is to be weighed. There were many of the Hebrewes, that although through the preaching, and miracles of the Apostles, were persuaded to beleue in Christe, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in great estimation, and zeale of the Law, stickte vnto their olde customes, and ordinances of Moyses, and specially vnto their Sacrifices, whiche they were desirous to retaine for their sinnes. And therefore they founde them selues agreeued with the Apostle, for that, whereas he tooke away their olde Sacrifices, they thought them selues to be destitute of the benefites of the Lawe, and remedies for sinne.</p>
      <p>Herevnto the Apostle maketh answere, and in effect teacheth: That of such Sacrifices as the Lawe ordeined, now we haue no neede, for so much as the Priesthood of Christ, who hath once offred him selfe with sheadding of
<pb facs="52"/>
his bloude vpon the Aulter of the Crosse hauing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fulfilled them, remaineth and continueth stil with vs, whiche is sufficient. <hi>We haue</hi> (saith he to them) <hi>an Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereof it is not lawful for them to eate, whiche doo serue the Tabernacle.</hi>
         <note place="margin">
            <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.</note> And that ye see not hostes to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> killed, and the bloude of Calues to be shed of vs, the cause is, for that the onely blouddy hoste of Christe hath sufficed, that now we haue neede of no other, but of that. That hoste is the founteine, and endlesse trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, whiche conteineth the sufficient price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. onely it is neede, that wee be made partakers of it. Neither were those Sacrifices of Moyses lawe suche, that by vertue and power of them being but si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes and figures of Christ,<note place="margin">
            <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.</note> synnes were remitted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: but by them synnes were brought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and signification was geuen out, that there was neede of an other blouddy Sacrifice, by whose vertue men in conscience should be made perfite.</p>
      <p>And so the Apostle treateth of the thing it selfe, that was shadowed in al the Sacrifices of the Law, and is so acceptable vnto the Father, that by his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre vertue and merite it sanctifieth men, and remitteth sinnes, whereunto by the ordinance of Gods iustice the Bloude of the Sonne of God was Requisite. Suche is the Hoste or Sacrifice of the Crosse onely, by whose vertue and merite they be sanctified, whosoeuer from the beginning either by the Sacrifices of the former times, or by the daily Sacrifice of the Churche, are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. By whiche onely for this cause al be said to be sanctified, bicause who so euer be sanctified, be by that, and by the vertue of that, made cleane. In case the olde
<pb n="50" facs="52"/>
Sacrifices, or the Sacrifice of the Masse also were suche sufficient prices of our redēption, without doubte bothe those, and this, had long sithens ceassed to be offered. For suche a Sacrifice, whiche by his owne proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite geteth sufficient price for sinnes, ought to be great in deede (soothly by the Death of the Sonne of God) but one onely sufficeth.<note place="margin">
            <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</note> Wherefore of a blouddy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice there is no more neede, but of suche a one, as by which we may be made partakers of that great and most worthy Sacrifice. Of whiche sorte the Sacrifice of the Masse is, where, in the person of Christe, that Death is presented for vs vnto the Father.</p>
      <p>And what Hoste, or thing mystically offered, could either better set Christes Death before his Fathers sight, or more effectually deriue the merites of his Death vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, then that very body, wherein he suffered? For which cause, when he deliuered the Sacrament of his Possion vnto vs,<note place="margin">
            <hi>Lucae</hi> 22.</note> he said, <hi>Doo ye this in remembrance of me.</hi> So that this Sacrifice of the Masse, although it be in his kinde a true Sacrifice, as it shalbe proued here after in this Reioindre: yet it taketh his whole vertue, and power, of the Sacrifice of the Crosse, which is of it selfe the whole price of our Redemption. Now <hi>S.</hi> Paul disputeth with the Hebrewes of that whiche with bloudshed redemed vs, and not of that whiche without bloudshed applieh the Redemption vnto vs. That was but once offered, this is, and must be ofte repeated.</p>
