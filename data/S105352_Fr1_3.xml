         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>into I was no sooner entred, then me thought I saw standing before me, the shape of a well-proportioned man su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in deaths liuery, who seemed to write as fast as I could read. This gastly obiect did much astonish me, and (as fancie in such cases is a fruitfull nource of superstitious feares) my amazemēt was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: being thus taken in the reading of that Authour, who, besides his other impieties, is the greatest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>ffer of apparitio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>s. But when I had well noted the others mild countenance, my courage did soone recall it selfe, and I growing somwhat bold, demanded both who he was, and why he came: whereto hee gently answered thus I am hee, whose pen was first emploied in the aduancement of vanitie, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in the discouering of villanie. Ioyne these two, and they will serue thee for the <hi>Periphrasis</hi> of my name. In the former of which, I confesse I haue offended, yet who knoweth not, that Fiction the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother of Poësie makes her the shadow of Philosophie; which if not sweetned by this heauenly mixture, may well haue reuerence, but small regard. This mooued the Poet to write, and me to vse for my familiar <hi>mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

This much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed my former admiration, who demde it rare, that any of that sexe, wealth, and wantonnesse could with such patience brooke the losse of life. Being in this humor I discouered my selfe vnto her, and earnestly requested her to shew me the cause of this her more then manly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: whereto she gētly replyed, that since my death her fortune chāged by hir folly had quited the former plēty &amp; pleasures that she had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </gap> enioyed, with a farre greater measure of want and woe; and for she sawe mee extremly desirous to heare the maner of this change and sequell, shee imparted that likewise vnto mee, concluding that sith death had ridde s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>e that liue; for whose admonition, euen in so small a time (for my witte was neuer long in performing such a taske) <hi>I</hi> would haue pende in maner of a caueat, alarge discourse both of hir former lewdnesse which my selfe had knowne, and of her following miseries which she had then related. But finding my desires full accomplishment herein impossible, after long thought I conceip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a likely course, for the effecting thereof in parte; and this it was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> To sue to <hi>Mercury</hi> that by the vertue of his charming rodde <hi>qua manes euocat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

In this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution I gaue long attendance, before the leysure of that busie God, (which as thou knowest is heauens Herald, and hels carrier,) did afford me any opportunity: But in the end hauing purchased ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse and audience, I preuailde so farre with him, that either for his good opinion of my intent, or for the loue he beares vnto Poetry wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himselfe, as he is the God of eloquence, hath no small interest, hee fully graunted my desire, but with this <hi>prouiso,</hi> that I should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch within an houre, by which time he will haue readye a fresh <hi>conuoy</hi> of ghosts for his returne. To be short; I was with a tryce in sight of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, whether running for ioy in headlong hast as the way ledde mee, I haue by chance lighted on thee, and thereby know that this subiect is reserued for thy penne. Listen then to my relation. Heere he som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what pawsde: then with a deepe sigh sorrowes true preface, he began his sadde discourse therein comprising the seuerall branches that I haue handled; this done, hee thus concluded: Thou hast now hearde the summe of all, which I had once begunne to write, meting by good happe with penne, incke and paper on the way; but the shortnesse of my time warns me to resigne the office of my penne vnto my tongue. Suffice it that <hi>I</hi> despeire not of thy memory, nor doubt thy forwardnes. This only I will add, let the world know it coms frō me, that they who since my death haue vnkindly blamd me, may henceforth cēsure more charitably of me. Hereto (me thought) I thus replyed: The chargethat thou imposest, is (I feare) greater then I can well discharge: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the nature of my veine is like to thine, neither is it <hi>in suo genere</hi> so sufficient. Besides none will beleeue this, but rather deem it a blinde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise of mine to begge a title for my booke, &amp; to picke vp some crummes of credit from anothers table. Some againe will charge me that I haue stolne this conceipt out of <hi>Lucian.</hi> And many maruaile, that I who haue a while forborn the presse (saue only in some sleight trāslations of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
