   <head>The answere to his friend. R: M:</head>
   <lg>
      <l>MY dearest friend I willingly confesse,</l>
      <l>That I whose life should other lead &amp; teach,</l>
      <l>Am not deuoide of blame, and foule impeach,</l>
      <l>VVhich (O,) I would no tongue could ere expresse.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Now for I haue my selfe in wotth made lesse:</l>
      <l>Too stale a fable to the publick speach,</l>
      <l>Is't not enough: but that I furthther reach</l>
      <l>To blaze my follies in a printing presse.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>No pardone no, both songes and Comedies,</l>
      <l>And what besides pleasing applause hath heard,</l>
      <l>VVithout remorse in their creation dies:</l>
      <l>To byrth and buriall rites at once preserd.</l>
      <l>Too much of these dyd men in me behold,</l>
      <l>O would time past could be regaind with gold.</l>
