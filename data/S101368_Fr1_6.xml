These aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of gods word, yea Eathnishe Epicures and beastly bellygods, consider not, how in the tyme of Antichrist, that is to say, of the Deuill and the Pope, when all darke ignorancie, and ignoraunt darknesse reigned: when Papistrie and false Religion only florished: when supersti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cious hypocrites alone ruled and ruffled: there was muche more scarcenesse, penurie &amp; dearth
<pb facs="9"/>
of all things than is now in the blessed tyme of the glorious ltght of Christs most glorious gos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pell. Rede we not, that euen in this Realme of England (as I may passe ouer with silence the stories of other nations) so great penurie, scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenesse, &amp; dearth of grayne was found, that the Inhabitantes thereof were compelled to make them bread of Pease, Beanes, Tares, Fitches Acornes, Ferne rootes, &amp;c? Chaunced not the like thing almost in one of the yeres of Queene Maries reigne now of late? Was the worde of God and the preaching therof, cause of so great miseries? But then was there hygh silence of Gods word: neither was the trompet of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes gospell freely blowen. Was the want of Masse occasion of it. Masses swarmed in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corner and countrey with all other idle inuē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions of Antichrist. Whatsoeuer the deuill and the pope at any tyme brought to the Churche, was in those dayes most diligently practised: &amp; yet notwithstāding such &amp; so great miseries thē chaūced, as in the time of the gospel y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> like was neuer foūd. Yea with the gospel al good things were geuē vnto vs and to this our Realme of our moste mercifull father, whiche we also at this presēt most abundaūtly do enioye thorow the singular benefite of the Lorde oure God, so that the aduersaries of Gods word haue no iust and worthy cause to cōplaine of the scarcenesse of thinges, wherof is so great abundaunce and plenty in this our land, that we haue not onely sufficient for the sustentation of our owne coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen, but also of many thousands of straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers▪ whiche lykewise do inhabite thys oure Realme. But this from the beginnyng hath bene the propertye alwayes of Sathan and of

It is ynough for the disciple, that he be as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is, and that the seruaunt be as his Lord is. If they haue called the Lord of the house Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub: howe much more shall they call them of his housholde so.

And as what so euer plage or mischiefe chaunced in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles tyme, was euer imputed to them and to their doctrine: so likewise came it to passe with the holy fathers and other good Christiās, that succeded them, as we may see not only in histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb facs="10"/>
but also in other writers, as in s.

If all thinges go well and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously with them, then are they mery, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently offer sacrifice to to their God the belly. But if any aduersity come, then knitte they the forehead, and worke their malice vpon Gods word and the faithfull professours of the same. The worde they call heresie, erroure, doctrine new and straunge, seditious, and cause of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion &amp; of all other plages, wherwith the commō weale is afflicted.

   <p>Now as touching the spiritual benefites and heauenly giftes of the minde as the knowledge of the holy scriptures, the vnderstanding of the Lordes blessed will, the preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the true administration of the Sacramēts, the abolishment of all false worshippings &amp; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions, &amp;c. wherwith God in this our age hath most mercifully blessed vs▪ far passing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other nations that be vnder the heauens: as these wise wicked worldlinges knowledge not the benefits of the body, nor yet are thanckfull to God for them: so likewise are they altogether vnthanckfull for the gifts of the minde, whiche do so far excel the other, as gold surmoūteth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or siluer, tynne. For lyke as Owles cā not abyde the golden and glysteryng beames of the Sunne nor the light of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> day: so in lyke māner cā not these bellygods and Antichristes slaues suffer the glorious and pleasaunt light of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes most glorious and pleasaunt Gospel. They crye out with the wicked, of whō the Prophet maketh mētion, on thys manner: Se not. Loke not out right thynges for vs: but speake fayre wordes vnto vs. Loke out erroures. Get you out of this way: Depart out of this pathe, and turne the holy one of Israel frō vs. In the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling traditiōs▪ croked constitutions, idle inuē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiōs, drousy dreames deuilish decrees, false fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,

And if for shame they seme to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue &amp; alowe any part therof: yet they do so māgle it, &amp; bring it in captiuitie to the traditiōs of mē, that it looseth the sincere simplicitie &amp; simple sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceritie, whiche it receaued of the holye Ghost. Some of thē are not ashamed so to diminish the authoritie of Gods sacred scriptures, that they affirme the word of God to be so far the worde of God,<note place="margin">The holye Scripture.</note> as the Church doth allowe it, meaning the pope &amp; his spiritual shauelinges: as though God gaue vs in his holy Scriptures an vnper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fecte doctrine, and not sufficiently authorised of him without the consent of Antichrist &amp; of hys broode. Is not this to set God to schole, and to make him a Nouice? So should it follow, that the word of God is grounded on the Church &amp; not the Churche on the worde of God. Is not this right Antichrist, that should turne y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rootes of trees vpwarde? Christ saith speaking of his Church: My shepe heare my voyce. Againe, he that is of god, heareth the wordes of god. Itē, Euery one that is of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> truth, heareth my voice. And the holy Apostle saith:<note place="margin">

although of neuer so greate excellencie, wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and power: but such as are the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, are built vpon the worde of God, &amp; whatsoeuer authoritie they haue (euerye one in their degree and office) they haue it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Gods worde, without the whiche word there can be no Church, for asmuch as there cā be no faith, as the Apostle saith: Faith cōmeth by hearing,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</note> and hearing commeth by the worde of God: so farre is it of, that either pope or Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinall or anye other person hath any power to geue authoritie to the worde of God, whiche already is authorized by the most hygh and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power, euen God himselfe.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Custome.</note>Some obiect olde and aūcient customes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that this our religion, as they terme it new and straunge, dissēteth in order and vsage greatly from the manner heretofore practised in our temples. I graunt: neither can the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Gods worde suffer and abyde such olde vnsauory croked customes, as heretofore haue bene vsed in the popish Religion, as the coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of salte, water, bread, bowes, flowers fire, ashes, cādles, &amp;c. creping to the crosse, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images, calling vpon dead Sainctes, sensing of altares &amp; Idols, praying in a straūge tong, offering the missall sacrifice for the quicke and for the dead, receauyng of the Sacrament vnder one kind, with a thousand moe errours and heresies, and other greuous abuses, which of longe vsage and custome in tymes past haue bene exercised among vs, &amp; taken for true God<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lynesse. But who knoweth not▪ that custome ought to geue place to reason and truth: for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and truth exclude alwaye &amp; put out of place custome, be it neuer so olde and auncient, lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
<pb facs="12"/>
and commendable. Christ is the truth: &amp; therfore ought we rather to followe the truth, than the custome. If thou lay to our charge cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, sayth S. Gregorye: Thou must marke what the Lorde saith:<note place="margin">

Custome without truth, saith Saint Cyprian, is nothing els thā an olde errour. Therfore leauing the error, let vs followe the truth. When the truth is once come to light, saith Saint Austen, let custome geue place. For who doubteth, that custome ought to geue place to the opē truth.
