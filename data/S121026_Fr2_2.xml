   <head>TO THE GOODE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccordinge to promise (gentle Reader) I haue here for the antiquitie and veritie of our religion, added to S.</hi> Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <hi>the testimonie of glorious S.</hi> Austen: <hi>vpon whom the heauenly dewe of Gods grace was so plentifully powred, that he was for sharpenesse of witt, depth of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge, and holynes of life, both to them of his time, and all posteritie, the light of the world, and salt of the earth. Many, singular, and rare testimonies for his vertue, learninge, and zeale of true religion, might be produced: but I will content my selfe only with two. The first shalbe of S.</hi> Celestinus <hi>Bishoppe of</hi> Rome <hi>who writeth thus in his cōmendation:</hi> Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinum <note place="margin">Epist. 1. ad quosdā Galliarū Episcopos. cap. 2.</note> sanctae recordationis virū, &amp;c. We haue allwayes for his life and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits had in our communion, Augustin
<pb n="4" facs="288"/> a man of holy memorie: neither was he euer so much as once touched, with any sinister suspition: Whom longe since we remember to haue bene of so great learninge, that he was by my predecessors, reckoned amongest the best Doctors: Wherefore all did ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie thinke well of him, as he that was euery where both loued and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. <hi>The secōd shalbe of master</hi> Cooper <hi>one liuing in our dayes, and not partial as the world knoweth on our syde, whose woordes be these.</hi> Austen the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <note place="margin">In his chronicle anno Dō. 397.</note> and learned Doctor of Christes Church was Bishoppe of Hippone a Citie in Affricke. This man was of such excellent witt, that in his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode <note place="margin">Se also his Dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ay in the words Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinus.</note> he learned all the liberall scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without any instructor: and in all partes of Philosophie, was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully learned. At the begininge he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored the opinion of them, which be called Maniches: but by the continuall prayer of his goode mother Monica, and the persuasion of holy S. Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, he was conuerted to the true faith. They both being replenished with the holy Ghost, sang the psalme <hi>Te Deum,</hi> answering mutually one the other.
<pb n="5" facs="288"/> After in prayer, writinge, &amp; preachin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, he so much profited the Church, that his name is worthyly had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of all men: <hi>and generally all Protestants so esteeme him, as of no one Doctor more. To this holy and learned Father, we appeale for tryall of our cause. They denye prayer and inuocation of Saintes, as iniurious to Christ, and sauoringe of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrye: we defend it as Catholicke, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall. They condemne pilgrimage and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitinge of Martyrs tombes for superstitious, and abhominable: VVe teach it to be goode and lawfull. They detest shrininge of Saintes bones, the reuerent touchinge and carrying their relicks in procession: VVe imbrace it as highly redoundinge to the honour of God, from whose diuine fountayne all their grace did flow, and by such signes do praise God in his Saints, and know their death to be precious in his sight. Now whether in these pointes S.</hi> Austen <hi>doth fauor vs, or helpe them, that I leaue to the iudgment of all Protestants, thoughe neuer so partiall in their owne cause, aster they haue readd ouer this smal treatise; for our cause is so clere, and the auncient father so close on our side, that most assured I am, were his name suppressed, and a title prefixed accordingly (which spirituall stratagem with such as allowe</hi>
      <pb n="6" facs="289"/>
      <hi>the authoritye of this, Father, any that please may sone put in practise) they would rather scoffe and deride them for phantastical newes sent out of the new world by the Iesuits, and trim tales meete for dotinge old wemen to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace them selues, then once imagin that such doctrine was current in the slourishinge time of the primatiue Church; or so much as dreame, that such grosse stuffe in their concept, could come from the penn of that learned Clerck and worthy Father</hi> S. Austen: <hi>VVhat salue then for this sore can be deuised? will they haply say, that the booke from whence this doctrine is fetched, is some bastarde, lipp, and falsely fathered, vpon that holy Doctor? This shiste can not serue, there being not so much as any colour to countenance such a cauill: for all learned men confesse it not only to be his, but also one os the most notable monuments that euer he published: being made in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>iper age, against insultinge Pagans and infidels, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Christian religion, and about which he laboured many yeares, besore he brought it to perfection: all which circumstances maturely considered, make his authoritie in the foresayd articles far more great and wayghtye. VVill they tell vs that he wrot a booke of Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and so not vnlikely that these opinions of his be there recalled? willingly should I</hi>
      <pb n="7" facs="289"/>
      <hi>graunt it, yf any such thinge were there extant: but seinge no cunninge in searchinge can finde that out, which is not there to be found, they must needes graunt, that this answeare bringeth rather corsiue, then comfort to their cause: sor yf in his latter times he perused ouer all his workes, and yet neuer reuoked any one article of the Catholike faith, then can not his booke of Retractations any wayes preiudice, but rather giue them more creditt, and make his authoritye more to presse them. And what man of common sense, that readeth his owne woordes, will euer thinke that he could retract what he there writeth, concerning prayer to Saints, visitation of relicks and the like? seinge they were not any priuate opinions of his owne, but the common beleefe and practise of Gods Church, as is euident out of the treatise followinge. Smaller matters God knoweth they be, which he speaketh os in his Retractations, and two only things he retracteth in his booke of the</hi> City of God <hi>from whence these stories are taken. The first is, that he thought it a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, that fire from heauen did runne betwene Abrahams sacrifice;</hi> It should not <hi>(quoth he)</hi> haue bene put downe for a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, <note place="margin">Lib. 10.</note> because this was showne him in vision. <hi>The second is, where he sayth</hi>
      <pb n="8" facs="290"/>
      <hi>that</hi> Samuel <hi>was not the sonne of</hi> Aaron. I should rather <hi>(quoth he)</hi> haue sayd, that he was not the sonne of a Priest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Samuels father is foūd amongst the sonnes of Aaron, but a Preist he was not, &amp;c. <hi>Such priuate opinions as these, of smal importance, as each one seeth, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth in that booke; other mayne and many articles of diuinitye, in controuersie betwixt them and vs, he doth not retract; which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth playnly, that they are sound, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, and were the beleefe of that time. And this the Protestants, that be learned be not ignorant of, sor which cause when we obiect that</hi> S. Austen <hi>prayed sor his mothers soule:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lib. 9. cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes cap. 11. 12. 13. Epist. 99. ad Euodiū &amp; 20. de ciuit. cap. 15. Tract. 118 in Ioan. Haeres. 82.</note>
      <hi>that he beleeued Christ to haue descended into that part of hell, called</hi> Limbus patrum, <hi>or</hi> Abrahams bosome, <hi>and deliuered</hi> Adam <hi>from thence, and the rest os the holy fathers: that he thought it necessary to vse the signe of the Crosse: that it was heresy to teach that virginity and marriage were os like merit, and such like points in controuersie: they neuer tell vs, that he retracted these opinions, knowing full wel that no such thing is there to be found: and therfore though this deuise runneth vp and downe in corners, &amp; helpeth sometimes amongest ignorant people, and giueth a prety grace when his booke is not present, yet most</hi>
      <pb n="9" facs="290"/>
      <hi>sure I am that not any of our learned aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries would be willinge to ioyne with vs vpon that yssue, being not ignorāt, that this answeare rather desireth darknes then loueth light: which is the reason as I suppose, that it cōmeth seldome in print: sor except it were once, yf once, neuer did I se any such thinge, though in common conserence it be the common refuge and sanctury. The Protestantes of</hi> Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <hi>burge destitute of a better answer, help out the matter with flatte lying, making</hi> S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin <hi>to reprehende that, which he doth</hi>
      <note place="margin">Centur. cap. 6. co 699.</note>
      <hi>highely commende.</hi> Augustin <hi>(say they)</hi> in his 22. booke of the citie of God, the 8. chapter, concerning the relicks of Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uene writeth, that a superstitious and greate cōcurse of multitudes was made vnto them euene into Affricke, the people being become mad with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine illusions, which were reputed for miracles. <hi>But this ouer-reaching libertie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth their cause to be desperate, and that no sounde answere can be found to auoide so irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable a testimonie: they greatly iniurie that worthy father, he neither calleth those miracles illusions, nor censureth the people for supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious or madde: those termes be slippes of their owne planting: nay what doth he els in that whole chapter▪ but proue that the catholicke</hi>
      <pb n="10" facs="291"/>
      <hi>faith wanteth not miracles? can any then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that he would call them illusions, by which he affirmeth our faith be proued? Peruse (goode reader) the treatise followinge, and I leaue it to thy iudgement whether they had the feare of God before theire eyes, that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned so grosse and gracelesse an inuention. Glorious</hi> S. Austen <hi>then whom so much they admire (notwithstanding these former shiftes) is ours: and the catholike Church, the Apostles and Christe him selfe, is oures: for what doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne he brought from heauen: what the disciples learned of him, and their posterity receiued from them: that did this worthy Father, and the Church of Christ in his time beleeue; VVherof as no good Christian euer made doubt: so doth himselfe affirme in these words with which I will here end.</hi> That which <hi>(the fathers and catholike Doctors)</hi> found in the Church, <note place="margin">Lib. 2. con. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
