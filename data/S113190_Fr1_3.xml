                 <title>A discourse, of marriage and vviuing : and of the greatest mystery therein contained: how to choose a good wife from a bad. An argument of the dearest vse, but the deepest cunning that man may erre in: which is, to cut by a thrid betweene the greatest good or euill in the world. Pertinent to both sexes, and conditions, as well those already gone before, as shortly to enter this honest society. By Alex. Niccholes, Batchelour in the art he neuer yet put in practise</title>

   <head>To the Youth and Batchelary of <hi>England, hote blouds at high Reuels,</hi> which fore-thought of this action, and all other, that hereafter intend this aduenture.</head>
   <l>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>INCE that the meanest blessing in mans life,</l>
   <l>Is not the Dowry of a vertuous wife;</l>
   <l>No otherwise then is the aduerse crosse,</l>
   <l>To him that beares it the most easy losse.</l>
   <l>Therefore to you, whose weary bonds yet keepe,</l>
   <l>Seuering the Armes wherein you long to sleepe;</l>
   <l>That haue before-hand, many a tedious howre,</l>
   <l>Wisht that approaching minute in your powre,</l>
   <l>Which when arriu'd, most slowly brought to passe,</l>
   <l>Cancels but Parchment to inroule in Brasse:</l>
   <l>What not so short a terme of yeares shall end,</l>
   <l>Vnlesse one shew himselfe the kinder friend:</l>
   <l>Wherein, lest your to forward hast should stray,</l>
   <l>Here is beforehand chalked out a way:</l>
   <l>(As conscience craueth, for so large connexion</l>
   <l>Should not be entred in without direction.)</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="4"/>Which who so walkes in to the true intent,</l>
   <l>Shall not commit that action to repent.</l>
   <l>The ignorant by this haue sharper eyes,</l>
   <l>More deeper insight to these misteries,</l>
   <l>And were their vnderstanding darke or blinde,</l>
   <l>To passe this Laborinth 'tis here refinde:</l>
   <l>Here are the Characters insculpt and read,</l>
   <l>That make a happy or a loathed bed.</l>
   <l>What woman is on whom all these depend,</l>
   <l>Her <hi>Vse, Creation, Excellence,</hi> and <hi>End.</hi>
   </l>
   <l>In making choyce how much to be confin'd,</l>
   <l>To <hi>Beauty, Riches, Parentage,</hi> or <hi>Kinde:</hi>
   </l>
   <l>What are the chiefe disturbers of this state,</l>
   <l>That soonest point a man that sorest fate.</l>
   <l>Here are the Rockes discouered to the eye,</l>
   <l>That he that would not shipwracke may saile by.</l>
   <l>And these the rather being aforehand laid,</l>
   <l>Vnballanst pleasures to each youth and maid,</l>
   <l>That when experience shall their sweetnesse tell,</l>
   <l>In stead of heauen they purchase not a hell.</l>
   <l>And that the ioy their forward youth hath sought,</l>
   <l>Vncrosly match'd mry come more neere their thought.</l>
   <l>
      <note place="margin">To those that forbeare mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for more liberty of sin.</note>But you whose lusts this lymit shall not tye,</l>
   <l>For more inlargement to variety,</l>
   <l>That will not any your owne proper call,</l>
   <l>The better interressed to commerse with all.</l>
   <l>As when your Lord and Lady downe are laid,</l>
   <l>Behind the dore to woe the Chamber-maid:</l>
   <l>Or amongst neighbours, where you lead your liues,</l>
   <l>To be the more familliar with ther wiues,</l>
   <l>Or any place where ere you do espye,</l>
   <l>A pretty morsell pleasing to your eye,</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="4"/>To ceize it more suspectlesse, being knowne</l>
   <l>Then hee that hath at home a wife of's owne.</l>
   <l>Well take that blessing, but withall this curse,</l>
   <l>To walke on weake legges with an empty purse.</l>
