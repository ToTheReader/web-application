   <head>A PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His little Booke ensuing, was addressed to Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1537. whiche when I had redde, and well perused (kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the impression almost spente) I dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it worthy a new imprinting, bycause it was written by two auntient Fathers, and learned Diuines, who vouched their authorities from the sacred word of God. Alas, that Arrogācie, which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of al mischiefes, &amp; direction to most heresies and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the denial I meane of the supremacie of the Quéene, far surpasseth all other Heresies and Treasons, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance, bringeth destruction of body &amp; soule. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit (the more to be lamented) it is ouer rife in <hi>England,</hi> for it is not only y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> opinion of diuers old men, but of many yong mē, which are destitute of learning, voyde of grace, &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of knowledge, and yet hold opinion, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is, and ought to be the supreme head. What blinde sorte of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill disposed Papistes be they? nay rather, what Romishe Rebels are they? which (contrarie to the word of God) had rather haue a forraigne <hi>Pope</hi> their head, than oure most dread and soueraigne Lady, the Quéenes most excellente Maiestie, whose Subiectes naturallie we are, vnder whose obeysance we are borne, vnder whose protection we liue, and vnder whose mightie power (next God) we rest defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from all forraigne Enimies, in suche sorte, as by the lawes of God, by the lawes of Nature, and by the lawes of the Realme, we are bounde to obey hir, and none other. These things considered, I can not but maruell how those Papistes dare so presumptuouslie extoll that enimie of Christe, the <hi>Pope,</hi> as to call hym <hi>Gods Vicar on earth.</hi> What <hi>Pope</hi> hath coniured them? or what Deuill hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched them, that they are so mightilie affected to the <hi>Pope?</hi> and so slenderlie regard their naturall liege Lady the


<pb facs="4"/>
Quéenes Maiestie? Sure I am, that by denying the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, they haue broughte themselues into <hi>Premunire,</hi> and from thence grow into farther mischiefes, from whēce their holy Father the <hi>Pope,</hi> with all his Colledge of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, can not deliuer them. And what else commeth of this Papisticall Religion, but murmuring, contention, strife, sedition, rumors, lewde practises, and priuie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies, to put discord amongst them that liue in peace, and lastly open Rebellion, if they were able to bring it to passe? For want of which habilitie, they nowe vse Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Coniuration, Nicromancie, Piromancie, and Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, wherto they attribute great credite. They séeke out Witches and Sorcerers wheresoeuer they may be found throughout Christendome. Their determinations and elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siōs they hold in great priee, and with their diuelish crafts, they séeke to delude thée, and all the Subiectes of the Quéenes most excellente Maiestie. Wherefore, I wishe all menne to beware, howe they kéepe company wyth Papistes: for euen as the Lepres infect others with theyr foule disease: so doe the Papists infect many, with their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiferous euill councell, and worse example. They resemble likewise the venemous Toade: for as the foule Toade can not abyde the swéete tast of the fruitefull Uine, so can not they abide the true tast of the doctrine of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uioure Christe, the flourishing Uyne of eternall life, but wrest the sacred Scriptures, to serue their turnes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the <hi>Pope</hi> aboue Emperour and Kings, falsehoode before truth, darkenesse before light, ignoraunce before knowlege, a Masse no Communion, a Dirge no Sermon, a Concubine no Wife, Bulles and baggages, before the sincere word of God.<note place="margin">
         <hi>The figures of these are sette out at large in this Booke, as in perusing thou shalte finde.</hi>
      </note> And our English fugitiue, runnagate Papistes, whiche are beyonde the Seas, sende into this Realme of <hi>Englande,</hi> Bulles, Pardons, Beades, Latin Primers, Papisticall Books, Superaltares, Pictures of Sainctes, hallowed Graynes, Crosses, <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> wyth Sainct <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell in them: and thrée or four droppes of


<pb facs="4"/>
Balme, Font water, and of a hallowed Candle, done by the <hi>Pope,</hi> dothe make all these holy Reliques: so as (I thinke) if the paring of the <hi>Popes</hi> nayles were sente into <hi>England,</hi> it would be thought no small iewell amongst the Papists. But let this passe, and sée nowe what oure home Papistes sende them againe. I wéepe to write: they cause, that many Gentlemen, and some of greate Worship, doe send their sons to <hi>Doway,</hi> to the Uniuersitie of <hi>Louaine,</hi> to <hi>Rheynes,</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> yea, and some to <hi>Rome,</hi> to nuzel them in Idolatrie, and roote them in Papistrie. And great are the summes of mony, whiche yearely goe hence for the finding and maintayning of those yong Gentlemē: and farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the charge whiche relieueth the Papistes that are there, for the number is greate, and they are very liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and boūtifully rewarded out of <hi>England</hi> by the Papists here: For many Papists sell their lands, and employ their great summes of money in banke, contrary to the expresse word of God,<note place="margin">The Iewes entred in the time of King <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1067. and were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled in the raigne of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the firste. 1291.</note> as the Iewes did in the time of King <hi>Williā</hi> the conqueror, &amp; employ the foule increase or vsurie therof, to the reliefe of other Papists beyond sea. Moreouer, their Buls, pardons, and such other néedlesse, or rather damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble baggage, trash, &amp; trumperies, are ouer dearly bought, althoughe indéede they be nothing worth, nay worse than naught. For in the raigne of Quéene <hi>Mary,</hi> I my selfe did know a Gentlewoman, that gaue .xx. pound for a Bull that she might not come to Church, yet was shée as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike as the beste of that sorte: but the matter was, for that the priest of the parish and she were fallen out. Truly that Bull was a fit Make for a Cowe, or hir charitie, and aswel worth .xx. pound, as an Owle is worth an ounce of fine gold: and euen of that value be the rest of his Bulles, pardons, and sanctimonies, and graunted vppon as greate considerations. For it is bruted by the Papistes, that the traiterous varlet <hi>Feltō</hi> is canonized for a Saint at <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; so was <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> a Prelate, as traiterous, as <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> the Papist was: but <hi>Felton</hi> obtained the Popes great


<pb facs="5"/>
grace, for the setting vp of a Bull, which then was newly brought into <hi>England,</hi> and for his reward, was faire han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, drawen, and quartered (and had no more harme:) yet that Bull begat many Calues, both Bull Calues, and Cow Calues, whiche it is high time to wayne, for they make suche a bleating, that no man can take rest, or lyue quietly by them, vnlesse peraduenture they receyue the Bulles rewarde. And if it be true that <hi>Felton</hi> is Saincted, then is it for his Treason sake. And what Traytor then would not loue such a <hi>Pope</hi> as can make Saincts of Diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Traytors? or who can but feare suche a <hi>Pope,</hi> as can make Diuels of Saincts? for with his holy pardons (if he lie not) he maketh Sainctes, and with his terrible curses (if he say true) he maketh Diuels, so as Sainctes and Diuels are at his pleasure. And the <hi>Pope</hi> can do more than this too, for he can send Soules to Heauen, and take Soules out of Purgatorie, for that (as he sayeth) is the bayting place by the way to Heauen, or to hell. And what is that the <hi>Pope</hi> can (not) do? forsooth nothing at all: for as great is his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and power in making of Sainctes, as a Coblers skill and arte is, to make Mappes of the whole World: And I beléeue there are as manye Sainctes in Heauen made by the <hi>Popes,</hi> as there are blacke Swannes swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the Thames. But for all the <hi>Popes</hi> magnificence, and superabundant authoritie, I had rather be a Collyer at <hi>Croyden,</hi> than a <hi>Pope</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> for in my iudgement, it is better to haue a blacke body like a Collier, than a blacke Soule like a <hi>Pope,</hi> for vnlesse the <hi>Pope</hi> washe himselfe cleane in the bloud of Christ, with the droppes and teares of repentance, onely trusting in the merites of Christes Passion (which he can not allow sufficient to saluation) hée shall neuer sée the ioyes of Heauen, but in post hast he must néedes goe to his second Sea and patrimonie in Hel, to the blacke féend Lucyfer his fellow companion for Pride, and whose faithfull Uicar he approueth himselfe héere: for as


<pb facs="5"/>
all men know, in Hell there is no redemption. Now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude &amp; demaund, what foolish senselesse Papistes are, they that beléeue the <hi>Pope</hi> can help them, where he can not help himselfe? for we beléeue in God, who sayeth, <hi>Subditi estote omni humanae ordinationi propter Dominum, siue Regi tanquam praecellenti. &amp;c. Be subiect to all humane ordinance for the Lords sake, whether it be to the King,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Pet. Epist.</hi> 1▪ <hi>Cap.</hi> 2▪</note>
      <hi>or to the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. &amp;c.</hi> making the King to be most excellent vnder God, by which words of Sainct <hi>Peter,</hi> it is manyfest that <hi>Peter</hi> did not chalenge to himselfe any primacie: why then should we yéelde it to the <hi>Pope,</hi> that only chalēgeth (and yet wrōg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie) to be the successor of <hi>Peter?</hi> No no, it is the right, and next God, belongeth to our most dread soueraigne Lady the Quéenes Maiestie (whome God long preserue) and to none other, through all, or any hir Highnesse Realmes or Dominions. And againe, by special prouision or <hi>Premunire Anno.</hi> 16. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 5. it is set downe, that such as purchace or pursue in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> Bulles, Instrumentes, or suche like, shall be out of the Quéenes protection: yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that both the Lawes of God and Man are against it, Papistes will be Papistes, spéede as they spéede may. Whereto I pray thée (gentle Reader) haue a speciall regard, and amongst the rest, marke our double faced Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, whiche <hi>Ianus</hi> like, in Court, and else-where, doe make their boast to be the Quéenes Maiesties faithfull subiects, comparable with the best Protestantes: but when it commes to the tryall and touchstone, to know what they thinke of the Supremacie, then they cleaue to the <hi>Pope,</hi> hauing no feare of God, no loue to the Quéene, nor no dread of iustice: for in denying the Supremacie, they take from the Quéenes Highnesse hir Maiestie, regall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the due obeysance which she ought to haue of hyr Subiectes▪ and most trayterouslie they renounce theyr faith, loyaltie, seruice, and obedience, whiche they owe to hir excellencie, so as they make thēselues quicke sacrifices


<pb facs="6"/>
to the Deuill, and manyfest Traytoures to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Quéene. For to saye the truth, Papistes were the cause of the last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the North, whyche was the ouerthrowe of the auntiente house of <hi>Westmerlande,</hi> and the deathe of the Earle of <hi>Northumberlande,</hi> and manye other, as <hi>Norton, Markamvielde,</hi> and others, whyche haue steyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with Treason, and vndone their houses for euer. There were also at that time many Bayliffes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables, to the number of thrée hundred or vpwarde han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, whiche well deserued it, in that they commaunded menne in the Quéenes name, to goe to that Campe, the Camp where the Rebels lay. But Northerne men may say, <hi>that euill is that camping where the Gallowes winnes the Goale.</hi> These thyngs will not be forgotten in the <hi>North</hi> partes these hundreth yeares. And therefore take héede Papistes, and thinke that Northerne men will not Rebell, for they haue payde for their learning. You maye not vaunt as you were wont to doe, saying, you were sure that all the <hi>North</hi> would take your partes, for if you make your reckning so, you recken without your hoste, for ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lordes nor Lurdeynes can rayse them, withoute commaundemente from the Prince. Therefore (good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes) vouchsafe to reade this little Booke, whereby you may learne to obey the Quéenes Highnesse truely, and to detest the <hi>Popes</hi> fayned holynesse vtterly.</p>
   <p>Thys little Booke or Letter, was written in <hi>Anno</hi> 1537. and in the thirtith yeare of the Raigne of our late Soueraigne Lorde of famous memorie, Kyng <hi>HENRYE</hi> the eyght, at what time <hi>Reginalde Poole</hi> was made Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, for <hi>Cosma</hi> and <hi>Damian,</hi> by <hi>Paule</hi> the third, Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> so as the Papistes can not mislike it for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie, for it carieth some antiquitie, and was written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue fortie yeares sithence. Thus for my part, I fare like hym whiche hathe founde a Purse or Capcace of another mans, and then like a playne true dealing man, maketh


<pb facs="6"/>
enquirie who is the owner of it. Euen so doe I cause thys little Booke to bée newe Printed, that the right owners may be knowen. And sithence they be dead long agoe, that the Quéenes good Subiectes maye haue it amongst them, as the authoures meante it in their lyfe time. And thus I ende, praying God to endue hir Maiestie with perfecte health and all felicitie, long and triumphantly to raigne and rule ouer vs, and to turne the heartes of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, and to make them all good Subiects, to the glorie of God, and strength of the Realme. <hi>Amen.</hi>
