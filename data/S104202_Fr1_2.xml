   <p>I Commend here vnto thy che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and Godly loue Christiane Reader / the ten cōmaundementes of allmightie God / wroten Exod. 20. and Deut. 5. the wiche were yeuen to this vse / an end / diligently to be lernid / and religiouslie obseruid Deu. 4. Mat. 7. My mynde / and commentaris in them I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seche the to reade withe iudgment / and yeue sen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence withe knolege: as Idout nothing at all of thi cheryte / or godd willing hart towardes me / and all well meaning persones. But for asmou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che as there can be no contract / peace / aliaunce / or confederacye betwene too persones or more / except fyrst the persones that will cōtract / agre within them selfes vpon souche thinges as shal be contractyd / as thow right well knowyst: also seyng these ten commaundementes / ar nothing else but the Tables or wrytinges that contayne the conditions of the peace betwene God and man Gen. 19. and declarithe at large / how / and to what the persones namyd in the wrytinges ar bounde unto the other: Gene. 17.22. Iere. 7. I wilbe God / and you shalbe my people. God and man ar knyt to gather / and vnyt in one. It is necessary to know / how God / and man was made at one / that souche conditions could be
<pb facs="3"/>
agreyed upon and confirmyd withe souche so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempne / an publicke euidences / as these tables be / wroten withe the finger of God. The conten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes wherof byndithe God to ayede / and succur / kepe / and preserue / warrant / and defend man from all yle boothe of body and solle / and at the last to yeue him eternall blysse and euerlasting felicite: Exod. 19. Deut. 4. Matt. 11. Ioan. 3.4.5.6. Man bounde of the other part to obey / ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue / and kepe Godes commaundemētes / to loue him / honor him / and fere him aboue all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Were there not loue / an Amite betwene God and man fyrst / thone would not bind him selfe to be master / nother the other to be seruaūt in souche a frendlye / and blyssid sotiete / and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowshipp as these tables cōtayne. Before ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were yeuen / gode commaundyd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to go downe from the mount Synai vnto the people / to know of them / whether they wold confederat / and entre alyaunce withe hym or not: Exod. 19. Moses did the messayge as God bade hym / where vnto the people all to gather consentyd. So that is was fully agreyd vpon that God shuld be there God / and they his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uannes / with certayne conditions / contayning thoffice of them boothe: God to make them a pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>culier people / to prefer them aboue all natiōs of the erthe / to make thē a prynceli prysthode / and a holy people.</p>
   <p>There offyce to obey / and obserue his holy will and pleasure: Deut. 4. Exod. 19.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>Here se we the aliaunce and confederacye made Betwen God and man / and the wrytin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes yeuen: like wyce how it was made. But wherfore it was made / and for who is merites / yet by these textes we se not: wy God shuld loue man that so neglectid his commaundementes / fauoryd and louyd / beliuyd and / trustyd better the deuyll then God: Genes. 3. so farre offendyd the deuine maiestie of God / and degeneratid from grace / and godlynis by custome of sinne and contempt of God / that he bewalyd / and re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pentyd that euer he made man: Gene. 6. and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creyd to destroy the creature man / that he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyd / as he did in dede. Not onlye thus destroing man / but also protestid openlye / that better it had ben Iudas neuer to haue bin born / Matt. 26. and in the 25. chapiter of the same Gospell / the displeasure of God is declaryd so great / that he apoyntithe man to an other / end then he was creatid for: saing / depart ye doers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite from me vnto eternall fyre / preparyd / not for man but for the deuill / and his Angelles. What is now more contrary one to the other / and farther at debate / then God and man / that now we se bound in lege to gather / as very fren<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des. Moses Deut. 9. shewithe / that onlye mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy prouokyd God vnto this aliance / to receaue them into grace / deliuer thē out of Egypt / and to possesse the plentous lond of Canaan: farther that God found iust mater and occation to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse thin habitantes of that land / and found
<pb facs="4"/>
no merites in thisraelites to yeue it them / for they wer a styffeneckid people / and intractable as Moses laythe / to there cherge / Deu. 9. How be it God hauyng respect only vnto his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses made vnto Adame / Abraham / and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterite: mesuryd not his mercye according to the merites of man / who was nothing but sinne / lokyd all waies apō the iustice / and deseruings / innocensie / and perfectiō of the blyssid sede pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misid vnto Adame / Gene. 3. and vnto Abrahā / Gene. 12.15.17. God put the deathe of Christ as amenes and arbiter of this peace / Ebre. 9. For the Testament auaylythe not except it be confyr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myd by the dethe of him that makithe the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the whiche deathe in the iudgmēt of God was acceptyd as a satisfaction for sinne from the beginning of Adames falle / as Paule say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the / Christes prysthed was and is like vnto Mel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dizedeck / that had nether begin̄ing nor ending: bound nether to time nether to place / as the pris<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hed of Aron. but as God accomptid in Adams sinne all man kind beyng in his loynes / worthy deathe: so he accomptyd in Christ all to be sauyd from deathe / Apoca. 13. as Adame declarithe by the Name of his wief / callyd here Heua / the mother of the liuing and not of the ded: Gene. 3. All these promises / and other that appertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nid vnto the saluation of Adame and his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite / were made in Christ and for Christ onlye: and appertainid vnto our fathers / and vs / as we appertainid vnto Christ▪ he is the dore / the
<pb facs="4"/>
waie and the liffe: Ioan. 10. he onlie is the media<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tour betwene God and man / with out whom noman can com to the fader celestiall: Ioan. 1.3.6. Because the promises of God appertainid vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to oure fathers / for asmouche as they like wyce vnto Chryst: hether vnto and for euer they were preseruyd from Hell and the paynes dewe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Adames sinne in him / for who is sake the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was made. The meanes of oure peace and reconsiliation with God / is only in Christ / as Esai saithe capit. 53. by who is passion we ar ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de hole. Therfore Christ is callyd by Iohan the Baptist / The lamme that takythe awaye the sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne of the wrrold. Ioan. 1. and as the deuyll foūd nothing in Christ that he could eondēne / Io. 14. likewyce now / he hathe nothing in vs worthy damnation / be cause we be comprehendid / and fully inclosyd in hym / for we be his by faythe. Al these that be comprehendid vnder the promes / belong onto Christ. And as far extendithe the vertew / and strenghe of Godes promes to sawe man: as the rigoure and iustice of the law for sinne to damne man. For as by the offence and sinne of one man / deathe was extendid and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de commune vnto all men vnto condemnation / as Paule saythe / Rom. 5. so by the iustice of one / is deriuid lyffe into all men to iustificatiō. The wordes of the promes made vnto Adame and Abraham / confirmithe the same▪ They ar those.

sede / and heresede shall breake thy he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Gene. 3. for as we were in Adame before his falle / and shuld if he had not synnyd byne of the same innocense and prefection that he was creatyd in: so were we in his loynes whē he syn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nid / and participant of his synne. And as we were in hym and partakers of the ile: so were we in hym when god made him a promese of grace and part takers of the same grace: not as the chyldren of Adame / but as the chylder of the promise. As the synne of Adame withe out pruylege or exception extentyd / and appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyd vnto all Adames / and euery of Adames po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sterite / so dyd this promis of grace generally appertaine as well to euery and singuler of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dames postetite as to Adame: as it is more play<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nely expressid Gene. 15.17. Where god promisy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the to blysse in the sede of Abraham / all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the worold. And Paule makythe no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersite in Christ / of jew / nor Gentile. Ferther it was neuer for bid / but that all sortes of people and of euery progeny in the worold to be made part takers of the jewes religion and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis. farther saynt Paule Ro. 5. Doothe by colla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of Adame and Chryst / synne and grace: thus interpretat Godes promes. And makith not Christ inferiour to Adame / nor grace vnto synne. If all then shalbe sauid / what is to be sai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de of those that sainct Peter spekith of 2. Pet. 2. that shall perishe for there false doctrine.

that ledythe to liue / and feu entre: Matth. 7. Thus the scripture answerithe: that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mese of grace apperteynithe vnto euery sort of men in the worold / and comprehendithe them all / how be it within certaine limetes / and bon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des: the whiche if men neglect / or passe ouer / they exclude them selfes from the promes in Christ. As Chain was nomore excludid till he excludid hymselfe / then Abel: Saul then Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid: Iudas then Peter: Esau / then Iacob: thowgh Mala. 1. Ro. 9. it semithe that the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God was yeuen to sawe the one / and to damne the other / before thone louid God / or the other hatid God. How be it these thretenin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God against Esau if he had not of his wilful malice excludid himselfe / from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of grace / shuld nomore haue hindrid his saluation / then Godes threteninges against Niniue Ion. 1. whyche not withstonding that God saide shuld be destroiede within xl. daies stode agreat tyme after / and dyd penence.

And that his liefe and conuersation was not as agreable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to iustice and equite / as Iacobes: the sentence of God vnto Rebeka Gene. 25. was not in the fault / but his one malice: for there is mencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nid nothing at all in that place Gene. 25. that Esau was disheretyd of eternall liffe but that he shuld be inferioure vnto his brother Iacob
<pb facs="6"/>
in this worold whiche prophecye was fulfyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid in there posterites / and not in the persones them selfes. Of this acceptation of the one / and reprobation of the other conserning the prome<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sis of the Erthe spekithe Malachie the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te / as the beginnyng of his booke declarith spea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king in this wice.

Not withstonding I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid Iacob and hatid Esau. Wherin hatid god Esau? the prophete shewithe. I haue made his possession that was the mountes (seir) desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te / as a desert or wyldernys of dragones / Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachie 1. the whiche happenid in the time of Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>buchodonosor. Wherin he louyd Iacob the text declarithe. God transferryd the right and title that appertaynid vnto Esau the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther to Iacob the yonger. like wice the lōd that was promisid vnto Abraham and Isaac / was by legacy and Testament / yeuē vnto Iacob and his posterites / Gene. 25. an 27. Sainct Paule Rom. 9. vsithe this example of Iacob and Esau for none other purpose but to take away from the Iewes / the thyng that they moost putt here trust in. to say / the vaine hope they had in the carnall linaige / and naturall discent from the familie and houshol of Abraham. and likewice there false confidence they had in te kepyng of the law of Moses. Pauls hole purpose is in that Epistole / to bring man vnto a knolege of his sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
<pb facs="6"/>
/ and to shew him how it may be remittid: and with many testimonis and Examples of the scripture / he prouithe man to be sauid only by mercy / for the Merites of Christ. Whiche is apprehendid and receuid by faithe: as he at lar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge shewithe cap. 3.4.5. of the same Epistole.</p>
   <p>In the vnderstonding of the whiche thre Chapiters aryght / is requyryd a singuler and exact diligence: for it semythe by those places that paule concludythe / and in maner inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dythe the dyuyne grace / and promys of God within certayne termes and lymytes / that only Chryst schuld be effycacyous and profetable in those / that apprehend and receaue this aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant grace by faythe: and to souche as hathe not the vse of faythe / Christ / nether godes grace to appertayne. Now seing no man by reason of this Naturall incredulyte born / and begoten withe vs Rom. 11. Gal. 3. can belyue and put souche confydence in God as he requyrythe by his Law / as experience of oure awne weke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis declarithe / thowghe man haue yers and tyme to belyue / the promes of God in chryst ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaynythe vnto noman. This Sentence is playne Marke the laste chapiter. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuythe not / schalbe dānid. How be it we know by the scrypture / that not withe stonding this imperfection of faythe / many shalbe sauyd / and likewyce / not with stondyng that Godes promes be generall vnto all people of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold / Mat. 11. Rom. 11. 1. Tim. 2. Gene. 3. yet ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny

shalbe damnyd. These too poyntes therfore must be diligentlye discussyd. fyrst how this faythe / being vnperfeit / is acceptid of god: thē how we be excludyd from the promes of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce / that extendithe to all men.</p>
   <p>I will not reherse now the myndes of other / but as briuely and simple as I can / declare the mind of the scripture in this mater. Sainct Paule callithe this seruitude of sinne / natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali remaining in oure nature corruptid / som<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tymes apethian / then amartian / at an othere time asthenean. The first word signifiythe an impersuasibilite / diffidence / incredulite / con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumatie or inobedience. The second signifiythe Errour / sinne or decete. The Third betokenithe wekenes / imbecillyte / or imperfection. so wry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tithe Paule. 1. Cor. 15. mannis body to be first borne in imperfection / or imbecillite. Also that God concludithe allmen vnder infidelite. Ro. 11. In the Epistole to the Galathiens capit. 3. He saithe that the scripture doothe conclude all men vnder sinne. in those thre places thow mayst se the thre wordes that I rehersid before withe the whiche Paule describithe the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites of man. whiche infirmites / Esai 53. Io. 1 Soothe testifie that they ar translatid into Christ. Not so that we shuld be clene deliuerid from them / as thowghe they were ded in oure nature / or oure nature / changid or shuld not prouoke us oni more to ile: but that they shuld not damne vs / bicause Christ satisfied for thē
<pb facs="7"/>
in his awne bodie. And Paule saithe. Rom. 5. that Christ died for sinners whiche were infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: and callithe those synners thennimies of God. how beyt / he callythe not them Theosty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas in the scripture / that is to say cōtemnours of God. Euery man is callid in the scripture wickid / and thennimie of God / for the priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and lacke of faithe / an loue / that he owithe vnto God. <hi>Et impij uocantur qui nō omnino sunt pij.</hi> that is to say / they ar callid wickid that in all thinges honorithe not god / beliuithe not in God / and obseruithe his commaundemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes as they shuld do / whiche we cannot do / by reason of this naturall infirmite / or hatred of the fleshe (as Paule Callithe it Ro. 8.) against God. In this sense takithe Paule this worde wickid / Rom. 5. when he saithe that Christ died for the wickid. So must we interpretat sainct Paule and take his wordes / Or els noman shuld be damnid. Now we know that Paule him selfe / Saint Iohn / and Christ / damnythe the contemprours of God / or souche as willin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glij cotinew in sinne / and will not repent. Ma. 12. Mar. 3. Luce 12. Paul Rom. 8.1. Corint. 5.2. Co. 6.2. Pe. 1. Those the scripture excludithe fro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me the generall promis of grace. Thou seist by the places afore rehersid that thowghe we can not belyue in God as vndourttidly as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirid / by reason of this oure naturall sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis / and diseace: yet for Christes sake / in the iudgment of God / we ar accōptid as faithfull
<pb facs="8"/>
fydeles for whoys sake thys naturall dyseace and syckenys ys pardonyd by what name so euer Sainct Paule callithe thes naturall infirmite / or Originall sinne in man / And this imperfection or naturall sickenis taken of Ada<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me / excludithe not the person feom the promis of God in Christ / except we transgresse the limi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mites / and boundes of this Oryginall synne / by oure awne folie / and malice / and ether of a contempt / or hate of Godes worde we fall into synne / and transforme our selfes into the yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ige of the deuill. Then we exclude by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes oure selfes frome the promises and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Christ / who only receuid oure infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes / and Originall diseace: and not the contēpt of him / and his law. farther the promes apper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine to souche as repent. Therfore Esai Capit. 53. said without excepcion / that the infirmites of all men were cast vpon his Blessid shulders It is oure office therfore to se / we exclude not oureselfes from te generall grace / promisyd to all men. It is nat a Chrystiane mannes part to attribute his saluation to his awne frewill / withe the pelagion / and extenuat originall sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne. Nor to make God thauctor of ile / and oure damnatiō / withe the Maniche. Nor yet to say / God hathe wrotē fatall Lawes as the Stoicke and withe necessite of desteny / uiolently pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithe one by the here in to heauen / and thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stithe thother hedling into hell. But assertaine thy selfe by the scripture / what be the causes of
<pb facs="8"/>
reprobation / and what of Election. The cause of reiection / or damnation is sinne in man / whiche will not hire / nether receaue / the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the gospelle: or else after he hathe recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid it / by accustomid doing of ile / he fall ether in a contempt of the gospell / will not studie to liue there after / or else hatiht the gospell because it condemnithe his vngodly liefe. And would therwere nether God / not gospell to punishe him for doing of ile. This sentence is trew how so euer man iudge of predestination. God is not the cause of sinne / nor wold not haue mā to sinne / Psalm. 5. <hi>Non Deus uolens iniquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, tu es.</hi> That is to say. thow art not the God that willyt he sinne. Osee. 13. it is said: Thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion o Israel is of thy selfe: and thy succur only of me. The cause of oure electiō is the mercy of God in Christ / Ro. 9. How be it / he that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be part taker of this election / must receaue the promes in Christ by faithe: for therfore we be ele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctid: because afterward we ar made the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of Christ: Ephe. 1.
