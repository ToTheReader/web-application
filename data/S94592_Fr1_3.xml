      <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Xperiēce the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Tyme, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Wisedom, the rewarde of trauell, and the onely iewell of a fewe the wiser, is commonly good Reader sette out at so high a price, &amp; valewed at so deare a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyworth, that she hath euer moe cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners then Chapmen, moe lookers on her, then likers of her: and yet is she bought of some, though one dram of her cost them a whole pound of repentance. To discende into the particulars, were but to tye thee to awearisome tale, and to leade thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long through a tedious Laborinth, stuft full of examples of former age: a matter alreadie so open to the viewe of the whole world, that for me to stirre farther ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, were but to sette a light Candle in the bright sunn. Onely for proof, it may please thee good Reader to admitte the instance in my self. When I began first to shake hāds with the varietie of delightes, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayed
<pb facs="8"/> youth, are commonly caried awaie with: &amp; looking back (as it were ouer my shoulder) saw the vast Sea of sugered mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series that I had waded through: I then began to thinke it high tyme to set doune a surer compasse to direct the remnant of the course that I haue yet to runne. And although at that tyme I caried in my purse sufficient wealth to support my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, in my bodie sufficiēt health to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine my life: and these both so reasonable as might haue satisfied a reasonable man, (were not <hi>Natura hominū nouitatis aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>) yet found I neither such content in the one, nor the other, as might longer cōtent me to continue in that state. But drawne on a while by this instinct or infection (I know not whither to call it) I was driuen at last by a greedy kinde of Ielosie, to enuie the store that I saw in others, in respect of mine owne penurie: and therwithall I fell into consideration how I might become one of the small nomber of those, whō the
<pb facs="8"/> greatest number wondred at. To enter the straight path that many the learned had happely to their greate commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perfectly troden, I saw it almoste vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible: vnlesse peraduenture I should get me where the Muses dwell, to Oxforde and Cambridge: and there puttyng my self a prentize seuen yeares, to the seuen libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sciences, might afterwarde become as long iourney man I can not tell to whome: &amp; in the end (as too many the learned do) get I can not tel what. This course yeelded so course a liking, as I soner passed ouer it, then into it: and castyng about again with my self, I was combred with a hundreth other odde crochettes, all as farre beyond the compasse of my reache, as they were shorte of the condition of my liking: till at length in the midst of this muse, I mette in my mynde with two suche Minions, as in my conceipt were the onely Paragons of the rest: the one gallant and gorgeous gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with golde and siluer, bedect with
<pb facs="9"/> iewelles, sole Ladie and gouernesse of all the riche Mynes and Mineralles that are in the bowelles of the yearth: the other sweete and odoriferous, adorned with flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers &amp; hearbes, beautified with delicate Spices, sole Ladie and regent of all the pleasant thinges that growe vpon the face of the yearth. These I vowed to serue and to honour, euen to the losse of life and lim: neither haue I greatly broken promise with thē, though they haue not kept touch with me. Goodly and many golden Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines they promised me, mary hitherto haue scantly performed any leaden Mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilles. But howsoeuer the bargaine stande betweene them and me, I am neither dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to accuse them, nor to excuse my self. We agreed vpon wages, and I weare their liueries: their cognisance such as it is, I beare wheare I am not ashamed to showe it: diuers and sondrie their affaires haue thei employed me in, in the whiche I haue faithfully, painfully, and chargeably
<pb facs="9"/> applied my self, &amp; haue attained by their instructions (to myne owne destruction almoste) many their hidden secretes as well in Metalles, and Mineralles, as in Hearbes and Spices: parte wherof I haue diligently collected together, and for non paiment of my boordwages at their hands am forced to set them with the residewe of my skill to sale, with offer to thee (good Reader) of preferment to the best thinges I haue: yet at a far easier price then they cost me, beyng no lesse my <hi>Sūma Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> cast vp, and the foote of my accompt set doune, then the wastyng out of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer health, and the wearyng of the little wealth I had. So that what experiences soeuer I haue digged out of harde stones, blowne out from hot fire, raked out from foule ashes, with greate cost and greater trauaile, that hast thou heare in my booke to see, and in my shop to vse with greate ease at thy commaundement.</p>
