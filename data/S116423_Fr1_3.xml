      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Finde in the Booke of GOD, (most gentle Reader) that a<note place="margin">Mat. 10 32. 33 and Psal. 119. 46.</note> man shoulde not be ashamed to speake of the testimonies of the Lorde, yf it were before Kinges: as also a charge ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 1. 2.</note> that a man shoulde not let to delyuer those glorious thynges whiche hee hath heard of by many witnesses, to iust and faythfull men: to the intent that they also might be able to teach, and to delyuer the same vnto others, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 9. 10. and. 6 6. to 10. and Ioel. 1. 3.</note> as other Prophetes commaunde, saying: <hi>Tell you your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of them, and let your children shew to their children, and their children to an other generation.</hi> For as much then as I finde suche a charge there geuen, I thinke it no shame to speake thereof at this time vnto you: but holde my selfe bounde, according<note place="margin">Math. 25. 15. to 31. and Deut. 6. 6. to 10.</note> to that talent which God hath geuen me, to make a rehearsall of those glorious thinges which to me haue been reuealed: to the intent that you also may come to the Booke of God, where you shalbe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with such a cloude of heauenly witnesses, both of perfect skill and also willingnes, that yf you will, you may be made able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe at large vnto others, both the wysedome, prayse, power, glory, and state of that euerlastyng King and kingdome. Therefore as some haue sayd vnto me: Come and see the Booke of God, for there shall you finde the Messias: yea there shall you finde that gloryous King, whose wysedome is so great, that it farre exceedeth the wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<note place="margin">1. Kinges 4. 29. to end,</note> of all the sonnes of the East, or of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Nay, there shall you see him whose wysedome so much excelleth other mens, that it farre surmounteth the wysedome eyther of <hi>Ethan, Heman Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole,</hi> or <hi>Derda.</hi> I say, as some haue sayde vnto me: Come and see the booke of God, that so you may beholde this glorious King, whose fame is spread throughout all the nations, euen so throughout this litle Discourse, say I vnto you: Therefore yf you will so do, I doubt
<pb facs="4"/>
not but that you wyll say the lyke vnto others, and also say vnto me, it was a true report indeede that we heard of by you, concernyng<note place="margin">1. Kinges 10.</note> the wysedome of this King, and also the glory of his kingdome: how be it we scarce beleeued it, vntyll we came, and that our owne eyes had seene it. But now we perceyue that you tolde vs not the one halfe of the wysedome of this great King, nor yet of the glory of his kingdome: for indeede it farre surmounteth the fame that we heard thereof by you. Therfore happy are those men that stande in the courtes of this King: yea thrise happy are his seruauntes, which alwayes stande before his presence to heare his wysedome: I meane<note place="margin">Math. 12. 42. &amp; Luke 11. 31.</note> in the presence of that heauenly King, who farre excelleth <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> euen <hi>Salomon,</hi> who so farre surmounted those aforenamed, and in whose presence is the fulnes of all ioy and gladnes. But yf you wyll not come to heare the wysedome of this great King, nor yet to see the glorie of his kingdome which so farre excelleth <hi>Salomons,</hi> he hath pronounced with his owne mouth, that the Queene of the <hi>South</hi> shall ryse in iudgement against you. And this is the summe of my lytle and vnlearned Treatise. Therefore yf you looke vnto the booke of God, whether this my vnskilfull draught woulde drawe you, I shall thinke my laboure well bestowed, and you your selfe shall remayne no longer, as that lytle Syster which hath no brestes: but<note place="margin">Can. 8. 8. Can. 4. 2.</note> you shall be lyke that flocke of Sheepe, where not one is barren a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them: and as that florishyng Tree fast planted by the Riuer side, whose leafe shall euer shew it selfe most fresh and greene, euen<note place="margin">Psal. 1. 1. Kinges 7. 21. &amp; Apoc. 3. 12. Can. 4. 4.</note> to the bringing foorth of fruite in great abundance. And moreouer you shall be then as a Pillar in the house of the Lorde your God, and also as the Towre of <hi>Dauid</hi> most strongly buylt for your owne defence, and shall continually remayne in the eyes of this <hi>Salomon</hi> as one that findeth peace. The which peace, the Lord graunt you<note place="margin">Can. 8. 10.</note> may speedely inioy.</p>
