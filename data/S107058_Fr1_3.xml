   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will not tediously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face touching either the <hi>occasion</hi> of this Treatise, which wee may finde in the first Chapter; or any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular else that may be passed ouer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preiudice to You, or Me. I haue only these things wherof to advertize you, before yee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the booke it selfe.</p>
   <p n="1">
      <hi>1</hi> I am certainly informed that some, hauing intelligence of my purpose of pubishing this worke, (which is tbe summe of sundry Lectures deliuered in mine owne<note place="margin">S. Magnus London.</note> Charge) spare not to giue out that <hi>this is not the same which I preached.</hi> I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at their confidence and vncharitablenesse, forasmuch as I am sure that, at the time of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such their proclamation, they neither saw one line of my booke, nor knew what it containes.
<pb facs="6"/> Only in generall, some of them haue heard it by Iudicious and eminent Divines, to be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Orthodox:</hi> which it seemes, doth not a little trouble them, because they haue divulged the contrary, of my Sermons. Howeuer they, by this, make it appeare before hand, that they are resolued not to permit this tract to goe without a scratcht face, so soone as their nailes can come at it. I am therfore constrained for defence thereof to avouch, that I can (if need require) make it good by aboue <hi>500</hi> Witnesses, that I haue beene so punctuall in setting downe, in this booke, the maine position which I first deliuered that I haue put it into the very same termes formerly vsed, without the least variation. I willingly confesse, that in the prosecution of the point, I haue here added some things by way of further illustration; and some also, for more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple confirmation; and pressed some obiections further then the streights of time would then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. And if for this I be to blame, let wise men iudge.</p>
   <p n="2">
      <hi>2</hi> Whereas most of the obiections pordu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and answered in this treatise, haue beene
<pb facs="6"/> first vrged vpon me in private conference, or sent me in writing by sundry friends, whose worth I reuerence, &amp; whose loue I much affect, notwithstanding their dissent from me in this particular; I must craue leaue to professe and protest before him that knoweth all things, that my aime is not so much as in my secret thoughts, to despise or disparage any of them hereby: but only to set downe their arguments, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by occasion might be taken, more throughly to discusse this subiect. It is true that I haue sometimes made vse of the same phrases first vsed by my friends to me: yet I desire them to take notice that I haue only weighed their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments impartially in the ballance of reason and truth, without the least glaunce vpon any of their persons. And if I could haue beene as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained that none but they would euer haue lighted on the same obiections, I could as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly haue suppressed them; as J doe the names of the obiectors. But because what friends doe octiect in loue, others may also presse to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of this truth, I haue made bold to make those arguments thus publique, that their
<pb facs="7"/> mouthes may be stopped, who else might happen to vrge the same with violence and passion enough, and thinke them vnanswerable, if there should no answeres be sent out to meet them. For their sakes therfore haue J thus presumed on my friends (whom I earnestly desire still to hold deare vnto me,) hoping they will not bethinke it to the publique good, nor hold themselues dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraged hereby, but rather reioice that they haue beene a meanes of a more exquisite debate of this point, wherby the truth may be better knowne.</p>
   <p n="3">
      <hi>3</hi> I haue a request to all that shall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to make vse of this booke, that they will be at the paines to read ouer the whole, or forbeare to censure it by any peece therof, that they may happen to cast their eye vpon. For, in a point of controversy, wherein method requires only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in one part, confirmation in another; refutation in another; and often references from one part of the discourse vnto other places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for avoiding of confusion and tedious repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: it is impossible to receiue full satisfaction by reading any one peece only, how satisfactorie
<pb facs="7"/> soeuer it may proue when it is considered alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and when the rest is pervsed and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well as that branch on which hasty and forward censurers doe sometimes passe a sharpe and heavy sentence. If you pervse the first part of this booke only, without the residue, yee may perhaps obiect divers things, and remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied because ye goe not on to the latter part wherein all such obiections together with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to them, doe present themselues in their proper rankes. On the contrary, if wee looke only on the latter part to see how the maine obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be answered, yee may sometimes haply sticke (through your owne fault) at some of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres, because I take sundry things for graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which ye may doubt of till ye haue read the former part, wherein the same things are proued at large, and to which, in my answers the rules of Method often compell mee to referre you. Farewell.</p>
