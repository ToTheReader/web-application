   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD is not known, yea not
even taken notice of (as a spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Prouerb deliuereth) vntill
that it be passed by; yea more, be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
lost. Alas! the trueth hereof I most
apparantly perceiue in my self, it aptly
agreeth with my state, and my runne
course of life, for that I too late tooke
notice thereof, too late knew what time
is, and of what value it is, and what a
precious and inestimable treasure it may
be truely found to be. So farre forth
that I am much aggreiued that I did
not dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>erne it, and well might I, for
that I haue lost so great à jewell: and
earnestly I desire (if it were possible)
<pb facs="5"/>
that I were maister of my yeares al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
spent, to the end I might well and
most solicitously employ them, as I-ought,
and my well being requireth, and my
duety commandeth, and that I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
them from the Captiuity and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrallment
with which they haue been
miserably detained, yea and enchained.
Rather might I well say, that he who
hath not known, and prized time bath
justly deserued, that now he lament
aud earnestly vvish for it, and that yet
notvvithstanding he faile to possesie
that vvhich he disesteemed, that vvhich
he, alas! so slightly regarded. But I take
for a singular, a rare grace and mercy
of notable value that our Lord (although
at the end of my dayes) hath giuen me
this capacity, this vnderstanding, and
feruent desire of à better employing my
time, vvhich from hence for vvard his
mercy vvill grant me, that I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
and giue some counsaile to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse;
<pb facs="6"/>
carelesse and as it vvere altogether
negligent.</p>
   <p>And to give beginning to vvhat is
fore deliuered, I haue desired that he
please to make me his Attorney or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
that I may petitionarily plead for
the ransome, the redemption thereof:
and that I may instruct them, who haue
lost it, hovv they may regaine it, and
that I may declare hovv much it impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them, hovv farr it concerneth them,
of vvhat great consequence it is to them,
and likevvise further I may earnestly,
and vvith fulnes of charity craue of thē
and piously, yea euen mooue them that
they cast not avvay one hovver: vvhat
say I? no nor moment of time. I vvill be
breife, though vvere it I should spend
neuer so much time in the account he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof,
I should not judge it lost time.</p>
   <p>I shall not be able to bringe to passe
vvhat <hi>Pythagoras</hi> doth aduise, vvhich
is to contract many sentences in fevv
<pb facs="6"/>
vvordes, as good Philosophers ought,
and are accustomed to doe. Hence <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>
to one vvho talking vvith him
seemed to taxe some vvhat the breuity
of the Philosophers sentences, ansvve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
you say right vvell truely they are
in fevv vvords couched indeed, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
not hence reprehension, for vvere it
possible, so likevvise should be the sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
   <p>But I vvill doe the fall extent of my
povver, contracting this vvhole subject
vnder tenne Chapters onely. Herein ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
Gentle Reader that I cast not time
avvay neither in the definition or des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription
of Time (vvhere it might seeme
that the Treatise should take his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
for that it is not necessary (as said
<hi>Saint Augnstine</hi>) for there is not
ought more knovvn, nor more familiar,
more frequently spoken of by humane
tongue, then is that of time.</p>
   <p>Let it gratiously please God Almighty
<pb facs="7"/>
our good and glorious Lord through his
precious blood (which vvas the price
of our redemption) that this treatise
of the redeeming of lost time may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svverably
profit the Reader.</p>
