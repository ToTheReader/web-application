   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost reuerend Father in God, there is no one thing in this world that of men truly zealous, &amp; Christian in these latter daies of the world with greater earnestnes hath bin desired, then that by a ioynt, &amp; common consent of all the Churches rightly, &amp; according to the canons of the sacred Scriptures, reformed, there might be a draught made, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulged, containing, and expressing the summe, &amp; substance of that Religion, which they doe all both concordablie teach, &amp; vniformely maintaine.</p>
   <p>That holy man (of happie remembrance) D. <hi>Cranmer</hi> (who sometime enioyed that roome in our Church,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Archb. Cranmer.</hi>
      </note> which your Grace nowe worthily possesseth) in the daies of that most godly young Prince, <hi>King Edward the sixt,</hi> employed a great part of his time, and studie for the effecting of that worke; and imparted his thoughts with the most principall persons, and of rarest note in those daies for their wisdome, pietie, and credit among the people of God throughout Christendome. <hi>M. Caluin,</hi> vnderstanding of his intent, addressed his letters vnto the sayd Archbishop, and offered his seruice, saying that might his labours stand the Church in steede, <hi>ne decem quidem maria,</hi> it would not grieue him to saile ouer ten Seas to such a purpose.</p>
   <p n="2">2. But this proouing a worke of much difficultie, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnpossible in mans eies, especially in those daies, to be brought about, the next course, and resolution was,<note place="margin">Vnitie of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in all Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</note> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie Kingdome, and free state, or principalitie, which had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned the superstitious, and Antichristian religion of the Church of Rome, and embraced the Gospell of Christ, should diuulge a Briefe of that religion, which among themselues
<pb facs="3"/>
was taught, and beleeued, and whereby through the mercie of God in Christ, they did hope to be saued. Which to God his great glorie, &amp; the singular benefit, &amp; comfort of all Churches, both present, and to come (as the extant Harmonie of all their confessions doth most sweetely record) with no great labor was notablie performed.</p>
   <p>This worke of theirs tolde the Churches in those daies, and doth vs, and will enforme our posteritie, that not only in euery particular State, &amp; Kingdome, but also throughout Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where the Gospell was entertained, the primitiue, and Apostolicall daies of the Church were againe restored. For the multitudes of them that did beleeue (I speake both ioyntly of all, and seuerally of each reformed people, not of euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular person, fantastique, False-apostles, and peruerse teachers, or professors in any Church, who were not wanting euen in the Apostles daies) touching the maine, and fundamentall points of true religion, were then of one hart and of one soule, and did thinke, and speake one thing, and liue in peace <note n="a" place="margin">

The said Archbishop (for vnto whom better, after God, and the King can we ascribe the glorie of this worthy act? hee wrought this Vnitie, and Vniformitie of doctrine in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in the Halcyon daies of our English <hi>Iosias,</hi> K.

      <hi>A</hi> certaine learned man (speaking of the Religion heere then professed, and wrighting vnto the Lords of our late Queenes Counsell) doth say, he (meaning the Papist his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, who charged our Church with discord, and disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about matters of religion) He ought (saith he) if hee had bin able,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="3"/>
learned, and iudicous men) of the doctrine then ratified by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and professed in this kingdome.</p>
   <p>But those daies of our Churches peace continued not long (through our vnthankefulnesse, and sinnes) neither on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side was our persecution permanent (through the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of god), though for the time exceeding vehemt, &amp; violent.<note place="margin">

   <p>For himselfe hee praied, that as God had made him a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and Preacher, of his truth: so hee might constantly beare witnesse vnto the same, &amp; haue the grace,<note place="margin">

      </note> and power to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it in the face of the world, euen till the hower of his death. For the church of Enlād hee praied, that God would be pleased once againe, to restore the free Preaching of the Gospell to this realme (and this withall possible feruencie of Spirit, hee craued at the hands of God). And for Lady Elizabeth, that hee would preserue, and make her a comfort to his then comfortlesse peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in England. And the almightie, and our heauenly Father both heard, and granted, all, and euery of his petitions.</p>

         <hi>Q. Elizab.</hi>
      </note> but all Gods people so prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed besides. And their prayers were not made in vaine. For both Q. Mary liued not long; and L.

This was effected in the yeare of our Lord 1562. (the same yeare that the mercilesse Massacre at Vassey in France was committed by the Duke of Guize;<note place="margin">

   <p>A principall contriuer of this Vniformitie in religion, and thereby Vnitie among vs,<note place="margin">

      </note> was another Predecessor of your Graces, euen D. Parkar the first Archbishop of Canterburie in the said Queenes daies.</p>

<pb facs="4"/>
compasse of the world hath neuer seene any thing more bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, nor more to be wished then is her gouernenment.</p>
   <p>So now againe flourished those Apostolicall times (as I may say) of vnitie, and Vniformitie of doctrine in our Church. For then were there no contentions, nor dissentions, nor thornie, &amp; pricking disputations among vs about questions of religion, <hi>tantum res nobis fuit cum satellitibus quibusdam Pontificiis</hi> (as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop Iewell said) wee then skirmished onely with the Papists. As it was at the building of Salomons temple: so was it with vs then. Wee set vpon the building of Gods house (which is his Church) without deane, without noyse, and stirres. The adversaries without heard vs, and heard of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings abroad by the pens of the learned Iewel, Nowel, Calfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, and such other Architects of ours; to our selues wee were comely as Ierusalem; to our enemies, terrible as an armie of Banners.</p>
   <p n="6">6. Also what afore, <hi>viz.</hi> an. 62. they had agreed vpon, the same at another Assembly at London, an. 71. and the 13. of Q.

But these men speedily both by learning were answered, and by authoritie censured,
<pb facs="5"/>
suspended, or depriued.</p>
   <p n="7">7. And yet not one of these Recusants, and so not one of Englāds clergie,<note place="margin">Vnitie of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine still cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</note> either now, or afore did euer oppugne the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, publike, and catholike doctrine of our Church, but most willingly approued, and applauded the same, as the truth of God.</p>
   <p>For euen the admonitioners themselues (which said that they did striue for true Religion; and wished the Parliament euen With perfect hatred to detest the church of England, whereof notwithstanding they were members) euen they doe say how they (meaning the Bishops, and their partakers) they hold the substance of Religion with vs, and wee with them. And againe. Wee (all of vs) confesse one Christ. And their Champion doth acknowledge, that her maiestie hath deliuered vs from the spirituall Egypt of Poperie.</p>
   <p>So that for doctrine (I meane still for the maine points of doctrine) there was now a sweete, and blessed concord among vs: which Vnitie continued all that holy, and reuerend Fathers, I meane Archbishop Parkers time, which was till the 17. yeare of Q. Elizabeth.</p>
   <p n="8">8. After him succeeded in the said Archiepiscopall chaire B. Grindall, a right famous, and worthy Prelate; and for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so sound, as in K. Edwards daies (had the Prince liued a while longer) he had bin promoted vnto the Bishoprick of London,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Archbish. Grindall.</hi>
      </note> vpon the translation of B. Ridly vnto Durham (for these things had the State then in purpose). But God otherwise had decreed for their advancements, as that the one of them should passe through the fire vnto the kingdome of heauen; and the other escape the dangers of many stormes, and waters before hee came vnto any preferment at all. And so accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly Ridley was burned, and Grindall banished, and both of them depriued either of life, or liuing, or both, and that for one, and the same cause, and doctrine, which they had preached, and wee professe.</p>
   <p>But the tempest being ouerblowen, and Q. Elizabeth (her selfe hauing likewise escaped the bloody hands of her cruel enemies, yea and Gunpowder traines, and Treasons too, in
<pb facs="5"/>
most barbarous manner laid to haue blowen vp her saint-like, &amp; sanctified Body, and Soule, into the heauens; and all for her constant fauouring, and embracing this very doctrine) her Maiestie (not forgetfull what he had endured for the cause of Christ, and his Church) aduanced this zealous Confessour, and tried Souldier, vnto the See first of London (afore designed him); next of Yorke, and lastly of Canterburie.</p>
   <p>The care of this Archbishop was great to further the glory of God, but, through the enuy and malice of his ill willers, his power was but small; his place, high, but himselfe made lowe, through some disgraces, by his potent aduersaries: which hee meekely, and patiently endured till his dying day.</p>
   <p n="9">9. During the time of this mans troubles, among other, two things especially deserue obseruation: One is,<note place="margin">The f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p>The Iesuits indicted Councels; summoned Synodes; enacted and reversed orders, and exercised Papal iurisdiction among vs, wee not weeting, nor so much as dreaming of any such matter.</p>
   <p>The Brethren (for so did they now stile themselues) in their Churches and charges would neither pray, nor say seruice, nor Baptise, nor celebrate the L. Supper; nor Marrie, nor Bury, nor doe any other ecclesiasticall duty according to the Law, but after their owne deuisings. And abroad (as if they had bin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Iesuiticall proceedings; or the Iesuits with their practises) they had their meetings both classicall, and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodicall; they set downe decrees, reuersed orders, elected mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, exacted Subscriptions, and executed the censures of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spension, and excommunication where they thought good.</p>
   <p>The Iesuits had for their prouinciall first Roberr Parsons, <hi>alias</hi> Cowbuck, then Weston, and lastly Garnet (which Garnet continued in that office till the yeare 1605. when he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and for most horrible and hellish treasons, as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Traitor put to death in Pauls Churchyard the same yeare. And the Brethren had their (I know not what) cheife men. All
<pb facs="6"/>
of these residing in, and about London; and in speciall fauour both with the Gentiles, and vulgar people of their seuerall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: and so continued multiplying their number, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strong, euen head-strong in boldnes, and schisme till the dying day of this most graue, and reuerend Archbishop, which was in the moneth of Iuly. 1583.</p>
   <p n="10">10. Some foure moneths afore whose death the said Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, at a certaine Assembly of their owne appointing, among other things (as I finde) decreed, that if Subscription vnto the booke of Articles of religion (afore mentioned, and still meant) should againe be vrged,<note place="margin">Vnity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine stil hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth among vs.</note> the said Brethren might sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe thereunto according to the Statute.

   <p>Themselues doe say, The controuersie betwixt them, and vs, is not as (the Bishopes, and their welwillers) they would beare the world in hand, for a Cap, a Tippet, or a Surplesse, but for greater matters, concerning a true ministerie, and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, according to the word: the one whereof,
<pb facs="7"/>
that is a true ministery they shall neuer haue, till Archbishops, and Bishops be put downe, and all Ministers made equall: the other also will neuer be brought to passe, till Kings &amp; Queenes doe subiect themselues vnto the Church, and submit their scepters, and throwe downe their Crowes before the Church, and lick vp the dust of the feete of the Church; and willingly abide the censures of the Church, that is, of the Presbyterie. For, as the Church is subiect vnto the ciuill magistrate in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of his ciuill authoritie: so must the magistrate, the King and Queene, subiect themselues, and bee obedient to the iust, and lawfull authoritie of the Church. The ciuill magistrate is none officer at all of the Church. For Church officers bee <hi>non Magnates, aut Tetrarchae,</hi> not gracious, or honorable Lords, but Ministers of the Church. The Presbyterie is the Church; and euerie Congregation, or Church, should and must in it haue a Presbyterie.</p>
   <p>This is the Light, which indeede the Martyrs, neuer sawe; the Religion, which our Brethren striue for; the Truth, which they may not preach; not Childish doctrine, like the Bishops Articles, but the wise Gospell; the maine, and materiall points of religion, nowe in these last daies last of all (yea after the eight Thorowe breaking of H.

   <p>Many Treatises afore, but nowe, and diuers yeares ensuing they flewe about, and abroad like Atomies; and by them the same things which afore, but in a differing sort, and in other words, they publish.</p>
   <p>For touching Church officers, they name who, and howe many sorts they be of them, viz. Doctors, Pastors, Gouernors, Deacons, and Widdowes (no moe, no fewer.</p>
   <p>They say, Euerie Church must be furnished with a Teacher, and a Pastor, as with two Eies; with Elders, as with Feete; with Deacons, as with Hands. Euerie Congregation must haue Eies, Hands, and Feete, and yet neither all, nor at all any Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to haue an Head, answerable to those Feete, Hands, and Eies.</p>
   <p>The doctor, by their doctrine, must be a distinct minister from the pastor, and onely teach true doctrine, and neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, nor apply his doctrine according to the times, and his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie, nor minister the Sacraments. For these things the pastor is to performe. Which pastor also, whensoeuer he administreth the Sacraments, must necessarily make a Sermon, or els he cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth Sacriledge.</p>
   <p>And concerning discipline, by their doctrine, euery Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation must haue absolute authoritie, to admonish, to censure, to excommunicate, and to anathematize all offending persons yea euen Kings, and Princes, if they be of the Congregation. And no Prince but must be of some parish, and vnder one, Presbytery or other alwaies, Where this power is not, in their iudgements, one of the tokens of a true Church, is wanting.
<pb facs="8"/>
For this Discipline with them is a Marke of the Church, and numbred among the Articles of their Faith.</p>
   <p n="16">16. This (say they is the great cause, the holy cause, which they will neuer leaue suing for, though they should be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Parliaments in their daies, vntill either ther obtaine it, or bring the Lord in vengeance, and blood against the Stare,<note place="margin">The Brethrēs diuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of their Discipline.</note> and the whole land, for repelling the same. The Discipline is Gods holy yoke, Gods sceptre; the kingdome and throne of Christ.</p>
   <p>Our controuersie (say they) is whether Iesus Christ shall be King, or no. Againe, the end of all our trauaile is to build vp the walles of Ierusalem, in to set vp the Throne of Iesus Christ, our heauenly King, the middes thereof; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing whereof is a testimonie vnto vs that wee shall haue part in that glorie, which shall be reuealed heereafter.</p>
   <p>So learne we nowe from their said bookes, learned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiue discourses (which the Fathers, and our fore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neuer sawe, nor had learned) both that their Discipline established, and exercised is a visible marke of a true Church; and to desire the aduauncement of the same, an inuisible token of an elect childe of God: so as neither is that a Church, at least no true Church, where their Discipline is not; neither they but titular christians, no true christians indeede, which either sigh, or seeke not to haue it established, and Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in euerie parish to be aduaunced.</p>
   <p n="17">17.

   <p>And yet these faithfull Brethren, either through forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or frailtie, or (which I rather thinke) forced thereunto by the power of truth, doe plainly confesse, that those verie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of our Bishops, and Articles of the conuocation house, euen that little, litle part of the Gospel, which the said Bishops, and Martyrs brough to light, and hath enlightned the whole

   <p>Whereof I still gather that had their newly reuealed, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med learned Discourses, and doctrines touching Discipline, &amp; their Presbyteries (howsoeuer with goodly, &amp; glorious titles, to rauish poore heartes with the desire thereof, brandished, and set out) neuer bin diuulged, or preached, we may be saued, but without knowing, and beleeuing, the Articles or doctrine of our Church (which yet is not ours, but Gods) there is no saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ordinarily to be looked for, of any man: so true, and of such necessitie, is this; so impertinent, and vnneedefull the other.</p>
   <p n="18">18. <hi>Octogesimus octauus mirabilis annus:</hi> it was prophecied to be a wonderfull yeare long afore it came, and will neuer be forgotten now it is past.<note place="margin">
         <hi>An.</hi> 1588. Q. Elizabeth opposeth her authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Br. their bookes, and writings.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Among the things for which the yeare 88. is famous, one, and not of least regard, is, that afore it expired, these bookes of the brethren, by a Proclamation from Q. Elizabeth, were denounced Schismaticall, and seditious; and the doctrine in them contained, erroneous, tending to perswade, and bring in a monstrous, and apparent dangerous Innouation within her dominions, and countries; and to make a change, euen a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous change of the forme of doctrine then in vse. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the said bookes were commanded to be brought in, and deliuered into the hands of authoritie; and speciall charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that no moe of that nature should come abroad, or be printed.</p>
   <p>Wherby (so much as in that blessed Queene, whose name with eternall honour shallbe recorded) these newe fancies of the brethren were hissed, and exploded out of this Christian kingdome; and the articles, or publike doctrine of our Church, confirmed, countenanced, and by the royall prerogatiue of that peerelesse Prince, more strongly ratified, and commended to her awefull and good subiects then afore.</p>
   <p n="19">19 The zeale of learned, and godly men herevpon was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, and their courage so encreased, as whereas afore this time but one or two, or a very few (the first whereof was your L. imediate Predecessor, whose memorie be alwaies honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="9"/>
among the Saints) did encounter the Brethren and oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their fancies: now an Armie of most valourous,<note place="margin">Most learned &amp; worthy men set themselues against the Br. and the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</note> and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Champions, and Challengers rose vp, which then, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers yeares ensuing (among whome as your Grace was the first in time which gaue the onset: so are you to be reckoned with the first, and best for zeale, wisedome, and learning) did conflict with these Brethren, defended the Prelacie; stood for the Prince; and State; put the newe Doctors to the foile; profliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Elders; set vpon the Presbyterie: and so battered the new Discipline, as hitherto they could neuer, nor hereafter shall euer fortifie, and repaire the decaies thereof.</p>
   <p n="20">20. Notwithstanding what the brethrē wanted in strength, and learning, they had in wilynes;<note place="margin">A Stratagem of the Br.</note> and though they lost much one way in the generall, &amp; maine point of their discipline; yet recouered they not a litle aduantage another way, by an odde, and a newe deuise of theirs, in a speciall article of their classi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call instructions.</p>
   <p>For while these Worthies of our Church were employing their engins, &amp; forces partly in defending the present gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Ecclesiasticall, partly in assaulting the Presbytery and newe Discipline, euen at that verie instant the Brethren (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues too weake either to ouerthrowe our holds, and that which we hold; or to maintaine their owne) they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned quite the Bulwarkes which they had raised,<note place="margin">

   <p>This Stratageme of theirs was not obserued then, neither I feare me is regarded as it should be yet: and yet did, &amp; since hath, and doubtlesse in time to come, if it be not timely seene

   <p n="21">
      <note place="margin">Certaine fruites, and effects of the Sab. doctrine published by consent of the Brethren.</note>21. In this their fallie (as I said before) they set not vpon the Bishops and their calling, their Chancelars &amp;c. (as Popish, and Antichristian) they let them alone, seeing and knowing they are too well backt for them to subuert: but (which are of great, all; and almost of the same antiquitie with Bishops di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of thē; and I had almost said as necessarie) they ruinate, and at one blowe beate downe all Times, and daies by iust autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie destined to religious, and holy vses, besides the Lords day, saying plainely, and in peremptorie words that the Church hath none authoritie, ordinarily, or from yeare to yeare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to sanctifie any other day to those vses but only the Lordes daie.</p>
   <p>They builde not Presbyteries expressedly (though vnder hand, if it be well marked, they doe erect them in their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of the Sabbath: but they set vp a newe Idoll, their Saint Sabbath (earst in the daies of Popish blindnes <hi>S.</hi> Sunday) in the middes, and mindes of Gods people.</p>
   <p>By the former they haue opened not a gap, but a wide gate vnto all licentiousnes, libertie, and prophanes on the Holie daies (which is readily, and greedily apprehended of all sorts of people euerie where, especially of their fauorites) to the hie dishonor of God; decay of deuotion; hinderance of Christian knowledge and wisedome in all sorts, especially in the vulgar multitude, and poore seruants; aduantage of the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies; and grosse contempt of the necessarie, and laudable orders of our Church. By the latter they haue introduced a newe, and more then either Iewish, or Popish superstition into the land, to no small blemish of our Christian profession, and scandall of the true seruants of God,<note place="margin">The summe of the Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p n="22">22. Their doctrine summarilie may be reduced vnto these two heads, whereof the one is, that the Lords day (euen as the
<pb facs="10"/>
old Sabbath was of the Iewes) must necessarily be kept, and solemnized of all, and euerie Christian, vnder the paine of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall condemnation both of bodie, and soule.</p>
   <p>The other, that vnder the same penaltie it must bee kept from the highest to the lowest, both of King, and people, in sort, and manner as these Brethren among themselues, haue deuised, decreed, and prescribed.</p>
   <p>The former of these is like that of the false Apostles, which came from Iudea vnto Antioch, and taught the Brethren, that vnlesse they were Circumcised after the manner of Moses, they could not be saued. Whome the Apostles, Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas first; and afterwards Peter, Iames, and the rest at Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem both zealously did resist, and in their first Synod, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation powerfully suppresse.</p>
   <p>The latter, as bad as that, hath bin the mother of many he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall assertions, and horrible conclusions.</p>
   <p>I haue read (and many there be aliue which will iustifie it), how it was preached in a Mercate towne in Oxfordshire, that to doe any seruile worke, or businesse on the Lords day, is as great a sinne, as to kill a man, or to committe adultery. It was preached in Sommersetshire, that to throw a bowle on the Sabboth day, is as great a sinne, as to kill a man. It was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Norfolke, that to make a Feast, or wedding dinner on the Lords day, is as great a sinne, as for a Father to take a knife and cutte his childes throate. It was preached in Suffolke (I can name the man, and I was present when hee was conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before his ordinary for preaching the same) that to ring moe Bels then one vpon the Lords day to call the people vnto Church, is as great a sinne as to commit murder.</p>
   <p>When these things I read, and heard, mine heart was struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with an horror, and so is it still, when I doe but thinke of them, and calling into minde the Sabboth doctrine (at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don printed for I. Porter and T. Man. an. 95, which I had read afore (wherein very many things are to this effect) I presently smelt both whose disciples all those preachers are; and that the said doctrine had taken deepe impression in mens hearts, and was dispersed (while our watchmen were otherwise busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

   <p>Againe, hee requireth Subscription, but not of ciuill magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates; not of the Commons (as else-where some doe;) not of euery man, yea of womē, aswel as of men (as did the persecuted Church at Frankeford in Q.

   <p>Last of all, his Maiestie calleth for Subscription vnto Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of religion, but they are not either Articles of his owne, lately deuised; or the old newely turkened▪ but the verie Articles agreed vpon by the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopes, and Bishops of both Prouinces, and the whole Clergie in the Conuocation holden at London, and that in the yeare of our Lord God. 1562, <note n="a" place="margin">Can. 2.127.</note> and vnto none other; euen the same Articles, for number thirtie nine <note n="b" place="margin">Ibid.</note>, no moe, no fewer; and for words, sillables, and letters the verie same, vnaugmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vndiminished, vnaltered.</p>
   <p n="29">29. And beeing the same, the whole world is to knowe, that the Church of England is not in religion changed, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable like the Moone;<note place="margin">The Church of England setled, and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p>
      <pb facs="13"/>And being the same, all men againe may see that we are stil at Vnitie both among our selues at home; and with the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches abroad in all matters of cheifest importance, &amp; fundamentall points of religion, though our adversaries, the Papists, would faine beate the contrarie into the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples heads.</p>
   <p>And being the same, there is nowe (as also from the first restauration of the Gospell among vs there hath beene) an V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformitie likewise of doctrine by authoritie established, which at the King his first arriuall among vs, was so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired by the Brethren.</p>
   <p>And finally being the same, let vs not doubt, but perswade our selues that we shall find the Antichristian Church of Rome too the same, which for the same doctrine, and for none other cause, prosecuteth all Christian churches, but ours of England especially, with sworde, fire, and powder in most hostile, yea and hellish manner: the effect of whose hatred against vs as we haue often seene: so especially had wee felt the same the next yeare after our Kings ratification of these Articles, had not our euer mercifull God most miraculouslie detected both the Treason, and Traitors. For which his fauours his holy Name be glorified of vs, and our posteritie,<note place="margin">
         <hi>An.</hi> 1605.</note> throughout all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>
   <p n="30">30. So our Church is the same. But be the Brethren, the faithfull and godly Brethren too the same nowe,<note place="margin">The Brethren no changlings</note> which they haue also beene? If they bee, then will they not denie (which an. 72. they writ) that We hold the substance of religion with them; nor (which an. 602. they published, &amp; is afore remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred) that the true Faith by which we may be saued, and the true doctrine of the Sacraments, &amp; the pure worship of God, be truly taught, and that by publike authoritie and retained in the booke of Articles. And in this Confession I pray God they may constantly perseuere.</p>
   <p>Howebeit euen these men (which in a generalitie doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the doctrine of our Church) being called by authoritie to acknowledge their assent vnto euerie Article thereof in particular, they doe not a little debase the estimation of this
<pb facs="14"/>
doctrine of our<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and shewe themselues but too apparent, and professed disseruors from the same. And though all of them doe, and will approoue some: yet not one of them will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe vnto all, and euery of the Articles.</p>
   <p>For vnto the Articles of religion, and the Kings Supremacie they are willing to subscribe. And they may subscribe (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath beene noted) vnto such of them, as containe the summe of Christian Faith, and the doctrine of the Sacraments. But vnto the same Articles, for number 39. agreed vppon in this Conuocation at London an. 62. they neither will, nor dare, nor may subscribe. For neither the rest of the Articles in that booke, nor the Booke of common prayer, may bee allowed, no though a man should be depriued from his ministerie for it (say the sayd Brethren in a certaine Classical decree of theirs). The late Politician is not affraide to mooue the high, and most honorable Court of Parliament, that Impropriations may bee let to Ferme vnto Incumbent ministers, viz. which faithfullie preach in the Churches the true doctrine of the Gospell, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Articles of religion, concerning Faith and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: meaning that such Ministers as preach the same doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, if they proceed to the rest of the Articles, Concerning either Conformitie in externall, and ceremoniall matters; or Vniformitie in other points of doctrine contained in that booke, should not be partakers of that benefit, or of Benefices Impropriat.</p>
   <p n="31">31. If it be demaunded, what the causes may be, why they will vnto some,<note place="margin">VVhy the Br. will subscribe vnto some, but not vnto all the Articles.</note> but will not vnto all; or why they will vnto those Articles which concerne Faith, and the Sacraments, but will not vnto the rest, subscribe? The reasons hereof be two, whereof.</p>
   <p>The one is, for that in their opinion, there is no Law, to compell them to subscribe vnto all, For (say the brethren re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siant I know not where), Wee haue alwaies beene readie to subscribe to the Articles of religion concerning the doctrine of Faith, and of the Sacraments, which is all that is required by Lawe. Also the Brethren in Deuonshire, and Cornewale: Wee are readie (say they) to subscribe to the third (which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb facs="14"/>
the booke of Articles of religion) so farre as wee are bound by Statute, concerning the same, <hi>viz.</hi> as they concerne the doctrine of the Sacraments, and the confession of the true faith. And the 22, London Brethren tell K. Iames to his head, how the Subscription which he calleth for, is more then the Lawe requireth.</p>
   <p>Their other reason is, because (as the Lincolnshire doe say) sundry, (as the London Brethren affirme) many things in that booke be not agreable, but contrary to Gods word.</p>
   <p n="32">32. If these things be true which they doe alleadge, surely then are those men to be chronicled for the Faithfull, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and innocent Brethren indeede, whome neither present Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices can allure; nor the angry countenance, and displeasure of a king, euen of the puissant, and powerfull king of great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, can force to doe any thing at his beck, and pleasure, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against Lawe, or for which there is no law; and who had rather to forgoe all their earthly commodities, &amp; liuings, yea &amp; to goe from their charges, and ministery, and to expose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, their wiues, and children to the myseries of this world (grieuous for flesh and blood to endure), then to approoue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for true, and sound by their hands, which is opposite, or not agreeable to the reuealed will, and Scriptures of God.</p>
   <p>But if these allegations of theirs be but weake, and sinfull sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, or rather apparently most false, scandalous, and slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous imputations to their Prince, their mother Church, and this State, then doubtlesse, as they euen Christians now liuing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take them: so the ages to come will euerlastingly note, and censure them both for disloyall Subiects that so traduce a truly, and most christianly religious King; il deseruing children, that so abuse their honourable, and reuerend Fathers, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors of State, and authority: turbulent spirits, not peaceable men, which raise such broiles, troubles, and diuisions in the Church and kingdome (the issues whereof no tongue can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and are fearefull being thought of) without cause; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally neither faithfull, nor godly Preachers, but vngodly broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of vntruthes, and slaunders, and the very authors, and
<pb facs="15"/>
fautors of horrible cōfusion, &amp; faction in Gods Church, whose peace they shold seek, &amp; promote euē with their deerest blood.</p>
   <p n="33">33. Since the Statute for Vniformitie in rites and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was first enacted, moe then 35. yeeres haue passed, in all which space, neither the Brethren nowe being, nor the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren afore them liuing, haue hetherto shewen, of the 39. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, for names and titles, Which; for number, Howe manie the Articles be which ecclesiastical Ministers necessarily must; howe many which they may not, or neede not, vnlesse they list, subscribe vnto (which I am sure they, or some of them, at one time, or other would haue expressed, had the Lawe fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their recusancie, and they beene able to haue iustified their Maxime, which is, That they are not compellable by subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to approoue them all. Againe, since the first establishment of that Statute Lawe, the most reuerend Fathers, and truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Ministers of this Church (sound, for iudgement; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, for learning; zealous, for affection; sincere, for religion; faithfull, in their Churches; painefull, in their charges; more profitable many waies; of as tender consciences euery way, as any of these Brethren combined), according both to their bounden duties, and (as they are perswaded) to the very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and true intent of the said Statute, haue alwaies both with their mouthes acknowledged, and with their pennes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued the 39. Articles of our religion for truthes not to bee doubted of, and godly.</p>
   <p>Yea, and the Brethren too themselues (which nowe so scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouslie, when they are orderly called thereunto, doe holde backe their hands, and will subscribe but choisely vnto some of them) euen they with their mouthes (which is equiualent, and all one) haue, &amp; that according to the Statute (or else their liuings be void) vpon their first entrance into all, and singular their ecclesiasticall benefices, openly both read, and testified their consent vnto the said Articles, for number euen nine and thirty, acknowledging them, I say all of them to be agreeable to Gods word: whereof the people in there seuerall charges be ready witnesses to testifie so much before God, &amp; the world.</p>
   <p n="34">34. Againe, of these Brethren (that will subscribe but vnto which they please of these Articles) there be some who faine would beate into mens heads, if they could tell howe to make
<pb facs="15"/>
it credible),<note place="margin">A late deuise of the Br. to shunne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribtion.</note> that the Doctrine of our Church is altered from that it was in the raigne of Queene Elizabeth.</p>
   <p>But this assertion being too grosse, egregiouslie vntrue, and no way iustifiable, they secondly giue out, and report (so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious be they to inuent newe shifts to cloake their inuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and rooted pertinacie) howe the purpose, if not doctrine of our Church is of late altered from that it was. And therefore though they can be wel content to allowe of the old doctrine, and auncient intention: yet vnto the old doctrine, and newe Intention of our Church, they cannot subscribe, might they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gaine much, or loose whatsoeuer they haue thereby.</p>
   <p>Besides, this newe Intendement, contrarie to the old pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if not doctrine of our Church, is become nowe the maine, &amp; principall obstacle, why they cannot subscribe vnto the booke of Cōmon prayer, &amp; booke of Ordination, as earst they (some of them) foure times haue done, when aswell the Intention, as Doctrine of our Church, was pure, and holy.</p>
   <p>Lastly, they seeme not obscurely to intimate vnto the State, that were they sure, or might bee assured, that the purpose of our Church were the same which it was, neither varied from the doctrine; they would be prest, and as readie euen foure, if not fortie times moe, to subscribe vnto the fore mentioned bookes of Common prayer, and of Ordination, as afore times they did, when they were out of doubt the Intention of our Church was correspondent to her Doctrine, that it was sound, &amp; good. I haue foure times subscribed (saith a Brother) to the booke of Common prayer with limitation, &amp; reference of all things therein contained (not vnto the purpose only, or doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine only, but) vnto the purpose, &amp; doctrine of the church of England. Yet cannot the same man with a good conscience so much as once more subscribe (which formerly, and that with a good consciēce had subscribed foure times). His reasō is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the purpose, if not doctrine of our Church, (to which hee referred his subscriptiō) appeareth to him, by the late Canons, booke of cōference, &amp; some speeches of men in great place, &amp; others, to be varied somewhat from that which he before (not without reason) tooke it to be.</p>
   <p n="35">35. The purpose of our Church is best knowne by the Doctrine which shee doth professe; the Doctrine by the 39. Articles, established by Act of Parliament;
<pb facs="16"/>
the Articles by the words,<note place="margin">The purpose, and doctrine of our Church continue the same.</note> whereby they are expressed: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpose then the publique Doctrine doth minister; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrine then in the sayd Articles is contained, our Church neither hath, nor holdeth; and other sense they cannot yeeld, then their words doe impart. The words be the same, and none other, then earst, and first they were. And therefore the sense the same; the Articles the same; the Doctrine the same; and the purpose, &amp; Intention of our Church still one, &amp; the same.</p>
   <p>If then her purpose be knowne by her Doctrine, and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and their true sense by their very words: needes must the purpose of our Church be the same, because her Doctrine, and Articles for number, words, sillables, and letters, &amp; euery way be the very same.</p>
   <p>And so our Churches intention in her publique Doctrine, and Articles reuealed, being good at the first, it is to still. For her purpose (continuing one, &amp; the same) cannot be ill at the last, which was good (and so beleeued, and acknowledged, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the Brothers subscription) at the first; or good, in good Queene Elizabeths, and ill, in illustrious King Iames his daies.</p>
   <p n="36">36. If the premisses sufficiently explane not the constancy of our Churches purpose in professing religion sincerely, then cast we our eies vpon the Propositions,<note place="margin">Neither the Doctrine, nor purpose of our Church alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> which she publiquely maintaineth; and if wee find them the same which euer they haue beene, then neede wee not doubt (the Brethren them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues being Iudges) but the Articles againe, their sense, the Doctrine, purpose, and Intention of the Church of England (the Propositions interpreting, as it were, the said Articles) is the very same it euer was.</p>
   <p>Now that the Propositions (pregnantly, and rightly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and arising from the articles) be the same, &amp; for substance vnaltered (though vpon good considerations, some fewe be added to the former); and all of them approoued for true, and Christian, by the lawfull, and publike allowance of our Church, the booke here ensuing plainly wil declare, and so demonstrate withall not the Doctrine onely, but intention also of our
<pb facs="16"/>
Church, to be the same, and not changed: and being vnchanged the bookes then of common prayer, and of ordination too, cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in the purpose and intention of the Church of England and reduced to the Propositions (as the Brethren would haue them), be well allowed, and authentically approoued; and the said brethren with as good conscience nowe againe, and afresh may subscribe vnto all the Articles, euen concerning the Booke of common praier, and of ordination, aswell as of the Kings supremacie, and of Religion, as afore, often, and alwaies they did.</p>
   <p n="37">37. Fot my selfe (most reuerend Father in God) what my thoughts be of the religion in this realme at this instant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, and of all these Articles, if the premisses doe not, that which here followeth will sufficiently demonstrate, Twentie, yea 22, yeares agoe, voluntarily, of mine owne accord, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnconstrained, I published my subscription vnto them; my Faith is not either shaken, or altered, but what it then was, it still is: yeares haue made those haires of mine gray, which weare not; and time, much reading, and experience in theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conflicts, and combates, haue bettered a great deale, but not altered one whit my iudgement, I thanke God.</p>
   <p>Nothing haue I denied, nothing gainesaid, which afore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered.</p>
   <p>Thē Propositiōs are (and yet not many) moe; the method, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered quotations, added, both for the satisfaction of some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and iudicious freinds of mine, requesting it at mine hands, and for the benefit both of the common, and vnlearned, &amp; of the studious, and learned Reader.</p>
   <p>The whole worke expresseth aswell my detestation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of all adversaries and errors, opposite, crossing, or contradicting the doctrine professed by vs, and protected by our King, or any article, or particle of truth of our religion; as my approbation of that truth which in our Church by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Statutes, and ordinances, is confirmed.</p>
   <p>There is not an heretike or Schismatike (to speake of) of any speciall marke, that from the Apostles time hitherto, hath discouered himselfe, and his opinions vulgarly in writing, or in
<pb facs="17"/>
print against our doctrine, but his heresie, fancie, or phrensie may here be seene against one propositiō or other. The Sects, and Sect masters adversaries vnto vs either in the matter, or maine points of our doctrine, or Discipline; to one of our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or other; wholly, or in part, which here be discouered to be taken heed of, and auoided, are many hundres.</p>
   <p n="38">38. This, and whatsoeuer els here done, either to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the truth, or detestation of heresies, and errors I doe very meekely present vnto your Grace, as after God, and our King best meriting the patronage thereof.</p>
   <p>My selfe am much, the whole Church of England much more bound vnto your Lordship; yea not wee onely nowe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, but our successors also, and posteritie shall haue cause in all ages, while the world shall continue, to magnifie almightie God, for the inestimable benefits, which wee haue and shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from your selfe, and your late Predecessors (D.
