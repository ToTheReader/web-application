   <head>TO THE MOST CHRISTIAN King, <hi>Henrie</hi> king of Fraunce and Poleland, the third of that name.</head>
   <p>SIr, the bookes of Gouernment and Commonweale matters which I haue set foorth heretofore vnder your authoritie, doe now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to your Maiestie reviewed and amended, for the good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you made of them, and for the pleasure you take sometimes in looking vpon them, and in causing them to be read vnto you. And soothly although your Highnesse being brought vp and exercised from your tender age in affairs of Peace and Warre, and other matters of state, can skill by experience of the chiefe things that are requisit to the gouernment of your realme, and doe ordinarily retaine men about you of your counsell, a great number of wise and skilfull personages: yet notwithstanding, the reading of Bookes that treat of Gouernment, may greatly delight you at times of recreation, when as you shall see in them many goodly and profitable aduertisements, concerning the gouernment of Princes. Many Kings and Emperours set their whole felicitie on warre, and in conquering new countries, but if they looke well hereinto, they shall find it better for a Prince to gouerne wisely, and to order their estate conueniently, than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade and conquer another Princes realme; considering that the chiefe cause why he is set vp of God, and why God is so gracious to him, as to put innumerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in subiection to him, is that hee should holde them together in the knowledge and obseruation of the true Religion, rule them with good lawes, defende them by force of armes, and in all cases be so carefull of their welfare, as they may regarde him as their father and Sheapheard. It is not for him to applie himselfe alonly to the preparing of great and puissant Armies, to couer the Sea with Ships, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and other vessels furnished for the warres, to giue battell, to make conquests, to winne Citties, to subdue new Kingdomes, and to set vp his flags and banners of Armes in the vttermost bounds of the World: but to prouide for the welfare of his Subiects, to remedie their harmes, to relieue their wrongfull oppressions, to yeeld and shew himselfe meeld and gentle in hearing the requests and complaints of the inferiour sort, modest and vpright in answering them, readie to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster iustice to euery man, as well by appointing reward for vertue, as punishment for vice, and finally so to behaue himselfe as hee may be loued, feared, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of all men. Most true it is Sir, that whereas at your comming to the Crowne, you found this your realme of Fraunce long forworne with the ciuile broils which
<pb facs="5"/>
were at that instant far greater than euer they had bene afore, and sore impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>shed by the former calamities; you could not then fully shew to your subiects the good dealing which you were desirous to shew towards them, because you were let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the wickednesse of the time. But now that the troubles are layd asleepe by the peace which you haue accorded of desire to releeue your afflicted people; all men looke for all manner of happinesse hereafter by means of your clemencie, and that God pittieng this realme, as one whereof hee hath shewed himselfe to haue a singular regard aboue all others, will by your means rid it from al former dangers, turning the miserable discord wherewith it hath bene infinitly disquieted, into sure concord; and the horrible tempest of ciuile warre, into perpetuall calmenesse of Peace. Howbeit letting that matter alone, I returne to Aristotles matters of Gouernment, whereunto I hope to ad Platos also, at leastwise if I may haue opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to doe it, and that my health wil giue me leaue: not only translating them both out of Greeke into French, but also moreouer enlightening them with expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the worke may be the more delightfull to your Maiestie, and the easier to be vnderstood of others which shall looke into it vnder your protection. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the skil of the gouerning of Commonweals consisteth cheefly in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, I haue where neede requireth, alleaged diuers examples, both old and new, gathered out of the famousest states of the world, especially of the neerest v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>to vs to our knowledge; assaying to set downe the causes and reasons of their euents, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the obseruations of the Philosophers, and other means deuised after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by long experience, &amp; put in practise by the space of two thousand yeres or thereabouts: Surely it hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ene no small trauel to be the setter forth of so high and graue discourses in French, and especially to expresse the elegancie of the one, and the proprietie of the other. But I will neuer count it painfull to vndertake the thing that may benefit my Countrie, or which I thinke may please your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, to whome I dedicat and consecrat this whole worke of Gouernment, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of as great importance as euer any hath hetherto bene done in French; whether it be in respect of the worthinesse of the master it selfe, which is the goodliest and profitablest that can be, or in respect of the excellencie of the authors thereof, who were of the skilfullest that euer liued among men. Sir, I beseech God long to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue your Maiestie, and to giue you a happie reigne in good peace, both at home and abroad, to his honour and your contentment, to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of France, and the benefit of al Christendom. At Paris in the month of Iuly, Anno. <hi>1596.</hi>
