   <head>THE PREFACE OF THE AVTHOR TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN by the prouidence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, (courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) who sweetly disposeth all things, I was by two Pursuiuants apprehended the 24. of March 1607. after our English accompt, and committed to the Clinke by the Lord Bishop of London on the 26. of the same moneth, 1608; I entred somewhat more deepely into the consideration of the controuersie of the Oath of allegiance, then before, whilest I was at libertie, I had done. And presently consulting with some of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren whom I found there prisoners before my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, I thought it very expedient to informe the Popes Holinesse of the lamentable estate of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, what miseries and imminent dangers such Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, as should refuse the Oath of allegiance, were like to fall into by reason of his Breues prohibiting them to take it; what diuision among Catholickes, what perturbation they were vndoubtedly to breed in the Church of England, (our dread Soueraigne being thereby not without iust cause exasperated) hoping by such meanes to procure a remedy before the malady
<pb facs="3"/>grew too desperate. But they more prudent, and better experienced in such like Romane informations then my selfe, thought it better in their iudgements, and more expedient, with patience to expect future euents from Rome, and not so to proceed, as being to small or no purpose at all.</p>
   <p>Hereupon I rested satisfied, though sorie in mind to consider the manifold euils that were like to ensue, as long as these two principall powers, Ecclesiasticall and ciuill, the Pope and our King, were at variance; and did not intend to set pen to paper of this matter; for that I knew my selfe the meanest among the rest of my brethren that had taken the Oath, and because I had (as I thought) in discharge of my particular duty, made sufficient proofe of my loyaltie towards his Maiestie, by accepting the Oath when it was required at my hands. In the end, aduised by a friend one of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to premeditate and prouide reasons for our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, to be sent to Rome; for it was to him more then probable he said, that in short space after we should receiue a commandement from his Holinesse so to do: and desirous withall to yeeld some satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the State, for the great scandall certaine of our brethren had giuen, by their perfidious inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in taking the Oath, &amp; anon after (being freed from troubles) relented and impugned (as hath bene repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that which they seemed by their act to haue iudged lawfull: I resolued vpon mature consideration, to reduce into some method for helpe of my memorie, and satisfaction of a friend, certaine notes which in scattered papers I had collected cōcerning this matter: not intending yet to publish them for feare first of
<pb facs="3"/>offending some Catholikes, who pretending the Oath to be vnlawfull (though they know not well wherein, are ready with rash censures to iudge and condemne, before sentence of condemnation from the chiefe Iudge be giuen: but especially I feared lest I should of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Popes Holinesse, who in his Breues hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admonished or prohibited all Catholikes to take it, or to teach the lawfulnesse thereof. At length know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my intention to be, not to offend any one, nor to contemne his Holinesse commandement; but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance, what in me lyeth, the glory of God, by setting downe sincerely what in my iudgement is truth, and perswading euery Catholike subiect to render to <hi>Caesar</hi> those things which are <hi>Caesars,</hi> to performe his dutie to his Maiestie in taking the Oath of allegiance, &amp; to seeke thereby to remoue the imputation of treachery and treason: I held it my dutie both to God and man, to breake silence, to cast away this humane feare, and to put on the mantle of charitie, <hi>quae foras mittit timorem.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4</note> Howbeit (gentle reader) whilest I meditated to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in these my labours, for the benefite of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Christ the Catholikes of England, sodainly that questiō of our B. Sauiour, as it were to deterre me from thē, came into my mind: <hi>Quis ex vobis volens tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim aedificare:</hi> Which of you minding to build a tower, doth not first sit downe and recken the charges that are necessarie, whether he haue to finish it: lest, after he hath laied the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that see it, begin to mocke him, saying, That this man began to build, and he could not finish it? I forthwith stayed, and cast my accompts, that is, I weighed the small meanes I had to relieue me taking paines, my
<pb facs="4"/>infirme and feeble body, slender furniture of bookes, and many interrupted distractions which my pouerty in prison ministred vnto me, and considered whether I might be able to bring this short treatise to an end, &amp; so auoide that illusion: <hi>This man beganne to build, and he could not finish it.</hi> Then though my meanes and abilitie euery way I knew to be small, yet trusting in the assistance of almightie God, whose glorie hereby I principally seeke, and is the chiefest reason of this my processe, I was by and by encouraged to attempt the defending of this Oath, (which I iudged farre beyond my talent) calling to remembrance that of the Prophet: <hi>In Deo meo transgrediar murum:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 17.</note> In my God I will passe ouer a wall.<note place="margin">Philip 4.</note> And the saying of S. <hi>Paule: Omnia possum in eo qui me confortat.</hi> I can do all things in him (that is, through his helpe) that strengtheneth me: nothing doubting also but,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. v. 13.</note>
      <hi>Qui operatus est in me velle, operaretur &amp; perficere pro bona voluntate.</hi> He that wrought in me to will, would likewise worke to accomplish according to his good will. Vpon this confidence then of Gods assistance, and for the instruction of certaine Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, who simply beleeue the inconsiderat assertions of some of their teachers; that such as take the Oath, do, and must renounce the Popes spirituall auctoritie of excommunication; and abiure or condemne for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie a disputable position, to wit, that the Pope may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for heresie or apostacie; which is most vntrue, as will easily appeare to him that without passion and with iudgement shall reade the Oath, or this my booke. These and such like I exhort not to be too credulous in a matter of so great moment as this is, giuing eare to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that will say, it may not be taken, and can shew
<pb facs="4"/>them no true reason why, nor in what point it is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. If any list wilfully to reiect this my wholsome counsaile, and will rather still giue eare to such as worke their ouerthrow, what else can they in reason expect but losse of lands and goods, perpetuall imprisonment by the law, finall destruction to them and theirs, and haply get no merite to benefite their soules, if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie (in clemencie excelling) be much exasperated? which with carefull regard ought to be looked vnto, because, <hi>Qui nimium emungit, elicet sanguinem:</hi> He that straineth too much, draweth bloud. And may not his Princely Maiestie be well sayd to excell in mercie and clemencie, who first with speede vpon the discouery of the Gun-powder treason, set forth his Proclamation worthy neuer to be forgottē, therby to stay the furie of the people, readie doubtlesse at that time to haue mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all that should beare the name of Catholike, without respecting who were innocēt or who were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent? &amp; after, himselfe,<note place="margin">Suetonius in Augusto.</note> as <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> in person plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the life of a souldier, by his pen interpreting the Oath of allegiāce, pleaded as it were (to giue satisfactiō of his Royall meaning &amp; intent of the law) for such as he needed not so farre to condescend vnto? This rare &amp; worthy example of our most learned &amp; most prudent Prince, I must needes say, was to me, (the least among many others) a very vrgent motiue to aduenture this spirituall combat of defending according to my power the Oath of allegiance.<note place="margin">Cic. lib. 1. Offic.</note>
      <hi>Studiosè</hi> (saith <hi>Cicero</hi>) <hi>plerique facta Principum imitantur.</hi> Many follow diligently the facts (or examples) of Princes. And if you reade the booke of the Iudges, you shal see what encouragement the example of <hi>Gedeon</hi> then Iudge of the Israelites
<pb facs="5"/>gaue vnto his small armie consisting but of 300 souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, against the Madianites their enemies in number al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most infinite.<note place="margin">Iudic. 7.</note>
      <hi>Quod me videritis facere</hi> (said this great Captaine) <hi>hoc facite: ingrediar partem castrorum, &amp; quod fecero sectamini.</hi> What you shall see me do, do you the same: I will enter into a part of the army, and what I shall do, that do you follow: which they did, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a happie victory. To whom can I better liken our mightie Monarch king <hi>Iames</hi> then to that worthy <hi>Gedeon?</hi> To me he seemeth likewise in effect to say vnto his subiects, What you see me do, do ye the same, as I haue begun to write, so follow my example, endeuoring by pen to defend my right, which is all I require by the Oath. Who admireth not the profound wisdome and great pietie of his Maiestie, that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing the fatall and wilfull fall of diuers of his beloued subiects, by reason of the Popes Breues prohibiting the Oath of allegiance, would be pleased for them &amp; their good, to retire himselfe from his princely recreations, to painefull labor both with mind and body, and to be the first that with his pen writ a learned Apologie for the Oath? Wherein for satisfaction of the perplexed consciences of some of his subiects, his Highnesse imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating our Blessed Sauiour,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note>
      <hi>qui vult omnes saluos fieri, &amp; neminem vult perire,</hi> who is willing all should be safe, &amp; will haue none to perish, interpreted his meaning to be, not to derogate from the Popes spiritual authoritie, but to require his subiects to performe their loyalty &amp; naturall obedience onely in temporals, which is due by the law of God &amp; nature; therby to draw all to his loue and their owne safety. Vouchsafe then, beloued reader, to spend some idle and vacant time to peruse this short
<pb facs="5"/>Treatise, written by thy welwiller for thy behoofe, to confirme thee if thou take the Oath, or to perswade thee if thou fearest it to be vnlawfull; the time thou spendest herein may counteruaile thy paines. Doubt nothing; if thou be Catholike, he is a Catholike priest that writeth, and teacheth thee herein Catholike doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: if thou be none, yet giue this booke the reading, assuring thy selfe this Author to be likewise a good &amp; loyall subiect, and as such he purposeth to liue and die. Feare God, honor the King, and in charitie pray for me thy hearty welwiller.</p>
