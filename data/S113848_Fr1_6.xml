our Author.</hi> But now wee arriue
where the height of wit, and sharpnesse of
iudgement, are both to bee exerciz'd, For,
<pb facs="9"/>
who can commend <hi>OVID</hi> sufficiently?
much lesse, who dares reprehend him?
Notwithstanding, I will say something;
not in way of detraction, but that we also
may be able to grow with his greatnesse.
<hi>Then speaking of his Metamorphosis.</hi>
Bookes deseruing a more fortunate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;
that from his last hand they might
haue had their perfection: which hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
bewaileth in luculent Verses. Yet are
there, in these, well-nigh an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which the wit of an other, I beleeue,
could neuer haue equall'd. <hi>And thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes

can hee said to transcend him. What should
I say of that singular, and well-nigh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
contexture of Fable with Fable? so
surpassing, that nothing can bee spoken or
done, more artificially, more excellently;
or, indeed, more gracefully. Who handling
such diuersitie of matter, so cunningly
weaues them together, that all appeare but
one Series. <hi>Planudes,</hi> well knowing that
Greece had not a Poem so abounding with
delight and beautie, translated it into that
language. What should I say more? All
Arts, which Antiquitie knew, are here so
fully delineated, that a number, expert in
both tongues, of prime vnderstanding and
iudgements, admire it beyond all expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>The first that writ a Commentarie
on this booke (whereof fiftie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
were vented, and that in his life
time) was</hi>
      <q>RAPHAEL REGIVS:<note place="margin">In praesar. Comment.</note>
      </q>
      <hi>Who thus in his Preface.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
appertaining to the knowledge and
glorie of warre, whereof wee haue not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
examples in the Metamorphosis of
<hi>OVID;</hi> (not to speake of stratagems, nor
<pb facs="10"/>
the Orations of Commanders) described
with such efficacie and eloquence, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
in reading, you will imagine your selfe
imbroiled in their conflicts. Neither shall
you finde any Author, from whom, a ciuill
life may gather better instruction.
<q>IACOBVS MICYLLVS.<note place="margin">In Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionum.</note>
      </q>
Hardly shall you find a Poem, which flowes
with greater facilitie. For what should I
speake of Learning? Herein, so great, so
various, and abstruse; that many places
haue neither beene explained, nor yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood;
no, not by the most knowing: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
rather a resolution from the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Oracle, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>Let the ingenuous, that affect not
error, now rectifie their owne by the
iudgements of these. But, incurable
Criticks, who warre about words,
and gail the sound to feed on their
sores, as not desiring their sanitie, I
forbeare to disswade, and deliuer
them vp to the censure of
<hi>Agrippa.</hi>
