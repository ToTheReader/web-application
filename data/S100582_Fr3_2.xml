Marke those three Chapters diligently, and ye shall perceyue that

the true Christian church is alone go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerned by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> preaching of gods word, an only office of Christ commaunded, and not by dead ceremonies cōmaun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> by the Pope, of whom there is no spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialtie.</p>
   <p>Consider howe those preachers throughout all this booke, are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto starres and Angels, their cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregacions called the right spouse of Christ. The other be assembled vnto most filthie locustes, bréeding of the smoke of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> pit bottomles, vnto hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full byrdes, foule spirites and diuils, their church called the proude Sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goge of Sathan, and the most execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whore of Babilon.</p>
   <p>In the iiij. Chapter is heauen made open, and the secrets therof manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> christian beléeuer, whom Iohn also representeth thys whole booke ouer. For not only are the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries therof in the vniuersall church performed, but also in the particular churches of nacions, and in the pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate consciences of men.</p>
   <p>In the .v.vj. and vij. Chapters, the
<pb n="3" facs="155"/>
Lambe Christ openeth the vij. seales of the booke of the most hidden myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God, for the vij. ages of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian church. In the meane season are the true seruantes of God sealed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to saluaciō, solaced in their troubles, and reléeued in their sorowes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, the great violence of the truthes aduersaries.</p>
   <p>In the viij. and ix. Chapters, the vij. Angels blowe their trumpettes. Signifying the preachers to shewe foorth their messages appoynted of God for the vij. ages of the churche, many wonderfull plages folowing in the people for their vnbeléeues sake, they obstinately resisting it, or els vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefully receiuing it.</p>
   <p>In the tenth Chapter commeth the mightie Angell from heauen with a booke in his hand all open, and Iohn deuoureth the same. Which betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the earnest preachers of this latter age of the church, wherein the true seruauntes of God shall gréedily receiue and also digest the scriptures. Take thys for a bréefe sum of all y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is
<pb facs="156"/>
spoken in the other volum, the residue shall follow hereafter in course.</p>
   <p>In the mergent of that first parte or volume, put I many allegacions both of the scriptures and doctors▪ And there vnto was I first prouoked by this saying of Sainct Hierome in a certayne Epistle of his, ad Paulinum monachum. The Apocalips of Sainct Iohn (sayeth he) hath so many myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as it hath wordes, or for euerie word a mysterie whither ye will.</p>
   <p>I mynded also thereby, my labours to ease the readers for search of the places, and to signify vnto them that I dyd nothing therin without auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And vndoubtedly the gatheryng of those places was so laborious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, as the making of the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, which neuerthelesse I thought well bestowed for the comfort of my bretheren.</p>
   <p>But two cruell enimyes haue my iust labours had in that behalfe, of whome the one hath them falsifyed, the other blasphéemed. Which hath caused me to leaue thē out in all that
<pb n="4" facs="156"/>
héere foloweth. The Printers are the fyrst, whose headie hast, negligence, and couetousnesse commonly corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all bookes. These haue both dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plased them and also chaunged theyr numbers to the truthes derogacion, what though they had at their hands ij. learned correctours which tooke all paynes possible to preserue them.</p>
   <p>The other is Momus or Zoylus, yea rather one whiche playeth both partes vnder the cloake of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. This cruell carper and malicious quarreller leaueth no mans worke vnrebuked, minister it neuer so much godlinesse. But lyke as rust, mothes, maggottes, cankers, catterpyllers, with other vyle vermyne corrupteth all that is to the vse of man, so doeth this enimy, to distroy both name and worke, only for the auauncement of his owne precious person.</p>
   <p>His working tooles are suche vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie sophismes, problemes, elēches, corolaries, quydities, subtylties, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde intentions, intrincycall moods, wyth other prodygious sorceryes,
<pb facs="157"/>
whom he sometime sucked out of hys mothers brestes y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vniuersitie. These hath he not yet all, as vnsauerie mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selles euometed for Christ, diffyning rather with Aristotle than with Paul in his dayly disputations.</p>
   <p>Of this ryall Rabi is Peter iudged a foole, and Iohn an vnlearned Idiote. Yet shall his reader finde small lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at his hande, vnlesse he take an heape of barbarous tearmes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sowed togither sentences for matters of excelent learning. But surely Iohn will one day come from Ephesus to visite this proude Diotrephes, &amp; shew him of his arrogant brags to his dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, vnlesse he leaue of in tyme. All Aristotles prouision shal not help hym.</p>
   <p>Sathan vpon the pynnacle of the Temple neuer bestowed his alleged scripture more peruersely, than thys Momus interpreted certayne of my allegaciōs, nor yet farther from their right vnderstanding: But I forgiue it him w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> this forewarning for this time, thoughe it bée not the fyrst lewde
<pb n="5" facs="157"/>
poynt that he hath playd, in case that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e so leaue his quareling. My second allegation vpon the Preface .1. Cor. 6 is not set there to authorise the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips, as he most falsly and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my meaning hath interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, but affirmeth that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian beléeuers are Christs members which ought of necessitie by the holy ghostes appointment to heare and to read the wordes of the sayde Booke. For I know that the epistle vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Corinthians was written of Paule ten yeares at the least before Saint Iohns Apocalips. No lesse is he than a false Prophet that resisteth Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my rebuking Babilon for hir wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,</p>
   <p>To much it were to answere his other quarellings, and to tedious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> christian readers, and therfore I passe them ouer least I shoulde be to plenteous in aunsweringe a foole according to hys foolishnesse. Thus by these cruell handelynges of these two vngratious enemies, haue I iust occasion to leaue out the allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="158"/>
in the margent, obseruing this wholsome counsell of Christ concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning such as they be. Geue not that is holy vnto Dogs, nor yet that is precious vnto swine. For the one of his churlish nature teareth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth, the other like a swine trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it vnder his filthy féete. The grace of our Lorde Iesus Christ be with thée euermore (good christian Reader) and with all thē that séeketh of the scriptures the sauing health in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined withoute quarelling. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
