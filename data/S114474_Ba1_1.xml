   <head>¶ A verie fruitefull Prayer to God the Father, for the obtayning of these benefites, promised in this Booke, and necessarie to be vsed at all tymes.</head>
   <p>MOst holie Lord, the God of the spirites of all fleshe, we giue vnto thée most humble thankes, for all thy goodnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs, which thou hast found in thy selfe before the beginning of the world, and hast declared vnto vs from tyme to tyme, acknowledging our selues to be farre lesse, then the least of thy mercies. Thou arte perfect in thy selfe, and hast no néede of any thing: but it hath pleased thée to create all these thinges, wherein thy glorie dooth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as Angelles and men, and all things else for them, that them selues might know that they are created onelie for thée: not that any thing by them, could be added vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thée, but that thy glorie which is perfect in it selfe, might be séene in them, and they also be made pertakers of that happinesse, which is with thée, the which thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs in thy belooued.
<pb facs="55"/>
In whome also thou hast chosen vs before all worlds, for so thy wisedome hath apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, that we should passe through a world and so come vnto thée, and see thy glory, and the ritches of thy mercie, and that pleasure which is with thée for euer. And to this ende hast thou giuen vs thy most holie woorde, and thy sanctifying spirite to attend therevpon: wherby thy elect children might be reformed vnto thée. Holy Father, who is able to comprehend this thy great worke of our saluation in Iesus Christe: but thine owne wisedome which is infinite? as thy mercie is, all goodnesse, mercie and trueth come from thée, and ende in thée: but the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill &amp; corruption which befalleth thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures commeth of them selues. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, this also thou turnest to good, for euen the wicked thou sufferest for a tyme, that at the length thy iustice might be séene in them: but to thy chyldren thou ordainest all thinges to the best, for euen the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes for theyr sinnes, and the afflictions of this life, thou hast appointed for good: that by thy iustice, thy mercie might more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and their own happinesse which thou hast prepared for them, in more glory might be reuealed. To this ende hast thou set
<pb facs="55"/>
them from thée for a tyme in this lyfe, that in the lyfe to come they may know the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what it is to enioy thy presence. Thou hast made them héere mortal, that they may then perceyue, what it is to be immortall with thée, thou giuest them ouer some time to their owne sinne, that they may knowe how much better it is to be holy with thée in thy kingdom: thou makest them taste of the afflictions of this world, that they may féele in them, howe great thy glorie is, and to be happye and blessed, with thy euerlasting goodnesse. Lord, in thy great power hast thou created all thinges, and orderest them in thy wisedome, preseruest them in thy goodnesse, and hast redéemed vs in thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to thy selfe, in thy belooued: but thou knowest this vaine and corrupte nature, which is fallen from thée, and can not ryse againe vnto thée, except it be drawne by thée. Doo away our sinnes, O Lord, and possesse vs, sanctifie vs with thy holy spirit, that we may walke before thée, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth thy chyldren, and knowe and féele in déede, that there is no pleasure nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of it selfe, in these thinges which are mortall of them selues, but onely in thée the euerlasting goodnesse in all thinges else, in
<pb facs="56"/>
thée and for thée. Increase our faith, that we may walke before thée in obedience of faith: giue vs also those things which thou knowest good and expedient for vs, in this mortall life: that wée may vse them to thy glorie, and to the comfort of our selues and others, whome thou hast commaunded vs to looue in thée, that thou béeing our lyfe, in this life, and in the life to come, we may enioy the presence of thy Maiestie, and glorifie thy holie name for euer, among thy elect people, and blessed Angelles.</p>
