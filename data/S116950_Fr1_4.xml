      <note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note>
      <hi>heele,</hi> because the <hi>stronger man brake his head.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And herein consider the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Gods spirite in these spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>brusing the heele,</hi> and <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

For it was Sathans power (of God) too <hi>bruse Christ his heele,</hi> to beat, buffet, hisse at, spit at, scourge, and persecute him in the flesh: too shame him on the Crosse, to goare his side, too pearce his head, hart, and hands, too shead his bloud: yet the same Jesus Christ Triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rose agayne with the same hys flesh, ascended with the same: and with the same doth there remayne at Gods right hand, Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and Earth. In takyng of which <hi>brused heele,</hi> albeit hee sometymes fainted in the infirmitie of the flesh: &amp; as it were calling his foote backe agayne at the first touch or steppe, because of the sharpe sting whiche he felt (for his own reuerēce cryed at the entraunce of his Passion, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Father if it be possible let this cuppe<note place="margin">Math. 26.</note>

passe)</hi> yet he willingly, for our onely cause, and benefite, continued too be <hi>brused on the heele: manfully spoyled</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luke. 11.</note>
      <hi>the enemy of his harnesse wherein hee</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal 91.</note>
      <hi>trusted: troad vnder the red Dragon:</hi> and finally <hi>brake</hi> and crusht his <hi>head,</hi> that is, the rigor of the Law, the strength of Sinne, and the sting of Death.</p>
   <p>In the same case, and cause of quarell, which he had with our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster he laboreth to master vs, vsing his force in, and vpon our flesh, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs often in conflict a foyle, or a fall: but it is the fall of the fleshe, not of the spirite: of the body, not of the soule: of Adam the old, and out ward mā, not of Christ the inward, and the new. For the same heele, or flesh brused by the fall, <hi>through the Lawe in it selfe</hi> (the corruption that yet remayneth euen in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect)<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note>
      <hi>rebelling agaynst the Law of our mynde,</hi> albeit it hold vs Captiue, and make vs as dead through tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
<pb facs="6"/>
(sor it standeth not with the riches of Gods mercy, and grace, neither with the kyndnesse whiche he shewed vnto vs in Christ Jesus, that wee should bee perfect in this fleshe) yet it hath no dominion, it <hi>quickeneth, and riseth agayne, and is</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ephes 2.</note>
      <hi>made too sit in heauenly places.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Where note (Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that the Holy Ghost sayth, <hi>it is made to sit,</hi> it setteth not it selfe. How then? or of whom commeth the healing of this bruse? the recouery of this fall? the deliuery from this body of Death? and albeit our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies make often, and strong inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or incursions, yet whence is the finall victory? <hi>I thanke my God,</hi> (sayth S. Paul) <hi>through Jesus Christ</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note>
      <hi>our Lord.</hi> First he thanketh: a note of grace, and free gift, not of desert, or duetie. For, who geueth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thankes for that, which of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, and desert is his owne. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he geueth thankes to God,
<pb facs="7"/>
not to himselfe: and he thāketh not God, but in Christ Jesu our Lord. So that in our selues there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng: in God the Father standeth the gift: but Jesus Christ is all in all. For God will not, neither can he be pleased, but onely when Christ maketh intercession. Marke the course, and doctrine of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? It is God in deede, who hath raysed vs vp together, and hath made vs sit together in the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places. But did he this for that wee pleased him? or for that some great Saint did make intreatie? no, he <hi>made vs sit there</hi> (sayth the Text) <hi>in Jesus Christ:</hi> in no other. And why so in Jesus Christ? Forsooth, <hi>that he might shew in ages too come the</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ephe. 2.</note>
      <hi>exceedyng riches of his grace, through his kyndnesse toward vs, in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi> So that his kyndnesse, grace, riches, and whatsoeuer his blessings which we haue, or shall haue at his handes, it is onely for his welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="7"/>
Sonnes sake: who onely made vs <hi>who were farre of neare vntoo his Father, and reconciled vs that were in hatred, and children of wrath by his Crosse, and precious bloud.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hauyng him in thy mynde, or hart it is an horrible and fearefull thyng, but too thinke of God: A God of wrath and seuere iustice, but onely in his Sonne Christ, in whom he is well pleased.</p>
   <p>Pleased he is, we all cōfesse, and not only for original sinne alone (as some do affirme, thereby teachyng, that what sinne we cōmit after our baptisme we our selues, or the priest for vs, hauyng his hyer, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme, and not Christ) but also for all other Sinne in course of lyfe cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. For, <hi>by grace are wee saued</hi> (sayth the text, not washed) <hi>and that through Fayth.</hi> Which Fayth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not by oftē workyng well (for thē we might well argue that wee are saued by woorkes, when wee
<pb facs="8"/>
are saued by Fayth whiche is the fruite of our workes) but <hi>it is the gift of God</hi> (sayth the Scripture in the same place) <hi>and not of our woorkes.</hi> And why? <hi>least any man shold boast of himselfe.</hi> For thy woorkes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and for thy Fayth, thanke God, and thanke God through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. He onely is that good, and pitifull Samaritane, who, when we haue taken the foyle, or the fall, being sore wounded in this conflict of the flesh, &amp; Spirite, and so cast as forlorne too the hedge, doth wash, and heale our sores, and woundes with his most pure, &amp; blessed oyle, his sweet hart bloud, paying the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost farthyng of our debt: too him be all honor, glory, and triūph for euer. Amen.</p>
   <p>Of this I thought good too ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish thee, Christiā Reader, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous with thee to reioyce at the wō derfull woorkes of mercy wrought by this our great Champion Jesus
<pb facs="8"/>
Christ whose victory is our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: &amp; though we sinne of infirmitie yet he is perfect. Read, and accept this comfortable Treatise which I haue translated: therein shalt thou finde faithfully set before thine eyes what Christ hath done for vs in his Passion, and what he requireth of vs againe for being made partakers of the fruites of his Passion. The same Lord Jesus Christ blesse thy body, and soule to lyfe euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng. Amen. In whom I most hartely byd, and wishe thee too farewell.</p>
