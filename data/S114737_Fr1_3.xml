   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Gladly call to minde the time, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yong, I heard, worthy Master PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KINS, so Preach in a great Assembly of Students, that he instructed them sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Truth, stirred them up effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to seeke after Godlinesse, made them fit for the kingdome of God; and by his owne example shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, what things they should chiefely intend, that they might promote true Religion, in the power of it, unto Gods glory, and others salvation:</p>
   <p>And amongst other things which he Preached pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, hee began at length to Teach, How with the tongue of the Learned one might speake a word in due season to him that is weary, out of <hi>Esai.</hi> 50. 4. by unty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and explaining diligently, <hi>CASES OF CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCIENCE</hi> (as they are called.) And <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>found him so doing like a faithfull Servant.</hi> Yet left he many behinde him affected with that study; who by their godly Sermons (through Gods assistance) made it to runne, encrease, and be glorifyed throughout <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>My heart hath ever since been so set upon that Study, that I haue thought it worthy to be followed with all care, by all men. Since also (Gods good providence so disposing it) that I lived out of mine owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, I did obserue that in divers Churches, pure both for Doctrine and Order, this Practicall teaching was much wanting, and that this want was one of the chiefe causes of the great neglect, or carelessenesse in some
<pb facs="4"/>
duties which neerely concerne Godlinesse, and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian life. My minde was set on, as it were by violence, to try at least in private, whether I were able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with some young men that purpose the Ministry, more to apply their mindes to this kinde of handling of Divinity; whence no small fruit was to bee hoped for. Being afterwards called to a publike charge of Teaching in the Vniversitie, I esteemed nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or more excellent, then to goe before those that were Students for the Ministrie, in this manner of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
   <p>This part of Prophecie hath hitherto beene lesse practised in the Schooles of the Prophets, because our Captaines were necessarily inforced to fight alwaies in the front against the enemies to defend the Faith, and to purge the floore of the Church; So that they could not plant and water the Fields and Vineyards as they desired; as it useth to fall out in time of hotte warres. They thought with themselues in the meane while (as one of some note writes) <hi>If we haue that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and cleare eye of the Gospel if in the house of our Heart the candle of pure Faith be set upon a Candlesticke, these small matters might easily be discussed.</hi> But experience hath taught at length, that through neglect of this husbandry, a famine of Godlinesse hath followed in many places, and out of that famine a grievous spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all plague; insomuch that the counsell of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had need be practised; namely, that every man should labour in this worke with one hand, holding in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Speare or a Dart, whereby he may repell the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of the enemies. The same Experience hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise taught, that these <hi>small</hi> matters (if so be that so necessary things may bee so called) are despised with
<pb facs="4"/>
no lesse madnesse, then if one would suffer the fingers and toes of his hands and feete to bee cut off, as some small things, without which he hoped to walke and use his hands well enough. All things therfore being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed, I haue taken in hand (God also liking it, as J am perswaded) these instructions touching the power of Conscience. Not that I hope that any perfect thing, in this kinde, can come from me: (for there are more kinds of things this way, then that certaine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers can be given (by me at least) to every one) but that I might doe something, whereby the unlearned, and such as are destitute of better helpe, might some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what be helped; and that the more learned might bee excited to set forth some more perfect and exact thing. Of which duty the godly, learned, graue ancient Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are properly the Debtors, whose dayly labour it is to deale with the Consciences of men; who through their experience haue learned much better, what those questions are, in which the Conscience u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth most to doubt, and out of what grounds they may be best unfolded; then can easily be vnderstood by one that liues privately in an Academicall profession. And indeede, if such things were handled in the meetings of Preachers, according to the variety of Cases that fall out; and the more remarkeable decisions set downe in writing; the children of Israel should not neede to goe downe to the Philistims (that is, our Sutdents to Popish Authors) to sharpen every man his Share, his Mattocke, or his Axe, or his weeding Hooke, as it fell out in the extreame necessity of Gods people, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 20.</p>
   <p>Furthermore if such as are addicted to the Ministry, were first instructed in these things, and were seriously
<pb facs="5"/>
tried in them at the Examination, before they were ordained, one might well hope, to haue as well Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers as Churches, more according to Gods heart and <hi>Christs,</hi> then now we haue.</p>
   <p>The Papists haue laboured much this way, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct their Confessors: and in a great deale of earth and dirt of Superstitions, they haue some veines of Silver: out of which, I suppose, I haue drawne some things that are not to be despised. But they are without the life of this Doctrine: and death is in their pot. The thing it selfe requires, that by others, other things bee taught, and the same things, after another manner. I haue gone about to performe this in part: and others I make no question, will indeavour it.</p>
   <p>I follow here the same methode, that I did in my <hi>Marrow of Divinity.</hi> Of the second part whereof, the<note place="margin">Med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>la Theologi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap>.</note> three last of these Bookes are a full Exposition: which perhaps, those did expect that desired importunatly, as it were by dayly reproaches, that the publishing of this Treatise might bee hastened. But (to make an end at length of my Preface) I will conclude many things in few words, and that in the words of <hi>G. Parisiensis, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these things, many things we haue not written for unskilfulnes, many for other necessary businesse, many for dulnesse, many through feare of being tedious, many more because of our sinnes, which most of all hinder both us and others in such things. We doubt not, but we are subject to the danger of slanderous Backbiters; But by doing what we may, we have given some fit occasion unto wise men; and we haue set foorth, not a dry sandy ground of fruitlesse Disputations, but a most profitable and healthfull place for Wits to exercise themselues in.</hi>
