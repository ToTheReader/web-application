   <lg>
      <l>OH Heauenly Spirit of especiall power,</l>
      <l>That in thy hand, thy praise of praises holdest:</l>
      <l>And, from the top of <hi>Truthes</hi> triumphant tower,</l>
      <l>The hidden sence, of fairest thoughts vnfoldest:</l>
      <l>Inspire this hart, and humble soule of mine,</l>
      <l>With some sweet sparkle of thy power deuine.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Teach me to thinck but on that onely thought,</l>
      <l>Wherein doth liue the grace of vertues glory:</l>
      <l>And, learne no more, then what thy truth hath taught</l>
      <l>To those best wits, that write thy worthie storie:</l>
      <l>Wherein is seene, in heauen and earths preseruing,</l>
      <l>The highest point of praises praise deseruing.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Let not compare, come neere vnto none such,</l>
      <l>Heauen bee my thought, and let the world go by:</l>
      <l>And say withall, that say I nere so much,</l>
      <l>All are but trifles to thy treasurie:</l>
      <l>For all, no more, then what thy mercie giueth,</l>
      <l>Who can behold wherein thy glory liueth?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>No, I can see the shining of the Sunne,</l>
      <l>But cannot sound the Essence of the light:</l>
      <l>Then, of thy face, in whom that faire begunne,</l>
      <l>How can my soule presume to haue a sight?</l>
      <l>No, my deere God, thy glory hath a beeing,</l>
      <l>Where Eie, nor Heart, nor Soule may haue a seeing.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <l>And therefore Lord since such thy glory is,</l>
      <l>As cannot bee, but of thy selfe conceiued:</l>
      <l>And heauen nor earth, conteines that sparke of blisse,</l>
      <l>But from thy hand of Mercy is receiued:</l>
      <l>What spirit can hir sweetest passion raise?</l>
      <l>Neere to the due of thy deserued praise.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Yet, since all glory doth belong to thee,</l>
      <l>Thy name in all things must bee magnified:</l>
      <l>And by thy Mercie thou hast made mee see,</l>
      <l>How in my soule thou maist be glorified:</l>
      <l>In that sweet Mercy make my Soule to know,</l>
      <l>How best I may thy blessed glory show.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Oh glorious God, what creature can there bee?</l>
      <l>That moues or Breathes, or growes, but shewes thy glory:</l>
      <l>What art, or science, but doth speake of thee,</l>
      <l>And writes the wonder of thy wisedome story:</l>
      <l>What sound or sence, can reasons Soule refine?</l>
      <l>But speakes in glory of thy grace deuine?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The Sunne, in brightnesse glorifies the light,</l>
      <l>That in the beames but of thy beauty liueth:</l>
      <l>The Moone and Starres amid the darkest night,</l>
      <l>Shew what a light thy louing Mercy giueth:</l>
      <l>So, Sunne and Moone and all those shining creatures,</l>
      <l>Doe shew thy glory, in their lightsome natures.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="5"/>
      <l>Is not the daye a figure of perfection,</l>
      <l>Wherin thy creatures were created first:</l>
      <l>And Night of sinne, that with a fowle infection,</l>
      <l>Shewes how the Soule is for hir sinnes accurst:</l>
      <l>But night once past, the Glorious daie appeering,</l>
      <l>Shewes sinnes forgiuen the ioy of mercies cheering.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>So, Sunne and Moone, and Starres, and daie and night,</l>
      <l>Speakes of thy glorie in their cause of beeing:</l>
      <l>And, how they serue but in obedience right,</l>
      <l>Vnto the grace, but of thy will agreeing:</l>
      <l>While wisdome shewes in state of reasons storie,</l>
      <l>They giue vs light, that wee may giue thee glory.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The Azure Skie, more cleere then Chrystalline,</l>
      <l>Wherin the Sunne doth cast his beames abroad:</l>
      <l>How doth it figure that faire hand of thine?</l>
      <l>Wherein thy Mercie makes hir most aboade:</l>
      <l>While, to the humble soules beleeuing eye,</l>
      <l>Thy glory shines farre brighter then the Skie.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The Clowds that shed those dropps of blessed dewes,</l>
      <l>That water the drie places of the Earth:</l>
      <l>What droppe so small, but it thy glory shewes?</l>
      <l>To bring a plenty where was earst a dearth:</l>
      <l>How doe they figure faithfull sorrowes teares?</l>
      <l>Whence sin-burnt soules the fruit of mercie beares.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="5"/>
      <l>The Aier, that giues each liuing creature breath,</l>
      <l>Speakes of thy glorie in that breathing power:</l>
      <l>And, when it leaues the creature vnto death,</l>
      <l>It shewes thy glory, in that parting hower:</l>
      <l>To leaue the flesh so in corruption wounded,</l>
      <l>Till grace renue, that was in sinne confounded.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The earth, that yeelds such choice of fruits and flowers,</l>
      <l>How doth it shew, that glorious power of thine?</l>
      <l>When, all vnseene doe hidden lie those powers,</l>
      <l>That Arte or Nature neuer can define:</l>
      <l>How sweetes, and formes, and colours so should grow,</l>
      <l>But that thy glorious will would haue it so.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And, as the spring brings forth the budding greene,</l>
      <l>With, beauties dies for to adorne the field:</l>
      <l>So in the winter, few or none are seene,</l>
      <l>That can the eye contentiue pleasure yeeld:</l>
      <l>So that the earth that neuer silence breaketh,</l>
      <l>In hir dumb speech, yet, of thy glory speaketh.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The Sea wherein those worlds of fishes liue,</l>
      <l>That floate and tomble in the tossing waues:</l>
      <l>What Notice doe they of thy glory giue,</l>
      <l>That from the Whale the little Herring saues:</l>
      <l>And makes the Dolphin wound the Whale so sore,</l>
      <l>As driues him from the Sea to die on shore.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <l>What beast so great? or creeping worme so small?</l>
      <l>what bird so high, or of so low a flight?</l>
      <l>But, that thy name is glorified in-all,</l>
      <l>who, hauing made them by thy heauenly might:</l>
      <l>Preseruest them so, that all the world may see,</l>
      <l>They haue their beeing onely but in thee.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The beast his heare, the feather of the bird,</l>
      <l>The fishes scale, and euery tree his barke:</l>
      <l>These for defence doth Nature all aforde,</l>
      <l>As of thy glory, euery one a marke:</l>
      <l>wherein thy hand of Mercy is beheld:</l>
      <l>That doth such comfort to each creature yeeld.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Is not the Fire a figure of thy wrath?</l>
      <l>That soone consumes the proude assault of sinne:</l>
      <l>The aire, the pacience that thy mercie hath,</l>
      <l>When true contrition doth remission winne:</l>
      <l>The water, teares, that thou for sinne hast shed,</l>
      <l>The Earth, thy death for to redeeme the dead.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Since then, aboue, and in the Elements,</l>
      <l>Sunne, Moone, Stars, Skie, Fire, water, Earth, and Aier:</l>
      <l>And, what may be beneath the Firmament,</l>
      <l>Beasts, Birds, Fish, worme, scale, fether, hide, nor haier:</l>
      <l>Nor Tree, nor Flower, nor Herbe, nor Grasse, doth grow,</l>
