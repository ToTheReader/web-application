   <head>THE ARGVMENT.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>LVcius Tarquinius</hi> (for his excessiue pride surnamed <hi>Superbus</hi>)
after hee had caused his owne father in law <hi>Seruius Tullius</hi> to
be cruelly murdred, and contrarie to the Romaine lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
not requiring or staying for the peoples suffrages, had possessed
himselfe of the kingdome: went accompanyed with his sonnes and other
Noble men of Rome, to besiege <hi>Ardea,</hi> during which siege, the principall
men of the Army meeting one euening at the Tent of <hi>Sextus Tarquini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
the Kings sonne, in their discourses after supper euery one commended
the vertues of his owne wife: among whom <hi>Colatinus</hi> extolled the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
chastity of his wife <hi>Lucretia.</hi> In that pleasant humor they all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
to Rome, and intending by theyr secret and sodaine arriuall to make
triall of that which euery one had before auouched, onely <hi>Colatinus</hi> finds
his wife (though it were late in the night) spinning amongest her maides,
the other Ladies were all found dauncing and reuelling, or in seuerall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: whereupon the Noble men yeelded <hi>Colatinus</hi> the victory, and
his wife the Fame. At that time <hi>Sextus Tarquinius</hi> being ensflamed
with <hi>Lucrece</hi> beauty, yet smoothering his passions for the present, departed
with the rest backe to the Campe: from whence he shortly after priuily
withdrew himselfe, and was (according to his estate) royally entertayned
and lodged by <hi>Lucrece</hi> at <hi>Colatium.</hi> The same night he tretcherouslie
stealeth into her Chamber, violently rauisht her, and early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
speedeth away. <hi>Lucrece</hi> in this lamentable plight, hastily dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Messengers, one to Rome for her father, another to the Campe for
<hi>Colatine.</hi> They came, the one accompanyed with <hi>Iunius Brutus,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>Publius Valerius:</hi> and finding <hi>Lucrece</hi> attired in mourning
habite, demanded the cause of her sorrow. Shee first taking an oath of
them for her reuenge, reuealed the Actor, and whole maner of his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and withall sodainely stabbed her selfe. Which done, with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
they all vowed to roote out the whole hated family of the <hi>Tarquins:</hi>
and bearing the dead body to Rome, <hi>Brutus</hi> acquainted the people with
the doer and manner of the vile deede: with a bitter inuectiue against the
tyranny of the King, wherewith the people were so moued, that with one
consent and a general acclamation the <hi>Tarquins</hi> were all exiled, and the
state gouernment changed from Kings to Consuls.</p>
