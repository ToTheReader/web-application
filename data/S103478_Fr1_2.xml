      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable, hauing (long since) often weighed and considered, with my selfe, the great care &amp; paines that haue been taken, in setting forth sundry necessary books for plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; grafting of fruit, &amp; finding it (by much experience) no lesse needfull, that the right order, in gatheting &amp; keeping thereof, should be made knowen, &amp; obserued: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, at length (for the general good of the whole kingdome) to lay downe, in this small Treatise, the disorder and abuses of the vnskilful in this kinde; together with the true &amp; due course to be taken therein. The worke now finished, I haue presumed (though far vnworthy) to publish it, to the world (vnder the shadow of your honorable protection) as the first fruites of a willing minde, ready to make tender of his humble seruice, &amp; acknowledgement of all duty, to your Lordship, to performe it, in what he may. Not doubting, but that, as your Ho: (next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Maiestie) hath been the protectour &amp; preseruer of the whole realme of <hi>Ireland,</hi> you will also vouchsafe to patronize and protect one Irish-borne, who (by long experience) hath made triall of that which he deliuereth to others. Wherefore, humbly crauing, that your Honour will bee pleased to accept hereof, &amp; to giue it countenance (that so the rather it may haue free passage, in despite of malitious &amp; scornfull tongues, into the hands of all such as desire to eat the fruite of their owne vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyards, in their due season): I conclude with my earnest and feruent prayers to Almighty God, for the protection and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of your good Lordship, in all true honour &amp; happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in this life; &amp; hereafter to make you partaker of that inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable &amp; incorruptible fruit of the life eternall, which groweth not in orchards of mens planting, but in the Paradise of God,</p>
