   </head>
   <opener>
      <salute>Right Honourable and my very good Lord,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ouchsafe to accept that which was both concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and brought forth at Your Lordships <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund;</hi> you haue giuen it a being, it now craues your protection; and the rather because it brings you at once a <hi>testimony</hi> both of my <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>weakenesse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Worth</hi> of our late noble Lord, Your worthy Father (now with <hi>Christ,</hi> deserued, (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) a farre more learned <hi>Pen,</hi> though had not neede of any: t'is the Priviledge of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> to bee their owne <hi>Pannegyrists, —habent opera suam lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guam</hi> (saith S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>) <hi>&amp; suam facundiam tacente linguâ,</hi>—they haue not onely tongues of their owne, but eloquence, and in a powerfull silence proclaime themselues.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>'Tis therefore a superfluous labour to endeauour to preserue his memorie in these poore paper monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who still liues in those walking <hi>images</hi> of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, his religious and hopefull <hi>Children;</hi> still liues in the sad hearts of the poore and naked, whom his <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> hath so often fed, and cloathed: in that neglected vertue of <hi>Hospitalitie,</hi> (for justly may it preserue that <hi>Name</hi> into <hi>eternitie</hi> by which it selfe liues; which in this cold <hi>dotage</hi> of the decrepit <hi>World,</hi> and perpetuall frost of <hi>Charitie,</hi> would be benumm'd or staru'd, were it not entertain'd and cherish'd by that honourable Name of <hi>Spencer</hi> and some few others:) but in this Your Honour will satisfie the world, who beleeues You as truely to succeed Him in his vertues, as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions; and in his pious and religious <hi>Examples,</hi> which euer surviue their <hi>Authors</hi> Funerals, they haue a life of their owne, or rather an immortality, by which they not onely continue vnto posterity, but powerfully perswade to imitation.</p>
   <p>But since it hath pleased the dead to appoint a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the liuing to make choise of my selfe (the most vnworthy of Gods Ministers, none being more conscious of his owne defects, none more willing to serue this Honourable Family according to his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) I haue studied to fit my Sermon, to his Funerals. He did not affect <hi>Pompam funeris,</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> speakes <hi>ad Paulam</hi> vpon the death of <hi>Blaesilla:</hi> nor I <hi>Pompam Sermonis;</hi> here's no Rhetoricke vs'd to moue the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and affections, which are the stoppes and fretts of the Soule, to bee fingred by the Art of a powerfull Oratour: I know the times wee liue in to be criticall
<pb facs="3"/>and touchy, and that our Funerallists frequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to teach <hi>sorrow</hi> to be eloquent, an age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an intemperate <hi>curiosity</hi> of style is become not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>humour,</hi> but a <hi>disease;</hi> for my part I haue chosen (in a pious obseruāce of that plainesse he required) rather to satisfye <hi>the desire of the dead, then the curiositie of the liuing;</hi> and therefore I doe not (as the olde <hi>Romanes</hi> vsed) <hi>laudare defunctum pro rostris</hi> (to speake with <hi>Suetonius</hi> in his <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi>

   </p>
   <p>If any accuse this poore <hi>Peece,</hi> as <hi>Lucilius</hi> did the writings of <hi>Fabianus Papirius;</hi> for to plaine, I must borrow that <hi>Apologie</hi> which <hi>Seneca</hi> made for him, <hi>mores ego, non verba composui, &amp; animis scripsi illa, non auribus;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Seneca ep. <hi>100.</hi>

   </p>
   <p>That diuine Moralist commaunds his yong <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> that he should euer suppose <hi>Cato</hi> or some of the stricter Stoickes, a beholder of all his actions,<note place="margin">Sen. ep. <hi>11.</hi>
      </note> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conceite of such an awfull presence, a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient direction: Your Honour needes goe no further then the happy memory of your blessed Father ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for direction or patterne. Suppose you him bespeaking his Children as <hi>Valerius Corvinus</hi> did his Souldiers, <hi>Facta mea vos imitari vellem, nec discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam modò, sed exemplum:</hi> take out the Lecture, and goe on (great Lord) in those vertuous and pious courses hee hath trode before you, and <hi>that</hi> God, with whom hee now raignes in glory, prosper and protect you in all your actions, guide and direct you
<pb facs="4"/>in all your wayes, crowne you with the blessing of peace heere, and with a Crowne of glory hereafter: this shall euer bee the prayer of him who is, and professeth still to continue</p>
