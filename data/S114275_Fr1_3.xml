   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader:
I here present thee
with some peeces
&amp; fragments of an
intire and iust discourse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the Author, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that vsefull &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Argument, the sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and triall of a Christians
loue to Christ: It was the
glory of the last age, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other miracles, God
blessed it with the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Leraning, it being
<pb facs="7"/>
being a time wherein liued
and flourished men famous
for learning and piety, who
sent abroad into the world
many large volumes for the
vindicating of Gods true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and worship from Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barisme,
Errour, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition:
And 'tis a part of the
happinesse of this our Age,
that (beside the same truth
still maintained) it hath sent
forth many famous Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises
concerning the nature
of faith, the power and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of Religion. Amongst
which, this would not haue
beene of the least note, if the
Author himselfe had liued
to finish it: A continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and perfecting whereof
<pb facs="8"/>
I cannot hope for from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
much lesse dare I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to attempt it my selfe,
as euer loathing that soloe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme,
<q>
         <bibl>Hor. Art. Poet.</bibl>
         <l>—vt turpitèr atrum</l>

formosa supernè.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Take therfore these Sermons
as they were deliuered and
left by him: What is done in
them I had rather should
appeare to thy iudgement in
the serious reading, then
from my opinion of them:
onely let mee intreate thee to
read them with the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
they were written (for
that's the way to profit by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens works) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb facs="8"/>
not thy selfe to trifle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
some odde houre in thē,
but reserue them to some of
thy most retired thoughts
and seuerest meditations, so
maist thou by Gods blessing
finde something to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the assurances of thy
hopes by Christ, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
thy future care and
loue to sincerity. In which
respests, if they profit any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whose hands they come, I
shall lesse blame the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of some who for that
cause earnestly desired them,
and the lesse regard the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of others, who may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mislike the publishing of
them. As his conuersation
was sweet, so is his memory
<pb facs="9"/>
pretious, to mee as to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Neither can I thinke it
any way stained by the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of loue, wherein I chose
rather to giue life to some
things of His, than that all
should die with him. All the
good bee thine, and all the
Glory, Gods. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
