      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ntiochus</hi> the Great, who was the first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Antioch,</hi> the most famous Citty in all <hi>Syria,</hi> hauing one onelie daughter, in the prime and glory of her youth, fell in most vnnaturall loue with her; and what by the power of his perswasions, and feare of his tyranny, he so preuailed with her yeelding heart, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came maister of his desires; which to continue to himself, his daughter, being for her beauty desired in marriage of many great princes, he made this law, That whoso presumed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire her in marriage, and could not vnfold the meaning of his questions, for that attempt should loose his life. Fearelesse of this Lawe, many Princes aduentured, and in their rashnesse perished: amongst the number PERICLES the Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and neighbour to this tyrant King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> was the last who vndertooke to resolue this Riddle, which he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, through his great wisedome, performed: and finding both the subtiltie and sinne of the Tyrant, for his owne safetie fled secretly from <hi>Antioch</hi> backe to <hi>Tyre,</hi> and there acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Helycanus</hi> a graue Counsell our of his with the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, as also with his present feare what might succeed, from whose counsell he tooke aduise, for a space to leaue his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and betake himselfe to trauell; to which yeelding, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi> puts to sea, ariues at <hi>Tharsus,</hi> which he finds (thorow the dearth of corne) in much distresse: he there relieues <hi>Cleon</hi> and <hi>Dyonysa</hi> with their distressed City, with the prouision which he brought of purpose; but by his good Counsellour <hi>Hely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> hearing newes of <hi>Antiochus</hi> death, he intends for <hi>Tyre,</hi> puts againe to Sea, suffers shipwracke, his shippes and men

all lost, till (as it were) Fortune tyred with his mis-happes, he is throwne vpon the shoare, releeued by certaine poore Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shermen, and by an Armour of his which they by chaunce dragged vp in their nettes, his mis-fortunes being a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, <hi>Pericles</hi> arriues at the Court of good <hi>Symonides</hi> King of <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> where through his noblenesse both in Armes and Arts, he winnes the loue of faire <hi>Thaysa</hi> the kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by her fathers consent marries her.</p>
   <p>In this absence of his, and, for which absence the <hi>Tyrians</hi> his subiects muteny, would elect <hi>Helycanus</hi> (whome <hi>Pericles</hi> ordained his substitute in his absence) their King, which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of theirs <hi>Helycanus</hi> by his graue perswasions subdewed, and wonne them to goe in quest of their lost Prince <hi>Pericles:</hi> In this search he is found, and with his wife <hi>Thaysa,</hi> who is now with childe, and <hi>Lycorida</hi> her Nurse; hauing taken leaue of his kingly Father, puts againe for <hi>Tyre,</hi> but with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of a tempest at Sea, his Queene falles in trauell, is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered of a daughter, whome hee names <hi>Marina,</hi> in which childe-birth his Queene dies, she is throwne ouer boorde, at departure of whome <hi>Pericles</hi> altereth his course from <hi>Tyre,</hi> being a shorter cut, to his hoste <hi>Cleon</hi> in <hi>Tharsus;</hi> hee there leaues his yoong daughter to be fostered vp, vowing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a solitary &amp; pensiue life for the losse of his Queene.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Thaysa</hi> thus supposed dead, and in the seas buried, is the next morning on the shore taken vp at <hi>Ephesus</hi> by <hi>Cerimon</hi> a most skilfull Physition, who by his Arte practised vpon this Queene, so preuailed, that after fiue houres intraunced, she is by his skill brought to able health againe, and by her owne request, by him placed to liue a Votary in <hi>Dianaes</hi> Temple at <hi>Ephesus. Marina Pericles</hi> sea-borne daughter, is by this gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to discreete yeares, she is enuied of <hi>Dyonysa Cleons</hi> wife, her foster mother, for that <hi>Marinaes</hi> perfection exceedeth a daughter of hers, <hi>Marina</hi> by this enuy of hers should haue beene murthered, but being rescued by certaine Pyrates, is as it were reserued to a greater mishap, for by them she is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Metelyne,</hi> sold to the deuils broker a bawd, to haue bin


<pb facs="3"/>
trained vp in that infection, shee is courted of many, and how wonderfully she preserues her chastitie.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Pericles</hi> returnes from <hi>Tyre</hi> toward <hi>Tharsus,</hi> to visite the hospitable <hi>Cleon, Dyonysa,</hi> and his yoong daughter <hi>Marina,</hi> where by <hi>Dyonysaes</hi> dissembling teares, and a Toombe that was erected for her, <hi>Pericles</hi> is brought to beleeue, that his <hi>Marina</hi> lies there buryed, and that shee died of her naturall death, for whose losse hee teares his haire, throwes off his garments, forsweares the societie of men, or any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. In which passion for many moneths continuing, hee at last arriues at <hi>Metelyne,</hi> when being seene and pittied by <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simachus</hi> the Gouernour, his daughter (though of him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen so) is by the Gouernour sent for, who by her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent skill in Song, and pleasantnesse in discourse, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the story of her owne mishap, shee so winnes againe her fathers lost sences, that hee knowes her for his childe, shee him for her father; in which ouer-ioy, as if his sences were nowe all confounded, <hi>Pericles</hi> falles asleepe, where in a dreame is by <hi>Diana</hi> warned to goe to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and there to make his sacrifice. <hi>Pericles</hi> obayes, and there comes to the knowledge of <hi>Thaysa</hi> his wife, with their seuerall Ioyes that they three so strangely diuided, are as strangely mette. <hi>Lysimachus</hi> the Gouernour marrieth <hi>Marina,</hi> and <hi>Pericles</hi> leauing his mourning, causeth the bawde to be burned. Of his reuenge to <hi>Cleon</hi> and <hi>Dyonysa,</hi> his rewarding of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shermen that releeued him, his iustice toward the Pyrats that made sale of his daughter, his returne backe to his kingdome, and of him and his wifes deaths. Onely intreating the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to receiue this Historie in the same maner as it was vnder the habite of ancient <hi>Gower</hi> the famous English Poet, by the Kings Maiesties Players excellently presented.</p>
