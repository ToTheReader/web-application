      <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Raxiteles the Painter, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded why in presenting a curious target to Minerua hee did most cunnigly pourtray the picture of her Priest Chrisites, aunswered that Mynerua was wise, &amp; so was Chrisites, &amp; that being his friend he thought this the best meanes to gratifie him. Which saying of Praxiteles I take as a sufficient excuse for my rashnesse. For if I be demaunded why in dedicating my Booke to others I haue inserted your worshippes name, I answere that both your constant, vertuous and godly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiō caused me with Praxiteles to ingraue your name in a worke where Gentlewomens cōstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is so stifly defended, knowing your rare and vertuous qualities to be such, as your verie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (if you haue anie) shall be forced maugre their face to extoll vour fame with immortall
<pb facs="41"/> praise, and also your liberall bountie &amp; friendly curtesie (whereof without any desert I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted) draue me, though not as I would, yet as I could, to shew the dutifull affection wherwith I am bound to be at your commaund for euer. While thus I wished more euidently to shewe some signe of my good will, a certaine letter of Mamillia to the yong Ladie Modesta chaunced to come vnto my hands, wherein the Anatomy of Louers flatteries is displaied, which I humbly present vnto your worshipfull patronage, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you to accept it, not according to the value of the gift, but to the mind of the giuer, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring you that none of your welwillers do in heart wish you more prosperitie, though my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie be not able in outward shewe to make it manifest. Thus ceasing to trouble your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, I commit you to the Almightie.</p>
