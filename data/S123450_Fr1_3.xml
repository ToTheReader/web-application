   <head>To the Christian <hi>Reader.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>I Am not ignorant (good Reader) that set formes of Prayer are very distastfull vnto many: They are adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to bee a kind of confining and limiting of Gods Spirit: And some which doe allow them a lawfull vse in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, doe yet not so well approue them for priuate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. For mine owne part, as I fauour neither their fondnesse who scarce account it praying,
<pb facs="6"/>
vnlesse it bee by a booke; nor their carelesness, who labor not to attaine to an ability of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending their personall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions (euen in wordes of their owne conceiuing) vnto God: so I could neuer see good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why platformes of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for those, who are yet but beginners in this spirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Prayer should bee thought any way inconuenient or needlesse amongst Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. There is a great deale more arte in the cariage of a sute to be put vppe vnto God (especially when a man is to be the mouth of others, as in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or in visiting the sicke, or the like occasion) then euery one, though perhaps hee haue some good feeling and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in Religion, can at the
<pb facs="7"/>
first attaine vnto. Neither is it (as is pretended) any straitning or bounding of Gods Spirit; but a meanes rather of quickening and stirring vp the spirit of him that prayeth, when he shall see the necessitie of bemoning some corruptions, or of crauing some graces, or of giuing thanks for some blessings recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which himselfe did not so much as thinke vpon before. Besides, that hee may accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as his spirituall fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling shall increase, enlarge any particular request, if it bee not so full to his present case; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert his owne more personall concernements, which he, who went about onely to giue him some generall directions, was not able to coniecture. And touching that which I do here
<pb facs="7"/>
offer to the worlde, I professe sincerely, that in my first vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking it, I had no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to take vpon mee to set downe lawes for other mens deuotions, or to prescribe any man in his particular occasions of going to the Lord, to speake so or so and no otherwise, as though I would reduce all sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to be put vppe into the high court of Heauen, vnto a proportiō &amp; scantling of my conceiuing: He shal wrong me very much, whosoeuer shall so imagine. Only this was it I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and thought: I saw the ignorance of that place, where I liued. I had often &amp; earnestly commended Prayer. I had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, with the best reasons I could perswaded the vse of it in priuate families. I perceiued
<pb facs="8"/>
withall in some, a better incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to it, then power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. Hereupon I thought with my selfe, that as familiar Catechismes, and plaine Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises haue their vse being ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the publique ministry, to bring those, which are yet but babes in Christ (1. Cor. 3.1.) vnto knowledge; so also some helpe in this kind might bee good, to beget feeling, and to be a guide to those which haue as yet but stammering and lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping tongues, vntill they shall be able, hauing tongues as fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned siluer (Pro. 10.20.): plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and distinctly to speake the lāguage of <hi>Canaan</hi> (Isa. 19.18.). For this cause I gaue my booke no greater title thē A HELP to DEVOTION, because I would not bee mistaken,
<pb facs="8"/>
or thought to intend any thing els, but onely to further their religious purpose, who would faine learn to pray orderly and effectually vnto God. And in this course, I am sure, that I am not without Examples. Worthy Diuines haue in these latter times bestowed their paines this way: M. <hi>Iohn Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> M. <hi>Edw. Deering,</hi> M. <hi>H. Smith,</hi> M. <hi>R. Rogers</hi> (pag. 421. of his 7. Treatises.) M. <hi>Brinsly</hi> (in the second part of the True Watch) and others whome I need not name. I might men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion others of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes, as M. <hi>Caluin</hi> (in the end of his Cathechisme,) &amp;c. But the warrant of the Scripture is aboue all. I will say nothing of those formes which wee finde appointed for publique vse in
<pb facs="9"/>
the Temple: that which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to iustifie, is the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of formes for priuate helpe. I might tell thee of the words of Prayer, which the Prophet bade the people to take vnto them, and to say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord (Hos. 14.3): of the forme which <hi>Habakkuk</hi> was wont to vse for the ignorances of the people (Chap. 3.1.): of the many Psalmes which are stiled, Psalmes of instruction, not onely because the matter was of vse to instruct Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but also because the very mould it selfe might remaine as a helpe in Prayer for those, who should at any time fall into the like occasion, which the endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the particular Psalmes was exercised with. These &amp; other things might I insist vpō:
<pb facs="9"/>
But I finde a title giuen to one Psalme, which shall be to mee in stead of many proofes, Psal. 102. It is this: A Prayer of the afflicted when he shall bee in distresse and powre foorth his meditation before the Lord. Which Psalme, thogh ayming perhaps at some more speciall afflictiō, in which the seruants of God then were, yet inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is reported in the title to be for the general vse of an afflicted person (as indeede it is excellent for such an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion) it seemeth to mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly to satisfie all those who shall doubt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencie of such set dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</p>
   <p>Thus hauing acquainted thee with my whole intent, and laboured (least thou
<pb facs="10"/>
shouldest be forestalled by any mis-opinion) to shew warrant for my doing, I commend my endeauours to thee, and thee to the Lord, praying him to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish thee with the spirit of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication (Zech. 12.10.) that thou mayest bee so full of holy matter (Iob 32.18.) and so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boūding with gratious speach (Col. 4.6.) that thine ability to vtter thine owne feeling vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, may bring much sweetnesse to thy Soule, and no lesse comfort to others, if thou bee at any time occasioned to speake in the name of others vnto his Maiestie: Adding this withall, that if thou ayme not at this grace, but content thy selfe still to speake no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wordes but such as are put into thy mouth, thou
<pb facs="10"/>
wrongest thy selfe greatly, and all those who haue laboured to bring thee vnto more perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Farewell.</p>
