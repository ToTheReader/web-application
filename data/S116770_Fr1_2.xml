      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Author of this <hi>Treatise</hi> (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader) hath left this world, and is gone to the place of the blessed, resting himselfe in the bosom of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Abraham.</hi> Hee vvas a godly and faithfull man whilest hee liued, as his life shewed; so also his labours and workes which hee hath
<pb facs="3"/> left behinde him doe testifie. Pittie it is his dayes were no longer, that hee might haue finished many things him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe which hee had begun; some of which are perfected by others, and some likely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to come forth. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it fare with other of his Works, it seemeth that this was perfected in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, by his owne hands; which I wish may not onely come to the hands of Gods children, but into their hearts chiefly. And though he haue finished his course &amp; is gone the way of all flesh; yet think that hee speaketh to thee by this Book, &amp; bids thee to put
<pb facs="3"/> on this <hi>spirituall Armour,</hi> which is indeede the whole Armor of God. For this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour being put on will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy soule against not some, but all the fiery darts of the wicked. Happy &amp; thrice happy is that soule that is thus defended: for it shall go well with it heere in this world; but a thousand times better with it in the world to come. Reade it: remember it: practise it: and the Lord giue thee vnderstanding in all things: and blesse it vnto thee.</p>
