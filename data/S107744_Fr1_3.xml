   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>y lorde / accordyngly vnto your desyre:
I haue trāslated your boke &amp; put it into our na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyue
&amp; mother tongue as my simple wit and po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wer
lernyng wold suffer me, And though it be
nat so well done as (I surely knowe) many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
myght &amp; can haue done it, if it wolde haue
pleased your lordship to haue de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>yred thē, and
if also it wold haue lyked them to haue taken that labour: yet I
trust I haue so done, that it may be comforth to the readers &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rers / 
or at the leste: I haue gyuen occasion to ordre to amend and
performe that I rudely and barbarously, set forward. Surely (my
lorde) the chyefe cause of this my labour was: for that I thought
this boke shulde be moche profytable to the readers and edefyeng
to all that wolde diligently hear it, And to say the treuth: I know
no thynge more comfortable to man, For amonges all the exercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that helpe the spirite to obteyne the loue of god / and specially
to hym y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> wolde begyn &amp; vse a spiritual lyfe: no thynge is thought
always more frutful, thā the continnal meditacion of the passion
of our lorde god Iesus Christ, for the exercyses of all other spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
meditacions may be reduced and brought vnto this. As by
an example, If a man desyre to bewayll and weape for his vices
and synnes for his vnkyndnes and vilenes / if he couit to purge &amp;
amend his negligence &amp; defautes: he shall fynde none more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and redy meane to pricke hym forwarde to his intent: than
to remembre the most innocēt death and passion of his redeamer:
that is to consyder what bitter paynes he suffred for man: to spare
and kepe man from payne eternall wherafter Iustice he shulde
haue rather dampned man for his synnes, And here man may see
both the Iustice and also the mercy of god. Man may cōsyder in
hym selfe the great mercy of god: in that god wold forgyue and {per}<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don
hym of his synnes. He may also perceiue the iustice of god: in
his owne synnes, whiche god dyd correcte &amp; punysshe accordyng
to iustice in hym selfe, bycause he wold nat suffre thē vnpunished,
And thus in this meditacion man may fynde how to weape and
mourne for his synnes: for the which the son of god was bet / woū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyd
and crucified, and all that god suffred: to cure man of his syn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
&amp; kepe hym from eternall payne. Here may also man bewayle
<pb facs="3"/>
his owne vnkyndnes, consyderyng how vnkyndly he rendreth to
so faythfull a louer: so many yuell dedes contrary to goddes plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure,
and also dayly contemptes and despysynges: for his tendre
loue and kyndnes and for his manyfolde gyftes which man day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receyueth of hym. Morouer this cōtemplacion of the death of
Christ indureth man both to hope and to fear, wherby he may be
releaued of two temptacyons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>or if the enormitie of his synnes
moue any man to dispaire: he hathe here in this exercise wherby
to put away his synnes, and to make satisfactiō for them, he hath
here wherof to redeme hīselfe y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> blode &amp; deth of his lorde god,
&amp; therfore he nede nat to feare his synnes, if he so ordre hym selfe y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
he dye with Christ, dye (I say) from synne and ryse in a new lyfe.
And on the other parte, it man be vexed by presumpcion or vayne
lyghtnes and myrth without the fear of god: he hath here how to
abate his vayne myrth, cōsyderyng how that heuē was shyt from
the moste holy frendes of god by many yeres ye aboue .iiii. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
yeres, and how that the glory of god was denyed to mā or at
the least differred, by so many yeres vnto the tyme that our lorde
and sauiour Iesus whiche neuer dyd synne: suffred death for our
synne, so that no mā may come to that glory but by payne, &amp; thus
shall mannes vayne myrth be put downe. If peraduenture man
be dull and slouthfull to all goodnes: where shall he haue a more
spedy remedy to pricke forwarde his dulnes: than to cōsydre how
his lorde god moste pure &amp; innocent man, suffred so greuouse pay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
for hym. Some man wold peraduenture exercise him selfe in
his owne knowlege and so to come to meknes. But I pray you
where shall he haue a better occasion therunto, thā to ponder and
way the difformite and great difference of his owne study and la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour
and shortly the ordre of his hole lyfe: and of the labour &amp; lyfe
of Iesus Christ, that is, remembre man howe cōtrarie thy lyfe is
to his wyl &amp; p̄ceptes / how vnlike to his vertues / how farre frō his
ensāples, remēbre mā how frayle thou art &amp; redy to fal, how vnsta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
in all thy good purposes, how vnredy or rather loth to folowe
thy lorde, howe vnapte to all goodnes, As euery man may dayly
se in hym selfe. Forthermore, if mā wold be enflamed to loue god
where may he haue better help than by this exercise, for if it be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to rendre loue for loue, and the loue of god was neuer more
openly shewed to man than in his redemption, that is in the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and death of our redeamer Christ Iesus: it is than manifest
<pb facs="3"/>
that by this remembraunce of his passion: a man is moste strong<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
excited and moued to loue god. And if man desyre to be pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
forward in that loue: let hym remembre the benefites of god
which be as signes &amp; tokens of his loue, And these benefites most
euidently appere in his passion, as ye shall more clerely se in this
boke. At last, if man desyre that all his lyfe be continuall and per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petuall
prayer / and that he wold haue his herte euer lyfted vp to
god, and his deuotion or feruour euer renewed: he shal neuer get
it more easly than by the remembraunce of the lyfe and passion of
his lorde god, for there he may haue in euery worde / acte / behaui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>our
and paine that Christ spake / dyd / vsed / and suffred: how to be
compuncte and sory in hert / &amp; how to be conforted in spirite. For
in the consyderation of them, now he may wepe by compassion,
Now by gyuyng thankes: he may haue swete affections, Nowe
he may desyre to be confourmed vnto hym, and to his wyl, Now
he may labour and wysshe to be holly transfourmed into hym.
Thus may man go from one exercise vnto an other to auoyde te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnes / 
and so euer to be ī prayer. And shortly to cōclude, there
is no kynde of spirituall exercise: but that it may be founde in the
lyfe &amp; passion of Christ, or els by moste pleantuouse fruyte it may
be reduced and applied to it. And this shall better appere in the
fyrst parte of this boke the thyrde {per}tycle. Nowe my lorde I haue
shewed what was the pryncypall cause mouyng me to accōplysh
your desyre / and if I may perceyue that ye or ony other take pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyt
therby: I shall gyue prayses to god from whom all goodnes
commeth / and I beseache iour lorship to pray with me that moch
profyt and comforth myght come to them that shal rede this
boke and folowe the exercices therof. And thus I cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende
you and all youres to the passion of our
lorde.</p>
