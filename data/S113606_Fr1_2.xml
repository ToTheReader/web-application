      <salute>MOst wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novvned Princess,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>I beeing troubled and wearied with feare,
<pb facs="3"/>
lest my children should not find the right way to heauen, thought with my selfe that I could doe no lesse for them, then euerie man will doe for his friend, which vvas, to write them the right way, that I had truely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued out of the written word of GOD, lest for vvant of vvarning they might fall where I stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and then I should think my selfe in the fault, who knew there were such downe-falls in the world, that they could hardly climbe the hill to heauen without helpe, and yet
<pb facs="3"/>
had not told them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Wherefore I writ them the right and ready way to Heauen wel war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anted by the scriptures of the olde and new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the true word of God, and tolde them how many false paths they should finde, how they should finde them, and what care they should haue to shunne them: if they tooke a false way, what a trouble they should haue in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againe, what danger if they went on: and of many doubts which the world would make with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="4"/>
a cause, and how si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent it would bee in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Thus when I had writtē vnto them of these things, I was at much peace, quiet and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
   <p>But as no contentment in the world continueth long, so sodainly there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose a new care in my minde, how this scroule should bee kept for my children: for they were too young to receiue it, my selfe too old to keepe it, men too wise to direct it to, the world too wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to endure it. Then in great griefe I looked vp
<pb facs="4"/>
to heauen, from whence I knew commeth al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and looking vp, I saw a most Angelicall throne of Princely Peeres and peerelesse Princes prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for heauen, and yet by the appointment of God were heere to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs on the earth: then I perceiued that this Throne was the ioy of England: then I conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the highest blud had the lowest mind: then I sawe humility looking downe-ward, while the sweet slips of her vertue grew vpward: then, euen then, Princely Lady, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb facs="5"/>
your mild and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous coūtenance, which shewed, your heart was bent to doe good to all: wherefore without feare, and with much faith, I aduentured to make your Grace the protectresse of this my Booke, knowing that if you would but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your name to bee seene in it, Wisedome would allow it, and all the wicked winde in the world could not blow it away. The Lord multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his graces more and more on you, and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe vnto you a numerous posterity, in whom your
<pb facs="5"/>
Grace may receiue much ioy and comfort, and GODS Church, and true Religion continuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and propagation.</p>
