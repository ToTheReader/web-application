   <p>O KING live for ever, and be graciously pleased to take in good part this little Stone, and this little Booke, which is an <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter</hi> of the Vertues thereof. A Stone if your Majesty regards the price, to bee lesse esteemed then the meanest <hi>Gem.</hi> But if you respect its use and profit in the Arte of <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Dyalling,</hi> yea and in <hi>Divinity</hi> it selfe; it is not to be counted deare, though in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the most precious <hi>Diamond.</hi>

If the quantity of it be considered, it scarce exceeds a little clodd of Earth: But if we consider the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects it hath to the <hi>Arctick</hi> and <hi>Antartick</hi> poles to the <hi>Tropick</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and the <hi>Aequinoctiall,</hi> then it equalls the <hi>Terrestriall▪ Globe,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was deservedly called by the name <hi>Terrell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="4"/>
is by many degrees the most profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and most praise-worthy of all formes of Government, which are any where <hi>used,</hi> or that can be imagined; unto this Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Estate I have alwayes wished well, as he knoweth who searcheth my heart and reynes. Furthermore it is approved by the consent of all Writers, and by the Mottoes of many Emperours, that a <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> manner of Governing is most safe, most acceptable, and most commodious, both for <hi>Princes</hi> and Subjects, for as suger, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the testimony of <hi>Ferne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>) doth the very same things, and all in a better and sweeter man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then honey doth, so a Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick affection doth effect more then flavish terrour, and a filiall love of subjects, is better then ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile feare.
