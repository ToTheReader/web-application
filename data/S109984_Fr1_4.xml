   <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT TO the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I purposed not to speake any thing to the Reader, otherwise then by way of Epilogue in the end of the Booke, both because I esteemed that to be the fittest place, to giue my Reasons, why I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spited the handling of the two last Chapters, till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time, and also, because I thought not that any man might well and properly be called a Reader, till he were come to the end of the Booke: yet, because both he, and I, may suffer some disaduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, if he should not be fore-possessed, and warned in some things, I haue changed my purpose in that point.</p>
   <p>For his owne good therefore (in which I am also interessed) I must first intreat him, that he will be pleased, before hee reade, to amend with his pen, some of the most important errors, which are hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noted to haue passed in the printing. Because in the Reading, he will not perchance suspect nor spy them, and so he may runne a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, of being either deceiued, or scandalized.</p>
   <p>And for my selfe, (because I haue already receiued some light, that some of the Romane profession, hauing onely seene the Heads and Grounds handled in this Booke, haue traduced me, as an impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and profane vnder-valewer of Martyrdome,) I most humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech him, (till the reading of the Booke, may guide his Reason) to beleeue, that I haue a iust and Christianly estimation, and reuerence, of that deuout and acceptable Sacrifice of our lifes, for the glory of our blessed Sauiour. For, as my fortune hath neuer beene so flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nor abundant, as should make this present life sweet and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to me, as I am a Moral man: so, as I am a Christian, I haue beene euer kept awake in a meditation of Martyrdome, by being deriued from such a stocke and race, as, I beleeue, no family, (which is not of farre larger extent, and greater branches,) hath endured and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered more in their persons and fortunes, for obeying the Teachers of Romane Doctrine, then it hath done. I did not therefore enter into this, as a carnall or ouer-indulgent fauourer of this life, but out
<pb facs="6"/>
of such reasons, as may arise to his knowledge, who shall be pleased to read the whole worke.</p>
   <p>In which, I haue abstained from handling the two last Chapters vpon diuers reasons; whereof one is, that these Heads hauing beene caried about, many moneths, and thereby quarrelled by some, and desired by others, I was willing to giue the Booke a hasty dispatch, that it might cost no man much time, either in expecting before it came, or in reading, when it was come.</p>
   <p>But a more principall reason was, that since the two last Chapters depend vpon one another, and haue a mutuall Relation, I was not willing to vndertake one, till I might perseuere through both. And from the last chapter it became me to abstaine, till I might vnderstand their purposes, who were formerly engaged in the same businesse. For the first Discouerie giues some title to the place, and secludes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, without the Discouerers permission; And in men tender and iealous of their Honour, it is sometimes accounted as much iniurie to assist, as to assault.</p>
   <p>When therefore I considered, that the most Reuerend and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> Lord chiefe Iustice of the cōmon Pleas (whom, they which are too narrow to comprehend him, may finde argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments enow to loue, and admire, out of the measure and proportion of his malice who hath written agains<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> him, (since wee ought to loue h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>m so much, as such men hate him) had in this point of Iurisdiction, laid so solid foundations, raised so strong walls, &amp; perfited his house vpon so sure a Rocke, as the lawes of this Kingdome are. And when I saw, that as the diuell himselfe is busiest to attempt them, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in strength of Grace, (not forbearing our Sauiour himselfe) so an ordinary Instrument of his, (whose continuall libels, and Incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie bookes, haue occasioned more afflictions, and drawne more of that bloud, which they call Catholique, in this Kingdome, then all our Acts of Parliament haue done,) had oppugned his Lordships Booke, and iterated and inconculcated those his oppositions, I could not know whether his Lordship reserued any farther consideration of that matter to his owne leasures, or had honoured any other man, with his commandement, or allowance to pursue it. Till therefore I might know, whether any such were embarqued therein, as would either accept my Notes, and dignifie them with their stile, or submit their Notes to my method, and the poore apparell of my language, or vndertake it entirely, or quit it absolutely, as a body perfit alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by that forme which his Lordship hath giuen it, I chose to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare the handling thereof at this time.</p>
   <p>One thing more I was willing the Reader should be forewarned
<pb facs="6"/>
of; which is, that when he findes in the printing of this Booke often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a change of the Character, hee must not thinke that all those words or sentences so distinguished, are cited from other Authors; for I haue done it sometimes, onely to draw his eye, and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more intensly vpon that place, and so make deeper impressions thereof.</p>
   <p>And in those places which are cited from other Authors (which hee shall know by the Margine) I doe not alwayes precisely and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiously binde my selfe to the words of the Authors; which was impossible to me, both because sometimes I collect their sense, and expresse their Arguments or their opinions, and the Resultance of a whole leafe, in two or three lines, and some few times, I cite some of their Catholique Authors, out of their owne fellowes, who had vsed the same fashion of collecting their sense, without precise bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselues to All, or onely their words. This is the comfort which my conscience hath, and the assurance which I can giue the Reader, that I haue no where made any Author, speake more or lesse, in sense, then hee intended, to that purpose, for which I cite him. If any of their owne fellowes from whom I cite them, haue dealt otherwise, I cannot be wounded but through their sides. So that I hope either mine Innocence, or their own fellowes guiltinesse, shall defend me, from the curious malice of those men, who in this sickly decay, and declining of their cause, can spy out falsifyings in euery citation: as in a iealous, and obnoxious state, a Decipherer can pick out Plots, and Treason, in any familiar letter which is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
   <p>And thus much it seemed necessary to mee, to let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der know, to whose charitable and fauourable opinion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> I commit the booke, and my selfe to his Christianly and deuout Prayers.</p>
