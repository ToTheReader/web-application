   <p>CVrteous Reader: my good friend M. G. W. at his departure into the
Countrey, left this most honest worke to be censured by me: being
right well assured, by the continuance of our true friendshippes that
I would not deceiue him with a flattering iudgment, and (trust me) vpon a
considerate reading, I found it a little book, containing a large testimony
of his loyalty to his Prince and country, a sweet comfort, and most sound
counsail for good subiectes: concludi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>g by many fair examples of Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

      </gap> infamie. The matter agreeing with the condition of this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
time, I haue aduentured to possesse thee with the benefite thereof,
before I made account vnto him of my liking: which is, that no good sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iect
can mislike the same, and I made the more hast herein: because some
wicked persons that will not be admonished, haue now by new conspiracy
desired our publique sorrowe▪ and by their discouery haue brought an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall
ioy into the church of God. Giue God thankes▪ for his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
presentation of her Maiestie, and the confusion of her enemies, serue
him, and read this booke, which trulie promiseth thee, that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
