   <head>THE PROEM.</head>
   <p>IT is a poynt knowne of all the Philosophers, and confirmed by their common confent, that the vse and practise of euery Arte, is better and of more excellencie, then the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple speculation and contemplation of the same; as that for the which all rules &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Sciences are ordained, and to the which they are referred, as to the chiefe end: the which may more amply appeare by Aristotle, <hi>Primo Ethicorum; et pri. Topicorum,</hi> &amp; diuers other Phylosophers, throughout their whole works: For amongst all humane Arts, the practise of Girurgerie is the most excellent and profitable, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o much as it preserueth man in health and good constitution of bodie, in preuenting sicknesses to come, by meet &amp; fit medicins; and beeing sick, doth restore him againe to the forme estate, which (if it were not seene vnto by the skilfull and expert Chirurgian) would tend to the dissolution &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of nature. The naturall inclination and disposition of man, by the gift of other humane Sciences, is onelie bettered and made more prompt. As for example, Logick fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth nature, &amp; teacheth to reason well: Rethorick to speake eloquently; the Law shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth the way to maintaine possessions purchased, and to recouer that whereof men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded. These gifts are in great estimation amongst men: but in respect and comparison of life it selfe, which by the learned Chirurgian is maintained and prolonged, diseases, and maladies cured, they are of little account or value. For what auaileth it vnto a man to bee a cunning Astrologian, a learned Lawyer, rich and mightie, yea, a Monarch of the whole world, and in the meane time haue no ioy, nor pleasure thereof, by reason that he is daily vexed with cruell paine, and deadly torments of maladies, ready euery howre to giue vp the ghost? Is not man then greatly beholding vnto Phisick and Chirurgerie? The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, causeth him to enioy and gather the profit of all other worldly Sciences.</p>
   <p>Heereof it proceedeth, that <hi>Aesculapius, Apollo,</hi> and other inuentors of our Art, haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer (for the excellencie of that Science) beene deified and esteemed for Gods, meaning thereby, that like as diuine Authors doe farte exceede worldly inuentors, so this Art found out by the Gods, is worthy to be preferred by man, to all other worldly Sciences. For this cause the Greeke Poet <hi>Homer,</hi> doth prefer the professors of this Art, to all other professors, how excellent soeuer they be. Heere vpon, I being mooued by the former reasons, &amp; loue that I beare to the Common-wealth, I intend to intreate of a disease, whose cure pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the Arte of Chirurgerie, commonlie called the disease of Spaine or Naples. The more generall the disease is, and incident to all Nations, the greater ought the carefull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the expert Chirurgian be, to preuent and cure that maladie, Nature, by reason of appetite and inclination to carnall copulation, doth argue (the more is the pitty) the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall raigne and common infection, of this contagious disease, throughout all Nations, Citties, and Townes. Therefore, he that would prescribe an easie, perfect, and true way to oute this disease, should greatly benefit the Publique weale, in preseruing the life of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of people, who vndeseruedly, by infection from others, are greeuously op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, with this detestable maladie. Now, by daily and long practise, &amp; conference with men of learning in this matter, I haue found out diuers remedies and medicins, neuer sette forth by any before this time. Neuertheles, to make my worke more perfect, I will first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of the ordinarie cures practized by others, which diuers men, haue written in diuers manners, to the great hurt of the Patient, and discredite of the Chirurgian, not knowing, the true cure, which is the cause that manie make a miserable end of their life, which shall appeare to the diligent Reader in this my Treatise following.</p>
