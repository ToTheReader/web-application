   <p>Of all these Powers, the Vnderstanding, &amp; Will are the most important; as being they, to which the rest are all reserred. <hi>Verum,</hi> or that which is <hi>True,</hi> is the <hi>Obiect</hi> of the <hi>Vnderstāding,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Obiect</hi> of the <hi>Wil,</hi> is <hi>Bòn̄,</hi> or that which is <hi>Good.</hi> The <hi>Act</hi> which the <hi>Vnderstāding</hi> exerciseth, towards his <hi>Obiect</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> is <hi>Knowledge;</hi> for the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> doth euer desire to know; &amp; that which is exercised by the <hi>Wil,</hi> towards the <hi>Obiect</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is <hi>Loue;</hi> for al creatures which cā <hi>Loue,</hi> are carried to a desire of that which is <hi>Good,</hi> or at least which seemeth good to the. And indeed it may be truly sayd, if it be discreetly vnderstood, that there is no creature at all, which hath not a <hi>Loue,</hi> that it lookes after.</p>
   <p>Euen all the <hi>inanimate Creatures,</hi> do moue with a restles desire to their proper <hi>Cēter,</hi> through a quality which is impressed vpon them, by the common Creator, of them, &amp; vs. <hi>Fire flyes vpward, &amp; earth falls downe ward; they are driuen by their weight, they aspire to their places.</hi> By force you may with hold them, but if you leaue them to themselues, you shal quickly see, where they haue a mind to be. And as the actual <hi>Loue</hi> which a reasonable creature bears to any <hi>Obiect,</hi> is accōted for the weight wherby he is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to his iourneyes end, <hi>Amor meus pondus mē, eò feror, quocumque feror;</hi>

From hence also it comes, that as it is proper to him, to apprehend his <hi>End,</hi> so he must be enabled with all the meanes cōducing to it. This last <hi>End</hi> of man, is perfect &amp; complete Beatitude. So as the true and vndoubted <hi>Obiect</hi> of his <hi>Will,</hi> is, <hi>Omne bonum,</hi> which is <hi>All Good.</hi> This Perfectió supposech, &amp; of it self implyeth, in any creature, which can aspire therunto, <hi>to be, to liue,</hi> &amp; <hi>to know.</hi> So that if any man be asked, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would be glad to <hi>Be,</hi> to <hi>Liue,</hi> to <hi>Know,</hi> &amp; to <hi>be Happy,</hi> he cannot doubt of it, though he would; vnlesse he were out of his wits, &amp; then in effect, he would be no man. Now, <hi>Beatitudo</hi> (as saith <hi>Boetius</hi>) <hi>est status, omnium bonorum aggregatione perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus.</hi> And<note n="(c)" place="margin">Confes. lib. <hi>10.</hi> c. <hi>21.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>S.</hi> Augustine saith, <hi>That if any man should be asked, whether he would be happy, or no; all the world would say yea; as all the world if it were asked, whether it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce or no, would be sure to say that it would fayne</hi> Reioyce; <hi>which</hi> ioy <hi>if it be true &amp; cōplete, &amp; without possibility of mutation, is nothing els but meere</hi> Beatitude. But this, in the meane time, is the mayne, &amp; finall, vniuersall end of man. And frō hence it necessarily followes; That man seeing many particulars proposed to him, as means cōducing to this end, is not necessarily carried towards this, or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meanes (which many tymes are contrary to one another) because he apprehends thē not, to be necessary, or not perhaps so much as sit, for his <hi>End,</hi> to which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, his desire is necessarily carried.</p>
   <p>Hence flowes the vse &amp; exercise of <hi>Free-Will,</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>wherby a man hath power to <hi>consult, elect, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> &amp; <hi>resolue;</hi> as also, on he other side, to refuse &amp; reiect what he lyketh not, in all the particular occurrē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his life. <hi>S.

      <hi>forme of our vnderstāding, which the inclinatiō of our wil doth follow, is</hi> vniuersall; <hi>vnder which, many particulers are cōprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And so, for as much as the acts consist in those particulars, amongst which there is none which can equall the power of an</hi> vniuersall; <hi>there remaineth a kind of inclination of the will, which carrieth it selfe</hi> indeterminately <hi>to seueral things.</hi> For vpon a desire, which a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaues of health, he beginnes to consult, about those things, which seeme to conduce vnto it; and at length, he resolues to take a potion. So that Counsaile precedes the resolution of taking the potion; which proceeds frō his willingnes to be counselled. If any thing be therfore apprehended, (according to all those particulars, which may be apprehended) as a conuenient good, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily moue the will. And frō hence it is, that a man doth necessarily desire <hi>Beatitude,</hi> which is a <hi>State complete by the aggregatiō of all good things,</hi> as hath beèn said.</p>
   <p>Now, that the <hi>Wil,</hi> is carried to any thing which is presented to it, rather according to one particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which it hath, then to another, may happen es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially vpon any one of three occasions. First when the thing it selfe is of more weight; and then a man is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried towards it, according to reason. As when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs, that which respects his health, before that which respects his pleasure. Secondly, when he considers of
<pb facs="6"/>some particular circumstance, and not of another; as when a man will needs borrow money, without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how he shall be able to repay it. And thirdly, it may happen, by the disposition of the mans mind at that tyme; because (according to <hi>Aristotle</hi>) <hi>As any man is in himselfe, such doth his end then seeme, to him to be.</hi> And so we see, that the wil of a man is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued towards any thing, after a very different manner, when he is much transported by choller, to what he is, when he is quiet.</p>
   <p>But, the while, it easily appeares, how noble these two <hi>Faculties</hi> are, of the <hi>Vnderstāding</hi> &amp; the Wil; &amp; how greedy and earnest they will be sure to be, in slying with a fierce kind of appetite, towards their seuerall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. And as a man cannot fayle to be happy, according to his mayne desire, if these faculties be well addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, by the particuler meanes which conduce to it; So by any disorder which they fall into, their Maister groweth to be miserable. Such disorder vseth to ariue, vpon the allurement of some <hi>particular obiects,</hi> and the close quarter which is kept, betweene the <hi>vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stāding,</hi> &amp; the <hi>will,</hi> which are not only neere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but greater friends, then many would perhaps imagine, and so they make a mighty impression vpon one another. And howsoeuer, for as much as concernes the generall, and finall obiect, which is <hi>Beatitude,</hi> though neither of them, can any more perswade the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to erre willingly, then it selfe can be subiect therin to errour; yet, <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> when there is question of the particular addresse, or meanes, there vseth to grow much abuse. And as, if the <hi>vnderstanding</hi> looke vpon things in a false light, or (as it were) through the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ars, or through a paire of lying Spectacles, it wil say
<pb facs="6"/>shrewdly to the <hi>will,</hi> by way of inducing it to imbrace an erroneous beliefe; so if the <hi>will</hi> bestisly engaged, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pō the earnest loue of an apparēt false good, insteed of a true one, either by any ill habit acquired: or by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemēcy of some tēptation, or by the impotency of some passion, or els by the surprise of some delightful obiect, or the like; it doth, many tymes, so worke, &amp; win vpon the <hi>vnderstāding,</hi> as to make it cōcurre towards the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of wicked, &amp; vniust decres; wherby Christ our Lord may be crucified, &amp; <hi>Barabbas</hi> discharged; the creature may be imbraced, &amp; the God of al creatures be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. <hi>For thus,</hi> saith.<note n="(e)" place="margin">Conf. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>
      </note> S. <hi>Augustine, are sinnes committed, when thou, O God art forsaken, O thou fountaine of life, who art the sole and true creat our of al things; &amp; whē, by a foolish, and particular pride of appetite, we grow to loue that, which is but a part of the whole, and which with all is false. But by h̄ble deuotion, we returne to thee againe; &amp; thou dost cleanse vs from our euill custome; and art mercifull to the sinnes of such as confesse them; and thou hearest the groanes of thy prisoners; and dost take off the fetters which we made for our selues. But so, as that yet we must no more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance the proud hornes of false liberty, against thee; through a couetous desire of enioying more, which wil proue to be the losse of what we haue already; if we loue our owne preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded priuate good, more then thee, who art the common good of all.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>So that now we see, how necessary it will be for vs to take some course, for the coupling of these two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes (which, on the one side, is our selues, and on the
<pb facs="7"/>other, our finall <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Beatitude</hi>) by some <hi>meanes</hi> which may be both sweet, &amp; strong, towards the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning, &amp; imploying of these <hi>faculties,</hi> &amp; <hi>powers</hi> of ours; that so we may be secured, from loosing our way, to a iourneys end, which doth so much import.</p>
   <p>For the errours of the <hi>vnderstanding</hi> are dā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in a high degree. To the <hi>vnderstanding</hi> it first belongs, to specify, or present all <hi>particulers</hi> to the <hi>will;</hi> and if that be done with disguise, the man is like to be in ill case. For the <hi>will,</hi> is an obeying, and blind faculty, which discourse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> but executes, if it lists, in conformity of what is offered, by the <hi>vnderstāding;</hi> and therfore it is, as if it had no life at all, till the <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> giue it meate, to feede vpon; which she takes at the hand therof, though it be poyson. The er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours also of the <hi>will,</hi> are at least, as dangerous as those others; for this is the seat, and Center of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and it is both extremely laborious, &amp; withall very lickerish after all the delightfull obiects which it lookes vpon. And for listening, &amp; gazing it growes first to cheapning, &amp; then to buying; &amp; by the disorder, &amp; distēpered heate therof, it blowes with vehemet desire v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them. And so it rayseth a dust into the eye of the <hi>vnderstāding,</hi> wherby it is made, as blind almost, as the blind <hi>will</hi> it selfe. And wherby it growes persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that how deere soeùer that cōterfeit ware do cost, it may proue a kind of sauing bargaine to vs, in the end.</p>
   <p>Now, what a case are we therfore in, if our Loue, being so restles a thing, as it is, &amp; so resolued, to be euer feeding vpon some obiect or other, we suffer that to be such a one, as besides the endles tormes of the next life, can neuer bring vs to any true rest in this? For the soule can neuer rest in the possession or fruition of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb facs="7"/>The reason heerof is playne; because the rest of any thing consisteth in the attayning &amp; inioying of that last end, to which it was ordayned, in the creation therof. And therfore the soule of man, being made for the fruition of God, whose glorious vision is only able to make vs say, <hi>It is inough;</hi> what meruaile is it, that it can take no lasting true contentment, in any thing which is lesse then God?</p>
   <p>The holy <hi>S. Bernard</hi> sayth heervpon, to this essect: It is no meruaile that the soule of man can neuer be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the possessions, honours, &amp; pleasures of this world. For the soule desires to feed vpon such a meat, as may carry proportion to it selfe. Now, the entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this life, carry no proportion at all to the soule, in the way of giuing it entiere satisfactiō. For the soule is spirituall, &amp; immortall; and all these obiects, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temporall, or carnall. And therfore, as he who were ready to starue for lacke of meate, would be ridiculous if he should thinke to kill his hungar, by going to a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, &amp; gaping there like some <hi>Camelion,</hi> to take in the ayre (which ayre is no cōpetent and proportionable food, for a body of flesh &amp; bloud;) iust so a man who shal pretend to satisfy &amp; fulfill the desires of a spirituall &amp; immortal substāce (as we know the soule to be) by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fowly vpon the Carrion of Corporall thinges, is at least as very a foole as the former. And besides his folly, &amp; his losse of labour in the meane time, he wil, heeraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, grow to suffer by it, so much more; hē the otherr; as the eternall dānation of a soule, is a matter incōparably more considerable, then the death of a mortall body.</p>
   <p>No; it is God alone, who can quēch the infini e ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of his reasonable creatures. He alone made the whole world for vs; &amp; vs for himself; &amp; he only is our
<pb facs="8"/>Center, &amp; place of rest. He only is that first <hi>Truth,</hi> which our <hi>vnderstāding</hi> should aspire to <hi>know;</hi> &amp; the only <hi>Good,</hi> which our <hi>Will</hi> should be so inflamed to <hi>Loue.</hi> And because as hath bene said, the question is, but of the <hi>Meanes,</hi> wherby we must tend to this most perfect <hi>End:</hi> and for that, by the treachery of our sēses, we are induced to place our harts, &amp; the affectiōs therof vpon dāgerous, &amp; vicious <hi>obiects;</hi> it is therfore, shat I am procuring to set that one before vs, which is the most strōg, &amp; sweet, &amp; perfect <hi>meanes,</hi> &amp; which may not only inuite, but assist vs also admirably otherwise, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ariuing to our <hi>last End.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The line which leades to this faire full point, &amp; the way which guides vs to this eternall habitation, is that top of beauty, and excellency, <hi>Iesus Christ our Lord;</hi> vpon whom if we can perswade our selues to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten the rootes of allour <hi>Loue,</hi> we shall not only be happy there, but euē heere. And to the end that we may consider the innumerable, &amp; inualuable reasons, which we haue to loue this Lord of ours; I haue laboured first, to shew the vnspeakeable dignity of his person; &amp; then the infinite loue it selfe which he hath borne to vs. And this I haue deduced, out of the principal misteries of his most sacred life, &amp; bitter death, as they haue bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to vs in holy. <hi>Scripture.</hi> And although whilst I treate of the Loue of our Lord to vs, in euery one of the particular mysteries, I do, also shew, the straite obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into which we are cast, of returning loue for loue to him: yet I procure to do it more expresly, towards the end of the book in the two last Chapters. The holy ghost be he who by sweetly breathing vpō our soules, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vs to do this duty well; which hath bene so highly deserued of vs, &amp; which only is able to make vs happy.</p>
