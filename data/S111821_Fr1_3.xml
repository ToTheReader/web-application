      <note place="margin">Cantice. vi.</note> These wordes are writen in holy scrypture &amp; are thus to say in englyshe / The dough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tres of Syon haue sene hyr (that is to say oure lady) and they haue shewed hyr mooste blessyd. In whiche wordes the holy goste sayth thre thinges that longe to the praysynge of oure mooste blessed lady. ¶Fyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste who they be that prayse hyr / whan he sayeth. the doughters of Syon. ¶The seconde / what they doo or they begynne to prayse hyr / whan he sayeth that they haue sene hyr. ¶The thyrde / the maner of hyr praysynge / whan he sayeth &amp; they haue shewed hyr mooste blessed / therfore he sayeth. The doughtres of Syon haue sene hyr and they haue shewed hyr moste blessed. ¶Fyrste the holy goste tellyth who they be that prayse our Lady / for he callyth them doughtres of Syon. But though all chrysten soulles that treu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly lyue in chrysten fayth / may be called doughtres of Syon / that is to say of holy chyrche: yet more proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ye ar called doughters of Syon. For not onely ye ar doughtres of holy chyrche by chrysten byleue as other chrysten people ys: But also ye are doughtres of this holy relygion / which as a mother noryssheth youre soulles in grace in this Monastery that ys na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Syon. And therfore as ye are doughtres of this bodely Syon / so ought ye to be doughtres of Syon
<pb facs="3"/>
gostly / For Syon ys as moche to say / as a cōmaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement or byholdinge. And ye ought to be doughtres of cōmaundement by meke &amp; redy obedyence to the byddynges of god / and of youre reule / and of youre soueraynes / ye ought also to be doughtres of byhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge by cōtemplacyon. &amp; specyally in byholdynge of youre owne wretchednes / and of youre vnkynde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes agenste god / and of the charite &amp; goodnes that he dothe to you. ye oughte to beholde also the shortnes and vnstablenes of thys lyfe / the hastynes of dethe / the ferefulnes of dome / the bytternes of paynes / and the swyete and ioyfull rewardes of blysse. And if ye be thus good doughtres of Syon by meke obedyen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and by trew beholdynge of these thynges: then ar ye well dysposed the more worthyly to prayse oure moste gloryous lady. ¶The seconde thynge that the holy goste tellyth in these wordes (ys) that ye ought to doo or ye begynne to prayse oure lady. And that ys that ye oughte to se her. For ye wote well that no man ne may well shewe the worthynes or the proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyes of any thynge to the praysynge therof: but yf he haue fyrste som syght &amp; knowlege of the same thinge by one meane or other. How shall ye then condewly shewe by outwarde praysyng the excellent hyghnes and worthynes of the moste blyssed heuenly quene oure reuerente lady / as yt is full fayre expressed in al youre holy seruyce: but yf ye haue fyrste syght therof by inwarde vnderstandinge. ¶But for asmoche as many of you / thoughe ye can synge and rede / yet ye can not se what the meanynge therof ys: therefore to the onely worshyp and praysyng of oure lorde Iesu chryste and of hys moste mercyfull mother oure lady

and to the gostly cōforte and profyte of youre soules I haue drawen youre legende and all youre seruyce in to Enlyshe / that ye shulde se by the vnderstōdyng therof / how worthy and holy praysynge of oure glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryous Lady is contente therin / &amp; the more deuoutely and knowyngly synge yt &amp; rede yt / and say yt to her worshyp. ¶And in many places where the nakyd letter is thoughe yt be set in enlyshe / ys not easy for some symple soulles to vnderstonde▪ I expounde yt and declare yt more openly / other before the letter / or after or else fourthe wyth to gyther. ¶And farther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more / that ye shulde haue the more sprytuall loue / &amp; inwarde delyte and deuocyon / in thys holy seruyce I tell the causes &amp; the meanynges of eche parte therof that is to say / whan I come to the fyrste Inuitory▪ I tell what an Inuitatory ys to say / and why yt ys namyd so &amp; set in suche a place. And so I do of Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes / and Hympnes / and Antempnes / and respōces and versicles / and all suche other. For I declare why they ar callyd so / that ys to say / why an hympne ys callyd an hympne / and why an Antepmne is callyd an Antempne / and so fourth of other / and why they ar set &amp; sayde in suche wyse / as ye may se more play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely in the story of the Sonday / eche thynge in hys place. ¶Of psalmes I haue drawen but fewe / for ye may haue them of Rycharde hampoules drawynge and out of Englysshe bibles if ye haue lysence therto ¶Also when I drawe a thynge ones in to englysshe I write it not agayne as often as I fynde it after in eche place / but onely in the fyrste place / as <hi>Gloria pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri,</hi> is declaryd i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
