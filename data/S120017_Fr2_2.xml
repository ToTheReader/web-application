   <head>¶ The Preface.</head>
   <p>MAtters beyng yet in doubt, maie with questions and reasons, bee brought out of doubt: but thinges beyng without doubt, ought not with the subteltie of wordes, bee broughte into doubte. As without all doubte Edmonde Boner late vsurped bishop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, was a bastarde, and also the soonne of a Bastarde: that is a Bastarde in grosse, and a Bastarde can not, neither maie not bee a bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. Boner was a Bastarde, <hi>ergo</hi> no bishop; and this is a true conclusion. This is not true said an old <hi>Dunsticall</hi> felowe, sittyng at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with a graue learned Lawier of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawe, and an eloquente Ciuilian, that were all three together: the one frouned, the seconde did bite his lippe, the third in a greate rage saied: men maie saie what thei will now a daies, &amp; belye the truthe as you haue doen, he was a blessed confessor, although a bastard, and a true bishop, bothe by Gods Lawes, the Canonicall lawes &amp; the lawes of this realme of Englande. To this thei saied all <hi>Amen.</hi> Proue you the cōtrary saied thei, and we wil yelde vnto you: will you: he, then will I proue hym no bishop, when he liued, whiche you graunt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> bastarde by these thrée La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes.
<pb facs="11"/>
Make proffe saied these three, I will by Gods grace quod he, proue that neither Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall, nor Boner, were any bishoppes of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but vsurped, bicause thei twoo were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardes: and all bastardes bee vnder the same predicament. For the booke of Wisedome in the. iiij. Chapit. makyng a difference betwene twoo generations of the lawfull, and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Of the lawfull it is saied: <hi>O quam pulcra, &amp; casta generatio. &amp;c.</hi> O how faire is a chaste generation with vertue: the memoriall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is immortall, for it is knowen with God, and with men: when it is presente, men take example thereat, and if it goe awaie, yet thei desire it: it is alwaies crouned, and holden in honor, and winneth the rewarde of the vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>. But the other generation, that is vnknowen emong men, that are called the children of the people: thus muche is spoken of in the same booke. <hi>Multigena autem impiorū multitudo non erit vtilis, &amp; spuria vitulamina non dabunt radices altas, nec stabile fundamentum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituit.</hi> That is. The multitude of the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly children, are vnprofitable children, and the thynges that are planted with whoredome, shall take no depe roote, nor laie any fast foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, though grene for a tyme in the braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yet thei shalbe shaken with the winde,
<pb facs="11"/>
for thei stande not fast, and through the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of the windes, that is Gods vengance thei shalbe rooted out, for the vnperfite braū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches shalbe broken, the fruicte shalbe vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and sower, mete for nothyng. For why beyng demaunded of their parentes, that is, who were their fathers, or mothers, doe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse against them, and declare their abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and dooe disclose their synnes, as did that wicked Cham, the sonne of Noe, whiche <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> his fathers secretes, for whiche cause, Noe asked vengeaunce vpon the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders sonne, that therby the offender might bee more greued, then with his owne mishappe. Therfore the lawe that punisheth thoffēders issue, dooeth more prohibite synne, then that whiche plageth the offender <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>: by this it maie be cōsidered, with what zeale the law of Englande abhorreth vnlawfull coniunctions, depriuyng them not onely of lawfull paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, but also of Ecclesiasticall dignitie, and tē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall inheritaunce. The Ciuill Lawe, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng of the birth of children, saieth: <hi>Quod non potest arbor mala fructus bonos facere. &amp;c.</hi> An euil tree, saie thei, can not bring forth good fruite: nor a good free beare euill fruites, and by the consente of the lawes it is agreed, that euery plante yeldeth to the nature of the grounde,
<pb facs="12"/>
wherein it is planted. The childe also hath<note place="margin">Leges <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

Therfore saith the Ciuill Lawe, your naturall or bastarde soonne, is the soonne of the people: and when suche a bastarde is, hauing no certain, or kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen assured father at the birthe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> it is daily seen, and so iudged by lawe. Now can he come by a father after: as example. If one woman should beare twoo children, of twoo fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and one of these fornicatours, after doe marie with this woman, whiche of these chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren should this mariage make legitimate: This would partly help <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </gap> of the people, and did not knowe their fathers: it wer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore against all reason, that a child after ward<note place="margin">Genes. 16.</note> borne in the same Matrimonie, being lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">

      </gap>:
<pb facs="12"/>
So no bastardes doe inherite lawfully, by the lawes of Englande, neither is equall to the lawfull begotten in the inheritaunce, whiche by the Ciuill lawes can be deuided, but onely emong the male children. Saincte Augustine in <hi>lib. xvi. de Ciuitate dei,</hi> saieth, Abraham gaue all his substaunce vnto Isaac his soonne; but vnto the soonnes of the Concubines, he gaue giftes, and sente them awaie from Isaac his soonne. Wherevpon he ment that to bastar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, there is no inheritaunce due, but onely necessary liuyng, and vnder the name of a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starde.

So there is more abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiō in one bastard, then in. lxix. lawfull son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Many examples I can bryng for the of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, repugnant to bastards, of their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life, whoredome, idolatrie, extortion, treasō, murder, glottonie. &amp;c. For it is thought<note place="margin">

So you shall not doubte, but by Gods lawes, the lawes of Englande, and also the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call lawes, that bastardes are all depriued of lawfull parentes, therefore of inheritaunce Temporall: also not lawfull to take Orders, therefore no ministers of Spiritnall dignitie,<note place="margin">Ergo.</note> therfore no bishops. Iudge of this your selues,<note place="margin">Ergo.</note> and then make answere, when it shall please you. Sir, we will depart, quod thei, referryng this matter till an other tyme.
