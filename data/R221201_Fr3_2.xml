   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>

      <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>uch is Gods manifest miraculous hand in his various and unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wayes of afflicting Mankind in that most noysome disease of the <hi>Pestilence,</hi> that it is not onely wonderful, but also impossible for the wit of any man, how wise or learned soever he may esteem himself, or by others be esteemed, to give a sufficient reason, with also a general and methodical Cure for that most contagious, noysome, and killing disease of the <hi>Pestilence,</hi> for that it is apparent it passeth mans wit to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend or to avoid the most subtile invasions and assaults thereof, as having in it <hi>(aliquid divinum)</hi> to be considered of, it being one of the three great and terrible Arrowes of the Almighty, whereby according to his Divine Will he hath usually cut off sinners from off the Earth almost in all Ages, and in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as we may gather, and is at large read in holy Scriptures, and in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of good men, and daily experience declares no lesse; all which, for brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I will omit here to repeat.</p>
   <p>And his most usual great and fearful Arrowes declared, are <hi>Wars, Famine,</hi> and <hi>Peftilence;</hi> and the most merciful of these three, which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> chose, was the <hi>Pestilence:</hi> which, although his mighty, fearful, and terrible hand be in it; yet for as much as his mercy is exceeding great, yea, over all his works, and that he hath not forbidden, but given us leave, with understanding, and some judgment, to make use of all lawful means to preserve our frail bodies in health by all our best endeavour, so long as we trust chiefly on his mercy, in the use of the means.</p>
   <p>In regard whereof, I weighing with my self how just and needful a thing it is at all times, but chiefly in contagious times, for all men, especially for men of my calling, to shew their endavours for the help not onely of themselves, but also of their Christian Brethren, as well by directions as by preservative and curative Medicines; I esteemed it not amisse, by this following weak Treatise, to shew forth the fruits of my many years experience, touching the general knowledge of this disease, as also the best means I had experienced both for the preventing and curing of the same, when and where occasion may be offered, either Domestick, Marine, or Military. And first, as by the way, take it into your consideration, that this disease holdeth not one certain rule, figure, nor order in seizing on mans body, no, nor in one and the same house or family; neither are men generally taken sick alike, no, nor directly, as in other times of the <hi>Plague</hi> they have been, but each time of Contagion hath different assaults, and difference in the symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes. For in <hi>Anno 1625.</hi> we had many signes contrary to the <hi>Plagues</hi> in other times; yea, and many did dye daily, without any signs or marks on their bodies at all: and also sometimes, as is too manifest, the <hi>Plague</hi> beginneth in
<pb facs="165"/>
Winter, and that as well with us as with our neighbour Nations, as namely, <hi>Germany, France,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and other parts of the world it hath done: whereas for the most part, heretofore the <hi>Plague</hi> with us hath begun in Summer, and was commonly most fierce, predominate, and untractable to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in the heat of Summer, and chiefly in Harvest, which is the unseasonable time that we do usually call the Canicular or Dog-dayes.</p>
   <p>But the sicknesse of the yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>1636.</hi> held not that rule, but encreased in some Townes in Winter: wherefore since it is evident, that the Almighty hath the ordering thereof, and calleth us unto him, as is said, by extraordinary formes, when, where, and how he pleaseth;</p>
   <p>Let us with unfained humility of heart prostrate our selves with true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and hearty prayers, shewing lively fraits thereof in a Christian conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then, without all question, his Rod will be taken away from us and our Land, and also I advise all such as it may or shall concern, to repair unto such good means and learned Counsel, as at the instant may be had, for the preserviug of their lives, and for the curing this fearful disease, and that without dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous presumption, by delayes, over-much timorousnesse, or fearing, for in both these extremities we offend God and our neighbours.</p>
   <p>And know, that all flesh is subject to this disease, for it spareth no age, sex, nor degree of Mankind whatsoever.</p>
   <p>And amongst many evils, this one great misery attends it, and is incident to the vulgar people sick of this disease, that when the disease reigneth, the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and most skilful men, together with the best Divines and most able men of estate, which with their relief should comfort and administer unto them both spiritual and bodily comforts, as also many of their most neer and chiefest friends, are wanting and fled, and in their places spring up unworthy, unskilful, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yea, and vagrant wretches, as I may term some of them, that in such times usually take npon them impudently the charge of many good mens lives; who also then are incident to be committed to the hands of wicked and unskilful Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and I had almost said mercilesse Keepers, which make their cases yet more lamentable: of which, my self have had full experience, when I had the disease.</p>
   <p>And for as much as in those times very many of the chiefest Traders of our Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> as also of other remote parts of the Countrey, flye from the City, which commonly set the poor on work, the case of the poorer sort is made yet more miserable: all which miseries, with many more attending this noysome disease, is no way to be diverted from mankind, but by the tender mercy of God: So that each man for himself and his neighbour, especially in such times, is justly obliged to call unto God, and say, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us:</hi> And so in brief, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my Preface.</p>
