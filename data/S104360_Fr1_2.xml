      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it hath been a custome of long continuance, as well in Rome the Capitall City, as in diuers other renowned Cities of the world, to haue the liues of Princes and worthy men, acted in their Theatres, and especially the conquests &amp; victories which their owne Princes and Captains had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, thereby to incourage their youths to follow the steps of their ancesters; which custome euen for the same purpose, is tolerated in our Age, although some peeuish people seeme to dislike of it: Amongst so many valiant Princes of our English Nation, vvhose liues haue already euen cloyed the Stage, I searched the Chronicles of elder ages, vvherein I found amongst diuers renovvned persons, one Brittish Prince, who of his enemies, receiued the title of <hi>Valiant Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> his name was <hi>Caradoc,</hi> he was King of <hi>Siluria, Ordonica,</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> which Countries are now called, <hi>South-Wales, North-Wales,</hi> and the <hi>Marches</hi>; and therefore being borne in Wales, and King of Wales, I called him the <hi>valiant Welshman</hi>; he liued about the yere of our Lord, 70. <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> in his 12. booke, sayth, that hee held warres 9. years against all the Romane puissance; but in the end hee was betrayed by <hi>Cartismanda</hi> Queene of <hi>Brigance,</hi> and so conuayed to Rome in triumph, so that the name of <hi>Caradoc</hi> was famous in Rome at that time: wherefore finding him so highly commended amongst the Romans, who were then Lords of all the world, and his enemies; I thought it fit amongst so many Worthies, whose liues haue already been both acted and printed, his life hauing already bin acted with good applause, to be likewise worthy the printing; Hoping that you will censure indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of it; and so I bid you farevvell.</p>
