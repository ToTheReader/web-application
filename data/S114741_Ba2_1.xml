   <p>THus hast thou (dylygente reader) the ende of these. ii. examynaciōs and answers of the moost christen martyr Anne Askewe, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> other addycy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons besydes. Marke in thē the horryble mad furye of Antychrist and the deuyll how they worke in thys age by their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous mēbres,<note place="margin">Antichrist</note> to brynge the last ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce swyftlye vpon thē. Afore tyme hath not bene seane, soch frantyck outra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge as is now, the iudges wythout all so<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber dyscressyon, ronnynyge to the racke toggynge, halynge, and pullynge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, lyke tormentours in a playe.<note place="margin">compassiō</note> Compa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re me here Pylate wythe Wrisleye the hyghe chauncellour of Englande, wyth Riche and wyth other whych wyl be co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>unted no small moates. And se howe moch the pagane Iudge excelleth in ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue and wisdom, the false christened iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge, yea, rather prodygyouse tyraunte. Whan Pylate had enquired,<note place="margin">Pylate</note> what accu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sacyon the Iewes clergye had agaynste Christ, he perceyued they dyd all of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyce, and refused to meddle therin. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. xviii. In Wrisleye and Ryche is no suche equite.<note place="margin">Wrisleye.</note> But they rather seke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syon to accomplyshe the full malyce of Antychriste.</p>
   <p>Pylate shewed the accused all fauer<note place="margin">Pylate</note>
      <pb facs="110"/>
possyble. He examyned hym pryuatelye he gaue hym fryndelye wordes, he had hym not feare to speake, he hearde hym wyth gentylnesse, he counselled wyth hym that he myght the more frelye sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse theyr madde furye, and he promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, they shulde do hym no wrong in case he wolde vtter his ful mynd. Ioā. xviii Farre contrarye to this were Wrisleye and Ryche,<note place="margin">Wrysleye</note> whych not all ignoraunt of the Byshoppes beastlye errours, maly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyouslye wythout all feare of God and shame of the worlde, executed vpon this godly woman moste terryble tyrannye. Pylate spake for the innocent,<note place="margin">Pylate.</note> excused hym, defended hym, layed fourth the la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we, pleated for hym sharpelye, required them to shewe mercye, alleged for hym theyr custome, declared him an innocent &amp; sought by all meanes to delyuer hym, Mat xxvii. These periured magistrates Wrisleye &amp; Ryche,<note place="margin">Wrisleye.</note> not onlye examyned thys innocent woman with rigour, but also hated her, scorned her, reuyled her, condempned her, for an heretike, &amp; with vnspeakable tormentes sought to enfor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce her to brynge by accusacion other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble women and men to death.</p>
   <p>More ouer Pylate wolde shede no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent bloud,<note place="margin">Pylate.</note> but laboured to mytigate the Byshoppes furye, &amp; instaūted them
<pb facs="110"/>
as they were relygiouse, to shew godlye fauer, concludynge that he coulde by no lawe of iustice, iudge him worthie to die Marci. xv. These vengeable tyrauntes Wrisleye and Riche insaciably thirsted.<note place="margin">Wrisleye</note> not onlie the innocēt bloud of this faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full seruaunt of God, but also the bloud of the noble duchesse of Sothfolke, the bloud of the worthye countesse of Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde, and of the vertuouse countesse of Suffexe, the bloude of the faythfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye Dennye,<note place="margin">Ladyes.</note> of the good lady Fizwilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams, and of other godlye women more, soche widowes and wiues as Paule, Pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, and Iohan commendeth in their epi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stles, besydes the bloude of serten noble<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men of the kynges hygh counsell. And all at the spyghtfull callynge on of the Byshoppes. Slacke eare gaue Pilate to the prestes,<note place="margin">Pylate.</note> he regarded not ther dysplea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure, he detected their proternouse mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, by delayes he dyfferred the senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and fynallye washed hys handes as one that was clere from their tyrannie, Luce. xxiii. Swyft eare gaue Wrisleye &amp; Ryche with their wycked affynyte to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> puffed vp porkelynges of the pope Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner,<note place="margin">Wrisleye &amp; Riche.</note> Bonner, &amp; soch other, they folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed their reuell counsell, they enpryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her, iudged her, condempned her, &amp; racked her, at the laste with their owne
<pb facs="111"/>
poluted bloudie tormentours hādes, till the vaynes and synnowes brast.</p>
   <p>If ye marke the scriptures wele, ye shall easelye perceyue that Pylate was not in fawte of Chrystes bufferynges,<note place="margin">Pylate,</note> bearynges, scornynges, face spyttyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, crownynge with thorne, and soch other extreme handelynges. But the malycyouse Byshoppes &amp; prestes which waged Iudas to betraye hym,<note place="margin">Prestes.</note> hyred fal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se wytnesse to accuse hym, monyed the multitude to dyffame hym, fayned fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se matter agaynste hym, compelled the lawe and terrifyed the iudge, to haue their full myschefe accomplished, as our Bishoppes haue done in thys cruell acte and soche other. Whan the prestes wolde haue blemished hys name by the ignomyniouse deathe whiche he suffred amonge theues on the crosse, Pilate proclamed it gloriouse vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to all the worlde,<note place="margin">Pylate.</note> writinge his title in Hebrue, Greke, and Latine, Iesus of Nazareth kinge of the Iewes, and wol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de not at their instaūt callinge on, chāge it, Ioā. xvi. Wrisleie &amp; Riche with their vngracyouse affynyte,<note place="margin">Wrysleye</note> haue in euerye poynt folowed here the execrable affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the prestes. Fauorablye Pilate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed Ioseph of Arymathye to take downe Christes bodie, and to burie it.
<pb facs="111"/>
Math. xxvii. Wrisleye cōmaunded thys martyr of God with her faythfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyons to be brent to ashes. Pylate was ignoraunt of Gods lawes,<note place="margin">Pilate.</note> and a pagane Wrisleye and Ryche know both the lawe and the Gospell,<note place="margin">Wrisleye</note> and are chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styanes, the more is it to their dampna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon, to execute soch turkish tyrannye.</p>
   <p>Now to conclude with Anne Askewe as the argument of thys boke requireth In the yeare of our lord a M.D.XLVI And in the moneth of Iulye, at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dygyouse procuremente of Antichristes furyouse remnaunt, Gardyner,<note place="margin">Brent.</note> Bonner and soch lyke, she sufferd most cruell dea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the ī Smythfelde with her iii. faithfull companyons, Iohā Lassels a gentylmā whych had bene her instructour, Iohan Adlam a tayler,<note place="margin">Martyrs</note> and a prest so constaunt in the veryte agaynst the sayd Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes supersticyons as they, whose name at this tyme I had not. Credybyle am I infourmed by dyuerse duche marchaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes whych were there present, that in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> time of their sufferinges, the skie abhor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ringe so wycked an acte,<note place="margin">A sygne.</note> sodenly altered coloure, and the cloudes frō aboue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue a thōder clappe, not al vnlyke to that is writtē, Psa. lxxvi. The elemētes both declared therin the hygh dyspleasure of God for so tyrānouse a murther of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes.<note place="margin">Gods hā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.</note>
      <pb facs="112"/>
and also expreslye sygnyfyed his mightye hande present to the comfort of them whych trusted in hym, besydes the most wonderfull mutacyon which wyll within short space therupon folowe. And lyke as the Centuryon with those that were with hym,<note place="margin">Centurio</note> for the tokens she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed at Christes deathe, confessed hym to be y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sonne of God, Math. xxvii. So dyd a greate nombre at the burnynge of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se martyrs, vpon the syght of thys open experymēt, afferme them to be his fayth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full members.</p>
   <p>Full manye Christen hart haue rysen and wyll ryse from the pope to Chryste through the occasyon of their consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge in the fyre.<note place="margin">Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> As the saynge is, of their ashes wyll more of the same opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon aryse. Manye a wone sayth yet both in Englande and Duchelande, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,<note place="margin">Take hede</note> O that woman that woman, O those men those men. If the popes genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon and wycked remnaunt make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye more soch martyrs, they are lyke to marre all their whole market in Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lande. It were best for thē now a dayes to lete men be at lyberte for their holye fathers gaudish ceremonies,<note place="margin">Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes.</note> as they are for beare baytynges, cocke fyghtynges tennys playe, tables, tombelinge, daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge, or hūtynge, who list &amp; who maye.
<pb facs="112"/>
for as little haue those tradiciōs of his of the worde of God, in their prowdest out shewe, as they haue. Here wyll some tender stomakes be greued,<note place="margin">Tendre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges,</note> and report that in our headye hastinesse, we refuse to suffre with our weake brether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne accordynge to the doctryne of Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le. But I saye vnto them, what so euer they be whyche are so scrupulou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se wanderers, that they most execrablye erre in so bestowynge the scryptures. For abhomynable is that tolleraunce of our brethernes weakenesse,<note place="margin">Hypocre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye.</note> where God is by ydolatrouse superstycyons dysobeyed, dyshonoured, and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. A playne practyse were thys of Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>than in hypocresye to vpholde all deuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshnesse</p>
   <p>On the other side was there an other sort at the deathe of these blessyd mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,<note place="margin">Papystes</note> and they iudged of this alteracion of the ayre and thonder clappe, as dyd the Iewysh Byshoppes with their per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerted multitude. Whyche waggynge their heades, rayled, reuyled, iangled, iested, scorned, cursed, mocked, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed at Christes precyouse sufferynges on the crosse,<note place="margin">Prestes.</note> Mat xxvii. and Luce xxiii. These were the ydle wytted prestes at London and their beastlye ygnoraunt broodes with olde superstycyouse baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb facs="113"/>
and brethels, the popes blynde cattell.<note place="margin">Bawdes.</note> These cryed there like madde me dye bedlemes, as they hearde the thon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. They are dampned, they are damp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, their wyse preachers outasynge the same at Paules crosse, In dede full no billie are they ouerseane in the Bible that iudge the thonders to signifie dāp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nacion.

Thonder is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> helpinge power of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lorde, Iob. xxvii. and no dampnacion. Christe called Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han and Iames the sonnes of thonder, Marci iii. Whiche betokened that they shuld be ernest preachers, and no chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of dampnacion.

   <p>As the lambe had opened the first sea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le of the boke, the voice that went forth was as it had bene thonder, Apoca. vi. whiche is no dampnacion,<note place="margin">Apocal.</note> but a sharpe callinge of people to Godwarde. The thonderynges that apered whan the Angell filled his censer.<note place="margin">Thōders.</note> Apoc viii. were no dampnacions but Gods crueste wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des rebukinge the worlde for sinne. The
<pb facs="113"/>
best interpretours do cal those thōderin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges which came from the trone of God. Apocal. iiii. soch verites of the scripture as terrifieth synners, and no dampna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions.
