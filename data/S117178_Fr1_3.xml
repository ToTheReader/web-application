   <p>
      <note place="margin">First Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement.</note>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian and courteous Reader, I aduertise thee in a few things. First, if thou bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to reade, peruse seriously, consider ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely, and then judge vnpartially. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member well, that it is an obscure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy which I heer endeauour to explane. If thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuest any more literall and genuine, or mysticall and more likely sense thereof, I pray thee to impart it without enuy; if not, at least giue me leaue to communicate this vnto thee, as both a probable and approueable sense, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a better, more genuine and certaine, bee produced. Sure I am, that it is agreeing to the analogie of faith, and tends to the beating down of an execrable point of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> daily practised in the popish Church.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Second Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement.</note> Secondly, I aduertise thee, if thou be a <hi>Papist-Protestant,</hi> that is, more <hi>Papist</hi> than <hi>Protestant;</hi> or a <hi>Protestant-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,</hi> that is, more Christian than <hi>Papist,</hi> yet in part po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish (for, by such mongrell meddleis at Masse and at Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, the <hi>mystery of iniquity</hi> now worketh powerfully &amp; perfidiously) if thou be such a one (I say) then this my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation will surely at the first seem to thee altogether incredible, and a very paradox: but if in the vnpartiall perusing thereof, the same may happen to seem probable to thee, then bethink thy self what mysteries of iniquitie are taught in <hi>Babylon;</hi> when-as a second mystery thereof being laid open, fore-told and fore-condemn'd by Christ, the same seems so prodigiously incredible.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Third Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement.</note> In the third place I aduertise thee, that wheras in page 20. I doo call that Proposition blasphemous, wherein the

      </gap>y printed in a certaine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, stiled <hi>The Communion of Saints:</hi> and yet, it beeing there, I cannot wel pass by it without a little enquirie.</p>
   <p>Touching which Proposition, that hath giuen (as it is there deliuered) very great offense to many; I my selfe, finding such variety in the impressions of the said Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, for my owne satisfaction haue made diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry concerning the allowed copie, and for the same haue receiued most certain and assured instruction, thus: First, that these words, <hi>The makers of Christs body,</hi> together with the other, <hi>creatores Creatoris, the creators of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi> were indeed offered in the written Copie by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to haue been approued, but that they were vtterly disallowed, and the Author also strictly required to leaue them out; as also diuerse other passages (heerafter questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) which were likely to giue just offense. And lest the Reader might gather some like sense from other words going before in page 6. touching the Priests <hi>power ouer</hi>
      <note place="margin">page <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </note>
      <hi>Christs naturall body;</hi> these words, <hi>They make vp the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body of Christ by the holy Ghost</hi> (heerin alluding to the
<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 16</note> Apostles phrase) were expresly required by the R. Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to be added in place of the former. So carefull and wary was the learned and judicious Censurer of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, had not the Authour taken such a wilfull liberty to himself, not to print what he was allowed, but in diuerse things what he listed or lusted.</p>
   <p>In the second place I am informed, when-as (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the strict inhibition) these words, <hi>The makers of Christs body,</hi> were thrust into the first printed Copie, and
<pb facs="4"/> the Author challenged for it, he promised in the next im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression (which he then had in hand) to giue full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: but in that impression, in stead of omitting those words, he claps-on a large marginall Comment of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain annotations familiar with the <hi>Papists,</hi> though (God wot) not prouing his intent. And heerupon, greater of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense beeing taken than before, and an ouerture made of calling in his books (in regard of such indirect and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue dealing) he yeelded in the end to insert by way of parenthesis, for further explication, these words (<hi>to weet, in a sacramentall and mysticall sense</hi>). But yet it is to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, that he doth it not without a pretty sleight: for, immediately after the parenthesis, hee addes, <hi>They make the mysticall bodie of Christ;</hi> when-as hee should haue said, <hi>They make vp the mysticall bodie of Christ;</hi> leauing out the word <hi>vp,</hi> as not agreeing to his oblique purpose &amp; intent</p>
   <p>Further, I vnderstand that he being expresly required to leaue out the word <hi>onely</hi> in the sixt page towards the
<note place="margin">page 6</note> end therof, he did it not; but makes our Sauiour to speak those words (<hi>Doe this in remembrance of me</hi>) onely to his Apostles; perhaps thereby driuing after the popish sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing <hi>Facite:</hi> when-as it is most certain, that these words (<hi>Do this</hi>) haue reference to the whole mysticall action (both of Minister and people respectiuely) of <hi>blessing, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11</note>
      <hi>eating, drinking, &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thus then the Reader may obserue, how the Author (like the fish called <hi>Cuttle,</hi> hiding it selfe with his owne
<note place="margin">Sepia suo se a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramento occ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>
         <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat.</note> ink) shuffles vp and downe, now putting-in the words (<hi>in a sacramentall and mysticall sense</hi>) now leauing them out; again, in one impression putting-in the words (<hi>vp</hi> and <hi>onely</hi>) but in others leauing them out; not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (perhaps) what or whereof he affirmeth. May not the Author then (in all brotherly loue) or, if need be, his Patrone for him, if he haue any such, the reuerend <hi>Nemo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nullibi</hi> (with him <hi>Conclamatissimus,</hi> most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed; to others <hi>Occultatissimus,</hi> most hidde) be desired
<pb facs="5"/> to come out of his blank, and to appear in black, for the defense and instruction of his so vncertain and wauering a Client; that so wee, the poor Readers, may vnderstand what may be the meaning and mysterie of such dubious writing?</p>
   <p>With the Authors Epistle dedicatory, fronted in such an vncouth manner, we may bee the bolder (as also with the Preface annexed thereunto in some impressions) for that they both haue been so bold as to prease to the Press without any presenting at all to Authority for their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to be printed.</p>
   <p>First: may not the Authors discretion or reading bee
<note place="margin">Epist. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>d. liue 1.</note> questioned, for deuising the Epithets of <hi>Consummatissimus</hi> and <hi>Conclamatissimus Pontificum?</hi> (thereby intending to honour his Reuerend Father in God) which Epithets are not (so vsed) to be found in <hi>Sidonius,</hi> as by the Author he
<note place="margin">Sid. Apol. l. 2. ep. 2. l. 7. ep. 7</note> is cited. I finde indeed in <hi>Sidonius,</hi> in his <hi>lib. 2. ep.</hi> 2. these words, <hi>Conclamatissimo fontium</hi> (the most famous of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains) and in his <hi>epist. 7. lib.</hi> 7. in the inscription thereof, these; <hi>Domino Graeco Papa, To the Lord Greek, Pope:</hi> which title <hi>Papa,</hi> Pope, though in antient times it was vsed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously to Bishops; yet, because the Author imposeth no speciall name vpon his masked Patrone, may not I with others conjecture, that he intendeth for his Patron that Pope who is now onely so called <hi>per eminentiam,</hi> and claimeth to bee <hi>Conclamatissimus,</hi> most conclamed ouer the whole Church of Christ.</p>
   <p>What spirit of meeknes is in those words of the sayd
<note place="margin">Epist. ded. pag. 2</note> Epistle? <hi>Those to haue neuer tasted of the spirit of goodnes, who</hi> (as the Authors phrase is) <hi>did cut him for his Sermon;</hi> and likewise in those, wherein he taxeth those with <hi>intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>

      <hi>maleuolence,</hi> who had said <hi>that his Sermon was called in;</hi> when as (as hee there glorieth) <hi>it was called out?</hi> But how may it iustly be said of those, that <hi>they had neuer tasted of the spirit of goodnes,</hi> or that they had <hi>intemperate maleuolence,</hi> for that they reprooued that Sermon which was so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
<pb facs="5"/> suspected to fauour <hi>Papism,</hi> and also to be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the allowed and approoued Copie?</p>
   <p>He glorieth that his Sermon was so fast called out: for my part, I maruell not thereat; considering how great a number of <hi>Personated</hi> and <hi>Parsonated</hi> (Chameleon-like) Priests, in all habits and shapes, all colours and fashions saue their owne) doo daily spatiate in <hi>Pauls,</hi> and walk through <hi>Pauls Church▪ yard.</hi> And will not such disguised <hi>Massers, makers of Christs body</hi> (perhaps hauing it in their

   <p>Will it not serue them for and in stead of an inter-lude
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Epist.</hi> to the Reader in the Ende.</note> to <hi>call out</hi> and to reade that Sermon, wherein they may finde a Minister of the Church of England praying to Angels? And though hee pray in <hi>Bernards</hi> phrase (who was carried away with the errour of the time) yet they will begin to conceiue, that the <hi>Society</hi> wherein the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi> liued is not far off from the approuing of Saint-<hi>inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> yea and of <hi>transubstantiation</hi> also (in regard of what he writeth in his Sermon, page 7.) with such other <hi>Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worships</hi> as doo ineuitably flowe and follow thence-from. Which their conception is but a mere deception; like to that their pernicious Lie (now vauntingly in print) that the late most entire and religious Bishop of <hi>London, Iohn</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/> Doctor <hi>King</hi> died a Papist, a reconciled Papist. O the impudent and shamelesse fore-head of such men! <hi>Posue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt spem suam mendacium, they haue made lying to bee their</hi>

      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, to the height of her deception.</p>
   <p>Further, though it should cost them dear, yet they will <hi>call out,</hi> and pry into that Sermon, in the <hi>Preface</hi> whereof
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Epist.</hi> To the Reader.</note> they may finde <hi>a world of warriours</hi> (such warriors as haue written against the <hi>Tridentine Synod</hi>) to be branded with the <hi>choice and election of the pleasure of temporall sin.</hi> What?
<note place="margin">pag. 3. Heb. 11. 25.</note> all such warriours that haue opposed the Lady <hi>Hellen</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> (whether <hi>Royall, Clerks,</hi> or <hi>Laickes</hi>)? what? all (I say) <hi>Louers of pleasures, more than of God?</hi> and yet all <hi>Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators</hi>
      <note place="margin">Heb. 11 26.</note> and <hi>Interimists</hi> (Author-like) <hi>aspicientes in remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> aiming at that reward which God hath promised to those that loue him? O egregious! such onely louers of God, who endeauour to join <hi>light</hi> and <hi>darknes, Christ</hi> and <hi>Belial, God</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi> that is, two most opposite reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions? It will not bee vnacceptable to them, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in his Epistle dedicatorie, page 3, inueigheth so bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly against Sermon-haunters: wherin perhaps he wold shrowd himself, by pretended opposing the opposers of Church-gouernment. But may he not look further, and thereby obliquely strike at our Church? A practice not vnusuall heertofore (to my knowledge) in some indirect squinters against the doctrine and discipline of the same.</p>
   <p>The Author, in the same place, much complaineth of a <hi>corrupted liuer</hi> (Oh how sick, and deadly sick, would hee
<note place="margin">Epist. ded. pag. 4</note> make this famous Church to be!) <hi>of a corrupted liuer, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to cause the sound doctrine of our Redeemer to proue loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and none but scrubbers to be in request. Ʋah! the sound doctrine of our Redeemer proue loathsome! Out alack! none but scrubbers in request!</hi> The Church of Rome (I knowe what I write) would buy it dearly, that there were fewer of such
<pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>scrubbers,</hi> who haue scrubbed vp so vncessantly &amp; so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the roots of her errours, that the very bloud of her shame is thereby discouered, and by them laid open to the view both of men and Angels: And heerin I meane such handlers of controuersies, preachers and lecturers, as are approoued in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and allowed by Authority; and, to my vnderstanding, the Author le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, against such, his bitter and tart nick-name <hi>scrubbers.</hi>

   <p>It is not to be omitted, that those words (<hi>setting aside the efficacie of inspired Scripture</hi>) which were required with some other to be put in the allowed Copie (and for which the Author is beholding to his learned Censurer) were wilfully left out in the first Impression.

      <note place="margin">page 21.</note>
      <hi>Saints hath been neglected: for, from the daies of our Sauiour, vntill this houre</hi> (he reckons to the very time of the clocks stroke for his Sermon) <hi>not one man hath been so charitable to the Saints, as to bestowe one whole Sermon vpon their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (for any thing that I can finde) nor any iust Treatise (one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some little expositions) except onely one Schismatick, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates that Communion most vniustly to his own separation.</hi> Thus the Author. Hath he not forgotten (or else he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands them not) Saint <hi>Austines</hi> Book <hi>de vnitate Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae?</hi> his exquisite Volume <hi>de ciuitate Dei?

   <pb facs="7"/>
   <p>To conclude, (pretermitting manie other points in his epistles, worthie either of redargution, or requiring interpretation) I doe finally note, how in his epistle to
<note place="margin">Pag. 2. line 26</note> the Reader, hee promiseth thus; <hi>wee shall search, how farre that doctrine</hi> (hee meaneth the <hi>Trid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ntine) will admit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union?</hi> What? <hi>reunion?</hi> And may not the Authour here be aduised, to thinke of his owne strength; whether this bee feisible by him or no: let him consider, whether hee hath iudgement sufficient to resolue, discretion to order, ability to bring forth such a Childe; hee (I say) who (though hee hath taken libertie, to haue printed (in diuers things) what hee hath listed) hath notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (after manie trauailes) brought forth with a double birth so imperfect an <hi>Embryo;</hi> according as, in part, it hath beene shewed, and more might bee added.</p>
   <p>More Doubts and demaundes I might haue proposed; but these maie suffice: the which I desire both the Authour and all courteous Readers to take no otherwise then as so many requests that the Authour would bee pleased to open and explane himselfe more fully.</p>
   <p>But, for so much as may concerne his pretended <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamatissimus,</hi> most <hi>Conclamed Patrone,</hi> Lette him not take it amisse, if I presume, and conclude that there must bee a latent mystery, and emblem of some forraine obiect intended in this riddling dedication. For sure among the Reuerend <hi>Prelates</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous for learning, so solid and sound for iudgement (whose worthie names aduance our Church aboue other Reformed) there will none be found to fauour these dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, loose and ill sounding positions, which I haue here in part freely &amp; ingenuously noted; and this for no other ende, then to craue the Authours Brotherly explanation: the which I heartily wish hee may performe to his owne content and to the Christian satisfaction of others.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">4 Aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> My fourth Aduertisement is, that whereas the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader cannot but obserue my following discourse
<pb facs="8"/> to bee some what tart and pregnant against the errours of Poperie; my aduertisement to him is, that hee would bee pleased to interpret the same not as proceeding out of any spleene against their persons, but onelie out of an vnfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned zeale against their errours and vanities. God is my witnesse, that in the bowels of Charitie I could wish to my selfe, for their saluation, Saint Paules <hi>Anatheme,</hi> which hee <hi>desired to himselfe, for his brethren according to the flesh:</hi>

And is not this my zeale an expresse imitatiō (without enuie be it spoken) of the zeale of all those holie &amp; blessed <hi>Seruants</hi> and <hi>Messengers</hi> of God which his <hi>Spirit</hi> hath raised vp (from out of the very <hi>Vr</hi> of popery, &amp; fornance of <hi>Babylon</hi>) for the opposing him and his whom <hi>the Lord Iesus shall destroy illustratione aduentus gloriae suae, with the brightnes of his comming,</hi> the Glory of his Gospell? The phrases which I produce (<hi>Antichrist, false prophets, false-anointed-ones, idelatry, blasphemous,</hi> with such like) will not seeme harsh, nor ill-sounding to the Intelligent Reader, who may bee instructed in the Scriptures of God, and who also may be
