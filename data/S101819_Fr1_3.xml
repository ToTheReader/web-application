      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, whether of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie or Laity, of the Priesthood or people. Thou seest here a spectacle represented vnto thy view, horrid and bloody beyond all comparison, and scarce to be paralleld, except it be by the very Canibals and men-eating Tartars, people deuoide of all Christianity and humanity. The hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousnesse of which fact was agrauated, and more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliz'd in the Iudgement of all men, by considering the quality and profession of the person murdered, and by the suruay of that high relation, which the murtherers had, or at leastwise should haue had vnto him; as being a vessell consecrated to the Lord, and annointed to doe him seruice both in soule and body in the Tabernacle of his congregation.
