   <p rend="italic">WIlling to satisfie the especiall entreaty of some, and for a generall benefite to all Gods Church, I haue set out to publike view, this Sermon of preparatiue, which I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in my Parish Church at <hi>Horton</hi> in Kent. I know there is no word of God but hath his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, <note place="margin">2 Tī. 3, 16</note> for so saith paule, that al Scripture is profitable, but set this a part and we shall like him that after <note place="margin">Iohn 5, 5.</note> he had bin diseased, eight and thirtie yeares, laye at the poole of Bethsaida for helpe, and yet was neuer the neare because he had none to helpe him, nor knew not how to get in when the angell came downe to stirre the water: this is the reason why there are at this day so many vnfruitfull hearers, for that albeit mens soules are euen sick for want of knowledge, though they haue lien at the well head
<pb facs="3"/> and by the water of life, and had a continuall sound of the Gospell in their eare, yet in sixe and fortie yeares this ignorance cannot be expelled, because when the Angell of Gods will doth preach the word and stirre vp the water of life, they know not how to moue their eares toward it. This therfore (beloued) I haue set downe as a direction to teach men how to heare, that so often as the poole hereafter shal be stirred, and the word of God preached vnto you, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">

      </gap> may know how to vse it to your benefit, therefore learne this Sermon, and profit by all, neglect this and leese all. I haue called it a Iewell, as Christ called the Gospell a pearle, for without this Iewel <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 4,</note> you shall neuer finde that pearle, I haue fitted it fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
