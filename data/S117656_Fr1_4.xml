   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, if in all this discourse
you do not reade, that <hi>Mahamet Satarz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi,</hi>
(of whom mention is made pag. 9.)
is now become the General of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
campe. That <hi>Sinan Cicala</hi> (pa. 6. b.)
beginneth to recouer the fauor of the Emperor <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamet.</hi>
That <hi>Hassan Bassa,</hi> who had the gouernment
of Constantinople in the absence of the great Turk
(pag. 6.) was first created chiefe Visier, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes
put to death: And lastly, that the
Prince of Transiluania hath surprised <hi>Feulac,</hi> and
<hi>Canaal,</hi> and such other like matters. And especially,
that the Christian Emperour hath recouered the
strong Fort of <hi>Giauarino,</hi> chiefly through the grace
and fauour of God, and next by the notable valour
and labor of <hi>Adolph</hi> Baron of <hi>Schwartzenberg,</hi> most
worthy of eternall memorie: I pray you remember
how the Authour in his former Preface doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
that touching certaine accidents he writeth no
further then till the yeare 1597. wherein hee also
dealeth like a Politician rather then like an Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher:
&amp; therefore referreth those matters to some
other workes which he had then in hand. Farewell.</p>
