   <head>The first letter, from the Citizen in the behalfe
and cause of his eldest sonne, to a speciall
friend, of whose loue, and learning

   <opener>
      <salute>Right Worthy Sir,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>IF hauing beene at no small charge, and some care, to breed my sonne
vp in Gentleman like qualities, with purpose the rather to enable
him for the seruice of God, his Prince, and Countrey, I am very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to remoue from him as a Father, all occasions, which might either
make him lesse estemed of others, or abate the least part of his edge; I say,
not towards the honesty of life onely, but towards the splendor thereof,
and worship also, my hope is, that I shall not in your worthy iudgement,
seeme either insolent, or vaine glorious.</p>
   <p>Truth and Iustice are the onely motiues of my stirring at this present.
For, as I mortally hate that my Son should beare himselfe, aboue himself
so should I disclaime my part in him, if being vniustly sought to be emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
he sillily lost any inch of his due. He hath beene disgraced as no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
borne, when yet not hee but I his Father was the Apprentise,
thankes be to God for it. They cannot obiect to him want of fashion; they
cannot obiect to him the common vices, badges rather of reprobates then
of Gentlemen: They cannot obiect to him cowardise, for it is well knowne
that he dares defend himselfe: nor any thing else vnworthy of his name,
which is neither new, nor ignoble: But mee his poore father they obiect
vnto him, because I was once an Apprentise.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="9"/>
Wise Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> teacheth vs, vnder the names, and persons
of his <hi>Eutopians,</hi> that victories, and atchieuements of wit are applauded,
farre aboue those of forces: and seeing reuerence to God, &amp; to our Prince,
commandeth vs, (as his Maiesties booke of Duells doth affirme (not to
take the office of iustice from Magistrates, by priuate rash reuenges, I
haue compelled my sonne, vpon Gods blessing, and mine, to forbeare the
sword till by my care he may be found not to be in the wrong. For if it be
true, <hi>that by Apprentiship we forfeit our titles to natiue Gentrie:</hi>
God forbid that my sonne should vsurpe it. And if it be not true, then
shall be haue a iust ground to defend himselfe, and his aduersaries shall
stand conuicted of ignorance, if not of enuie also.</p>
   <p>These are therefore very earnestly to pray you, to cleare this question.
For, in the City of <hi>London</hi> there are at this present many hundreds of
Gentlemens children Apprentises, infinite others haue beene, and infinite
will be: and all the parts of <hi>England</hi> are full of families, either origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
raised to the dignity of Gentlemen out of this one most famous
place: or so restored, and enriched as may well seeme to amount to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
raising. And albeit I am very confident, that by hauing once
beene an Apprentise in <hi>London,</hi> I haue not lost to be a Gentleman of
birth, nor my sonne, yet shall I euer wish, and pray rather to resemble an
heroicke <hi>Walworth,</hi> a noble <hi>Philpot,</hi> an happie <hi>Capel,</hi> that learned
Sheriffe of <hi>London</hi> M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Fabian,</hi> or any other famous Worthies of this
royall City, out of any whatsoeuer obscurest parentage, then that being
descended of great Nobles, to fall by vice farre beneath the rancke of
poorest Prentises.</p>
   <p>In requitall of your care in this point, you shall shortly receiue (if I
can obtain my desire) out of the records &amp; monuments of <hi>London,</hi> a Roll
of the names, and Armes of such principall friends as haue beene aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to Honor, and Worship, throughout the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> from the
degree of Citizens. A warrantable designe, by the example of the Lord
chiefe Iustice <hi>Cooke,</hi> who hath bestowed vpon the world (in some one
or other of his bookes of reports) a short Catologue of such as haue beene
eminently beholding to the Common Lawes, and if I should faile in that,
yet doe I promise you a list or Alphabet of Apprentises names, who by
their enrollments will appeare vpon good Record, to haue beene sonnes
of Gentlemen from all the parts of <hi>England.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="9"/>
Neither let your approued vertue doubt, but that in the meane time
you shall finde vs very ready to shew our free, and honest mindes, in all
commendable, and disenuious emulations, with the best Gentlemen who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.
Which disposition measure not by the few Angells you receiue in
this Letter. For what are twenty in such a case?</p>
   <p>If this my sute, and request, cary the lesse regard, because it comes
but from a priuate Citizen, be pleased I pray to vnderstand, that in me,
though being but one man, multitudes speake, and that out of a priuate
pen, a publike cause propounds it selfe. And yet I come not single. For
with this Letter of mine, I send you two other. The one from a worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
friend, and kinsman of mine, written to me, and the other of my Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
his second sonne, much what of one nature with this of mine. And
so with my loue, and best respects remembred, I commit you to Gods holy
keeping, and rest, &amp;c.</p>
