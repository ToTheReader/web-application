   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot but make account that I am bound to returne thankes, where I finde fauour and acceptance: acknowledgement is the least part of my duty. He that will not confesse a debt, neuer
<pb facs="3"/> meanes to pay it: some such there be: And others againe, will inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously confesse, but not pay; not for that they will not, but because they cannot. And inability gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth an acquittance, though the debt be neuer so great: and the greatnesse of a debt, is to be iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not alwayes in the value of the thing, but after the free disposition of the one, and the little deseruing of any such fauour of the other. Thus is it with me. I haue found your Ladyship my louing friend, and this Vertuous Gentlewoman very Christianly respectiue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mee: to whom, as also to her second selfe, I acknowledge my selfe deeply ingaged. It is not a hard matter to finde friends, though in these dayes few enow,
<pb facs="3"/> but to finde a faithfull friend, one that will know a man in aduersity, is not so easie. Complementall are obuious euery where: but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall friends be rare: a face of fauour is in those, and that onely in prosperity, but the force of loue is onely seene in these; when a friend needeth them, they fayle not, they faynt not. True loue, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes, driueth away feare. I am bold to present you both with this little Manual. It is thus little of purpose, that it may be often read ouer, to helpe onely for matter of meditation, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you in prayer. I beseech you to accept it in lieu of payment, and it shall bind mee to pray for the blessing of our God, still vpon you, to whose gracious guidance
<pb facs="4"/> and protection, I commit you, and humbly take leaue.</p>
