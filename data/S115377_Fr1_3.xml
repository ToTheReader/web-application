   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader: forasmuch as wee are all (as Experience proueth, the surest Schoole-mistresse in the world) from the King to the Begger: from the best to the basest: from the mightiest to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest: from him that sits vpon the Throne: to the poorest grinder in the Mill, without exception, or exemption of any. Actors heere vpon the Stage of no long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: and (as euidently the Holy Ghost doth witnesse vnto vs all, in the <hi>1. Cor. 9.24.</hi>) runners of a most short and transitorie race heere in this mortall life: the which race being finished first, or last: either at our first, third, sixth, or eleuenth houre. That is to say, either in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Youth, Middle age, or Old age: our Bodies must then returne vnto Dust, from whence they came: and our Soules must returne vnto <hi>GOD</hi> who gaue them. That therefore in the very day and houre of our Deaths: that immortall part, I meane our soules, (which as Saint <hi>Austen</hi> saith, <hi>Generando infunduntur &amp; infundendo generantur,</hi> are infused into our bodyes by a Diuine and vnvtterable generation, and are begotten of <hi>GOD</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in vs, by a Coelestiall infusion,) may not bee repulsed by <hi>CHRIST</hi> himselfe, the Iudge of quicke and dead, with <hi>Non noui vos, discedite maledicti, &amp;c.</hi> I know you
<pb facs="5"/>not, depart you Cursed, &amp;c. But may then bee immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and that most ioyfully admitted, into the <hi>Coelum Emperaeum,</hi> the Heauen of Heauens, with that sweet <hi>Venite benidicti, &amp;c.</hi> Come yee blessed Children of my Father, &amp;c. to <hi>GODS</hi> most comfortable presence, there to haue full fellowship with the Blessed Trinitie, and with all the Communion of the tryumphant Saints, and so raigne with them in Blisse for euermore. I haue heere made bold in loue, as <hi>GODS</hi> poore Labourer (though <hi>Apostolorum minimus, Peccatorum maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp; Sanctorum infimus:</hi> the least of the Apostles, named of <hi>GOD,</hi> chiefest Sinner, and the meanest Saint.) to commend this compendious Sermon of mine vnto thy Christian view, for thy better instruction and daily direction in this present Life (which is but for a moment) how to runne most wisely and worthily indeed, of this thine appointed Spirituall race. The which poore Mite of mine, if I shall finde thee (courteous Reader) with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse and chearefulnesse to accept, and with careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and faithfulnesse daily for to vse, it shall then bee thine; Otherwise, if you doe gracelesly abuse it, or else most grossely refuse it, then it shall bee mine. Reade, and consider well I pray thee with good discretion, what heere thou readest: and the Lord giue vs all a right vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in all good things. And if vpon thy reading, or hearing hereof, you shall finde any Spirituall and Ghostly comfort for to follow: let <hi>GOD</hi> haue all the glorie, to whom all Glorie chiefly appertayneth: and let mee (the Lords vnworthy Minister) haue thy daily Prayers to <hi>GOD</hi> in my behalfe, that <hi>GOD</hi> of his goodnesse may so blesse me in my Ministrie, which I haue receiued from the Lord, as that hereby I may from henceforth be boldly
<pb facs="5"/>encouraged, and enabled to prepare yet some few Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations more of this kinde hereafter for thee. And thus most heartily commending it to thy Christian and charitable consideration, and my selfe with all my daily Studies and endeauours, vnto thy most faithfull and feruent prayers, I rest.</p>
