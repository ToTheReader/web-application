   <head>The Auctors Epistle, or Preface to this woorke. SAPIENCIAE. CAP. <hi>2.</hi> Exiguum, &amp; cum tedio, Est tempus vitae nostrae.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>YTHEN that by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> course, the date of mans life is short, and as experience sheweth, the Process of the same is full of perilles, both of soule and body. And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, our mortall complexion is yet subiect to many corporall infirmities, passions, and inordinate affections of the spirite. And so we passe away our dayes by continuall enterchange: as then sicke, nowe, in health, then tich, nowe poore: then in hope, now in dispayre: and now in discomfort, then in consolacion. Therefore IOB, making familier comparison, likeneth the beginnyng, the middes, and the end of mans lyfe, vnto a flowre.</p>
   <p>For right as a flowre in the first appearance or rysing is tender and feoble, and soone ouerthrowen, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and consumed and all be it that in the processe of growyng, it springeth and ryseth pleasantly, yet by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracion of Nyght and Day, mutabilitie of winde and
<pb facs="5"/>
weather, misty Cloudes, and tempestious ayre. This foresaid flowre is in continuall enterchange, and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth neuer stable in one florishing state any long time, but finally fadeth away, returnyng to very earth and powder.</p>
   <p>Right so a man in the tender state of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, is vnable to helpe him selfe, and to nourishe him selfe, in the necessitie of Nature he hath no suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunce. Then growyng vp to Childhood, he is both feeble of corporall strength, and weake in witte: and by casuall chaunce of any int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>mperancie, excesse, or surffet, he is soone quayled and brought to his ende. Then florishing and springing vp to the ripenes (that is) vnto yeeres of discretion, portlines of stature, and perfection of manly strength: he is apt to be possessed with many sondry perils both spirituall and corporall, and vnder the chaunge of many fortunate chaunces.</p>
   <p>And so concludingly, in decrepit aige he must neede suffer the impotencie thereof, and the miserie of many sore languors: and finally be sequestred from this lyfe and worldly vanities thereof. And thus he neuer stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth fyrme in one stay.</p>
   <bibl>IOB. <hi>44.</hi>
   </bibl>
   <q>
      <p>Homo natus est de muliere bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui viuens tempore, repletur multis miserijs: Qui, quasi flos egreditur, &amp; eonteritur, &amp; fugit velut vmbra, &amp; nunquam in eodem statu per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manet. &amp;c.</p>
   </q>
   <p>And thus our tyme reuoluing by continuall altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (to conclude and finishe our perillous pilgrimage in this vaile of teares) succeedeth dollorus Death: the which no man by naturall course can eschue. And of
<pb facs="6"/>
the time, the place, the maner, or the kind of his death, is no man that naturally knoweth: and then according to his deseruing he shall haue his dome.</p>
   <p>Therefore, sythen our time is but short and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, and by reason of diuers impedimentes ryght daungerus, it shoulde be the rather more profitably spent: For as Sainct Bernard sayth, There is nothyng committed to the disposition of Man, more precious then time. All be it, many worldly men labour and turmoyle them selues with weerinesse in worldly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, wastyng their dayes in meare vanitie. And carnall Creatures, blinded with sensuall appetites, lothsomely consume their precious tyme, wherein they might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnto knowledge and soules health, making no more accompt of lost tyme (whiche is vnrecouerable) then as it were but of vyle price, and of no value.</p>
   <bibl>BERNAR.</bibl>
   <q>
      <p>Nihil preciosius tempore: heu, nihil hodie vilius computatur. Transeunt dies salutis, &amp; nemo sibi diem vnquam causatur re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diturum.</p>
   </q>
   <p>And though for the profitable employment of our time most requisite it be for all estates and conditions what so euer, to be exercised in readyng or hearing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers woorckes and compiled matters, wherein might be conteyned noble histories, morall documentes, and royal examples of personages renoumed for their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous lyfe and conuersation: whiche when we duely reade and regard, may fructifie and bring profite to vs in our lyues and maners of liuyng, for the aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vertue, and the ahollishing of vice. Yet is there no exercise or labour taken in hand, nor tyme better
<pb facs="6"/>
spent, then in reading the sacred volumes of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For the knowledge of Scripture, by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, strengthneth our Pacience, and geueth vs conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in all aduersitie. VVherefore, the vnderstanding of it to euery estate higher or lower, is both honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, pleasant, and profitable, as Cassianus sayth.</p>
   <q>Non aliqua in mundo potest esse fortuna, quam literarum non auget gloriosa notitia.</q>
   <p>Yet notwithstandyng, holy Scripture hath a speciall prerogatiue beyonde all other doctrine, or prophane compiled matters. VVhetefore Sainct Ierome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared holy Scripture to a Mirror, or a Glasse, saying.</p>
   <q>Scriptura enim speculum est, feda ostendens, &amp; corrigere docens.</q>
   <bibl>GREGO.</bibl>
   <q>
      <p>Sacra enim scriptura, est quasi Speculum quod oculis mentis opponitur: Ibi enim sentimus, Quantum proficimus, &amp; quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum a profectu longe distamus.</p>
   </q>
   <p>For like as a Glasse sheweth a man the spots, defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and faultes of his face, the which by the sight of his eye, he can not discerne: so the declaration of holy Scripture lightneth a mans reason, and maketh him more profoundly to know the goodnes of God, his owne vnthankfulnes, the daunger of sinne, the vallure of vertue, the vicious vanitie of this world, the short processe of our lyfe, the endles torment of hell orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for sinners, and the perpetual pleasures of heauen, prepared for iust and godly persons. And though by the iudgement: of natural reason, men may indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ently haue a grosse conceipt betweene vice and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb facs="7"/>
good and euyll, some discernyng clearely, some darckly, accordyng to the measure of ingenious witt and capacitie in him that so deemeth and iudgeth: yet notwithstandyng, holy Scripture cleareth a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and conceipt, yea and helpeth reason perfectly to vnderstand in what state he standeth: and whether in the wayes of vertue or vice he furdereth or failleth. Therefore, Dauid the Prince of Propphetes, sayd.</p>
   <q>Declaratio sermonum tuorum illuminat, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectum dat paruulis</q>
   <p>And by a grosse comparison, though all mertalles be good in their vse, yet is there great distinction of degrees among them, and diuersity of value: as Brasse is more of price then Iron, Tynne, better then Leade, and Copper exceedeth Tynne▪ and one penny of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, is worth ten of Copper: and one penny of golde, is vvorth seuen of siluer. Euen so is it among Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Lucubracions, and matters composed and compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: for they haue their diuersitie and difference both in matter and maner of saying. And diuers degrees of goodnes maye bee founde in the same, As good, better, and all the best. VVherefore in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng wel this perswasion, I intend neither to disprayse, nor yet to attribute▪ singuler prayse superfluus to any fourme of compilacion or trauell in speciall. But by this digression, I purpose by Gods grace, to commend vnto deuout and godly disposed Readers, this memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall: that for as much as our tyme is precious, short, and full of Impedimentes: that by their knovvledge, they shoulde choose rhe best matter for rheir spirituall and gohstly nourishment of the soule: as they vvould doo in meate and drincke, clothinges, and necessaries
<pb facs="7"/>
for the sustentation of their body, and take their speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and frequent recourse in the exercise of readyng such bokes, as shal make best for their consolacion and profit spirituall. Thus in as much as holy Scripture, and the fruites thereof vvel vnderstanded and duely execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is a very guide to eternall lyfe, as is sayd.</p>
   <bibl>IOHN. <hi>5.</hi>
   </bibl>
   <q>
      <p>Scrutamini Scripturas, quia vos putatis, in ipsis vitam eternam habere.</p>
   </q>
   <p>And because novve a dayes men are best delighted to heare or reade such vvoorkes as are compendious, pleasant, and profitable, short in sentence, and large in sence. Although for lacke of cunnyng, and others sondry impedimentes, I am insufficient to compile such a peece of vvorke, yet neuerthelesse, by the grace of GOD, I entend to accomplishe my best endeuour, accordyng to my sclender talent, in setting foorth a compendius Treatis, to the honor &amp; prayse of God, and spirituall profite of such as shall take any pleasure in readyng thereof, vvhich may be called, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templacion of sinners. And by a similitude, forsomuch as euen as a man delighted in the diuersitie of meates and drinckes, and apparel for the body (for alteration or chaunge thereof, renueth appetite and affection) So likevvyse the spirit of man reioyceth and taketh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable refreshing of the enterchaunge and diuersitie of deuine matters, vvhich is the foode and furnirure of the soule. I purpose to deuide this Treatis in seuen partes, accordyng to the seuen dayes of the vveeke: so that for euery day a man may finde in readyng, a seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall delectacion, and remember a nevve excercitacion. And to make this compilacion more autentike, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose not to insert nor alledge any sentence thereof in
<pb facs="8"/>
the Latine tongue: but eyther that vvhiche is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by holy Scripture, pronounced by our Sauiour Christe him selfe, the foure Euangelistes, or that vvhich his Apostles haue left vs, or that vvhiche the auncient Fathers of the Primatiue Church haue vvritten for ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>omfort, or sometimes the morall mixtions of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers addicted to vertue hath reuealed vnto vs, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther els suche good and godly aduertisementes, as the good and godlye vvryters of the latter times haue offered me, incident to the consummation and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing hereof in good and decent order: although our grosse natiue language (and specially in composing of meeter is suche) that it can not in all poyntes agree with the perfection of the Latine tongue, hath made me to vvrite the matter it selfe in Latine, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise my ovvne priuate opinion vnder the same in englishe verse: supposing that some lyght is rather thereby made into the vvorke, then any obscuritie by my dooing.</p>
   <p>And to conclude, beseeching euery man that shall heare or reade this aforesayd Treatice: that they iudge not, ne backbite my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges, before they haue read, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently digested the same: I submit my poore and insufficint capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie to the discreete cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of euery reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Reader.</p>
