   <head>To the Queenes most exccellent
Maiestie.</head>
   <l>THat which their zeale, whose onely zeale was bent</l>
   <l>To shew the best they could, that might delight</l>
   <l>Your royall minde, did lately represent</l>
   <l>Renowmed Empresse to your Princely sight:</l>
   <l>Is now the offring of their humblenesse;</l>
   <l>Here consecrated to your glorious name;</l>
   <l>Whose happy presence did voutchsafe to blesse</l>
   <l>So poore presentments, and to grace the same:</l>
   <l>And though it be in th'humblest ranke of words,</l>
   <l>And in the lowest region of our speach,</l>
   <l>Yet is it in that kinde, as best accords</l>
   <l>With rurall passions, which vse not to reach</l>
   <l>Beyond the groues, and woods where they were bred</l>
   <l>And best become a claustrall exercise,</l>
   <l>Where men shut out, retyr'd, and sequestred</l>
   <l>From publicke fashion, seeme to sympathize</l>
   <l>With innocent, and plaine simplicitie:</l>
   <l>And liuing here vnder the awfull hand</l>
   <l>Of discipline, and strict obseruancie,</l>
   <l>Learne but our weaknesses to vnderstand,</l>
   <l>And therefore dare not enterprize to show</l>
   <l>In lowder stile the hidden mysteries,</l>
   <l>And artes of Thrones, which none that are below</l>
   <l>The Sphere of action, aud the exercise</l>
   <l>Of power, can truly shew: though men may straine</l>
   <l>Conceipt aboue the pitch where it should stand,</l>
   <l>And forme more monstrous figures then containe</l>
   <l>A possibilitie, and goe beyond</l>
   <l>The nature of those managements so farre,</l>
   <l>As oft their common decencie they marre:</l>
   <l>Whereby the populasse (in whom such skill</l>
   <l>Is needlesse) may be brought to apprehend</l>
   <l>Notions, that may turne all to a taste of ill</l>
   <l>What euer power shall do, or might intend:</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>And thinke all cunning, all proceeding one,</l>
   <l>And nothing simple, and sincerely done:</l>
   <l>Yet the eye of practise, looking downe from hie</l>
   <l>Vpon such ouer-reaching vanitie,</l>
   <l>Sees how from errour t'error it doth slote,</l>
   <l>As from an vnknowne Ocean int' a Gulfe:</l>
   <l>And how though th'Woolfe, would counterfeit the Goate,</l>
   <l>Yet euery chinke bewrayes him for a Woolfe.</l>
   <l>And therefore in the view of state t'haue showd</l>
   <l>A counterfeit of state, had been to light</l>
   <l>A candle to the Sunne, and so bestowd</l>
   <l>Our paines to bring our dimnesse vnto light.</l>
   <l>For maiestie, and power, can nothing see</l>
   <l>Without it selfe, that can sight-worthy be.</l>
   <l>And therefore durst not we but on the ground,</l>
   <l>From whence our humble Argument hath birth</l>
   <l>Erect our Scene, and thereon are we found,</l>
   <l>And if we fall, we fall but on the earth,</l>
   <l>From whence we pluckt the flowers that here we bring;</l>
   <l>Which if at their first opening they did please,</l>
   <l>It was enough, they serue but for a spring,</l>
   <l>The first sent is the best in things as these:</l>
   <l>Amusicke of this nature on this ground,</l>
   <l>Is euer wont to vanish with the sound.</l>
   <l>But yet your royall goodnesse may raise new,</l>
   <l>Grace but the Muses they will honour you.</l>
   <trailer>Chi non fa, non falla.</trailer>
