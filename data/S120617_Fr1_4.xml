      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here being come vnto my hands this last Summer (at my being in the Low Countries) a ridiculous and lying Pamphlet, touching this present subiect; for the loue I euer bare to sacred truth, and the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of many good spirits, who though they rest at home, as vpon their Center, yet haue their motions in the remotest parts: I haue publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed this little, but true, discourse of such actions and occurrences as haue been worthie the obseruance since either Armie aduanced to the field in the Countries of <hi>Cleue</hi> &amp; <hi>Gulick,</hi> (whereof my selfe haue for the most part bin an eie-witnesse) being loth to take vpon credit more then I might well answere, knowing well enough the danger in medling ouer-far in affaires of State, and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Princes, which only regard hath caused me to touch some things more tenderly then perhaps I would, desiring herein rather to resemble the corke, by swimming lightly aboue, then the hooke, by diuing too deep to fasten my selfe where I could not easily get wel off. So that onely I haue contented mee with the bare narration of what is past, euen to the last day of the
<pb facs="4"/>treatie at <hi>Santen.</hi> What is like hereafter to ensue, Time will determine, which I had rather he should doe then I, because I verily beleeue the blame will fall vpon him. Farewell good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whosoeuer.</p>
