      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Author's Preface hath occasioned mine. Wherein it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected I should give a publique accompt of this action. J had once other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise resolved. But it is the fashion. And therefore know (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that Evill is oftimes the (accidentall) cause of Good. Idlenesse invited me to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of my pen in some few loose sheets, which my fancy converted to the private vse of a <hi>beloved friend.</hi> Other end had J none. Sithence the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author hath beene pleased to impose that as a serious taske, which I had wantonly begun. Nature commanded duty and obedience, and so have J the glory of the time, <hi>To be in print.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Sed dic, <hi>Posthume,</hi> de tribus capellis.</p>
   <p>How doth the Authours Preface conduce to mine? Why thus. To many who perhaps will not
<pb facs="3"/>
at first consider, that this worke is but a Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or seeke advantages to expend their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, his may seeme impertinent. But let them know, that these Annales were first written, <hi>In gratiam Exterorum Res nostras noscendi cupidorum.</hi> So much witnesseth the first Latin Edition. Peruse it and finde it. J am but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, of whom, I hope, thou wilt not expect a dictionary translation. Neither quarrell the omission of some things, the knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to our Natives so innate, that now to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert them, were as bad as to farce with tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and make this little volume nauseous. Yet hath it lost nothing of its bulke, whatsoeuer it hath of its splendour, those defalcations being here and there in the course of the history sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with not vnnecessary additions, whereto the Authors approbation and consent was not wanting. As for errours of the Presse, blame the Printer, not me. If thou by this reape either profit or pleasure, thanke the Author, whose bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit it is that thou hast it; and that not tongue-tied, but more then single-languaged. Good is of it selfe diffusive, and he participates so much of it, that he cannot indevour an envious confinement of it. Farewell.</p>
