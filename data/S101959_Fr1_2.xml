   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Haue bene very vnwilling (good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader) to enter into these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies of Discipline, that haue now some space troubled the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. I remembred the wordes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> to <hi>Lot;</hi>
      <note n="1" place="margin">Gen. 13.</note>
      <hi>Let there I pray thee, be no strife betwixt thee and me, nor betwixt my men and thine for we be brethren;</hi> and did thereby learne that all strife betwixt brethren, was vnnaturall. I could not forget the saying of our Sauiour; <note n="2" place="margin">Iohn 14.</note>
      <hi>Peace I leaue with you, my peace I giue you;</hi> and so col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected how <hi>carefull</hi> we should be to <note n="3" place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note>
      <hi>keepe the vnitie of the spirite in the band of peace.</hi> Prophane writers could tell me; <hi>by concord, the weakest things growe strong; by discord, the mightiest states are ouerthrowen:</hi> and that made me loath to increase or nourish the dislikes and quarels that haue lately fallen out in this Realme, betwixt the Professours and Teachers of one and the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: yet when I sawe the peace of Gods Church violated by the sharpnesse of some mens humours; and their tongues so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, that they could not bee discerned from open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, I thought as in a common danger, not to sit looking till all were on fire, but rather by all meanes to trie what kind of liquor would restinguish this flame.</p>
   <p>Another reason leading mee to this enterprise, was the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my duetie to God and her Maiestie. for finding that some men broched their disciplinarie deuises vnder the title of Gods eternall trueth, and professed they could no more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
<pb facs="3"/>
the defence thereofthen of the Christian faith; and others defaced and reproched the gouernement of the Church heere receiued and established, as <hi>vnlawfull, irreligious</hi> and <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;</hi> (for what lees are so sower, that some hedge wines wil not yeelde?) I was mooued in conscience, not to suffer the sacred Scriptures to be so violently arrested, and ouer-ruled by the summons and censures of their newe Consistories; as also to cleere this state of that iniurious slander, as if not knowing or neglecting the manifest voyce of Christes spirite, we had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and preferred the dregges of Antichrists pride and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie.</p>
   <p>These causes of great and good regard led mee to examine the chiefe groundes of both Disciplines, theirs and ours; and to peruse the proofes and authorities of either parte; that by comparing it might appeare, which side came neerest to the synce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>itie of the Scriptures, and societie of the auncient and vncorrupte Church of Christ. The which wholie to propose by way of Preface woulde bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding tedious; shortely to capitulate, that the Reader may knowe what to looke for, will not altogether bee super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.</p>
   <p>The maine supportes of their newe deuised Discipline are; <hi>the generall equalitie of all Pastours and Teachers; and the ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Lay Elders with them to make vp the Presbyterie, that shall gouerne the Church.</hi> On this foundation they build the power of their Consistorie, that must admonish and punish all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, heare and determine all doubts, appease and ende all strifes, that anie waie touch the state and welfare of the Church. Against these false groundes, I shewe the Church of God from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> from <hi>Moses</hi> to Christ, and so downeward vnder Patriarkes, Prophetes, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, hath beene alwayes gouerned by an inequalitie and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie of Pastours and Teachers amongst themselues; and somuch the very name and nature of gouernement do inforce. for if amongst equals none may chalenge to rule the rest; there must of necessitie be superiours, before there can bee Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours. It was therefore a ridiculous ouersight in our new plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmers,
<pb facs="3"/>
to settle an ecclesiasticall gouernment amongst the Pastours and Teachers of the Church, and yet to banish all supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie from them.</p>
   <p>Some finding that absurditie, and perceiuing confusion of force must follow where all are equall, and no Gouernour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; confesse it to bee <hi>an essentiall and perpetuall part of Gods ordinance, for each Presbyterie to haue a chiefe</hi> amongst them; and yet least they should seeme to agnise or admit the auncient and approued maner of the Primitiue Church retained amongst vs, which is, to appoint a fitte man to gouerne each Dioecese; they haue framed a <hi>Running regencie,</hi> that shall goe round to all the Presbyters of each place by course, and dure for a <hi>weeke,</hi> or fome such space; for the deuise is so newe, that they are not yet resolued what time this changeable superioritie shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. With this conceite they maruelouslie please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, in so much that they pronounce this onely to be Gods institution, and this ouerseer or Bishop to be Apostolike; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they reiect as humane; that is, as inuented and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by man against the first and authentike order of the holie Ghost.</p>
   <p>Thus farre wee ioyne, that to preuent dissention and auoid confusion there must needes, euen by Gods ordinaunce, bee a President or Ruler of euerie Presbyterie; which conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because it is warranted by the groundes of nature, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and trueth, and hath the example of the Church of God <hi>before, vnder, and after the Lawe</hi> to confirme it, wee accept as irrefutable; and laie it as the ground-worke of all that ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. But whether this Presidentship did in the Apostles times, and by their appointment, goe round by course to all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours and Teachers of euerie Presbyterie, or were by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction committed to one chosen as the fittest to supplie that place, so long as hee discharged his duetie without blame; that is a maine point in question betwixt vs. Into which I may not enter, vntill we haue seene what the Apostolike Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries were, and of what persons they did consist at the first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of the Church.</p>
   <p>Certaine late writers, men otherwise learned and wise, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie misliking in the gouernement of the Church the Romish
<pb facs="4"/>
kind of Monarchie, and on the other side shunning as much popular tumult and Anarchie, preferred a middle course be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them of Aristocracie; thinking the Church would then bee best guided, when neither <hi>one, for danger of tyrannie;</hi> nor <hi>all, for feare of mutinie</hi> did beare the swaie; but <hi>a number of the grauest</hi> and sincerest, vndertooke the managing of all matters incident to the Ecclesiasticall Regiment. And for that there was no possibilitie in euerie Church and parish to finde a full and sufficient companie of Pastours and Teachers, to consider and dispose of all causes occurrent; and the people (as they thought) would the better endure the proceedings and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of their Consistories, if some of themselues were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee Iudges in those cases as well as the Preachers; they compounded their Presbyteries partlie of Pastors, and partly of Laie Elders, whome they named GOVERNING PRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYTERS; and by this meanes they supposed the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church would bee both permanent and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
   <p>To proclaime this as a fresh deuise of their owne, would be some what odious, and therefore they sought by all meanes as well with examples, as authorities, to make it seeme aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. for the better accomplishing of their desire; first, they tooke hold of the Iewish Synedrion, which had Laie Elders mixed with Leuites in euery Citie to determine the peoples causes, and that order being established by <hi>Moses,</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced it as a perpetuall paterne for the Church of Christ to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. To that end they bring the wordes of our Sauiour, <note n="1" place="margin">Math. 18.</note>
      <hi>Tell it the Church, if he heare not the Church, let him be to thee as an Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nike and Publicane.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Next, they perused the Apostles writings, to see what men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might bee there found of <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Gouernours,</hi> and ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on this sentence of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi>
      <note n="2" place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note>
      <hi>The Elders which rule well, are woorthie of double honour; speciallie, they that labour in the worde and doctrine;</hi> they resolutelie concluded, there were some Elders in the Church that <hi>gouerned,</hi> and yet <hi>laboured not in the worde and doctrine;</hi> and those were Laie Presbyters. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this place they made no doubt, but Laie Elders were Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of the Church in the Apostles times, and so setled
<pb facs="4"/>
their iudgements in that behalf, that they would heare nothing that might be said to the contrary.</p>
   <p>Thirdlie, because it would bee strange that Laie Elders e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie where gouerning the Church vnder the Apostles, no Councill, storie, nor Father, did euer so much as name them, or remember them, or so conceiue the wordes and meaning of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> vntill our age; they thought it needefull to make some shewe of them in the Fathers writings; least other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, playne and simple men should maruell to see a new sort of gouernours wrenched and forced out of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> wordes, whome the Church of Christ in fifteene hundred yeeres neuer heard of before. And therefore certaine doubtfull speaches of the Fathers were drawen to that intent; as where they saie, <note n="1" place="margin">
         <hi>Hiero. in episto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap> ad Titum, ca.</hi> 1.</note>
      <hi>The Church at first was gouerned by the common aduise of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;</hi> and <note n="2" place="margin">
         <hi>Ambros. in</hi> 1. <hi>ad Tim. ca.</hi> 5.</note>
      <hi>the Church had her Elders, without whose counsell nothing was done;</hi> yea, some of them were so forward and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to heare of their laie Presbyters, that wheresoeuer anie Councill or Father mentioned Presbyters, they straightway skored vp the place for laie Elders.</p>
   <p>This is the warpe and webbe of the laie Presbyterie, that hath so enfolded some mens wits, that they cannot vnreaue their cogitations from admiring their newe founde Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories. And in deede the credite of their first deuisers did somewhat amuse mee, as I thinke it doeth others, till partlie enclined for the causes aforesayd, and partlie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, where I might not refuse, I began more seriouslie to rip vp the whole; and then I found both the slendernesse of the stuffe, and loosenesse of the worke, that had deceiued so many mens eies.</p>
   <p>As first, for the Iewish Synedrion; I sawe it might by no meanes bee obtruded on the Church of Christ. for the Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall part of <hi>Moses</hi> law being abolished by the death of Christ, as well as the ceremoniall; the Tribunals of <hi>Moses</hi> must no more remaine, then the Priesthood doth. <hi>Moses</hi> Iudges were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to execute <hi>Moses</hi> lawe. the punishments therefore and iudgements of <hi>Moses</hi> law ceasing, as vnder the Gospel there can be no questiō but they do; all such Consistories as <hi>Moses</hi> erected must needs be therewith ended &amp; determined. Again they were
<pb facs="5"/>
ciuill Magistrates, that <hi>Moses</hi> placed in euery Citie to iudge the people, and had the sword to punish as the lawe did limite; Leuites being admixed with them to direct them in the doubts and difficulties of the lawe. Such Presbyteries if they frame vs in euery parish without the magistrates power and leaue; they make a faire entrie vpon the Princes sword and scepter, vnder the colour of their Consistories, which I hope they will be well aduised before they aduenture. Lastlie, that laie Elders in <hi>Moses</hi> lawe did meddle with discerning or iudging <hi>betwixt trueth</hi> and <hi>falsehood,</hi> things <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>vnholy,</hi> persons <hi>cleane and vncleane,</hi> or did intermeddle with the <hi>sacrifices or seruices of the Tabernacle,</hi> I doe not read; but rather the execution and superuision of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things and dueties belonged to the Prophetes, Priests and Leuites. So that laie Presbyteries vnder the Gospell can haue no agreement with the Synedricall Courtes of Moses, much lesse anie deriuement from them; vnlesse they will tye all Christian kingdomes to the Tribunals and Iudicials of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> lawe, and giue their Elders the sworde in steade of the word, which God hath assigned to Princes, and not to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</p>
   <p>The wordes of Christ in the 18. of <hi>Mathew, Tell it to the Church,</hi> which they vrge to that ende; if they were spoken of such Magistrates as <hi>Moses</hi> appointed, and to whome the Iewes by the prescript of his Lawe, were to make their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; then pertaine they nothing at all to the Church of Christ; but were a speciall direction for those times, wherein our Sauiour liued, and those persons, that were vnder the Law. If they be taken as a perpetuall rule to strengthen the iudgement of Christes Church, then touch they no way the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrions of the Iewes, or any other Courts established by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> Let them choose which they will; neither hurteth vs, nor helpeth them.</p>
   <p>The place of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> at a glimce seemed to make for them; but when I aduisedly looked into it, I found the text so little fauouring them, that in precise termes it excluded Lay El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as no Gouernours of the Church. for the Apostle there chargeth, that all <hi>Presbyters</hi> which rule well, should haue dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honor. His wordes be plaine. <note n="1" place="margin">1. Tim. 5.</note>
      <hi>The Presbyters, that rule</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>well,</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>Let them bee thought woorthie of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honour.</hi> Honour in this place is apparantly taken for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; as the proofes following doe import. <note n="1" place="margin">1. Timoth. 5.</note>
      <hi>Thou shalt not musle the oxe that treadeth out thy corne,</hi> and <hi>the workeman is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his wages.</hi> Now by no precept, nor example, will it euer be prooued, that Lay <hi>Presbyters</hi> had in the Apostles times, or shoulde haue by the word of God at any time, double honour and maintenance from the Church of Christ. Wherefore they must either giue all Lay Elders double maintenance, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> willeth, which they doe not; or shut them cleane from these wordes, which yeelde double maintenance by Gods law to <hi>Presbyters</hi> that rule well. What the meaning of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is in this place, though much might bee saide, and is saide of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which I haue omitted; yet to satisfie the Reader, I haue laide downe foure seuerall expositions too long to bee heere inserted, which I willingly permit to the censure of the wise, whether euerie one of them be not more consonant to the true intent of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> then theirs is, and as answerable to his wordes.</p>
   <p>If <hi>Paul</hi> in plaine words did not disclaime Lay Elders, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no right to chalenge double maintenāce from the church, nor other places contradict them; yet were there no reason vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the needlesse and iointlesse construction of this one sentence to receiue them. for by what logicke prooue they out of this place, there were some <hi>Presbyters</hi> that <hi>gouerned well, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not</hi> at all in the worde <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, which is as much as <hi>specially</hi> or <hi>chiefly,</hi> doth distinguish (as they thinke) the one sort from the other by a superior degree. doth it not distinguish as wel things as persons? and note so well diuers respects as diuers subiects? for example if we should say, <hi>Magistrates that gouerne well, are worthy of double honor, specially they that heare the complaints of the poore.</hi> Were he not very fansiful that would hence cōclude, there are <hi>ergo</hi> two sorts of magistrats, one that <hi>gouerneth wel,</hi> another that <hi>heareth the complaints of the poore?</hi> Againe, out of these spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>Counsellors that be wise are acceptable to their Princes, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such as are faithfull; workemen are rewarded for their skill, but specially for their paines; Pastors</hi> that be <hi>vertuous</hi> are to be <hi>wished for,</hi> but <hi>specially if they be learned:</hi> wil any sober man inferre that
<pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>fidelitie</hi> and <hi>wisedome, skil</hi> and <hi>industrie, learning</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> do not meet in one subiect, because <hi>specially</hi> goeth betwene them? Nothing is more common, then by this kind of speach to note as well two diuers qualities in one man, as two sundrie sortes of men; yea thereby to preferre a part before the general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising that part. As <hi>Teachers are to be liked for their learning, specially for their knowledge in the Scriptures; good men are to bee loued for their vertues, specially if they be liberall.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>In these speeches,</hi> they will say, <hi>the persons be diuers, as well as the things for some</hi> Counsellors <hi>be wise, that be not faithfull; some workemen expert, that be not painefull; some Pastours learned, that be not vertuous.]</hi> That prooueth true, not by any force of these speeches, but by the defect of the persons that want fidelitie, industrie and integritie. for the words rather imploy that both parts should be, and therefore may be found in one man before he deserueth this adiection of <hi>specially.</hi> As a Counseller must be wise, and specially faithfull, before he can be acceptable to his Prince. A workeman must be painefull, as well as skilfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deserue his wages. A Pastour must not only be honest, but also able to discharge his duetie, before he should be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteemed. And so by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words they may conclude, a Presbyter must not only gouerne well, but also labour in the word, before he may be counted to be <hi>specially,</hi> or <hi>most woorthie of double honour:</hi> other collection out of the Apostles wordes they can make none.</p>
   <p>And that shall wee soone finde, if wee resolue the Apostles wordes in such sort, as the nature of the Greeke tongue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth vs. The words stand precisely thus; <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>Presbyters</hi> GOVERNING WEL <hi>let them be counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of double honour;</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, SPECIALLY LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOVRING <hi>in the word and doctrine.</hi> The participles, as euerie meane scholer knoweth, may be resolued not onely by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue and his verb, but by many other parts of speech and their verbs; which oftentimes expresse the sense better then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue. As, <note n="1" place="margin">1. Timoth. 5.</note>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>Thou shalt not musle</hi> (thine) <hi>oxe treading</hi> (out thy corne,) that is, <hi>whiles he treadeth</hi> out thy corne, for after thou art not prohibited to musle him. So in the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which we speake of, <hi>Presbyters gouerning well are woorthy</hi>

      <hi>of double honor;</hi> well gouerning is the cause of double honour, neither is double honor due to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but with this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they <hi>gouerne well.</hi> Then resolue the Apostles wordes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a causall or conditionall adiunction, which is plainly the speakers intent, and we shall see howe little they make for two sortes of <hi>Presbyters. Presbyters, if they rule well, are worthie of double honour, specially, if they labour in the word; or Presbyters for ruling well are worthie of double honour; specially, for labouring in the word.</hi> Here are not two sortes of Elders, (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue) the one to gouerne, the other to teach; but two duties of eche <hi>Presbyter;</hi> namely to teach and gouerne, before hee can be most worthie of double honour.</p>
   <p>Their owne rules confirme the same. Those whome they cal <hi>Teachers</hi> or <hi>Doctours</hi> must they not <hi>labor in the word?</hi> There can be no doubt they must. Are they then <hi>most woorthie,</hi> or so <hi>worthie</hi> as Pastors be of double honour, who not onely <hi>labour</hi> in the word, but also <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>attend</hi> the flocke to rule it well? I trust not. Then Pastors are most worthie, and consequentlie more worthie then Doctors of double honor, because they not only watch to gouerne wel, but also labour in the word.</p>
   <p>If any man striue for two sorts of persons to be contained in these wordes, though there be vtterly no reason to force that collection, we can admit that also without any mention of Lay Elders. I haue shewed two interpretations, how diuers sorts of <hi>Presbyters</hi> may be noted by these wordes, and neither of them Lay, to which I refer y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Reader that is willing to see more; I may not here offer a fresh discourse of things else-where handled.</p>
   <p>The briefe is, <hi>Presbyters</hi> we reade, and <hi>Presbyteries</hi> in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike writings; but none Lay, that were admitted to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Church▪ <hi>Presbyters</hi> did <note n="1" place="margin">Act. 20.</note>

      <note n="4" place="margin">1. Timoth. 4.</note>
      <hi>impose hands.</hi> These be the dueties which the holy Ghost else-where appointeth for the president, and the rest of the <hi>Presbyterie;</hi> other then these (except this place of which wee reason) the Scriptures name none; and these be no due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for Laie Elders: vnlesse they make all partes of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stourall chage common to Lay <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and distinguish
<pb facs="7"/>
them only by the place; as if Pastors were to <hi>ouersee and feede</hi> the flocke <hi>in the pulpite,</hi> and <hi>Laie Presbyt ers in the Consistorie.</hi> Which if they doe, they allow onely wordes to Pastours, and yeeld to laie Presbyrers, both Pastorall words and deedes; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them authoritie <hi>to feede &amp; watch</hi> the flocke of Christ more particularly and effectually then Pastours doe, or may by their doctrine. Such labyrinths they leape into, when they seeke for those things in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sacred Scriptures, which were neuer intended.</p>
   <p>But were the word of God in this point indifferent, which for ought I yet see, is very resolute against them; the generall consent of alantiquitie that neuer so expounded S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, nor euer mentioned any laie Presbyters to gouern the Church, is to me a strong rampire against all these new deuises. I like not to raise vp that discipline from the dead, which hath lien so long buried in silence, which no father euer witnessed, no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill euer fauoured, no Church euer followed since the Apostles times, till this our age, I can be forward in things that be good, but not so foolish, as to thinke the church of Christ neuer knew what belonged to the gouernment of her selfe, till now of late; &amp; that the sonne of God hath bin spoiled of halfe his kingdome by his owne seruants and Citizens for these 1500. yeeres, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remorse or remembrance of any man, that so great wrong was offered him. I can yeelde to much for quietnes sake; to this I can not yeelde. They must shewe mee their Lay <hi>Presbyteries</hi> in some ancient Writer; or else I must plainly auouch their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistories (as they presse them) to be a notorious, if not a perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious nouelty.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ierome, Ambrose</hi> and others, are brought to depose, that the first Church had her Senate and Elders, without whose aduise nothing was done. but how wrongfully the deuise of Lay El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders is fathered on them, I haue declared in a special discourse, I wil not heere repeate it; onely this I say, if any of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that in the Primitiue or Apostolike Church Lay <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> did gouerne Ecclesiasticall affaires, I am content to recall all that I haue written of this present matter; if not, it is no great praise, nor good policie for them to abuse the names and wordes of so many learned Fathers, to the vtter discredite of themselues and their cause in the end.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>
Since then the Church of Christ, in, and after the Apostles times was not gouerned by Lay <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as this newe disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline pretendeth; it resteth that we declare by whom both the Apostolike church and the Primitiue after that were directed &amp; ruled; which I haue not failed to performe in many chapters, as farre foorth as the Scriptures doe warrant, and the vndoubted Stories of Christs Church do leade.</p>
   <p>In the Apostles I obserue foure things, needefull for the first founding and erecting of the Church, though not so for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing and maintening thereof; and foure other points that must be perpetuall in the Church of Christ. The foure extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary priuiledges of the Apostolike function were: Their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion immediate from Christ, not from men, nor by men; Their commission extending ouer all the earth, not limited to anie place; Their direction infallible, the holie Ghost guiding them whether they wrate or spake; and Their operation wonderful, as wel to conuert and confirme beleeuers, as to chastice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge disobeyers. Without these things the Church could not beginne, as is easily perceiued; but it may well continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. for now God calleth labourers into his haruest by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not by himselfe; Pastors take charge of those Churches that are already planted, they seeke not places where to plant new Churches. The Scriptures once written serue all ages for instruction of faith; and the myracles then wrought witnesse the power and trueth of the Gospell vnto the worldes ende. Wherefore those thinges had their necessary force and vse to lay the first foundations of the gospel before Christ was know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; but the wisedome of God will not haue his Church still depend on those miraculous meanes, which serue rather to conquere incredulitie then to edifie the faithfull; <note n="1" place="margin">1. Corinth. 14 verse 22.</note>
      <hi>signes being</hi> (as the Apostle saith) <hi>not for such as beleeue, but for such as doe not beleeue.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The other foure points of the Apostolike delegation, which must haue their permanence and perpetuitie in the Church of Christ, are the <hi>Dispencing the word, Administring the sacraments, Imposing of hands,</hi> and <hi>Guiding the keys</hi> to shut or open the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. The first two, by reason they be the ordinary meanes and instruments by which the spirite of God worketh
<pb facs="8"/>
ech mans saluation, must be general to al Pastors and <hi>Presbyters</hi> of Christs Church: the other two, by which meete men are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the ministerie of the word, and obstinate persons not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repelled from the societie of the saints, but also from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and hope of eternall life, respect rather the cleansing and gouerning of Christes Church, and therefore no cause they should be committed to the power of euery <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as the word and sacraments are. for as there can be no order, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in a common wealth where euery man ruleth, so woulde there be no peace, but a pestilent perturbation of all thinges in the Church of Christ, if euery <hi>Preshyter</hi> might impose handes, and vse the keyes at his pleasure.</p>
   <p>How the Apostles imposed hands, and deliuered vnto Satan, and who ioyned with them in those actions I haue handled in places appointed for that purpose; whereby we shal perceiue, that though the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of eache Church had charge of the worde and Sacraments euen in the Apostles times; yet might they not impose handes, nor vse the keys, without the Apostles, or such as the Apostles departing or dying left to be their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes and successors in the Churches which they had planted. At <hi>Samaria Philip</hi>
      <note n="1" place="margin">Act. 8. verse 5. &amp; 12.</note>
      <hi>preached</hi> and <hi>baptized;</hi> and albeit he dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the word and sacraments, yet could hee not impose handes on them, but <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> came from Ierusalem, and <note n="2" place="margin">Act. 8. ver. 17.</note>
      <hi>laide their hands on them, and (so) they receiued the holie Ghost.</hi> The Churches of <note n="3" place="margin">Act. 14. ver. 21</note>
      <hi>Lystra, Iconium</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> were planted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> at their returne forced to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the number of <hi>Presbyters</hi> in each of those places by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of their handes: for so the worde <note n="4" place="margin">Act. 14. ve. 23</note>

      <hi>impose handes,</hi> and <note n="6" place="margin">Tit. 1.</note>
      <hi>ordaine Elders</hi> in euerie Citie as occasion required.</p>
   <p>Herein who succeeded the Apostles, whether all <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> equally or certaine chiefe and chosen men, one in euerie Church and City trusted with the gouernment both of people
<pb facs="8"/>
and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> I haue largely debated, and made it plaine, as well by the Scriptures, as by other ancient Writers past all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that from the Apostles to the first Nicene Councill, and so along to this our age, there haue alwayes bene selected some of greater gifts then the residue, to succeede in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles places, to whom it belonged, both to moderate the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> of ech Church, and to take the speciall charge of imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands; and this their singularitie in succeeding, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie in ordaining, haue bene obserued from the Apostles times, as the peculiar and substantial markes of Episcopal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and calling.</p>
   <p>I knowe some late Writers vehemently spurne at this; and hardly endure any difference betwixt Bishops and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> vnlesse it be by custome and consent of men, but in no case by any order or institution of the Apostles; whose opinions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the authorities on which they builde, I haue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my small skill examined, and find them no way able to rebate the full and sound euidence that is for the contrarie. for what more pregnant probation can be required, then that the same power and precepts, which <hi>Paul</hi> gaue to <hi>Timothie,</hi> when hee had the charge of Ephesus, remained in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches throughout the worlde, to certaine speciall and tried persons authorized by the Apostles themselues, and from them deriued to their after-commers by a generall and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall succession in euery church and citie without conference to enlarge it, or Councill to decree it; the continuing where of for three discents the Apostles saw with their eyes, confirmed with their handes, and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> amongst others witnessed with his pen, as an order of ruling the Church approoued by the expresse voyce of the Sonne of God. When the originall proceeded from the Apostles mouth, and was obserued in all the famous places and Churches of Christendome, where the Apostles taught, and whiles they liued; can any man doubt whether that course of gouerning the Church were Apostolike? for my part, I confesse I am neither so wise, as to ouer-reach it with policie; nor so wayward as to withstand it with obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie.</p>

yet are they no causes to discredit the custome of the Primitiue Church in electing her Bishops to hold their places, so long as they gouerned well. for the same writer pronounceth of these very things, (setting the last aside;) <note n="1" place="margin">

      <hi>neque in istis quicquam est quod reprehendi possit,</hi> neither in these things is there ought that can be misliked. but in deede there is not one of al these diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities that can bee iustly prooued either by Scripture or Father. They are the conceits of some late Writers, that as touching the office and function of Bishops would faine finde a difference betwixt the Apostles times, and the next ages ensuing, lest they should be conuinced to haue reiected the vniuersal order of the ancient and Primitiue Church of Christ, without any good and sufficient warrant. The consent of all ages and Churches is so strōg against them, that they are hard driuen to hunt after euerie syllable that soundeth any thing that way, &amp; yet can they light on no sure ground to builde their late deuises on, or to weaken the generall and perpetuall course which the Church of Christ hath in all places kept inuiolable euen from the Apostles times.</p>
   <p>A few wordes of <hi>Ambrose</hi> are set downe to beare all this burden: but they are so insufficient and impertinent to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that they bewray the weakenesse of their newe frame. for <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh not one word either of <hi>going by course,</hi> or of <hi>changing after a time;</hi> only he saith, Bishops at first were placed by order, and not by election, that is, the eldest or worthiest had the place whiles he liued; and after him the next in order with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further choice. for that order which he speaketh of, (if any such were,) proceeded from the first planters of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and went either by senioritie of time, or prioritie of place allotted euerie man according to the gifts and graces which he had receiued of the holie Ghost. This wee may freely grant without any repugnance, or annoyance to the vocation or fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Bishops; let the Disciplinists confesse there was a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour and distinct charge of the President or chiefe from the rest of the Presbyters, as well in guiding the keyes as imposing hands; and whether they were taken to the office by election or by order, to vs it is all one; I hope the placing of the Presbyters in order according to their gifts in the Churches where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles preached, could not be without the Apostles ouersight
<pb facs="11"/>
and direction. and so long, whether they set such in order as were fittest for the place; or whether they left it to the discretion and election of the rest, we greatly force not. Howbeit the wordes of <hi>Ierome</hi> are so expresse that Bishops were made by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection euen in the Apostles times, that I see not howe they should be reconciled with their collection out of <hi>Ambrose.</hi>

   <p>For the manner of their succeeding whether by order or by choice, I make not so great account, as for their continuance. The Patrones of the late Discipline would make vs beleeue, that in the Apostles times the Episcopall dignitie or regiment of the Presbyterie went round by course to all the Presbyters, and dured a weeke or some such time, (for ghesses must serue them when other proofes faile them;) which assertion of theirs I knowe not whether I should thinke it proceeded of too much ignorance, or too little conscience. If the men were not well learned, I should suspect ignorance; if the case were not more then cleere, I woulde not chalenge their conscience. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they are, and the case so cleere, that in my simple rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I neuer sawe cleerer, nor plainer, (excepting alwayes the certaintie of the sacred Scriptures) let the Christian Reader iudge, for I dare not pronounce, with what intent a manifest trueth is not onely dissembled, but stoutly contradicted, and an euident falshoode auouched and aduanced to the height of an Apostolike and diuine ordinance, by the chiefest pillars of these newe found Consistories.</p>
   <p>It is lately deliuered as an Oracle, that vnder the Apostles there were no Gouernors of the Presbyteries, (whom they and we call Bishops) but such as <hi>dured for a short time,</hi> and <hi>changed round by course;</hi> and this is called <hi>the Apostolike and diuine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi>

   <p>And if he were not a man of farre more authoritie, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer fidelitie, then any that contradict him, yet haue we al the Churches of Christendome, &amp; their successions of Bishops from the Apostles, and all histories and monuments of antiquitie to concurre with him, that Bishops liuing in the Apostles daies, &amp; made by the Apostles hands, continued their places til they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither is there any man liuing that is able to shewe one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to the contrary. Let the Christian Reader then say, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not a vaine and false surmise which some in our age so mightily maintaine, that the Bishops which the Apostles ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to rule the Presbyteries, <hi>dured</hi> for some <hi>short space, &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by course,</hi> that superioritie going round in order to euerie Presbyter; &amp; the election of Bishops to gouerne the Churches and Presbyters committed to their charge, so long as they did it carefully, was mans inuention, and no Apostolike institution.</p>
   <p>The domination of bishops wil be their last refuge; otherwise, in elections of Bishops to continue whiles they do their duties, the best learned of them confesse, there is nothing <hi>that can or should be reprehended,</hi> onely they repine that a Bishop shoulde haue iurisdiction ouer his Copresbyters. And heere they are
<pb facs="13"/>
plentiful with places of Scripture, as if we went about to make Bishops, Lords and Masters ouer the Church, and all the rest to be their seruants. They alleage the words of Christ; <note n="1" place="margin">Math 20.</note>

Meane they by these places to prooue, that the Apostles had no superioritie nor authoritie in the Church of God, or that Pastours haue no power ouer their flockes? It were more then childish to impugne one trueth by another. They themselues do agnise that the Apostles had su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie and <note n="3" place="margin">

Superior and inferior degrees, if Christs wordes did exclude, no man might admit them or defend them as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. If the Apostles to whom, and of whom Christ there spake, did not withstanding his speech, retaine diuersities of degrees in the Church; it is euident our Sauiour did not forbid <hi>Superiority,</hi> but <hi>Imperie;</hi> not <hi>Pastorall,</hi> but <hi>Regall</hi> authoritie; not <hi>Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but <hi>Masterly</hi> preeminence; and that in respect aswell of the people, as of the Presbyters; <hi>Peter</hi> calling the people <hi>Gods he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage,</hi> and before and after naming them, <hi>the Lords flocke.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And how should it possibly be otherwise? for since the holy Ghost requireth the faithfull to <note n="5" place="margin">Hebr. 13.</note>
      <hi>obey their Leaders, and to bee subiect to them,</hi> no Scriptures do crosse the authoritie and inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which the guiders of Christes Church shoulde haue ouer their flockes; and God by his eternall Lawe comprising Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours vnder the name of Fathers, and assigning them the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due vnto Parents, we may not by colour of any wordes bereaue them of obedience and reuerence, no more then of maintenance, which are the parts and effects of Fatherly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and honour. So long then as wee giue Bishops <hi>no charge but Pastorall, no power but paternall,</hi> wee are not in danger of viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting either our Sauiours, or his Apostles precept; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this kinde of superioritie, may not bee called or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

to be Dominion nor Imperie; without wrong to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of trueth that hath confirmed it as needefull and healthfull for the house of God, euen from the first foundation of the worlde.</p>
   <p>They will easily grant fatherly moderation and Pastorall power vnto Bishops ouer the people, but not ouer the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; on this they set vp their rest, that no Pastour shoulde haue power ouer others of the same calling, and hope assuredly to haue the victorie. But they must first reconcile their owne contrarieties, they will triumph else before the conquest for ech Presbyterie, as themselues confesse, must haue a President by Gods essentiall and perpetuall ordinance. I aske now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God giue any man a bare title without any trueth, and a Regiment without all authoritie; or whether in Gods Lawe deedes and wordes concurre, and he be called <gap reason="foreign">

      </gap>, a Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; that is appointed and authorized by God to execute that office. The mouth of God intendeth not for mockeries as mans doth, and therefore the name neuer goeth without the thing. he is iust in his speach, and wil not vtter the worde that shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the hearer. If then by Gods Law there must be Presidents ouer Presbyteries, ineuitably there must be Gouernours and Superiours ouer them. If some must moderate the meetings of Presbyters and execute their decrees, of force they must haue power and authoritie ouer Presbyters; and so it is mainly conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent out of their owne positions, which they most refuse.</p>

   <p>If <hi>Timothies</hi> commissiō dip too deep for the Presbyters store (howbeital the ancient fathers with one consent make that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle a very paterne for the Episcopall power and calling;) yet the authoritie which so many thousand learned and godly Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops haue had and vsed with the liking and allowance of all Churches, Councils and Fathers euen from the Apostles times, should to no reasonable man seeme intollerable or vnlawfull; except we thinke that the whole church of Christ, from her first planting til this our age, lacked not onely religion but also vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to distinguish betwixt Pastorall moderation &amp; ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical domination; to which humor if any man encline, I must rather detest his arrogancie, then stand to refute so grosse an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie.

   <p>What I haue performed, the Christian Reader shall best per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue; if he take the paines to peruse it. All mens humors I do not hope, I do not seeke to satisfie. Such as are deceiued with ignorance of the truth, may haply by this be some what occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, if not directed to a further search; singular conceits that are in loue with their owne deuises, swelling spirites that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no superiors, couetous hearts that hunt after spoiles, when all is saide, will haue their dreames, if they can not haue their wils; these diseases are so desperate, they passe my skil, if it were a great deale more then it is.</p>
   <p>My purpose was and is, the peace of Gods Church, so farre as it may stand with the trueth of his worde, and fellowship of his Saints, that haue gone before vs with wonderfull graces of his spirite, as well for the greatnes of their learning as holinesse of their liues; and to that ende haue I so tempered and delayed my stile, that I might not iustly offend such as are otherwise

minded; vnlesse the refusing of their priuate fansies will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the heate of their displeasures. I haue alwayes had before mine eies, the most of them are brethren for the trueths sake; howsoeuer some of them fall to open enmitie for this humour of Iewish Synedrions and Lay Presbyteries. Let them reade; if they bring better, I am willing to learne; but I like no selfe-set assertions, as if all the worlde were bound to the very breath of our mouthes or dash of our pennes, without any other Text or interpreter.</p>
   <p>If I haue saide ought that is not allowed by the word, or not witnessed by the continuall and vniuersall practise of Christes Church, I desire not to be beleeued; I looke for the like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, if any man replie; not to heare the coniecturall and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue ghesses of some that liued in our age, but such effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reasons and substantiall authorities as may presse the gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayer, and settle the consenter. God make vs zealous for his, not for our wils; and so guide our labours, that we may lessen the troubles, and not ripen the dangers of Sion; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king rather how to amend, then how to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplie the rendes and breaches of Ierusalem.</p>
