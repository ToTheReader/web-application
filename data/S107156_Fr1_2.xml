      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EEM it not I beseech you (MOST ILLV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRIOVS NOBLE LADIES) any the leaste dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to your NOBILITIES, or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish to your VERTVES, that your humble seruant, and Secretarie, hath presumed to ioyne you, within the narrowe straites, and precincts of one, and that so short an Epistle, whom both terrene Dignities and heauenly Blessings haue so happily vnited in one most Noble STOCKE and LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAGE. He is not ignorant that the SPLENDOR of a DVTCHESSE cannot commonly be paraleld by the DIGNITIE and TITLE of a COVNTESSE: yet when he cōsidereth the RENOWNE of a COVNTESSE descended from most antient and Noble Families, Daughter to the Noble, and by Name and Discent most antient S. Iohn Tufton of Tufton, and before shee was wife to her moste Noble Father, wife to the noble heyr of the greate and antient L. Hungerford should any whitt eclipse, shadowe, or obscure the RADIANT BEA<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>MES of a DVTCHESSE▪ but rather by adding Splendor to Splendor,
<pb facs="3"/> make both more GLORIOVS and RESPLENDENT.</p>
   <p>Moreouer he apprehendeth a mutuall and long AFFEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION euen from the yonge yeares of the one betwixt MOTHER and DAVGHTER, as also the vnited hearts of WIFE and DAVGHTER, both embracing the most Noble Earle of Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of famous Memorie, the one with the LOVE of a WIFE towards her HVSBAND, the other with the AFFECTION of a DAVGHTER to her deare FATHER: Whose LOVE to requite, he with his owne hands stiled your GRACE, his DEARE DAVGHTER; and your HONOVR, his DEARE WIFE of whome he further gaue his most ample Testimonie and in these words: I WILL SAYE THAT THERE WAS NEVER MAN HAD A MORE LOVING AND VERTVOVS WIFE THEN SHE HATH BEENE TO MEE. And as your LOVE hath beene GREAT to this most honourable Earle, who was Discreet in his words, Prudent and iust in all his Actions, Charitable to the Poore, Affable to all, Faithfull to his Countrie, Gratious to his Soueraigne, Constant in his Faith and Religion, most beloued and honoured of all; and then whome noe Noble man of England was more affected, or more Generally honoured in his life, or more Bewayled and lamented after his death; So your VERTVES doe shine in this world with a most resplendent LIGHT, and are the DIAMONDS and PEARLES which adorne the RING of your Auncient NOBILITIE. And these his, and your Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call VERTVES, being grounded on the ROCK of a true FAITH, as they haue made the Earle, so they will make you CONSTANT SVPPORTERS of holy CATHOLIKE RELIGION; These being fixed to the ANCHOR of HOPE, as they haue guided him, so will they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you to the quiet HAVEN of eternall FELICITIE. Yea it is verily to be hoped that he by these VERTVES, is there alreadie arriued, whilst the one of you like a PHAROS, and the other like the CYNO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVRE with the FLAMES of CHARITIE, doe giue LIGHT vnto others, in this time of DARKNES.</p>
   <p>Wherefore (MOST VERTVOVS LADIES) to whome after the most Noble Earle (to whome this WORKE was first designed, and for whome before his death it was sett on the PRESSE) can I more worthilie dedicate these, CENTVRIES OF OVR ECCLESIASTICALL HISTORIE, then to these, in whome the Noble Earle still in renowme SVRVIVES? If you esteeme NOBILITIE ioyned with SANCTITIE, behold here LVCIVS, HELENA, and CONSTANTINE, three great SAINCTS,
<pb facs="3"/> three great PRINCES, and all great PROMOTORS and ESTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLISHERS of the RELIGION, which you imbrace. If you take pleasure to see the DAMASKE ROSES of MARTYRDOME, here is an ALBAN our PROTOMARTYR, here is an AMPHIBALVS with many more, all stout and valiant CHAMPIONS, Who haue sealed the TRVETH of our FAITH with there dearest BLOOD: They all were once PILGRIMS in this VALE of TEARES, as you both now are, but now they are glorious COVRTIOVRS in the Triumphant HIERARCHIE. If you followe theire STEPS, and imitate theire VERTVES and CONSTANCIE in FAITH, you may haue great CONFIDENCE to be Partakers of the like GLORIE: and in the meane time, your NAMES being prefixed before their HEROICALL ACTIONS, may impetrate theire PATRONAGE in all your corporall and Spirituall NECES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SITIES; and I shall pray to THEM, and to all the SAINCTS, and by THEM to the SAINCTE of SAINCTS to bestowe on you here all TEMPORALL, and in HEAVEN all ETERNALL FE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICITIE.</p>
