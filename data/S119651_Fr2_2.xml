                 <title>A reply against M. Gilbert Brovvne priest : Wherein is handled many of the greatest and weightiest pointes of controuersie betweene vs and the papists, and the truth of our doctrine clearely proued, and the falset of their religion and doctrine laide open, and most euidentlie conuicted and confuted, by the testimonies of the Scripture and auncient fathers; and also by some of their own popes, doctors, cardinals, and of their owne writters. Whereunto is anexed a seuerall treatise, concerning the masse and Antichrist. By M. Iohn Welsche, preacher of Christs Gospell at Aire</title>

      <p n="4">
         <hi>4.</hi> It is proued by the testimonies of sundry learned Papists, and great defenders of their Religion, that the Masse is not set downe in the Scripture, and instituted by Christ in the same.</p>

And thirdly, the authors of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Masse, who put to euery point of it, and in what yeare of God is set downe.

      <head>IN THE SECOND PART CONCERNING the Antichrist, these heades are handled</head>
      <p n="1">
         <hi>1.</hi> The reasons that <hi>M. Gilbert</hi> brings for to defend his Popes frō be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Antichrist are answered. Wherin it is shewed: first, that Antichrist should not be a Iewe, and repaire to the temple of Ierusalem, and the Iewes shoulde not receaue the Antichrist, as their Messias: next, that the Pope. suppose he pretends that he come in the name of Christ, &amp; that he is the Vicare of Christ, and the seruand of seruands: yet he is nothing lesse. He hes neyther his calling of God in his worde, nor is left in the roome of Christ: but hes entered in, not by the doore into the sheepefolde, but another way, as a thief and briggane, to steale and deuoure, and does no true seruice to Christ, but tyrannizes ouer his pure flock, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the princes of the earth. Thirdly, that the Antichrist should not bee one singular person, but a succession of manie, in the self same, Apostate kingdome and tyrannie. Fourthly, that for all his pretenses of humility and piety, yet he is an aduersary to God, and lifted vp aboue all that is called God.</p>
      <p>Secondlye, it is proued by all the markes whereby the Antichrist is discriued in the Scriptures of God. in the <hi>2. Thes. 2. Apoc. 13. &amp; 17.</hi> that the Popes of Rome are the vndoubted Antichrist, because to him only aggrees all these markes, and to none other. And first they are prooued to be the men of sinne, and sonnes of perdition, by their moste monstrous and abhominable liues, as their owne friends and flatteters, and Historiographers of the time, hes descriued them: a few are brought
<pb n="211" facs="131"/> forth as examples to proue this. Secondly, it is proued that he is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary to God, by comparing of his doctrine with the doctrine of Christ how it ouerthrowes his person, offices, Propheticall, Priestly and Kingly, and all his benefites, and all the meanes, outwarde and inwarde, of the knowing and applying of them: and that it depriues the Lord of his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne glorie, in communicating to stockes and stones, oyle and water a peece of bread, Angell and man, bones and ashes, and the moste vyle things that can be. And also howe it ouerthrowes the Sacramentes of Christ, and puts to others whilk he neuer instituted: &amp; the whole frame of his Discipline and gouernment, whilk he hes commanded in his word His officers, his offices, his Lawes. And hes put himself in Christs roome and hes made newe offices, officers, &amp; lawes, whilk the Scripture knows not of. Thirdly, that he hes lifted vp himself aboue al that is called God, or that is worshipped. First, aboue the whole Kirk, and all general coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels: next, aboue al Kings, Magistrates, and powers: And thirdly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Angels in heauen, and aboue them in Purgatorie and Hell: &amp; hes equalled himself with God himself, in his styles, and properties, and workes, and equalled himselfe to Christ Iesus. And hes also lifted vp himself aboue the God of heauen and his sonne Christ Iesus. Fourthly, that he sittes in the Temple of God as God, and so forth of the rest in the <hi>2. Thessal. 2.</hi> chap. and in the <hi>Reuelation.</hi> Whereby it is shewen, that euery thing that is foretolde of the Antichrist, is fully filled &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished in them: and that Babylon that harlote, that is set downe in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> is by their owne confession, Rome. Further, it is also prooued by the testimonies of sundry of themselues, and others, that the Popes of Rome is the vndoubted Antichrist, and Rome is that Babel.</p>
