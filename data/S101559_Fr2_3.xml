<pb facs="6"/>
Pilgrim, Stranger or Passenger, whichsoeuer, so as in all places whersoeuer he shall come amongst men religious, or at least capable of reason, hee might be very vvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and kindely entertained: and so indeed you must conceiue my intention was; but (not to apply to my selfe that saying:)
<q>
         <l>Who takes in hand a vertuous enterprise,<note place="margin">Petrar.</note>
         </l>
         <l>Fortune vniust gainst him will euer rise.</l>
      </q>
being driuen to dismember, and at last absolutely to omit, that which would haue beene most acceptable in my <hi>Traueller</hi> (that it might peraduenture more aptly concurre with the generall influence of his fatall name, which is silently to suffer and endure) and to extenuate the Worke, if not expressely answerable to your desire, yet inclusiuely, so you be carefully inspectiue, you may obtaine your desire: for in obseruing the whole but cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly, you may perceiue that my <hi>Passenger,</hi> in the first Dialogue, is instructed how to auoide idlenesse, the soules great enemie, and the very sincke of defamation, rather dedicating himselfe to vertue, the onely meanes to make a man immortall: In the second, not to liue like a Creature destitute, but as one with reason endued: In the third, to shunne extremities, and not to be poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at for miserable auarice, nor yet to be noted for a Gull and wastefull prodigall; and yet to retaine a pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trant vigilancie, and so without all fraud, to preuent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and worldly deceits: In the fourth, how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye on God, Vertue, and his owne demerit, not deeming all that which shines to be good gold: In the fift, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre all exorbitant worldly vanities, and greedy care of accumulation, like the large and spacious way which leadeth vnto hell: In the sixt, which is the first of the
<pb facs="7"/>
second part, to honour and respect not for flatterie, but of sincere humanitie and loue: In the seauenth, being the second, of the second Part, to be a vertuous Courtier, and a Seruant not to his owne particular interests, but to the honour of his Prince, to be prudent and wise, but not triuially gallant: to imploy his reuenues in vses truely honourable and permanent: to flye all base brablings and sutes, but yet to respect and obserue all vertuous Lawyers: and for breuities sake cutting off diuers other discourses, finally, to be a faithfull and seuere Guardian ouer his owne heart, to the end it may not foolishly be taken and ensnared with Loue, nor most vnhappily be made a slaue to feminine wiles. And yet notwithstanding all this, the better to satisfie both yours, and mine owne minde, and to make this my <hi>Traueller</hi> the more perfect, to the end in his trauaile, he may not onely be a discreet Gentleman, but further as one learned, that hee may discourse, giue counsell, reconcile friends at variance, and in his owne occurrents to discharge himselfe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably and with iudgement, you shall out of hand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue into your hands, another Labour of mine, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Monomachia,</hi> being the second part of my <hi>Traueller:</hi> wherein, in all points and questions of honour, how cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious soeuer, I hope to giue you full satisfactions: yea, and beyond any other, that hitherto hath beene written of such an argument.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, to the end that this my <hi>Traueller,</hi> amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest Honourable and vnderstanding Spirits, in great Courts, and in euery other commendable Assembly and meeting, as one experienced, graue and wise, may be able to discourse of matter of state, and to serue his Prince in euery important affaire: to this end I say, shall

come forth the third part of my <hi>Traueller,</hi> called, <hi>The Originall and foundation of State:</hi> wherein Laconically I will set downe vnto you, as well the cause, beginning, manner, meanes, and Art, of their conquest, acquisition, augmentation, and preseruation, as also the destruction of euery mightie State in this whole world. And because from a well-grounded State, both Religion and the Church deriues, so as by the celestiall high State, which followed immediately after the creation of blessed spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the Triumphant Church was ordained, and after the creation of this whole world, that Militant, as the onely meanes to honour God, and to be a strong bridle for euery vnbridled hmour: I will finally adde the fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>th and last Part of my <hi>Traueller,</hi> intituled, <hi>The religious Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie,</hi> wherein from the beginning of the world, I will briefely lay open vnto you, all kindes, and manners, and sorts of Religions, of euery nation in the World, wherein men honoured and adored God, or any other thing whatsoeuer, euen till this present day, to the end my <hi>Traueller,</hi> or any other man also
<q>
         <l>(Since to see other Lands we all affect) may clearely see,<note place="margin">Petrar.</note>
         </l>
         <l>That false opinions this world doe infect,</l>
         <l>And who himselfe from errour can protect?</l>
      </q>
And to the end he may easily imbrace the truth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish falsities. But by reason of humane nature, wee haue daily experience, that as humours and Genioes, so affections and Iudgement which oftentimes is vassall to them, and euery other thing else, doth vary and alter, I haue inserted into this present Worke many passages, diuers sentences, sundry no lesse pleasant then profitable sayings, and necessary aduertisements the more easily
<pb facs="9"/>
to allure euery mans minde, and if not fully, yet at least in a great part, to satisfie euery curious and noble vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding: and to preuent (so it be any wayes possible) all euill construction I might put into thee, I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured in my speech and phrases, as the most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and acceptable, to follow the more beaten stile and way, and which hath beene traced by the best Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
   <p>And if peraduenture any body thinke much, that in varying one and the selfe same word, I haue made vse of another diuerse from it, which in his iudgement was not to be vsed: he must vnderstand, that hauing obserued it in excellent Writers, I might iustly haue beene asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, blaming me vniustly for annexing it vnto the others, so as in this he must not censure mee, but his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitie.</p>
   <p>Besides this: if any shall iudge that I am but a careles Orthographist, in omitting too often the graue and sharp accents, or in occurrence, by doubling those letters which shold be but single, or in writing some single, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their iudgements should haue bin doubled: about this matter he must conceiue, that I hauing many times obserued good Authours to vary within themselues here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: I haue likewise in such wordes pleased mine owne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; touching the other, I confesse that the accent is taken for the note or sound, and as one may say the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, the sound thereof making vs to vnderstand the sillables, and the office of an Accent is to rule, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the word, so as it seemes, that as we cannot frame a voyce without sound, so a word cannot well consist, that wanteth Accent, this being as it were, the very soule and spirit of the wordes.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="10"/>Neuerthelesse, in that from my tender yeeres, I haue beene brought vp in continuall studie, and hauing in this time obserued the most corrected Prints, as that of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Manutio,</hi> as also hauing seene Verses and Prose, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the proper hand of most learned and rare Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and moderne Authours, as of Poet <hi>Guirino,</hi> of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quato Tassoes,</hi> of the excellent Philosopher and Poet <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar Cremonino,</hi> publike Professour in Padua, I doe plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue, that the crowning and garlanding of words with so many graues and accutes, is but (as a famous Professor of Italie told me) the meere curiositie of some Tramontanes, and of such in conclusion, which doe it onely <hi>vt videantur,</hi> that so they might be thought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy that wherein they were neuer brought vp. But the aboue-mentioned Presses, and those good Writers, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of euery one to be imitated, doe onely vse the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned notes, or markes of Graues and Accutes, in necessarie places; that is, where the Reader may be doubtfull, which is the Coniunction <hi>e,</hi> or the Verbe <hi>è,</hi> or to the end the Diphthong may be taken for one onely Sillable, as in <hi>più, già,</hi> or such like: or else to shew the difference betweene the feminine Article <hi>la,</hi> and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe <hi>là,</hi> as also in like manner, vpon the Preter-perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctence <hi>amò,</hi> being different from the tence Preter of <hi>amo,</hi> and of many other such like.</p>
   <p>So also in cases of doubt, where the accent should be placed ouer the first, or ouer the last Syllable, as <hi>amerò,</hi> or <hi>améro,</hi> the Adiectiue and the preterperfectence of the Verbe, <hi>leggerò,</hi> or <hi>leggèro,</hi> although the proper office thereof is to fall with the last Sillable, as in <hi>virtú, beltà,</hi> and such like short words, as also ouer the decorted Verbes, <hi>fé, potè, compiè, vdì, sentì:</hi> Then for the copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue,
<pb facs="11"/>
hauing heard and seene diuers rules obserued, with sundry distinctions, following herein the opinion of some Learned and Wise, I will euer preferre it before the Coniunction, it being his propertie to fasten and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne the sentence.</p>
   <p>Neuerthelesse I know, that let an Authour proceede with neuer so good iudgement and reason, yet the world being vitious, as it is, and euer hath beene, hee shall be but as a white to the arrow of euery mans tongue: for some being naturally replenished with a kinde of vitious emulation, and superstitious iealousie, they cease not continually to obserue anothers proceedings, interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all designes and malitious practises, by meanes whereof they may disturbe eyther the benefit, or the least sparke of reputation and honour that might accrew thereof: or else because euery one hath some particular light and vnderstanding more in one thing then in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and peraduenture in this specially and most of all: Or else it may be, because others like drowsie <hi>Tassoes,</hi> sleeping in the obscure darknesse of a thousand of their owne imperfections, yet for all this, they forbeare not to make profession of shewing light to others, being so puffed vp with philantie, and selfe-conceit, that like the Ape, they thinke any young one of their owne, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed soeuer, to be so perfect and beautifull, as it is worthy of all imbracement, and that their very wordes are like precious pearles: though indeede they rather resemble monsters of sundry kindes, their heads Guelfe, and their legs Gibelline, and they neuer speake, but their words be as baites vpon hookes, or twigges limed, and the better to colour their owne deformities, by ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishing anothers beautie, they are so dazeled, that like
<pb facs="12"/>
Mastiue curres, they neuer linne barking behinde ones backe.</p>
   <p>So that in this infamous profession, they farre exceed the worse kinde of Pharisaicall ostentation: and so sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting beyond all comparison, eyther <hi>Molorcus, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophron, Demogorgon, Anaxarchus,</hi> who for his detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and biting tongue was pestled to death in a brasen morter; foule mouthed <hi>Burchiello,</hi> wicked <hi>Bernia, Niuius, Carbilius, Pasquine</hi> an arch-type of the Pope, (for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing insensible and blinde in diuine matters, yet still with greater blindnesse hee will offer to illuminate those, that discerne all more clearely then himselfe) <hi>Francus, Bauius, Meuius,</hi> and wicked <hi>Momus,</hi> these miserable wretches goe groping, and sometimes on all foure, to set vp (as they doe) a faire shop at other mens cost and charge, and so making marchandize of anothers mans credit, by their owne diuulged and dispersed ignominie, they impudently seeke by anothers dishonour to set a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse face on the matter, and thus to put out their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest and shamelesse hornes, being so inamoured with such a miserable and base condition, that growing thus stone-blinde, they shame not in their tongues to carry the Gall of <hi>Rabilius</hi>; and in their chappes the poyson of <hi>Colimachus</hi>; in their mouthes the flame of Mount Etna, in their eyes <hi>Iupiters</hi> lightning, which he vsed against the Centaurs; in their words <hi>Lucifers</hi> darts, in their thoughts <hi>Bellonaes</hi> arrowes; in their Serpentine words, the filth and stinch of the Harpies; and in the opening of their mouthes, the bitternesse of <hi>Sulmo</hi> against <hi>Orbecca,</hi> commixing all their discourse with Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke Aloes: and yet notwithstanding these wide open doores, these vnwalled townes, these rudderlesse ships,
<pb facs="13"/>
these vncouered vessels, these vnbridled horses, doe not consider, that the tongue being a very little member, without some speciall cause, (according to the saying of <hi>Bias,</hi> and <hi>Hesiod</hi>) it should neuer goe out of that gate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni which (not without a great mysterie) diuine Wisdome, and Nature together, his ministresse hath enclosed it, amongst many other, to note specially vnto vs this one thing, that a man should giue himselfe to a vertuous speech, or a prudent silence: which by these men is so slightly obserued, that no Writer whatsoeuer can auoide the stingings of <hi>Zoilus,</hi> the spunges of <hi>Hoponace,</hi> the prickes of <hi>Archilochus,</hi> the gnawings of <hi>Momists.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And if most louing Reader, no man hath beene euer able, notwithstanding what Art soeuer hee vsed to this end, to keepe himselfe vntoucht of the detractours poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and venemous tongue, how can my <hi>Traueller,</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as it were, to all vexation and annoyance, scape free from this mans poysoned dart? Before hee opened his eyes in this world, they sought to see and censure him, to the end that as in the hands of one infected with the plague, euery thing how healthfull or sound otherwise soeuer it be, growes pestiferous and mortall, so being contaminated by their peruerse opinions, and by their false relations infected, euery thing is sodainely turned into Vipers poyson, the more easily to open vnto him a large and spacious way, to his perpetuall infamie.</p>
   <p>O Faith, O Religion, O Conscience, where are you to be found? In what close corner of the earth? in what profound bottome of the Sea? vnder what part of Heauen doe you lye hidde? that I may seeke and finde you out: I know this commeth to passe for a cleere testimonie, that as a flame can hardly be so
<pb facs="14"/>
shut in and enclosed, but that eyther light, smoake, brightnesse, or vapour will giue some notice thereof, euen so with great difficultie can anger be so couered, but that it may be read in ones countenance, and in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or else in a tongue that is loose, and like that of an impudent Harlot, babling, and incontinent. And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very requisite that hee who would sowe Thornes, should himselfe goe vpon them bare legged, and bare-footed: so let such a tongue be vnhappily borne in all ages; no lesse vnfortunate be it out of his owne neast, and amongst other strange Nations; neyther may it finde any other reward, then his owne hurt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice. Although for my part (though one should no more trust an infamous Detractor, then a wilde and vntamed Horse, and though sufferance may seeme to be a certaine consent and recognition of errour, or somewhat inclining thereto, so as some supposed it to be a kinde of distributiue Iustice, to be as it were a rocke to bad men, and an Harbour and Port to the good) this present life, being no other then a very hard warre-fare, and the vertuous tolleration and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iugation of ones selfe, is a glorious victorie, I am but too willing to pardon their tongues, marry not their hearts.</p>
   <p>But true it is, that hee is but foolish who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what belongeth to a Worke, yet makes it not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: as also another should shew himselfe much more foolish, who knowing what an errour publicke folly is, will yet commit it: therefore though in euery complete obseruance, which like the apple of the eye, must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected by an Authour, I haue not forborne to vse all possible industry, that no errour might be found, yet
<pb facs="15"/>
notwithstanding, many hauing past, you shall in the end of the Booke see them corrected: vnto which inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience hauing a very carefull eye, I remained all the last Summer in the Cittie, partly for this end, to the end that hauing vacancie, I might the more quietly and without other destractions, attend thereunto: but being surprised by a very grieuous infirmitie, it was a cause, that some things confused and cut off, could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a better forme, nor be set downe in more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible Characters: so that the <hi>Printer</hi> (notwithstanding otherwise, hee is no lesse a discreete then an honest man) being but a stranger in the Italian Tongue, in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie he was much troubled, also then this businesse came to be dispatched in vnfit and short dayes, and amidst mine owne great affaires, it hath ineuitably happened, that conformable to the issue of euery Worke, this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so cannot want his errours and defects, especially in two or three Dialogues first placed, but in the rest it hath not so fallen out, after I saw how the matter went.</p>
   <p>Although I must needes affirme, that it is not very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for an Authour to correct his owne Worke, both because apprehending well the argument, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Idea thereof deeply imprinted in his vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, his head goes before his wit, so as hee perswades himselfe, that it is the same in writing, euen as in his owne apprehension hee hath corrected and amended it; as furthermore, because an Authour being principally intentiue on the Inuention, to the production, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the conceits of the sentences, together with the concatenation of the whole, with all reciprocall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondencie, so peraduenture hee may not easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne euery errour, though in it selfe euident enough,
<pb facs="16"/>
so as finally the Authour in obseruing so many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as to inuent, compound, augment, elect, put out, change, correct, polish, set forth, to write, and write out, often, and oftentimes to recopie and renew the whole, growing now as it were faint and weary, it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth iustly with him, as it doth many times with a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and weary Passenger, who is apt easily to stumble and trip at those stumps and stones which are apparant enough, and euen against those that are much higher and more visible then the rest, the which peraduenture a wary blinde man would readily auoid and shunne: whereas a third, a stranger to such an enterprise, who peraduenture doth not so well know the beginning, the middest, the end, nor the principall obiect thereof, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so cleerely apprehendeth the whole scope of the Worke, hee may be more circumspect ouer euery word, more diligently consider of the same, and so better me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating thereon, and not being so much employed in his inward parts and offices of the minde, but fixing his minde wholy vpon wordes, when hee well vnderstandeth them not, hee earnestly considers thereupon, as also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes and corrects them the better. Wherefore I was very willing to haue left this enterprise of Correction to some other, but that for many speciall reasons I feared, by seeking to auoid some, to slip vnwarily not onely into these, but further into farre greater errours and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences. Concerning the Translation hereof into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>King,</hi> not being able of my selfe perfectly to iudge therein, I leaue the censure thereof to those that can better vnderstand it then my selfe.</p>
   <p>For the rest, I humbly request euery gentle and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Spirit, that he will call to minde how euery humane
<pb facs="17"/>
perfection is dasht with many imperfections, and all mortall vigilancie and diligence whatsoeuer, is ioyned with great carelesnesse and negligence, and which is worse, there is no remedie for the same, and therefore the nature of our present estate and condition being such, I must needes entreate you, to remaine satisfied with my good intention, and to accept of all in the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, especially it being onely my intention, to exalt Vertue, and to abase Vice, as also to loue and respect euery one conformably to his demerit, and therefore in the meane while,

         <l>And surging waues, beaten and drownde outright.</l>
         <l>With cheerefull brow these homely lines reuiew.</l>
