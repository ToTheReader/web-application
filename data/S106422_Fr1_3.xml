of our faithful and painful brother, now
published to the profite of many) are, I

      </gap> long to stand vpon, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare:
as well in respect of vs▪ that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
the gospell, in these breathing dayes, muche forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our selues, though we lacke not diuers crosses to put
vs in remembraunce, and to awaken vs, as in respect of
of oure enemies, who of late haue more threatned, and
blustered out against vs, then in many years before, crying
out of persecution when they suffer not for Christ, or for
any his causes: but against him, laboring thēselues to death
to ouerthrow his kingdome, (which though they burst,
they shall neuer (I am sure) be able to do) &amp; vndermining
his ministers most disloyally: whom he hath placed in that
highest authoritie, to execute his owne iust iudgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. It is wonder to heare what complaints they
make of persecution &amp; Tyranny, when for their iust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
they receiue the punishment due to their treasons,
conspiracies, and rebellions. They laye vs on, and yet
they crye out against vs, they complain of persecution, &amp;
yet them selues are the persecutours, that set themselues
agaynst the seruauntes of the Lorde, in all ages, against his
faithful minnisters &amp; against al professors, &amp; which is most
lamentable againste the holy trueth of God, yea, againste
<pb facs="6"/>
God himselfe, to whome they owe all duetie and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
But alacke this is a thing common together with
them and all other heretikes, that when they haue no
truth at all, yet they must pretend some, and though they
can neuer iustifie their cause, they muste at least a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>euer it,
as though they possessed it, and face vs out, to shroud their
idolatrous abhominations and curssed corruptions that
they maynteine and stand for, to their vtter destruction.
There cannot be a Traitor nowadayes executed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his demerits, (but fauouring their superstition,
which indeede is alwayes ioined with treason, to shake
the seate of our gracious soueraigne,<note place="margin">August. de Donatist. cap. 7. 8.</note> and to ouerthrow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

      </gap>fer for i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity,
&amp; for the wicked rending of Christian vnity: but
they that suffer for righteousnes, they are the true martyrs
in deede. If therefore they endure any thing at our hands,
they may thanke their owne vnquiet and hamering heads
that like (Moules, are alwaies heauing in their dark pathes
to marre the Lords vineyard) &amp; to ouerthrow the gracious
worke of the Gospell, which God will haue to proceede,
Maugre their heads, when they haue vsed all their treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
practises they can against it. Neither shall the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Agar, (if it may bee called a persecution rather
then a correction) be compared to that of Dauid, nor
that of the theeues to our sauiour Christes, whom though
the suffering made one, yet the cause did seperate. They
crye out of persecution, and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

prince or state, where the Gospell onely is professed
and mainteined (as it ought to be) by the lawes of the

howsoeuer nowe they maye learne at length by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

her royall sword within her scabbard, vntouched with
any bloud? Surely till they had like (if God of his gracious
goodnes had not preserued her maiestye) to haue set her
both beside seate, swotd, scepter and all: and if their diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
practises coulde haue taken place by rebellion at

brought vs againe vnder the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>r cruel &amp; vnsupportable yoke
of their Egyptiacall bondage: From the which, the Lorde
for his mercy sake deliuer vs. If they count it therfore any
persecution, it is a iust persecution against the enemies of
God, against the enemies of our state and Country. It is
also done in loue, to draw them from iniquitie, to reduce
them from errour, &amp; for the safegard of the whole polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
body. I will not speake of their persecutions, &amp; hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
butcheries from time to time: God shall giue better
opportunity one day and in another place. But I beseeche
thee (good Christian reader) marke what is deliuered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
persecution in this booke, then thou shalt both<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

learne what it is, and vpon whose backes it is like to light,
if they will be like him who is entred by the same gate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs. Neither let vs be discouraged, though it be in deed
our portion. For it shalbe a token vnto vs of our saluation,
but vnto them who are persecuters of perdition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
The reason is because Christ the Capitaine &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher
of our battell is with vs, and hath troade the pathe
before vs, vvith vvhome as long as vvee suffer, let the ys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues

hath forevvarned vs, to looke for them. They come not
by chaunce but by his appointment. They are for our good
and the cause being iust and Gods, according to his vvill

where nor whome, but a time shall come, they shall see
whom they haue smitten, &amp; tremble before him, for feare
of his iudgements. Be therfore of good comfort, &amp; reioice,
O al the Saints of God, though we passe thorow this wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

with mourning and teares, with lacke of liberty, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,

an aboundant haruest where we shall sit vpon the seates
of glorie &amp; be satisfied with it, when we shal be crowned
with immortality, &amp; shall see God, euen as he is. The trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
are short, though they be sharpe, and though they be
many, yet they are light, in comparison of that eternall
waight of glory. And you that are persecuters, whome the
Lorde hath not giuen vtterly ouer. Take heede whom you
strike. Thinke not to ouercome him whose power is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.
God vvill raigne in despite of his enemies in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest

became of them. VVhere is Decius and Dioclesian, where
is Valerius, Maximinianus and Maximius, where is Lucius,
Iulianus &amp; Aurelius? But you will say: these were ethnikes

you not ashamed to boaste of the Truethe, and yet to
