   <head>THE SETTER FORTH OF THIS booke vnto VVilliam Charke Minister.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T maye be (M. Charke) that you haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected now somewhat longe, or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse remayned in some suspence of this defence of the Censure, or reioynder to your replye. VVhich Cēsure, being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (as I haue heard) in eight or nyen dayes space at the most: this defence therof hathe now hadde the staye, more than of so many monethes, before it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to light. But the cause therof is easie to Iudge, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie to you, whiche (for the most part,) are priuye to the same.</p>
   <p>In generall, euery one can imagine by hym selfe, how difficult a thing yt is in England at this daye, for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique man to write any book: where nether libertie, nor rest, nor librarie, nor conference, nor beinge is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted hym. And in particular, thus muche I must adde, whiche you alredie in part doe knowe: that soone after the publishinge of your reply to the Censure, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor therof addressed hym selfe to a defence, and had in greate part dispatched the same, redie for the printe, in suche sort as the rigorous tyme of your persecution permitted hym. But God sufferinge at that verie instāt; that the sayd print so long sought, and muche feared by you; should be taken: there was taken, lost, and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ther-withall; not onelie all furniture there redy for this booke, but also for sundry other thinges, partlie printed; and partlie in printing; concerning our defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of trueth and equitie, against your falsehood and violent oppressions.</p>
   <p>This disturbance, and losse beinge fallen owt by gods most holy and fatherlie permission: and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Censure hauing nether tyme, nor place, nor bookes, nor leysure to begynne agayne, nor any hope of print when he should haue done the same: being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so necessarilie called awaye at that verye tyme, to a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce somewhat farof, vppon vrgent businesse: he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued


<pb n="2" facs="3"/>
vtterlie to gyue ouer the sayd attempt of defence, partlie vppon the difficulties now alleaged, and partly for that in very dede your replie (M. Charke) seemed sufficientlye to answer yt selfe, being so obscure in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, as most men without the Censure might not vnderstād yt: and so weake otherwise, as yt needed litle confutation of others. These were some causes: but in deed (as I vnderstand) the principall and cheefe cause was, for that M. Campian (the greatest occasion, and subiect of the Censure) was now also euen at that tyme fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>len into your handes, according as you had long wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: and therfore it was to be looked, that accordinge to reason, and all your owne promises, he should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed withall openlie, publiklie, and freelie: and so the cheefe matter of the Censure, and your replye (wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout any more writing) dispatched and taken awaye.</p>
   <p>But after, when it came to hearinge of the worlde abrode<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> how curteouslie you had vsed this learned man with tormentes, bothe before and after hys disputatiōs: and how without all indifferencie or law of reasoning, you handled hym in your conference in the Tower: &amp; how finallie you made hym awaye by cruell deathe, without any shew, or shadow of particular crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by hym, against prince or countrie: and that your selfe (M. Charke) as a conquerour of your aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, folowed hym in person to the place of hys Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, with bygge lookes, sterne countenāce, prowde woordes, and merciles behauyour, (for all these thinges were commonlie reported:) true it is, that diuers god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie men were moued therwithall (and the Author of the Censure, among other) to take in hand agayne the Answer of your booke: aswell for the honour of Christ hys martyre now in rest: as also for declaration to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> worlde, of what value you are in reason, learninge, and weight of argument by writinge: whiche are so fearse and violent vpon gods Sainctes at home, in deathe and tormentes: and so Pompeous in gate and speeche vnto the people: for gatheringe, or retayninge some credit vnto your cause.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="3" facs="3"/>This (I saye) shall appeare partelye by thys booke. And for these considerations was it taken in hand, after the late deathe of Good M. Campian. Mary yet, (as it was like enough to fall owt) your spyes, searchers, and other persecutours disturbed the writer therof, before he could end the same: as may appeare to the reader by the sight heerof. For this parte being come to my han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, &amp; perceyuing that the authour could not (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>or this present) goe forward with the rest. I thought it best to bestowe this vpon you, (M Chark) therby to fynde you occupyed, (yf it please you to answer it) vntill the other parte also come to be sett forth.</p>
   <p>Thus brokenlie we are enforced to deale, through the extremitie of tyme, as you see. VVherin, you hauing gotten the start before vs in the fauour of our Prince, you folow the same with such vehemencie, and strayt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as you allowe vs no one iote, ether of curteousie, or humanitie, or of reasonable indifferencie. You ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude vs from speeche, conference, writing, printing, disputing, or any other dew tryall of our cause. You watche, spye, searche, examine, and persecute euery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. You attache, dryue awaye, putt in pryson, rent on racke, put to death those whiche speake, or wryte, or stand in defence of trueth against you. You leaue no Innes, tauernes, fieldes, stables, barnes, douecotes, or palaces vnsearched for vs. And how then is it possible to answere you by wryting? Or what maruayle is there, yf we offer you some tymes halfe a booke for the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le? I doubt not but what soeuer extremitie or crueltie you vse (which shalbe no greater, nor longer than God will permit:) yet you are sure allwayes to be answered by some meanes or other, that God wyll prouide. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you haue had litle quyet repose in your intrusiō vpon gods Churche, we contynuynge styll our claym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and tytle. And heerafter you are lyke daylye to haue lesse, (as I hope) vntill your heresie be rooted owt again, as all her sisters haue bene heeretofore.</p>
   <p>It is a great argument to the people, that the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of your cause is now crushed euen in your owne


<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
conceytes, seyng you flye openlye, and without shame, all kynde of quiet tryall what soeuer: and with furye moue the magistrate onelye to violence agaynst vs. VVhich thoughe we be redy to be are with all humil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, according as God shall gyue vs patiēce: yet will we neuer yeeld to you therby in your heresies: but in the myddest of our afflictiōs will we resist your falshoode, more than before. This (I thinke) you sawe in the late martyrdome of good M. Campian, and his companions: whoe, thoughe they dyed moste ioyfullie, protesting their innocencie in all and singular the slaunders deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against them: thoughe (I saye) they protested pure innocencie therin, both in thought word and deed: and that, vpon the eternall damnation, or saluation of their owne sowles: though also they forgaue moste franklie from the verie bottom of their hartes, all their vniust accusers, condemners, tormentours, executioners, and you also ministers, whoe of their deathe and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes were the onelie, or principall instigatours: yet dyd they amyddest all that humilitie, modestie, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian charitie, detest with all possible vehemencie of their sowles, all and singular your false and fowle he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies: and so dyed moste constant, pure, and innocent martyres of their Lord &amp; Maister Iesus Christ. VVhose bloode I dowbt not, but will fight agaynst your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and impietie, many hundred yeres after bothe you are past this worlde together. And albeit, yf they had lyued (especiallie two of them) being indued with suche gyftes, and rare partes, as they were, (which with you were greate causes of hastenyng theyr deathes,) they might (no dowt) haue done muche seruice in gods Churche, and hurt to your cause: yet could they neuer haue done it so strongly, as they haue, and doe, and will doe by theyr deathes: the crye wherof worketh more forciblie bothe with God &amp; man, thā any bookes or sermons, that euer they could haue made. VVherfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, I can say no more, but that they were well bestowed vpon you. You haue vsed thē to the best. Our Lord &amp; his holy name be blessed therfore. And I beseeche hym

   <p>O M. Chark, how greedie are you of a litle vainglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? and how vayne are the wayes by which you seeke yt? thynke you that men haue no Iudgement in the woorld abrode? Trow ye not that many smylde in their sleeues to beholde this hypocrisie? no, no, yf you had parted with M.

And vvhat then vvolde you and your bretheren haue done abovvt these disputations vvith M. Campian, yf you had thought yt any vvaye able to abyde the vevve? And yet (as I sayd) you knovv the inequalitie, vvherby you dealt vvith that mā, being but one, vnbookt: vnprouided, vvearyed vvith impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

All this you knovve, and the vvorlde bothe knovveth and meruaileth at yt abrode. Mary vve meruayle not, vvhoe know your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. For that vve are sure, and dare auowe to your faces, that you vvill neuer deale vvith vs at euen hand, or vpō equall conditions, vvhile you lyue.</p>
   <p>And heere (M. Charke) because we are now fallen into this matter: I am in the name of all my felow Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques to renew our publike chalenge of equall disputation to you, and to all your brother ministers agayne. You see M. Campian is gone, whome you na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in this matter our onelye Champion. You see also that M. Sherwyn is made awaye with hym, whome you are wont to saye (for more abasement of the other) to haue bene farre better learned than M. Campian hym selfe. But how soeuer that was, bothe of them haue you dispatched, and therby (in your opinion) greatly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our cause. Yet notwithstanding we are the same men that we were before: yea muche more desirous of this tryall than before. VVherfore, we request you now at length, yea we coniure you, either for trueth sake, yf you seeke yt: or for your ovvne credites sake, yf ye will retayne it: that you yeald vs after so muche sute and supplication, some equall triall, eyther by writing,


<pb n="10" facs="7"/>
preaching, or disputing. There is no reasō in the worlde (but onelie feare) that may moue you to denye vs this our request. For the reason [of state] which you alleage (M. Charke) in your replye is most vayne. For what can a peaceable disputation graunted vs for religion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunger your state: but onelie (that you wold saye) that this disputation may chaunce to discouer your errors, and so make the hearers deteste your state of heresie? For other daunger there can be none to your state. And yf you had the trueth with you (as you pretend) whose propertie is, the more to shew her selfe, the more she is examined: you should muche increase your state, by this publike tryall. For that you shoulde bothe gayne more to your parte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> by opennyng the sayd trueth: and also confirme many of your owne syde, that now iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye doe wauer vpon this open discouerie of your feare in tryall.</p>
   <p>VVherfore once againe I saye vnto you ministers: obtaine vs this disputation, thoughe it be onelie but for a shevv, therby to hold &amp; maintaine your credites. VVe protest before God, that vve seek it onelie for the triall of Christ his trueth: for searche vvherof vve offer our selues to this labour, charges, &amp; perill of lyfe. VVe aske for our safties, but onelie such a vvarrant from her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, as the late Councell of Trent dyd offer vnto all the protestāts of the wolrd: wherof you haue the copie vvith you. VVee will come in what kynde &amp; number, at what tyme, to what place you shall appoint. Yf you will haue your owne countrie mē: they are redie to come. Yf you will haue straungers to dispute in your vniuersities before the learned onely: there shall not want. For your selues, vve gyue you leaue to call all the learned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of Europ for your defence. VVe will take one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie our owne countrie men, yf you permitt vs. VVe gyue you leaue to oppose or defende: to appoint questiōs: to chuse owt controuersies: to begynne or end at your pleasure: and to vse any other prerogatyues that you please: so that they impugne not the indifferencie of tryall. VVhat can yow alleage whye yow should not


<pb n="11" facs="7"/>
accept this?</p>
   <p>If you had leuer make this triall in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, than at home before your owne people, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you had: chuse you what protestant state you lyst, and procure vs therin the forsayd saftie from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and we will nether spare labour nor cost, to meet you therin also. Or yf this seeme hard, or lyke you not: then take you but the paynes, some number of you, to come into any Catholique kyngdome, or countrie, where you best please: And wee will procure what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie soeuer reasonable you shall demaund for your persons: And more then that, we will beare your expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses also, rather than so good a woorke shall remayne vnattēpted. And yf you can deuyse any other conditiō to be performed on our partes, whiche I haue left owt: doe you adde the same: and we will agree (by the grace of God) to fullfill it. If we offer you reason: than deale somewhat reasonablie with vs againe. For all the world will crye shame, and begynne to discredit you, yf you will nether gyue nor take, vpon so great oddes as heere are offered you. If you dare not venture with disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiōs: yet graunt vs certaine sermons, to encounter with you vpon this matter. Or yf that also be to daungerous: procure vs but a litle passage for our bookes: at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse you (M. Charke) shall doe an honorable acte, to obtayne licence of free passage for this booke, vntill it be answered by you, to the end that men hauinge reade this ouer, may be the better able to conceyue your answer, when it comethe.</p>
