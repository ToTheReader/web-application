      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the saying of him (Right Worshipfull) whom God did mooue you once to honour, with this selected text, <hi>Moses my seruant is dead,</hi> to your great praise, <hi>Grauis est &amp; arduus, si quis alius ex omni Theologia, locus is, qui est deformandis concionibus:</hi> by which (being vttered of a man of that learning and experience) I might be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what afraid to attempt the publishing of this Treatise, vpon such a subiect, but that I know it is acceptable to God (if we haue no greater gift to offer) to cast a mite into the Lords treasury; &amp; I haue had also the approbation of some for my incouragement, both in the Vniuersitie &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. A mite in a great treasurie is small in shew for encreasement thereunto, neuerthelesse it is some what, though but a mite. What I haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this labour for matter and method, it may by reading of it appeare: my labour hath
<pb facs="3"/> not beene little, my intendement good. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it is (Right worshipfull) I presume to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it you, as a poore present, to testifie my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and heartie thankfulnesse, for your manifold kindnesses and liberall fauours vnto me. I long ago offred it to your view, in a naked shape, and first conception, which euer since I haue beene better proportioning, and now haue thus clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed it as it is. If before this, I had prepared it, I had not so long deferred off, or if my pouertie could haue affoorded a better testimonie, as in will I can wish, it should most gladly haue gone forth, as worthily deserued, vnder the honor of your name. Accept (Right Worshipfull) this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and so looke vpon it, as you haue bene and are wont, louingly to accept of me: so shall you encourage me to further endeuors, and bind me still more in all dutiful respect, to acknowledge your professed and approoued loue and good will constant towards me; and to powre out my praiers to God continually for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation and encrease in all spirituall graces for euer. <hi>VVorsop</hi> this 16. of Iune.</p>
