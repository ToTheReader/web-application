      <l>As if your influence taught our Flow'rs to grow:</l>
      <l>Where still delighted you shall nobly move;</l>
      <l>Not like a sad Shadow, as they above</l>

      <l>Of ev'ry Ghost; but like a beautious Beame.</l>
      <l>The Lilly, and the Rose; which Lovers seeke,</l>
      <l>Not on their stalks, but on their Ladies Cheeke;</l>
      <l>Shall here not dare take root; nor yet the strange</l>
      <l>And various Tulip; which so oft doth change</l>
      <l>Her am'rous Colours to a diff'rent hew,</l>
      <l>That yearly Men beleeve the Species New.</l>
