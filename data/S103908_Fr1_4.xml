   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong all sortes of humane
writers, there is none that
haue done more profit, or
deserued greater prayse,
then they who haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to faithfull records
of Histories, eyther the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of mighty states,
or the liues and actes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
men: for by describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the order and passages
of these two, and what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents
hath followed what counsailes, they haue set foorth
vnto vs, not onely precepts, but liuely patterns, both for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
directions and for affayres of state: whereby in shorte
time young men may be instructed, and ould men more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
furnished with experience then the longest age of man
can affoorde. And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> reporteth that <hi>L. Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
when he went from Rome to make warre against <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi>
was altogether vnskilfull in Militarie seruices:
yet in the time of his Nauigation he so exercised himselfe
what with conference, and what with reading of histories,
that when hee came into Asia, by the iudgement and
confession of that great King, hee was preferred before all
the commaunders that were before him. Heerevppon
when <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> did deliberate of anye weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
matter, hee would especiallye take aduise of men
<pb facs="4"/>
skilfull in histories, and not without good cause: for if
(as <hi>Afranius</hi> saith) experience hath begot Wisedome,
and Memory as a mother hath brought it foorth; who are
to be better accompted then they whose memory is as it
were a rich storehouse, of the experiences not of one age
or Country, but of all times and of all nations. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is no great maruaile that <hi>Zenobia,</hi> who after the death
of her husband <hi>Odonatus</hi> tooke vpon her the state, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
insulted vpon the Romaines, but held the Arabians, the
Saricenes, the Armenians, and other fierce and intractible
people, in such obedience, that although shee were both a
woman and a Barbarian, yet they neuer stirred against her:
for she had perfectly red the Romaine history in Greeke,
and also had herselfe abridged the Alexandrian and all the
Orientall histories, whereby she attained the highest pitch
both of Wisedome and authority: for examples are of
greater force to stir vnto vertue, then bare preceptes, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as <hi>Cicero</hi> said that nothing could be taught well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
example. Therfore the Lacaedemoians (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)
did vse vpon feastiuall dayes to present vnto theyr Sons
certayne drunken slaues whom they called <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: that by
view of the vice they might learne to auoyde it, and <hi>His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menias</hi>
the Thebane, would shew to his Schollers musitians
of all sortes good and bad, instructing them to followe the
one and not the other. And this is that which the <hi>Apologily</hi>
telleth of a certaine Country woman, who being hard fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured,
and fearing least shee should bring foorth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
like her selfe, got many faire and beautifull Pyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which shee did dayly and steedfastly beholde: the
meaning whereof it, that by setting before vs the actes and
liues of excellent men, it is the readiest way to fashion our
qualities according to the same.</p>
   <p>Heereupon <hi>Cicero</hi> doeth rightly call history the witnesse
of times, the light of truth, the life of memory, and the
<pb facs="4"/>
messenger of antiquity. Heereby wee are armed against
all the rage and rashnesse of Fortune: and heereby wee
may seeme (in regarde of the knowledge of thinges)
to haue trauelled in all Countryes, to haue liued in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and to haue been conuersant in all affayres. Neyther is
that the least benefit of history, that it preserueth eternally,
both the glory of good men, and shame of euill. Some Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
doe deny, that glory is to be desired: for vertue
(say they) is a reward vnto it selfe, and must not be respected
for the vaine and titulare blastes of glory: yet in wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these things, they affect that especially, which they
especially depraue. And indeed there is no man hath so
horny hartstringes, (as <hi>Persius</hi> speaketh) who is not tickled
with some pleasure of praise: againe there is no man of so
flinty a forehead, who is not touched with some feare of
infamy and shame. Doe we thinke that the valiant souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
thinketh no toyle too tough, but boldly aduentureth the
hazard of all happes, because he is weary of his life? death
commeth by nature to all men alike, onely with difference of
memory with posterity.</p>
   <p>And I would thinke that Citties at the first were build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
lawes made, and many thinges inuented for the vse of
men, chiefly for desire of glory: which humour except the
old gouernours of common wealths, had thought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they would neuer haue fostered it as they did, with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes,
statues, trophies and triumphes, in which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it is but temporary and short; but in histories of
worth it is onely perpetual. This <hi>Cicero</hi> perceiuing he dealt
with <hi>Luceius</hi> to commit his actions to the monuments of his
writings: and <hi>Plinie</hi> the yonger did wish that he might bee
mentioned in the histories of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> because he
did foresee that they should neuer decay.</p>
   <p>But these are such as are not led away with a lust, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to flatter or to deface, whereby the creadite of historie
is quite ouerthrowne. Yet the endeuour to curry fauour
<pb facs="5"/>
is more easily disliked, as bearing with it an open note of
seruility, and therefore <hi>Alexander</hi> when he heard <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi>
read many things that he had written of him farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
truth, as he was sayling the floud <hi>Hidaspis,</hi> he threw
the booke into the Riuer, and sayd that hee was almost
mooued to send <hi>Aristobulus</hi> after for his seruile dealing:
but enuious carping carieth a counterfeite shew of liberty,
and thereby findeth the better acceptance.</p>
   <p>And since I am entred into this point, it may seeme
not impertinent to write of the stile of a history, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
what continuance, and what meane is to be vsed
in all matter; what thinges are to bee suppressed, what
lightly touched, and what to be treated at large: how crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
may be won, and suspition avoyded: what is to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
in the order of times, and discription of places and
other such circumstances of weight; what liberty a writer
may vse in framing speeches, and in declaring the causes,
counsailes and euentes of thinges done: how farre he must
bend himselfe to profit: and when and how he may play
vpon pleasure, but this were too large a field to enter into:
therefore least I should run into the fault of the <hi>Mindians,</hi>
who made their gates wider then their towne, I will here
close vp; onely wishing that all our English histories were
drawne out of the drosse of rude and barbarous Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish:
that by pleasure in reading them, the
profit in knowing them, myght
more easily bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned.</p>
