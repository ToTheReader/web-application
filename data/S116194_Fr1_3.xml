      <hi>To the Honourable, and</hi> noble Earle Lewys a Seyn, Earle in <hi>Witgenstein, and Lorde in Homburge,</hi> chiefe Gouernour of the Pals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue his Court, Peter Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quine sendeth gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Lord.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      <hi>Am persuaded with some of my friendes often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations (noble Earle) to suffer to bee published, suche thinges as I haue thought vpon, touching the newe order of Monks, which Italy an other Affricke in this kinde, hath lately brought into Christendome. For sithens I hard both of the title wherewith this newe army of Satan bewtifieth it selfe, as also the suttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with which it insinuateth it selfe to the worlde: many thoughtes entred into my minde, as well of the continuall hatred of this enemy against Christ: as of his craft, and power in assaulting the Church. For</hi>
      <note place="margin">The considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Satans continuall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and craft against the</note>
      <hi>as he sheweth a singular wylines in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises: So in the execution, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof, hee declareth a maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/>
      <hi>power, wherewith he is endued: the</hi>
      <note place="margin">Church profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the godly.</note>
      <hi>earnest meditation, and consideration whereof, I thinke to be a great helpe, and furtherance vnto godlines. VVherefore I suffered my selfe the rather to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, to communicate to the gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (for others I make no account of,) such things as came into my minde. And whereas I see the custome of dedicating, and inscribing vnto some man newe workes, to haue bene receiued of all men: and the same to be both ancient, and not vngodly, it may be perceiued by the onlie example of our Euangelist Luke: who</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 4. Act. 1. 3.</note>
      <hi>doubted not to dedicate his historie of the Gospell, and the Actes of the Apostles, to a man which in deed loued God, &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines: I thought good to follow him. Now while I considered, vnto whom I shoulde offer this my labour, who might bee not so much a Patron, as an indifferent iudge thereof: you especially (noble Earle) for your singular godlines, learning, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, ioyned with great wisedome came vnto my minde. For I knowe your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be such, and so sound: that those which professe them selues to loue, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the trueth, and godlines: may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
      <pb facs="10"/>
      <hi>and worthilie rest in him. Therefore I trust, you will accept the same, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your curtesie, with the like minde, I present it vnto you: that is to say sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and well meaning. And so you shall haue me now alreadie sundry wayes indebted vnto you for your sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular gentlenes, hereafter most beholding vnto you.</hi>
