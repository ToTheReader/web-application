Euen so I with the sayd poore man, which am neither indued with any of Croesus riches, Platoes skill, nor Tullies eloquence, am bold (yet presuming vpon your good graces like clemē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie) who deme it, I doubt not, no lesse part of magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and heroicall vertue, to accept louingly small pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, then to giue great, to offer vnto you this simple present: crauing, that albeit on my part I deserue none or very smal praise, who haue but only collected out of other the Sermons of Barnardine Occhine, these certein of Faith, Hope, and Charitie, and translated them out of the Italian, into our maternall tongue: yet that for the works sake, both bicause that of the said argumēt, there is none other, or those very rare workes extant before this, and also bicause that in these sayd Sermons, is very

largely, excellently, and learnedly intreated of the three speciall pointes of true Christianitie, which is the very summe of pure and perfect godlynesse, your L. woulde not denie to take on you the Patronage thereoff. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the foresaid author of these sayd Sermons, I wil say little: Only this is reported of him, that in his latter yeares (how so euer it fell so out I wot not) but he by his fall declared manifestly what and how vehement the frailtie of humaine nature is, and how prone wee bee to decline from God and his truth, &amp; to fall headlong into the snares of Sathan, if we be left vnto our selues neuer so little: but yet certaine it is, that once he was zealous, both in preaching and writing, and many of the workes by him written, doe declare that he was nothing inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in learning, yea, I might saye, in perfect iudgement, vnto the best in his time, I praye God, that his fall may serue for a spurre to all such as shall reade or heare of him, to warne them, that they neglect not the grace of GOD beeing offered. As for the translating heereoff, I did not rashly enterprise the same, without the aduice and instigation of such as be both learned and wise, who iudged it as well as I, a worke worthy the publishing, &amp; to be requisite and necessary. Thus trusting that your gratious Lordships will vouchsafe the reading of these sayd Sermons, with patience if therein chaunce to be any faults escaped either by the Printer, or by me the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator, and will accept the same friendly, according to your notable and milde vertuousnesse, I wish vnto your worthinesse condigne bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, &amp; eternall glory in the lyfe to come.</p>
