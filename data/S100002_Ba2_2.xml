   <head>THE FRENCH STATIONER TO the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendly Reader, here I giue thee the third Edition of this excellent Treatise of the Court, sith I haue found it very pleasing and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thee, except onely to some who found fault, that they were frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as they say) of the Marginall Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the second Edition, which indeede the Author himselfe had carefully and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inserted, rather by graue Authorities to confirme his opinion in the matters he alleaged and treated of, then that it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise needfull. Wherefore to content both the wise and curious, I haue imprinted and anexed them by themselues at the end of the last booke informe of Annotations; assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my selfe, that if thou prie narrowly into them, thou shalt find them more corrected</hi>
      <pb facs="228"/>
      <hi>and reformed, and better rangd and ranck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their proper places, with their true col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of passages, then they were in the first Originall which I recouered, and also in many places augmented and illustrated far richer, then in any of the precedent Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereof I thought good to aduertise thee, that thereby thou accept and take in good part the care and diligence which I haue had to please thee, and to giue, thee full satisfaction in all points which concerne my selfe.</hi>
