   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER, grace and peace from Christ our Lord &amp; Saviour.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo sorts of adversaries, the Church still hath among men. The one, of such as be without: the other, of such as arise from within the Church it self. Both heavie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: but the latter, far the more grievous, many wayes. By both of them haue we (as others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs) ben exercised, a long time, and in straunge maner. Yet in and against them all, hath the Lord by his power and of his mercy hitherto preserved vs, and I trust will so do vnto the end.</p>
   <p>Of late hath risen vp one <hi>Thomas White,</hi> despitefully reviling vs, and wickedly blaspheming the Name and tabernacle of the Lord. A man, that was himself here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore separated from the Church of England, holding the Prelacy Ministery worship and confusion thereof to be antichristian: VVho also was a joyned member of a Church in the VVest parts of England professing the same faith with vs: And afterward coming over to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and desiring to be partaker of the Lords supper with vs, did in our publick meeting before vs all, with his owne mouth, testify his consent with vs in the same faith we professe: From which he is now revolted: and of which he is become a notable adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie: setting himself tooth and nayle (what he can) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs and our cause: and that both privately &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly, as now himself hath manifested to the world.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>So as in himself (though it may seem straunge) are found both <hi>the extremities,</hi> whereof he speaketh in his Preface, <hi>which bring no small annoyance to the Church of God, hypocrisie, and prophanenes.</hi> His <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> now layd open, in the particulars aforesaid, and many other knowen vnto vs concerning him. His <hi>prophanenes,</hi> plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, both in forsaking the truth of Christ (as Esau sold his birthright for a messe of pottage) and in oppugning it in this maner:<note place="margin">
         <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.33.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16.</note> which sheweth in him a despising, if not a despiting also of the trueth: as Esau contemned the birthright, when he had sold it.</p>
   <p>And thus <hi>the instance,</hi> which he would falsely give in others, may fitly be observed in himself, for both the extremities aforesaid: As also that <hi>howsoever they seem to differ the one from the other, yet indeed they strengthen &amp; harden each other, with a mutuall reciprocation, and proceed also the one from the other, howsoever for a while envy do cloak it self vnder the name of zeale &amp;c.</hi> VVhich that it may yet the better appeare both in and from himself, I will here set down a letter of his, written while he held our cause, to a Minister of the Church of England: And (to vse his owne wordes) as Christ alleadged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pharisees,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Whites Discov. pag.</hi> 4.</note> the example of their owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they might be their iudges: so will I against himself his own writing &amp; dealing, that they (as his children) may be his judges. The letter is this which followeth, taken from his own originall copie.</p>

            <head>A letter written by Thomas VVhite, to Mr I. A. Minister at M. in VViltshire.</head>

                  <bibl>

                  <p>Oh let the malice of the wicked come to an end, but guide thou the just. Deliver me from the wicked doers, and save me from the bloudy men. The proud have laid a snare for me, and spred a net with cords in my pathway, and set grennes for me. Selah.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>Sir, the pillars of the kingdome of darknes haue ben especially three, ignorance, falsehood, and violence. How far your self have waded with others in these, in your late dealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, by sermons conference &amp; letters, let the sequele shew.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the first, you in conference at W.VV. would vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prove the reading Ministery to be a true Ministery,<note place="margin">Ignorance.</note> though you refused to iustify your owne, and that by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Whosoever preaches the Gospell is a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, but the reading Minister preach the Gospell, Therefore a true Minister.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For answer to your argumēt, I denyed the first propositiō, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in that sence as you took <hi>preaching</hi> for any publishing of the Gospel, which you presently left without defence. But if the reading Ministery be a true Ministery, then is it the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, and if it be the ordinance of God, then may not the Magistrate remove such a Ministery vnder any pretence without sinne. An ignorant Proctor, for an ignorant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, an vnfit tyme for such a doctrine of desolation, to keep darknes still in the Land, when the Lord hath shaken his sword against it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your ignorance further appeares in the expounding of the parable you entreated on <hi>Math. 13.24.1.</hi> In expounding
<pb facs="4"/>
(<hi>field</hi>) for the Church, whē as, though there by (<hi>kingdome of heaven</hi>) be meant the Church, yet by (<hi>field</hi>) must be meant <hi>the world,</hi> for the kingdome of heavē is in the (<hi>field</hi>) except the Church should be in the Church, or our Saviours exposition were vntrue, <hi>verse 38.</hi> where <hi>field</hi> is expounded to be the <hi>world.</hi> 2. In that you would vndertake to expoūd a dark para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not by playne places of Scripture, but contrary to the tenour of the Scriptures, and ordinance of God both in Church &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, for if by (<hi>tares</hi>) be meant open offenders, which may not be plucked vp, then may not open offenders be cast out in the Church, nor put to death by the Magistrate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You said in conference <hi>that all that preached the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> Act. 8.4. <hi>had extraordinary gifts,</hi> which you went about thus to prove. <hi>Philip.</hi> Act. 8.5. <hi>had extraordinary gifts, therefore all the rest had.</hi> Which argument you could not then nor ever will be able to prove, the very recitall of it is sufficient answer vnto it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And your insufficiency was even confessed by <note n="*" place="margin">Mr Sedg. to Mr Pow.</note> one of your owne fellowes (as I heard) who when he heard that you were to preach on that parable, said that he marvelled that you would vndertake it being so vnfit: he would some more suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient man would vndertake it: with many such words tending to the like effect.</p>
            <p>Thus have you shewed your self not alone ignorāt, &amp; so acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged after a sort by some of your selves, but also are become an vpholder and pleader for darknes in others. But if your dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling had ben alone of ignorance your fault had not ben so great, but you have added falsehood &amp; deceit therevnto, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="4"/>1. In that you were not ashamed openly in the pulpit (which you made the chaire of falsehood) to teach that <hi>excōmunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō had no ground from the 18. of Math.</hi> contrary to the coherence, drift, circumstances, consequence of that scripture,<note place="margin">Falsehood.</note> &amp; by cōference also with other Scriptures: as shalbe shewed if you will vndertake the defence of your own doctrine. In that scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is shewed a power which Christ hath given to his Church, <hi>ver. 17.20.</hi> for the removing out of their communion, ver. <hi>17.</hi> such as remayne vnrepentant and obstinate in their sinnes, ver. <hi>16.17.</hi> and therefore excommunication. To what end should this doctrine tend, if not to bereave the Church of that power which Christ hath left for the sweeping of vncleannes out of the house of God. But this shall be further shewed, from whose breasts you suckt this poisoned milk, which now you give others to drinck: if you will not leave the doctrine to the wide world without defence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that you trussed vp another false doctrine on the same Scripture, <hi>that the party offēder Mat. 18.17. should be an heathē &amp; publican only to the party first offēded, not to the whole Church:</hi> Whē as the whol Church hath as much cause to be offended as the party that was first offended, yea &amp; more cause thē that party had at first to be offended, by reason of the continuance in his sinne, which the offender hath added to his former sinne. If you had vnderstood what had bene meant by (<hi>trespasse,</hi> verse <hi>15</hi>) you would not haue thus abused this Scripture: as may also be further shewed. In this point, one of your Ministers,<note place="margin">Mr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> but of greater wisdome &amp; discretion then your self hath signifyed his contrary iudgment to you thereon (as I have heard) as knowing I doubt not the falsehood and vanity
<pb facs="5"/>
of your assertion thereon. Yea I dare vndertake that many of your our owne Ministers of best reformed iudgments, will be ashamed of these black drops which falls from your lipps.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In that you published in like sort that <hi>though open of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders did communicate with true Christians, yet were they not defiled thereby,</hi> traducing Mr Iohns: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> affirming the contrary. And yet when you came to the triall of it in conference between you and my self, you said your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was of a true Christian in the sight of God, not of a true Christian in the sight of men, as he is a member of the visible Church, and that such a Christian could not sinne or be defiled with sinne in that he was regenerate or borne of God, which was never the question betweene vs, and so a true Christian did not sinn though he should commit Idolatry, Adultery, or the like, in that sence that you tooke sinning: Yea a true Christian might as much be defiled with sinne in communicating with open offenders, as by committing adultery, for any thing you have said in that conference, which is vnder your hand. This was your miserable shifting, I feare against the light of your conscience. Yet Mr Ies. a few dayes after, in a conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Mr Pow. and himself at Mr Bayl. on the same question took it in an other sense, yea in that sence, as which you said you meant not, neither could I bring you vnto it, as may appeare in that conference. Such confusion of languages doth well become the builders of Babell.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For that in your letter to <hi>Mr St.</hi> S.W.W.N. dated the 20. of Ian: 1603. you would vndertake, though no other would assist you, yet your self, by word, or writing, or howsoever, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whomsoever, to iustify <hi>your Ministerie, doctrine, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb facs="5"/>
and yet by word in conferring you refused to iustify your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, whē you were provoked therevnto: yea when I offred to prove it false in those particulars you mentioned, and to be separated from. I offred also to prove your doctrine false on the <hi>18. of Mat. and 13. of Mat.</hi> but you refused. I desired that I might propose one argument concerning the question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween vs, but you would deale no further, except you might put downe some proof further of that which we never doubted of: viz: <hi>that a true Christian in the sight of God did not sinne in the regenerate part as he was borne of God.</hi> Was this timorous &amp; fearefull dealing answerable to your bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basted boastings, let others iudge. These be the doctrines of desolation which you do scatter: Let others now iudge what cause we haue to account you a false prophet, and they in mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable case that are led by such blind guides. Did you not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to wish in the pulpit <hi>that the Lord would stop your mouth if you spake not the truth.</hi> Your dealing hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed vs, and bene a meanes (through Gods goodnes) to gaine others to the trueth we professe, and for your self remember se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you care not what you teach, nor how you take the name of God in vaine, that which is written, Ion. 2.8. that <hi>they that wayt vpon lying vanities forsake their owne mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And yet least the measure of your iniquity were not full already,<note place="margin">Violence.</note> you add violence &amp; persecution to your former evill dealing. When you are not able to stand by the word you try whether you can suppresse vs by the sword. <seg rend="sup">1</seg> Your self would not suffer Mr Pow. to make answer to you at Slaughtens. fearing least your falsehood should be discovered thereby. <seg rend="sup">2</seg> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Mr Ies. by letters intreated him not to make you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb facs="6"/>
publikly, that you might speak what you would without controlement. <seg rend="sup">3</seg> And seing these meanes would not prevayle, your self to shew whose servant you are, with others went vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine &amp; againe as if much paynes had bene too little to procure a warrant to attach him, &amp; Will. We. told Mr Pow. that Mr Aw. was the procurer of the warrant. Thus do you by falsehood &amp; violence seek to vphold your ruinated kingdome, when truth &amp; verity hath forsaken her. And you shew your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in deed to be an Edomite, red with bloud, <hi>Ob. 1.10.</hi> like the scarlet coloured beast, who hath a mouth like a Dragon. <seg rend="sup">4</seg> Your associate Mr At. could tell me, <hi>that an other place was fitter for me,</hi> meaning the prison▪ To whō I answered, that if I had the gift of dissembling which he had, to subscribe against my conscience as he did (I told him then whē &amp; wher) I might live longe enough, &amp; inioy Achans wedge, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self doth without abridgement of liberty. You of all others may be ashamed to dissemble thus with the Prelates, knowing how basely you have thought &amp; spoke of them: <seg rend="sup">5</seg> You Mr Aw. could call vs <hi>brethren,</hi> &amp; afterward being vrged for your dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, you could expound your meaning that <hi>it was in respect of creation</hi>: and so Cayn, Ismaell; &amp; Antichrist, be your brethren too, yea &amp; nearer of kin then so, by persecution too. <seg rend="sup">6</seg> Your self could say not long since, that <hi>of all sects on some conditions you could soonest joyne to vs, as being nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest the truth:</hi> &amp; yet a little after call vs <hi>rebells</hi>: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion being a high degree of treason, your self if you conceale it 24. houres will incurr the danger thereof, looke you to it. <seg rend="sup">7</seg> You promised by writing to put downe reasons to iustify your <hi>Ministerie, and doctrine betweene vs conferred of,</hi> but
<pb facs="6"/>
we thought before how slack we should find you in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. At your next comming to Slaughtens. I pray you not to spend an houre and half in confuting vs in proving that we never denyed, as you did before, &amp; not to contradict your self as Mr Ies. did, disproving his owne doctrine the same tyme that he repeated it. The doctrine was that <hi>whosoever was reputed to be a Minister &amp; taught the doctrine in the foundation sound he was a true Minister,</hi> and yet in the same place at the same time he said that <hi>a non Resident was a thief and a robber.</hi> Now I hope he will confesse that a non resident is reputed by them to be a Minister and may teach the doctrine in the foundation sound, therefore a thief and a robber may be a true Pastor, (or els he disproved his own doctrine) which cannot be. With grief of heart I assure you I write these things, having bene sometimes perswaded that you had more conscience, and true knowledg of God then can be perceived in this dealing. Thus haue I given you a tast of your evill dealing, the Lord give you true remorse at the sight of your sinn, or els remēber that which Mr Fox hath written of the terrible end of persecuters. If you haue any thing to say in answer, do not snatch here and there as your maner is, but directly and orderly iustify these doctrines which are laid to your charge as false. Thus as before, so still committing our cause to the iust iudge, I take my leave: this present the 25. of Mon. 2. 1603.</p>

      <hi>but the malice thereof shall be discovered in the congregation.</hi> She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei himself, yea and Rabshakeh, could besides other things pretend even the name of God, when they ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led &amp; cursed most bitterly. Wherein also what other thing hath he done in his invective against vs, but as the Iesuites and other Papists have often done against <hi>Luther, Calvine, Beza, &amp;c.</hi> of whom they shame not to forge and publish notorious lyes &amp; sclanders: and all to obscure the truth professed by them? VVhose steps how this enemie of ours hath followed, let others iudge. And let himself remember his owne saying
<pb facs="8"/>
heretofore, if he will regard no others, <hi>that a man who hath run away from his Maister, wil seldome give him a good report.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But thus is he the fitter servant for his Maisters the Prelates, by whose authority he pleaded here before the Magistrates that his book was printed: and vnder them belike hopeth to be sheltered in England, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath now betaken himself: for what cause he knoweth best. But wheresoever and howsoever he bestow himself, let him know, God will find him out: from whom he cannot fly, nor escape his judgement. For as Enoch the seventh from Adam prophecyed, so is it in all ages to be remembred, <hi>Behold, the Lord cōmeth with his thousands of Saints, to do iudgement against all men, &amp; to rebuke all the vngodly of them, of all the workes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ynes which they have vngodly committed, and of all the hard things which vngodly sinners have spoken against him. Iude, ver.</hi> 14.15.</p>
   <p>For which cuase, we could for our owne parts so have left him, &amp; born in our bosome all his reproach, without giving any answer: had we not considered that by him not onely our selves but even the faith of Christ which we professe is traduced and oppugned; and many that are weak might thus be kept or turned away from the truth; and Salomon saith, <hi>He that is first in his owne cause,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.17.</note>
      <hi>is iust, till his neighbour come and make inquiry of him.</hi> Therefore thought we it best at this time to make the answer ensuing. VVherein as now we have followed the counsell &amp; rule of wisdome, which saith,
<pb facs="8"/>
      <hi>Answer a foole according to his foolishnes,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Pro.</hi> 26.5.</note>
      <hi>least he be wise in his owne eyes:</hi> so for hereafter (vnles there be great &amp; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall occasion to the contrarie) we may the better fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the other counsell and rule which Wisdome in the same place teacheth, saying, <hi>Answer not a foole according to his foolishnes, least thou also be like him:</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.4.</note> And specially for this man, who <hi>hath not delite in vnderstanding,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.2.</note>
      <hi>but that his heart may be discovered:</hi> whom God hath already made a spectacle to others of heady, contentious, and hostile opposition against the faith and witnesses of Iesus.</p>
   <p>Neither let him or any other of our enemies think their case the better, because of our sinnes or troubles or weak walking in the faith, whereō they do so much insist. Concerning which, my answer shall be with the words of the Prophet, <hi>Reioyce not against me,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Micah.</hi> 7.8.9.10.</note>
      <hi>ô myne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie: though I fall, I shall arise: whē I sit in darknes, the Lord shall be a light vnto me. I will beare the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, vntill he plead my plea, &amp; execute iudgement for me: he will bring me forth to the light, I shall see his righteousnes. And he will look vpon myne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and cover her with shame, which said vnto me, Where is the Lord thy God? Myne eyes shall looke vpon her, now shall she be troden downe as the myre in the streetes.</hi> And in this will we rest, and wayt vpon the Lord the God of our salvation: trusting in him, that notwithstanding our vnworthines and his chastising which we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, yet he will look vpon vs in mercy, and make all things worke for good vnto vs in Christ: And that
<pb facs="9"/>
thus the vttermost opposition of all our enemies (howsoever they set them selves against vs, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our cause or against our persons, against our faith or our walking in it) shall turne to our good, &amp; to the furtherance of the truth witnessed by vs: which we have much found that adversaries of all sorts have a long time and many wayes oppugned, as they yet dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do and cease not: though all in vaine. For great is the truth, and will prevaile: and greater is he that is with vs then they all that are against vs. To him be praise and glorie for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
