      <hi>There is one body and one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, euen as you are called in one Hope of your Ʋocation: One Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme: one God and Father of you all, which is aboue all, and through all, and in you all:</hi> To preuent distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and preserue the vnity of the Church: To limit out the naturall branches, besides those that are cut off by schismes, or pared away by the censures of the Church, to set out the truth of the Redeemer according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith, and the couenant of Baptisme: here are the bonds of peace combined in one head, not in the Church which had their circular Epistles written for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Coloss:</hi> 4.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.6.</note> nor in the Synods of the Church, which had their Councels for the composing of diuisions: These are but confirmations, no beginnings of that vnity which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. A peace there is pretended, or as the Author saies, a reconciliation: what peace? saith <hi>Iehu</hi> to <hi>Iezabel, Pacem do

         </gap>.</note> wee can shew an author for it: so that except they will make an vniuersall diffusion of some secret Grace flowing from <hi>Peter</hi> as from the name of Iesus, which is an <hi>Oyntment poured out:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cant. <hi>1.</hi> Phil. <hi>2.</hi>
      </note> If they thinke that this name of <hi>Peter</hi> like oyle aboue water giues a generall command ouer heauen and earth and hell as the names of Iesus, which it seemes they doe, for in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings <hi>Peter</hi> is as often writ as the name of Iesus in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of <hi>Paul:</hi> but I thinke, as <hi>Dauid</hi> was not a King ouer all Kings because of his mystery of three times annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, no more was <hi>Peter</hi> Prince ouer all the Apostles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the commission of threefold feeding: but that he was at Rome, that he seated himselfe there, that hee plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Church, gaue it after his death to <hi>Clement,</hi> we take it as a matter of history, not of faith. For if it were so, wee wonder that <hi>Paul</hi> should be so vnciuill to leaue out a salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Bishop <hi>Peter</hi> amongst the rest.<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>16.</hi>
      </note> It may bee <hi>Peter</hi> being one of the hot spirits of Galilee,<note place="margin">Galilei pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces.

      <note place="margin">Mat. <hi>26.</hi>
      </note> let them answer this, or there is no Apology to be made for <hi>Peter,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16</note> that besides vnkindnes is to bee accused of negligence that he grounded the Iewes at Rome no better, that were scarce catechized in rudiments of Christianity by him that was not Bishop of Rome some fiue and twenty yeares,<note place="margin">Acts <hi>28.</hi>
      </note> but also of the circumcision: and not onely of negligence but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnesse, in not remembring the words of Christ,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ioh:</hi> 21:15.</note>
      <hi>Feede my Lambes,</hi> vpon whom depended the hope of the whole flocke: It is a signe of lightnesse to be credulous, so saide <hi>Porphiry</hi> against the Christians; but beeing mortall as wee

   <p>But that hee left it to the Bishop of that See is the maine issue: let them answere <hi>Paul</hi> that had not a vision of the Gentiles as <hi>Peter</hi> had, but the diuision of them from the Iewes: and euen then me thinkes when the Doctor of the Gentils,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Acts</hi> 28.28</note> of which Rome was the chiefe City, was out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor with his Country-men I think Bishop <hi>Peter</hi> was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inhospitable, to let him hire an house. <hi>Peter</hi> had no Palace,<note place="margin">Epiphan: Hares. <hi>27.</hi>
      </note> thats a wonder, no more had <hi>Paul,</hi> both Romane Bishops: It seems that <hi>Peter</hi> dwelt vpon the stone in which <hi>Luke</hi> did engraue the picture of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or else to be supposed that he was Bishop of Rome by one of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ieroms</hi> allegories,<note place="margin">Hierom: in Philem: Acts <hi>28.30</hi>
      </note> as he doth interpret <hi>Pauls biennium,</hi> to be the gift in the two Testaments, and so the Bishopricke it selfe: so doubtfull we shall finde it in the history, that when wee come to beleeue it, I doubt it will but prooue an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory.</p>
   <p>Let them then interpret <hi>Gregory</hi> the Pope,<note place="margin">Greg: ep. ad Eulog: Alexand.</note> who doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch that the succession of Antioch was from <hi>Peter,</hi> and answer Antioch, who they say, enioyed him seauen yeeres, where was the first name of Christian, or <hi>Polichronius</hi> of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, who thinkes the Primacy should be where Christ first was, where was his first <hi>Fecit</hi> and <hi>Docuit:</hi> Then alas it will bee but meere folly to thrust vpon vs the writings of <hi>Clemins</hi> &amp; <hi>Anacletus,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Jacobo fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri Domini Episcopo E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscoporum Hebraeorum Ecclesiam Regenti.</note> whom they make say so without any craft, for <hi>Clement</hi> writes to <hi>Iames,</hi> and after that <hi>Iohn</hi> is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, both vnder this Pope, both their writings in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and the Epistles of these the onely heires to <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire forgotten: and so they may, for truly their authors are hidden and obscure, as the deuout Abbot spoke of <hi>William</hi> the simoniacall Bishop of Africke.

      </note> But as <hi>Victorinus</hi> the Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian before his full conuersion, ashamed of the humility of the word, blushing at the shame of the crosse, was wont to mocke <hi>Simplicianus</hi> when he enclin'd him to open professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Ergo ne parietes faciunt Christianos?</hi> The walles of the Church make no Christians, nor the chaire of Rome it seemes make Rhetoricians, but as in Art, so in the Truth of Religion, it may be,<note place="margin">

      <note place="margin">Chrysost.

<pb n="46" facs="30"/>good did issue from appeales; but long iourneyes, expence of money, many miseries, but no redresse, no pitty, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at the wrongs, and to those that did practise them, it was not <hi>Refugium,</hi> but <hi>Suffugium,</hi> a refuge, but a shift to slip off the punishment of some notorious crimes, that they had committed in their own Church: not for any care to religion, but to be of that religion which did eyther permit vnlawfull things, or dispense with great persons, like the <hi>Magi</hi> that said vnto the Kings of Persia: <hi>Wee haue a Law, that it is not lawfull for a man to marry his sister, we haue another Law,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Virgils Fglog.</note>
      <hi>that Kings may doe what they list: Et quae tanta fuit Romam tibi causa videndi? Libertas,</hi> saith the Poet, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and impunity was the cause of these appeales, and though there were a necessity, yet no fruite did grow from it.</p>
   <p>The comparison which S. <hi>Ierome</hi> a Priest in Rome doth make betwixt <hi>Orbem</hi> and <hi>vrbem</hi> is well knowne, and the place in which he paralels the merit &amp; Priesthood of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople with Rome.<note place="margin">Ier. ep. ad Euagr.

      </note> he would not heare of it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee was but a sparke of mortality as others were, he would not striue to flie the highest, but shine the brightest, and so we are come past the 600. yeares: Then euery man knowes how <hi>Phocas</hi> killed <hi>Mauritius,</hi> and vsurpt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and to curry fauour with the Romanes, made that dogge of the flocke, <hi>Boniface</hi> the third vniuersall Bishop: so they continued in hight of pride and cruelty: as the ould Rome was built in bloud: so was the supremacy gotten by parricide,<note place="margin">Psa. <hi>67.20</hi> Non Jesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum suasu sed militum terrcre: Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens. epis. ad Bell.

      </note> we wish it did not so continue.</p>
   <p>It was a saying, <hi>Thou leadest thy people like sheepe by the hands of Moses and Aaron,</hi> but now alas, it is not <hi>Ducit,</hi> but <hi>Trahit,</hi> we must not be led, but drawne by the necks, not so much by the perswasion of Iesuites, as the violence of Souldiers: <hi>Ignatius</hi> turned from a Souldier to a Iesuite,

   <p>These 5. things considered will cleere it.</p>
   <p n="1">1 A primacy in regard of the Empire.</p>
   <p n="2">2 The chiefe men elected Popes, excellent Schollers, woorthy Martyrs. This made the people wing on that side.</p>
   <p n="3">3 The Emperour translated to the East, The Pope get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the vpper hand of his deputy at Rome, the Emperor curbing the Bishop of Constantinople, the Latine Church grew strong, and the Greeke weake.</p>
   <p n="4">4 The leuity of the Greeke Church, giuen to nouelties, distracted with heresies, suffering of Bishops opposite to their Church, euen within their walls, was the cause that compelled the better sort of Bishops to appeale to Rome for succour, and of the credit of that Sea.</p>
   <p n="5">5 The Emperour still withdrawing his forces, the Cleargy of Rome ouer-ballancing the temporalty, <hi>Prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter imperium,</hi> gaue aduantage as stirrups for the man of Pride to raise himselfe by the helpe of <hi>Phocas,</hi> and such wicked Pages that lifted him vp into that seate where now hee sits Although all the Fathers that speake of Order, and <hi>Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> themselues so much runne vppon that worde <hi>Aequaliter,</hi> yet now ambition teares in peeces those brazen steppes where Deuotion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did weare it selfe, and we are wearied with the weight of this great head that is vpon vs, that neuer yet could bee set vppon the shoulders of <hi>Russia</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="53" facs="33"/>places: and now wee may pray with DAVID, <hi>Lord saue vs from the Horne of the Vnicorne,</hi> because this head hath made the most precious home of the Church an Instrument of Murther and of diuision rather then Vnion.</p>
   <p>Be it so, that will not content them to be Lords ouer vs, but our Faith also: They will haue an infallibility of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination: That must depend vpon that Chaire, and to this we must be reconciled, and so we must thinke vnder paine of damnation.</p>
   <p>This Question was canuassed at Cambridge before the King: It must determine and therefore necessary, One Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall necessary to determine matters of Faith; <hi>Non vnum vniuersum supremum Tribunal</hi> saide the King vppon that ground. The Deane of <hi>Paules, Loquebatur in puncto,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Doctor Cary.</note> as the Prouer be is: His wordes were like goades and nailes, sharp and sure. How wittily and substantially did hee prooue, that there was to bee had the last resolution of Faith: that Christ instituted that infallible: that it was most expedient to be so: that Christ foresaw it to be so expedient: that the Church could not be one body without it: that there could not be without it a iust vniting of the parts of the Church: that there could be no vnity of Faith: that without it Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks could not be conuinced, nor lay men in the Church: that the vnity of the Church was more preserued by it: that no Heresies were condemned without that Bishops consent: and that hce had the definitiue sentence. If any were giuen by others, yet they had recourse to the Pope for confirmation, as in the <hi>Mileuitan</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. So pithily disputing, that it was enough to haue plucked out a mans eyes as the preaching of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Galathians, and led him by a blinde Iesuiticall obedience to thinke so.</p>
   <p>The King certainly admired the frame of his arguments, and therefore impatient of interruption, bad them, let the Deane goe on. A frame indeed.</p>
