   <head>THE FRENCH Epistle dedicatory to His sacred Majesty of Great Britanne.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Xcellent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; heere is the first-borne of a Labour, as vnhoped for as the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is extraordinarie, which prostrates it selfe, with all humilitie, at the feete of your Maiestie, to doe you an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his Birth, and in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto you his first duetie, craues leaue to wander the World, and visit his friends.</p>
   <p>In these vnhappy times, which lately made <hi>France</hi> (my countrey) the sad obiect of pitie, and the mournfull subiect of
<pb facs="4"/>
good peoples sorrowes; on a day, sitting vpon the shores of <hi>Babylons</hi> gulph, aspecting with watty eyes the deplorable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of Christs true Church, which in the throng of these mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>series was sore wounded with iniuries, appearing as if she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> had attained the decrepit age of a dying life, which breath's forth her last gaspe: And as I expressed by my teares the dolor of her afflictions, and by my sighes the desires of her deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, my eyes imitating in their glances the wishes of my soule, sought for the place where the great god <hi>Pan</hi> vsed to feed and keepe his flockes at noone day: I discouered a far off, some sparkes of the Sunne of Iustice, which in this happy country of <hi>Goshen</hi> shines perpetually, whilest an eternal night couers <hi>Egypt</hi> with the gloomie clouds of darkenesse. Thither suddenly I directed my Vowes; which God prospered so happily by his prouidence, that (after many dangers, tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and toylsome iournies) I at length arriued here, where I found</p>
   <p>A PEACEABLE KING, in whom is brightly discerned an harmonious vnity of all christian &amp; roial vertues, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of that great Empress of vertue, <hi>Piety,</hi> from whence all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deriue, &amp; the admirable Oeconomy of Charity, condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with Prudence, educated by Experience, and that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence drawn from diuers examples of precedent ages, &amp; proofs of this present; which produceth in him all kindes of actions both iust and necessary, by which he freely giueth himselfe to the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth</hi> for pledge and caution of their peace and prosperity.</p>
   <p>AN HAPPY NATION (which vnder the fauourable Scepter of such a Prince, in whom the sacred fountaine of the most exquisite graces of heauen, abounding with all sorts of
<pb facs="5"/>
prosperity, hath aboue others the honour to settle the Church of Christ, and with her, Piety and Iustice her constant follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) whom the benigne aspect of heauen causeth to flourish with ioy and perfect peace, whilest a cruell Warre spoiles and ransackes both neighbouring countries and remoter parts, with vnheard-of torments and excessiue sorrowes.</p>
   <p>God, who calls himselfe the Prince of Peace, stiles himselfe also the King of Warre; to shew, that he rules all worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires with his incomprehensible eye of prouidence, as well as with his inuincible hands of all-powerfulnesse. But, to make plaine to all mens vnderstandings how farre God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Warres, Strifes, and Contentions; and on the contrary, how much he loues Peace and Vnitie, it is said, Blessed be the Peaceable, because they shall be thereby knowne to be the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Christ, and heyres of heauen.</p>
   <p>Your Maiesty (great Monarch) on whose head God (as his Lieutenant here on earth) hath placed three Crownes; beares both the warlike Sword of <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>s,</hi> and the peaceable Oliue branch of <hi>Minerua,</hi> as did that <hi>Pallas,</hi> whom the Athenians took for their titulary goddesse, because she presided in peace as well as in warre. But what is the expedition of Warre, to the subduing vnder his lawes, by the sweetnesse of Peace, the passions of men? to bring them to reason, and to settle them in a firme and assured rest? what to vanquish by force a people, to the conquering of whole nations hearts by loue? to lose them, in stead of gayning them? The multitude, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at the Sonne of God, who calm'd the greatest tempest, cryed out, What is he whom both Seas and Windes do obey? Euen so (happy King) when I saw at my landing so many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite effects of your rare wisedome, the peace &amp; happinesse
<pb facs="5"/>
of your subiects, with the tranquillitie &amp; blessednesse of your diuine soule; I could not but likewise exclaime, <hi>Ah! what is this</hi> IVST MASTER, <hi>and prudent King, whose admirable spirit workes so many wonders!</hi>
   </p>
   <p>God gouernes, from the highest place of heauen, the earth; and from the lowest place of it, the heauens: because his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence and almighty power, being infinite, fills all places, yet vnlimited. For though by his omni-presence hee be euery where, yet he is included no where.</p>
   <p>Your Maiestie, who by the excellent and harmonious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of your wise dispensation, doe rule with a melodious &amp; delightfull harmonie, with One of your Kingdome, all the Three; &amp; from the farthest place of Great Brittanne, all Great Brittanne; presiding by your power in all places, disposing by your wisedome all things neere and farre, and perfecting them by your iustice: you cause all the dependences of your essence to be found in all places, and all things to be but one and the same thing, &amp; each thing to be as all things. And euen as to the humane body, that excellent part of the brain, which the Anatomists call the admirable lines or traces, by their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine courses and turnings, exquisitely folded and vnited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whose number is no lesse infinite than the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship thereof most rare; doth so excellently refine the vital spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that they are sent thither from the heart, which makes them moueable, and serue as instruments of Conception, of Iudgement and Memory: Your Maiestie doth in like maner receiue in your Spirit, which is the most admirable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite peece of that great imperiall body, of which your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie is the head, the aduises and counsailes, the requests and demonstrances, which from the heart of your estate, as the
<pb facs="6"/>
vitall spirits of it, are sent to you, for to passe them thorow (that labyrinth of Rarity) your iudgement, where you refine them so with the diuers considerations of your prudency, that they proue necessary instruments of peace, the tranquillitie and prosperitie of all your subiects.</p>
   <p>The entrance or beginning of a raigne is most commonly thornie and difficulty, yea dangerous and painefull; not onely full of cares, but also tedious and troublesome: so that it had beene better for some kings to haue neuer raigned, or else to haue ended their dayes at their beginning. This moued the Philosopher <hi>Solon</hi> to sing these verses to <hi>Mydas</hi> king of Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, at the entrance of his Cities:</p>
   <q>
      <l>Le puissant Dieu de tout Souuerain Maistre</l>
      <l>Ne scauroit mieux les hommes secourir,</l>
      <l>Qu'entre mortels ne les laisser point naistre,</l>
      <l>Ouestans nez, les faire tost mourir.</l>
   </q>
   <p>But your Maiestie (great King) who by the speciall grace of God, and the prudence wherewith he hath endued you, farre aboue all other Princes, haue found the entrance of your raign spacious, delightfull and secure: and being grounded vpon the protection, enuironed with the blessings, &amp; conducted by the prouidence of that Soueraigne dispenser of Scepters and Crownes; you haue hitherto raigned, to the admiration of all the world, PVISSANT AND MAGNIFICENT, RICH AND CONTENT, HAPPY AND GLORIOVS; and in all, perfect and accomplisht.</p>
   <p>PVISSANT AND MAGNIFICENT indeede, sith that (with full power and authoritie you raigne ouer so many pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issant
<pb facs="6"/>
Nations, which God hath subiected to your Maiestie, vnder the homage and duety which you daily pay vnto him, as to the onely soueraigne King of kings.</p>
   <p>RICH AND CONTENT, in possessing them peaceably, without opposition; extracting pleasure of all that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed for the glory of God, which you seeke for your owne contentment.</p>
   <p>HAPPY AND GLORIOVS also, sith that (by those testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of loue which God giues you, and the thankesgiuing which your Maiesty yeeldeth him) you haue vpon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons free accesse to his incomprehensible Maiesty, a familiar entertainment with his infinite goodnesse; Heauen being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes open to your contemplations, and whatsoeuer your Maiesty can thinke most exquisite, rare on earth, fauourable to your wishes, is all bent for your felicitie. Oh how happy is your sacred Maiestie! what mortall can apprehend it? how glorious! and who is he that can expresse it?</p>
   <p>But behold, this is the chief point, ouer which my conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations cannot pass without staying; &amp; yet rest they neuer so little, they enter as it were into a labyrinth for a while. Gods graces and blessings fall most commonly into vngratefull hands, who dispence thereof the more niggardly, by how much they receiue them aboundantly: and the most part of men erre so farre, that in stead of worshipping in them the soueraigne power and prouidence of God, they striue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell him; nay, it lies meerly in their owne vnpowerfulnesse, that they doe not ouerthrow his incomprehensible Empire and Throne of glory. By meanes whereof, it falls out that it ofttimes chances to them, as to those subalternal Deities, who for putting themselues in <hi>Iupiters</hi> bedde, were by a boysterous
<pb facs="7"/>
winde, suddenly metamorphosed into strange shapes.</p>
   <p>But your Highnesse (mighty king) makes vse of it, as fire of the perfume; you returne those blessings to heauen againe through your praises and thanksgiuing: you disperse them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you by your royall liberality; for whosoeuer hath the honour to approach neere your Diuinity, is enlightned with the beames of your diuine vertues. And as <hi>Salomon</hi> did build and (with the stones of mountaines, and Cedars of Libanus) erect Altars to God: so you make therof instruments, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls to prop the house of God.</p>
   <p>Soueraigne authority vpon the people, meetes often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with violent hearts, which makes him not vnlike the daily motion of the Sunne; so swift, that it is terrible; and so terrible, that it would consume away if it should last long: but your Maiesty knowes well how to temper your Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie by your Iustice, &amp; likewise your will by your prudence; insomuch that this first course is moderated by the second, which is yearely, and runneth from West to East by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Zodiaque circle: by this sweet, temperate and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate course you order the seasons in your Monarchy: you cause a delightsome Spring, that produceth diuersity of flowers in aboundance; a rich and pleasant Summer, which yeelds all kinde of fruites plentifully, by which you reward paines and labours, you reflect the desires, you content the hopes of euery one, according to your wise dispensation. And as God is not contented meerely to bring forth his actions in the highest heauen; but by his Spirits administration, descends from that palace of glory, to the lowest deep, runing &amp; flying thorow all quarters of this Hemisphere, to dispose all things by his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty powerfulnesse: Your Highnesse (prudent King) imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
<pb facs="7"/>
the proceedings of that incomprehensible Monarch of Heauen and earth, which alone is a patterne to your soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Maiesty, do not anchor your actions in that Imperiall Hauen of your glory, the kingdome of England, which, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by the Soueraign authority of your Highnesse, as her <hi>primum mobile,</hi> carries those to others which are ioined to him, by the bands of one only power, Scotland and Ireland: but also the fame of your rare vertues spreads all ouer beyond the seas, your admirable prudency; &amp; your immortal pen, the fruit of your deep learning, at which nations being amazed, admire with reuerence, so rare and accomplisht a Maiesty.</p>
   <p>But what East wind driues my sails into so wide an Ocean, carrying away my endeuours farre beyond the reach of my power? Stay, my thoughts; whither runne yee? Rest conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. My curiositie, what seekest thou? Silence, my tongue; what dost thou say? Oh! would my skill, which is so small, dare to aspire to so high a taske, so weake and rashly to think to penetrate thorow so bright a sunne? so short, and presume to sound his depth? <hi>Good King</hi> pardon these hardy glances of my spirit, enlightned with a diuine light, and animated by an extraordinary vertue. Those which aspect the beames of the Sunne, within the Sunne, thinke a long time after they behold still a Sunne before their eyes; not being able, by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sense of the obiect, to draw the Idea of the spirit. Thus since I haue had the honour to see in so <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>glorious deeds</hi> your <hi>actions,</hi> in your <hi>actions</hi> your <hi>vertues,</hi> in your <hi>vertues</hi> your <hi>Maiesty,</hi> and your <hi>Maiesty</hi> in it <hi>selfe</hi>; these rare and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site obiects, as so many Sunnes, haue so rauished my senses and eyes, that they seeme to see them alwaies present before them. Moreouer, the Idea which is remayning in my intellect, hath
<pb facs="8"/>
brought them to such extraordinary designes, that if my forces were correspondent to my desires, and my vnworthinesse to the dignity of the subiect which animates me, I had alreadie proclaim'd your diuine perfections from one end of the earth to the other, yea from the earth to the heauens: and taking for my auditors so many blessed soules, which there gloriously inhabite, I should haue recited to them, with the admirable actions of your incomparable vertues, these glorious and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed deeds which issue thereof, and the most excellent glory which your Maiestie thereby inherites; at least, how in these last fearefull troubles of my sad, afflicted, and sorely desolate countrey, which so farre opprest her, that losing the sight of her owne reason, she had almost lost her selfe in it selfe; or, as I may well say, spoyled her selfe with her owne strength and defence. Your Piety (all-rare Prince) which is all-Iustice, cast her compassionate eyes vpon the deplorable and most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable condition of her poore oppressed brood: your Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, which is all-Charity, lent her eare to their wofull &amp; sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull complaints: your Charity, which is all-Prudence, opened her heart to their needy miseries and extreme wants, and your Prudence (which hath alwayes the eyes, the eares, and the heart open at all times to such poore afflicted wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, who doe implore of your Maiestie like pious actions) making at that time a charitable distribution, euer bound both publike and particulars to vow their heartie prayers to heauen for your health; &amp; their true seruices to the world for the prosperitie, greatnesse, pleasure and contentment of your Maiestie.</p>
   <p>But the worthinesse of the subiect, and my insufficiency, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing deterr'd me from so high an enterprise; I haue modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="8"/>
my designes, which aspired so high, and placing them in a meane region, I rul'd my endeauours by my might, doing my best to finde out, as well for my owne satisfaction, as for the good of others, to whom I communicate as many consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for miseries, and instructions of this wicked ages expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; in which we see regenerated what remained of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, instruments, materials and labours, to perfect the worke of this ages iniquity, the lees of ages past, which with his muddy wine troubles the braines, corrupts the manners, and debaucheth the noblest functions of manie: I haue destina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them for to seek out the growth, beginning, and progresse of this happy and magnificent reestablishment of Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call truth and puritie, the first and soueraigne cause of your Maiesties glory, the securitie of your estate, and prosperitie of your people, which in this flourishing Empire hath three crowns, of which your Ma: is the first Monarch, who receiue from Gods fauourable grace, by the hands of your religious prudence, so great a perfection, that it makes the whole work most wonderfull: a prop so solid, that when the raine is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, the stormy streames and impetuous floods come against it, and when the windes haue raged strongly, and blowne fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously at it, it could not be shaken, but still remained firme, strong, constant, and alwayes a flourishing pillar of securitie.</p>
   <p>And my designes haue so happily, though vnfortunately, succeeded, that when I had collected my senses, and prepared my selfe for this Work, I found it ready done by one of your Ma: subiects, in the Latine History, which he hath digested into yeares, describing such things as passed during the most glorious raigne of that heroick &amp; inuincible Princesse, aboue her sexe, full of magnanimitie, rare in Piety, admirable in her
<pb facs="9"/>
counsailes, wonderfull in her courage, and blessed in all her enterprises, that incomparable Queene ELIZABETH, who in her time vndertooke to build the royall worke of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py reestablishment, vpon the ground and ancient foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons laid by her ancestors, for a time slackt and decayed; but after her Maiesty had gloriously raised it to the last Story, she left the rest vnto your most sacred Maiesties care, to perfect, who hath truely brought it into that happy and magnificent estate now flourishing, hauing vtterly dissipated the many errors and abominations, which here (before her raigne) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded; as he, who bearing Armes after <hi>Ionathan,</hi> slew the Philistines, who fell dead before him.</p>
   <p>Had I not regarded others, but my selfe onely, I had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent matter to content my curiositie (in enioying, with rest &amp; leisure, the sweet fruit of a labor meerly premeditated) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bringing it to this most tedious &amp; no lesse pennible, than difficult action. But as my naturall disposition &amp; reason pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse my inclinations, still to practise, study and labour for the common good, though neuer so much preiudicial to my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affaires; and as this Piety, of which I carefully sought the mystery (directly opposite to the mysterie of iniquitie ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen in these later times) permits me not to bury my talent in the earth, how small, and of little value soeuer it be; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the experience which I haue purchased in the diuerse voyages, forraigne abodes, accesse, frequentation, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this my peregrination, taught and assu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed me, that this History cannot but be welcome, kindly receiued, deerely cherished, and preciously valued of an infinite number, as well your Maiesties subiects, as others, to whom their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the language, interdicted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap> And as my
<pb facs="9"/>
selfe in the vnderstanding of it, found that it was in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse and simplicity, adorned with the most rare draught, most liuely and naturall colours, which can be found eyther in Art or Nature, and in the chiefest parts thereof, filled with exquisite and solid instructions, which the best able can giue, the most curious wish, and the most subtle and ready witts apprehend; iudging, that the more it is knowne, the more glory comes thereby to God, the more seruice to your sacred Maiesty, the more prosperitie to your blessed raigne, the more strength to your powerfull state, and the more terrour to all your foes: I haue done it in the French, my natiue language, which is now the only tongue that entertains the commerce of conceptions, amongst the diuersitie of nations, to shew to the world, that among an infinitie of memorable causes and things, remarkeable effects and successe, at least this magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent peace and prosperitie, which begun to bud forth vnder the raigne of this most prudent, pious, magnanimous, truely Catholike and Christian Empresse (who can neuer be by any duely praised, and to this day propagated &amp; continued in this your Maiesties most blessed and peaceable gouernment, with so illustrious splendor, that though it be enuied of many, yet it is admired of all) proceedeth directly from the reestablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christs true and pure seruice; and by so many, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse, happy, glorious, and particular deeds most eminent, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to this triumphant nation, is plainly manifested, that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the only meanes well and happily to raigne, is sincerely to serue God, who defends those that defend his Faith, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours them that honour him; For to such as first seeke the tranquility and aduancement of his raigne, all things fall out answerable to their wishes; also that the seedes of iustice are
<pb facs="10"/>
sowed in the fields of peace, to be reaped by the peace-makers; that piety hath both the promise of the present and the future life, and that indeed it is the originall source from whence spring all other vertues.</p>
   <p>Your sacred Highnesse (pious Monarch) hath already seene and perused the manuscripts of this worke, which I presented to your Maiesty some moneths agoe, to receiue from you, as from my Oracle, direction, whether I should publish it or not. But since it hath pleased your most sacred Ma: to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour these lines of mine with your iudicious approbation, I haue caused them to be printed, and vpon this expressiue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as earnest of your gracious fauour, I assure my timorous desires, that your Ma: will be pleased to see the same now in its perfect shape. Sith your Highnesse daign'd to grace it with the benigne beames of your goodnesse at its birth, I prostrate it at your feete, as a <hi>praeludium</hi> of my industry, and the premises of my most humble seruice. And if I may be so happy, as to see this my labour once more approued, &amp; my oblation gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously receiued of your Ma: I hope that my courage, anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with so good fortune, will performe a greater enterprise; and so great a fauour, rousing vp and reuiuing my spirits, will make my labours so fruitfull, that I may be able in time to quit my selfe of my vowes and duties, &amp; pay vnto your Ma: (with a better labour) more agreeable seruices, &amp; to the world fairer fruits of my study.</p>
   <p>I once thought to detaine it captiue vnder silence, fearing to aduenture so vnpolisht a peece of worke among so many Worthies (who haue already settled their worth in the beleef of others) lest they, by the shril sound of their lustre, might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure this worthlesse worke: neyther would I haue exposed

(but vnder your Maiesties protection) its fortune to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant malice of this age, its honest meaning and simplicitie, to the scoffes and wicked interpretation of hellish slanderous tongues, and base worldlings, my contentment to the despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of the enemies of its originall, my talent and its gaine, to the pillage &amp; ransacking of those, who (being partially interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, hauing their eyes &amp; iudgements blinded with affected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest) perhaps will discharge their passions herein, paying my labours with ingratitude, and my holiest intentions with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions. But sith 'tis in a maner a translatiō which represents faithfully the authors conceptions (so well approued, that it is a true proofe of his ingenious industry; which will suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently content the most curious, cleare the Reader of doubt, and chiefly those doubts conceiued by this works ill-willers) the worst which can befall me, is to be a caution of my deeds and faults, and in neyther changing, adding, or diminishing, free &amp; absolue me from all blames: sith Piety, which begot it, expressely commands me; and Charity, which brought it forth, graciously summons me to publish it, and to bestow the profit &amp; pleasure thereof vpon my neighbours, to whom questionlesse it will be most delightfull, pleasant, and vsefull. And truly those which it most concernes, haue had, of a long time, that power vpon my owne proper benefites, sith my contentment consists not in the praise of Printing, but to please and profite thereby the vertuous and gracious. The courses of this worlds affaires, and the diuerse inclinations of men, instruct me that it will be beneficiall to diuers, yea to the enemies hereof, who for not vnderstanding truely the Latine hitherto, could not haue a true knowledge of its particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And for as much as your Maiesties gracious approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

assures me of your royall protection, and God which hath preserued it heretofore, doth warrant me from all misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, I venture this assay of my luck, and publish this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of my talent, both vnder his Diuine prouidence, and your Maiesties leaue and authority, that it may therfore wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the world with security, and yeeld contenting pleasures to those who shall honour it with the gracious beams &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorable aspect of their eies: I doubt not but it may meet with peaceable mindes, fauourable spirits, pure hearts, and sincere affections, who will reade it without passion, censure it (with meekenesse) without partialitie, to draw thereby the good which I intend them. May it therefore be acceptable to your most excellent, most August, and most Imperiall Maiestie, to whom I dedicate and consecrate it, vpon the Altar of my sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie, in testimonie of my humble seruices, deuotions, and to purchase to my selfe the dignitie to be entitled,</p>
