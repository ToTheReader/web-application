      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a great question, whether Art or Nature be more fruitfull, in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Monsters: the one, presents many erroneous and wilfull opinions; the other wanders up and downe in many grosse deformities and corruptions of life; both, active and forward enough to publish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, did not the power of Heaven, the wisedome of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, restraine them both. But passing along the channels of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> once the Nurserie of Learning, famous for varietie and abundance of such Prodigies; I finde one, of one kinde, as chiefe for his qualitie, as for his Office; one, in whom concurre the aberrations of Art and Nature; one complying with each of them, to make himselfe one of both, a strange prodigious Monster, <hi>a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving man without bowels,</hi> a man-pleaser, yet no friend: such a man, of whom there can be no Picture drawne, no full expression, unlesse we goe againe to <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> for some new invention of Paper and Characters: Time (perhaps) may hereafter discover him in better colours; in the meane while, who list may come and see, and learne to save himselfe from this untoward gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

   <p>The Story is a Looking-Glasse, wherein most passengers may see a glimpse of themselves, either acting or suffring affliction; here you may guesse at the substance, by the shadow: and if the boundlesse waters of trouble (swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the height of a Proverbe) have made it transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent enough for each man (whom it may concerne) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect a little upon himselfe; thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>dtie put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Marchant (like <hi>Ioseph</hi> himselfe, no better estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by his owne brethren) and bought at first by <hi>Isma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> men of the meaner sort; yet in time, the price thereof may be raysed by experience, and so made good for great ones: sure I am (like a Glasse indeed) there is matter in it which hath beene tryed in the fire, and which returnes impression, without flatterie.</p>
   <p>The Worke (in plaine tearmes) is a Rod prepared for the backe of fooles; but yet (like that of <hi>Moses</hi>) stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched onely over the Land of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> no wise man will be offended, nor any true <hi>Israelite,</hi> in whom there is no guile. The God of all consolation (who turned a Rod into a Serpent, and made a Serpent wise by nature, for a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of instruction) prosper my weake endeavours, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove these Blossomes to maturitie, that his blessed Name may be glorified, the Church edified, <hi>Iosephs</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions remembred, his enemies scattered, his friends encreased, all of us wiser unto salvation, and my selfe every day more profitably</p>
