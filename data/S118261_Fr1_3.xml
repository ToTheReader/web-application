      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere hast thou (good reader) suche godlye meditations, praiers and other exercises of that worthye witnes of god Iohn Bradford, as god by his singuler prouidence hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto preserued and now at the length broughte to light for thy comsort and commoditie. Daylye and howerlye was this his exercise, to talke with god by faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and hartye meditation and praier with power pearcynge the heauens, and many suche godlye exercises dyd he leaue behinde him, which either time hath consumed or elles suche as keepe them in store to their owne priuate vse, doe little consider what benefite they withold from the church of god, whiche if they shall yet brotherly communicate, there shall not lacke good will and diligence to set them abroad. In the meane season, let vs with thankfulnes receyue, reade, and practise these, as meanes to quicken our spirites, to stirre vp our dulle hartes to a more feruenre inuocatiō of gods holy name. Which howe farre it is frō that it shuld be in vs, and what nede we haue thereof, if oure deade senses cannot feele, here may we see and perceiue. Here may we learne to flee vnto god by praier, that we runne not on still with this vnthankfull world, into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnes

of his great benefites powered vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, especially for the libertie of his gospell, which we (in muche mercye restored nowe vnto vs againe) so vnthankfully receaue, so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly neglect, so wickedly abuse. God graūt vs his good spirit to work in vs this good work: to loke about vs in time: to consider our state past and presēt, as in deed we haue great cause to do, &amp; so with hartie praier flee vnto god to preuent the plagues that are at hand, lest with double woe we find the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ende worse then the beginning.</p>
