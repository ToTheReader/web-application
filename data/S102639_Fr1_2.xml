   <l>OF Subjects (my dread Liege) 'tis manifest,</l>
   <l>You have the old'st, the greatest, &amp; the least;</l>
   <l>That for an Old, a Great, and Little man,</l>
   <l>No kingdom (sure) compare with <hi>Britain</hi> can;</l>
   <l>One, for his extraordinary stature,</l>
   <l>Guards well your gates, &amp; by instinct of Nature</l>
   <l>(As hee is strong) is Loyall, True, and Iust,</l>
   <l>Fit, and most able, for his Charge and Trust.</l>
   <l>The other's small and well composed feature</l>
   <l>Deserves the Title of a Pretty Creature:</l>
   <l>And doth (or may) retaine as good a mind</l>
   <l>As Greater men, and be as well inclin'd:</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>Hee may be great in spir't, though small in sight,</l>
   <l>Whilst all his best of service, is Delight.</l>
   <l>The Old'st, your Subject is; but for my use,</l>
   <l>I make him here, the Subject of my Muse:</l>
   <l>And as his Aged Person gain'd the grace,</l>
   <l>That where his Soveraign was, to be in place,</l>
   <l>And kisse your Royall Hand; I humbly crave,</l>
   <l>His Lives Discription may Acceptance have.</l>
   <l>And as your Majesty hath oft before</l>
   <l>Look'd on my Poems; Pray reade this one more.</l>
