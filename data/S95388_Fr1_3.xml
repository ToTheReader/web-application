   <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>GEntle Reader, pondering, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently noting, the great fruits, and manifold helpes, which diuers holy members of the Catholike Church hath in times past, and euen vntil this day, do continually receaue from this third holy order, instituted by our Seraphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Father, S. <hi>FRANSCIS,</hi> which he, (as testifieth S. <hi>BONAVENTVRE</hi>) would haue to be called, the third order of Brothers and Sisters of Penance, for that the way of Penance is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men that desire to come to heauen, so in like sort this order, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting both the Clargie and Laie people, Virgins and married folkes of both sexes. I did therefore obtaine
<pb facs="9"/> from my Superiours, the forme of this Rule in French some <hi>17.</hi> yeares past, and seeing that it was first ordained for all deuout persons, of what degree soeuer, that would vndertake it, I did presently translate it into our natiue mother tongue, to the intent, it might according vnto the first institution, be made common vnto all such zealous persons, as had any desire to embrace it: forasmuch as this Rule and worthy forme of life, being made in a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Countrey (where all vertuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and pious deuotions, are freely practized) doth exhort all followers thereof, to frequent and fulfil diuers holy workes, which many persons, not well weighing the whole contents of this Rule, and the carefull prouision, which our holy Fathers haue made for all persons of what estate, and place, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, haue thought it to be a matter of great difficultie, if not impossible to
<pb facs="9"/> obserue the contents of this Rule in our Countrey at this time. Wherefore, seeing that it was ordained in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Chapter, which was helde last at <hi>Tolledo,</hi> that all Superiours; of the orders of holy <hi>S. FRAVNCIS,</hi> should vse their best meanes, to publish this his third order, in all Prouinces, I (though vnworthy of the place) not long after, being made <hi>Commissarie Generall,</hi> of the Prouince of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, desirous both to fulfill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the General Chapter, in doing my best indeauour, to publish in our Prouince, this holy order, and in like maner, to take away and make cleere all such doubts and difficulties, as seemed to be conteyned in this Rule, did translate it againe out of Latine, verbatim, as it was set downe in the Apostolical breue, of <hi>NICOLAVS 4.</hi> for the confirming of it, and according to the priuiledge which his Holinesse
<pb facs="10"/> graunted, in the <hi>18.</hi> Chapter of this Rule and forme of life, did dispence, and accommodate it in abstinences, fastings, and all other austerities, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the conueniencie, of the persons, time and place, of our Countrey. But seeing afterwards, that the number of Brothers and Sisters, did increase in such sorte, that it was, and would bee hereafter more troublesome, both to write out large Copies thereof, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one which desireth it, or to giue vnto each person those particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, which was necessarie for so holy a congregation: I purposed to put it into print, and therefore made a more ample declaration thereof, to the intent, that such as I could not conueniently instruct in all poynts of this Rule by worde of mouth, they did either doubt of, or were willing to learne, for the perfect obseruation of this holy estate of life; and for their
<pb facs="10"/> better encouragement therein, I had gathered also a short collection of the chiefest perfections of this most pious order, and therewithall endeauoured to shew how euery point thereof did take his firme foundation from the holy Scriptures, purposing to haue ioyned it, vnto this preasent Treatise. But hauing at length obtained this Rule written in Spanish, with the briefe annotations, of the Reuerend Father, <hi>Commissarie General,</hi> of our whole order in these partes behi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the the Alpes▪ I fearing least that this present Treatise, would altogether mount to a greater volume, then I thought it conuenient for this present time, haue left out the collection of the perfection of this Rule, vntill some other conuenient oportunitie, and added in stead thereof, this Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers Epistle, and his annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon this Rule, to the intent
<pb facs="11"/> that euery one may both see, how this Rule is obserued in Catholike Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and also that it is an order much respected, and not worne out of request, or like easily to be troden downe, seeing that all the chiefe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and superiours of our order, in the whole world, being assembled together, in a general Chapter, were so carefull in making a speciall orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, for the publishing and conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of it, which caused this our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missarie General, not onely to request, but also to command all our Prouinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to publish and establish, and vse all their best meanes, for the conserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this so holy a thing, whereby this holy congregation is so encreased, within this last ten yeares, since that commandement was giuen, that not onely the meaner vertuous sort, but also a greater parte of the Nobilitie of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hath and doth daily em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brace
<pb facs="11"/> and obserue it most sincerely, being mooued not a little thereunto, by the examples of many worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which did both excell them in many degrees of Nobilitie here in earth, and now much more in heauen; being some of thē Canonized Saints, others beatified, besides those honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy persons, which for their vertuous deedes, and holinesse of life, their names are cronacled to their perpetual memorie here in earth, and no doubt to their euerlasting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in heauen: whose names as our forementioned <hi>Commissarie,</hi> did place in the end of his little booke, so haue I ioyned them in the ende of mine, adding thereunto the name of our most vertuous and renowned Queene, <hi>KATHERINE,</hi> mother vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Queene <hi>MARIE,</hi> of happie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, being the onely person of great worth, that I can learne to haue bene
<pb facs="12"/> of this third order in our Countrey, which may as yet be conueniently cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacled. And for as much as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of this holy Rule and forme of life, doe (and must if they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently) serue the Saints of all the three orders, which our holy Patron S. <hi>FRANCIS</hi> instituted, I haue (both for their ease, and the deuotion of all such as will deuoutly inuocate their helpe) added also the commemorations of all those Saints, which imitating the Rules of our Seraphical Father here in earth, do now to his greater glory, and their euerlasting happines, euioy with him the sight and company of our heauenly Father, in his glorious kingdome, which as we desire all to do, so I beseech God of his infinite loue and goodnesse, to graunt vs all his grace to cōtemne in such sort as those blessed Saints haue done the vanities and pleasures of this world, that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
<pb facs="12"/> by their example, through the narrow way of Penance, we may come in the ende, to the happy home, where they now liue in all felicitie, and possesse eternall blisse, with God and all his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Court.</p>
