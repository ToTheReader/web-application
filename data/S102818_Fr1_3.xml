The Lord in mercie hath now visited vs, and hath done his part, and hath turned our former scarcitie into present plentie: the earth hath brought forth hir increase, and God euen our owne God hath giuen vs his
<pb facs="8"/>blessing. But wee regard not to visit the poore, &amp; to do our dutie: but albeit we find him a gracious father, we remain stil grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse children. For the plentie which God hath sent to refresh the poore, is without cause kept in, and not acknowledged, to the vndoing of the poore. But take we heed that we tempt not God, and presumptuously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the holy one of Israel vnto anger, in extenuating and abazing his rich mercies and making him a niggard, when as he hath opened the windowes of heauen, &amp; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs plentiously of his blessings to drink as out of a riuer.

      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent a future danger, if we shall giue out
<pb facs="8"/>our riotous feasting, and deuote our selues sometimes to a religious fasting. If this see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth too greeuous and ouer burdensome to vs: content we our selues with a moderate diet, and let our superfluities be bestowed to succour their necessities. As God hath libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lent to vs, so let vs largely lend to him againe. By giuing to the poore thou dost lend to him, and he promiseth to set it vpon his owne accounts, in theresurrection of the righteous. Consider wee the difficult estate of these times, the huge heapes of poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their extreame miserie. I haue vsed all diligence as God hath guided mee with his holy spirit, to stirre you vp to these religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties, vrging and pressing these two propositions, with as effectual and plausible perswasions as I could. I hope I haue not lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in any part of my worke, but in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place without any impertinent and idle digressions to make the paper swell, haue by solid arguments, illustrated and confirmed such needfull circumstances as belong to my assertions. I heartily desire thee not super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially and slenderly to consider it, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately
<pb facs="9"/>to reuolue it in thy mind. And albeit there be others who haue written of this argument more sufficiently then I, yet seeing I cannot bring gold and siluer with others, I see no reason but that I may bring such as I haue, euen goats haire, and badgers skins, vnto the Lords Tabernacle. The wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes mite was as pleasing vnto God, as the plentifull and sumptuous contributions of the rich. Though I haue but one talent, I cannot in duty bind it vp in anapkin, or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it in the earth. The honor of Christ Iesus whose vnworthie seruant I am, my dutie to my deare soueraigne, whose loyall subiect I am, the loue of my countrey whose vnfaig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned friende I am, hath animated me to this labor, which I commend to God, and to thy indifferent iudgement. <hi>Fare well Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, this eight of October, 1597.</hi>
