If almighty God was robbed of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the time of the law, when tythes and offrings were not brought into his storehouse for the maintenance of his seruice, and for the reliefe of the priests &amp; poore amongst thē, it is a necessary cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, that Gods honour is greatlye impayred by them, which pull from the Church any part of that which is giuen for the vpholding of Gods religion, and therefore that they are accursed.</p>

      <hi>Samuel</hi> describing the conditions of an vsurping king,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam. chap.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 15.</note> setteth downe this for one, vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Israelites: he will take the tenth of your seede &amp; of your vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and giue it vnto his Eunuches and seruantes. If the king might not take the tenthes of seede and vineyards,<note place="margin">Nomb. chap. <hi>18.</hi> ver. <hi>21.</hi>
      </note> because they were dewe to the priestes by Gods owne order and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the maintenance of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, no man hath any priuiledge to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich him selfe, his child, or seruants with the spoyle of Churche lyuinges, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king money or pensions for preferring other to them.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>The elders</hi> of the Iewes desired Christ instantly to heale the Cēturions seruant:<note place="margin">Luke. chap. <hi>7.</hi> ver. <hi>5.</hi>
      </note> their reason was this, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth our nation and hath built vs a sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue. If the building of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the Iewes godly assēblies, was an argument of the Centurions loue
<pb facs="6"/>vnto that nation, the pulling away of that from the Churche and Churche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which woulde mainteyne godlie and Christian assemblies, is a sure ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that little care is had eyther of Gods honour, or of his Ministers, or of Gods people, or of any religion at all.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ezechias</hi> the king of Iuda con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that the Priestes and Leuites should be throughly prouided for by the people of Ierusalem,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chro. chap.</hi> 31. <hi>ver,</hi> 4.</note> that they might be incouraged in the lawe of the Lorde, that is to say, that they might cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without distraction of mynde at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vppon their calling. If it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in Ezechias time that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Ierusalem shoulde haue mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance at the hands of the nobility and Citizens of Ierusalē, it is most equall, that none in our time whatsoeuer should take to themselues, eyther the whole or part of such maintenance, as hath beene heeretofore prouided for the Ministers, and is nowe confirmed to them by the godlie lawes of this noble lande.</p>

   <p>
      <hi>If Dauid refused</hi> to drinke of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Bethlehem because it was gotten with daunger of losing a few temporall liues,<note place="margin">
         <hi>1.</hi> Chro. chap. <hi>11.</hi> ver. <hi>16.17.18.19.</hi>
      </note> it is a very great sinne by praying vpon the church liuinges (as a hawke doth vpō partriches) to spoyle Christiās of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> food of their soules, &amp; so to bring a plague of famine amongst them. If Dauid deserue commendation for pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out the water of Bethlehem to the lord for a sacrifice, what do they deserue which by pulling from the Church and Churchmē, do spoyle almighty God of his seruice &amp; y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> poore of necessary releif, which are grosse sinnes against both the tables of the commaundements.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>If anie</hi> faithfull man or faithfull woman haue widowes,<note place="margin">
         <hi>1.</hi> Tim. chap. 5. ver. 16.</note> let them mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster vnto them and let not the Churche be charged, that there may be sufficient for them that are widowes in deed. If they sinne which for the ease of their owne purses suffer the Churche to bee charged, their sinne is greater which do pull from the Churche, or take eyther mony or pensions of the Church men for preferring of them.</p>
   <pb facs="7"/>
   <p>
      <hi>If God doe</hi> curse,<note place="margin">Deut. chap. <hi>27.</hi> ver. <hi>17.</hi>
      </note> and all good men detest them which remoue the bounde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, because by y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> fact, quarrels growe amongst neighbors, &amp; other mēs land is somtimes vniustly come by, they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a more greeuous curse at Gods hands, &amp; vnder greater detestatiō at his peoples hands, which take away either landes or commodities from y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Church and Churchmen. The remouing of the bowndstone hurtes but a fewe, and to their little losse. The taking away of the maintenāce of the Minister hurts a great number, and keepes from them learned and godly men, which shoulde teach and gouerne them.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>If Iesus</hi> Christ did cast out of the tēple in Ierusalē all them that sold &amp; bought in the temple,<note place="margin">Math. chap. <hi>21.</hi> ver. <hi>12.</hi>
      </note> and did ouerthrowe the tables of the mony chaungers, and the seates of them that sold doues, hee will deale more rowndly with buyers and seslers of Cleargy liuinges, because their sinne is greater. They which sold doues and were mony changers in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem had two goodly pretenses for their marchandize: first that the people
<pb facs="8"/>which came to sacrifice at Ierusalem needed not to seeke farre for doues to sacrifice, or for monie to offer in the tē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, because they might haue both mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny &amp; doues at hand for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> seruice of God in Ierusalem. Secondly, the exchange of monie and sale of doues was not in the sanctuarye but in the court of the Temple, which court was sometimes tearmed by the name of the temple. They which make marchandize of cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy liuings haue no such colour for their defence, they cannot say that they are monie chaungers and doue sellers, to furnish Gods people with monie for offeringes and with doues for sacrifice: but they take mony and gifts of corrupt men, to famish Gods people and to keep from them the goodlye funneshyne of Gods fauour, which the sounde prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell doth very liuely &amp; comfortably offer vnto them. They which sold doues and changed monie in Ierusalem, defiled not the sanctuary but the court of the temple: they which sell Church liuinges doe great hurt to the bodie of the Churche and common<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb facs="8"/>therefore their condemnation will bee more greauous because their sinne is greater.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>The Emperour</hi> Constantinus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded Anilinus,<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. chap. <hi>5.</hi>
      </note> to bee carefull that gardens, howses, or any thing whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer belonging to the right of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches should with all speede bee restored to them. If pulling from the Churches had beene lawfull, Constantinus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement had deserued neither li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nor performance. Our gracious souereigne Queene Elizabethes both desire and pleasure is, that worthy men be called for, and haue that maintenance freely which belonges vnto them: this hath her Maiesty deliuered in speeche, and it is prouided for by hir highnes lawes. All y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> feare God doe thanke him for, and are glad of this, and do therefore think very hardly of corrupt mē which will not be restrayned and reformed ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Gods and the Queenes both lawes and speech, or by the woorthye example of Constantinus, or by the testimonye of their owne consciences, which cannot but both accuse &amp; condēne them,</p>
   <pb facs="9"/>
   <p>
      <hi>They which</hi> present mē to ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal liuings are called patrons, that is to say, defenders of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church: to keepe back either all or part of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church liuinges is not to be a shielde to couer the Churche and the Minister, but a sworde to cut them, and therefore they may iustly be called the schollers of <hi>Lysimachus</hi> the Churchrobber which was slaine for his villanies.<note place="margin">2. Machab. chap. 4. ver. 42.</note> If a patrone preferre a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster for monye and corruption, hee must needs thinke hardly and vily of that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, &amp; the minister likewise of that patrone: for who can like a minister when he feeles his corruption, and what minister though hee fishe with a siluer hooke, wil accompt of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> patrons friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which he payes so deare for: and what good men can like of eyther him that preferres or is preferred in this sorte: will they not iudge them to bee straunge market men? Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoam made Priestes of the lowest of the people which were not of the sōnes of Leui,<note place="margin">1. Kings chap 12. ver. 31. &amp; chap. <hi>13.</hi> ver. 33.</note> but hee did it for monye. For the like respect, I feare, manye haue beene preferred, which cannot
<pb facs="9"/>be allowed for Prophets because they neuer were the sonnes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>I haue handeled</hi> these poyntes, I trust for the good of all▪ that they which are guiltie of this sinne may make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and leaue the practise of it, and that they which are not guiltie of it, may take good heede that they fall not into that sinke of corruption. If anye be offended with this I haue set downe, it is their faulte and not mine: for the seed which I haue sowen is very good, but the ground which receiues it not, is very bad: but my comfort is this, that I haue pleased almighty God and his seruauntes in this godly labour, though this certayne truthe bee a shut booke &amp; as a sealed letter vnto graceles Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morantes.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Question.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Whether landes and pensions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for the maintenance of Idolatrie, may and ought to be conuerted to the seruice of God?</p>
   <p>Answere.</p>
   <pb facs="10"/>
   <p>They may &amp; ought: for if mē should conuert them to their priuate vse, it might bee iustly thought, that in abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing superstition priuate gaine is the marke which is louelled at, and not the promoting of Gods true religion. This is Augustines iudgement in a notable and learned Epistle,<note place="margin">Aug. epist. <hi>154▪</hi> ad Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licolam.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues to be greatly liked of.</p>
