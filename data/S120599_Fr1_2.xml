   <head>TO MY VENERABLE MOTHER THE FAMOVS AND FLOVRISHING VNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERSITIE OF OXFORD.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ERE I destitute of all other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to demonstrate the <hi>providence of God</hi> in the <hi>preservation of the World,</hi> and to proue that it doth not <hi>vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally</hi> and <hi>perpetually decline,</hi> this one mightfully suffice for all, that thou, my <hi>Venerable Mother,</hi> though thou waxe old in regard of yeares, yet in this latter age in regard of strength and beauty, waxest young againe. Within the compasse of this last <hi>Centenarie</hi> and lesse, thou hast brought forth such a number of worthie <hi>Sonnes</hi> for piety, for learning, for wisdome; and for <hi>buildings</hi> hast bin so inlarged and inriched, that he who shall compare thee with thy selfe, will easily finde, that though thou be truly accounted one of the most auncient <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities</hi> in the World yet so farre art thou from withering and wrinkles, that thou art rather become fairer and fresher, and in thine issue no lesse happy then heretofore.</p>
   <p>The three last <hi>Cardinals</hi> that this Nation had were thine, if that can adde any thing to thine honour. Those thine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Sonnes, who of late dayes forsooke thee, &amp; fledde to thine Enemies campe, <hi>Harding, Stapleton, Saunders, Raynolds, Martyn, Bristow, Campian, Parsons,</hi> euen in their fighting against thee, shewed the fruitfulnes of thy wombe, and the efficacie
<pb facs="3"/>
of that milke which they drew from thy breasts. What one Colledge euer yeelded at one time and from one Countrey three such <hi>Divines</hi> as <hi>Iewell, Raynolds,</hi> and <hi>Hooker,</hi> or two such great wits &amp; <hi>Heroicall</hi> spirits as Sir <hi>Thomas Bodley,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Sauill.</hi> How renowned in forraine parts are thy <hi>Moore,</hi> thy <hi>Sidney,</hi> thy <hi>Cambden?</hi> what rare Lights in the Church were <hi>Humfreyes, Foxe, Bilson, Field, Abbot?</hi> What pillars those fiue sonnes of thine who at one time lately possessed the fiue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Sees in the Kingdome? So as if I should in this point, touching the <hi>Worlds pretended decay</hi> be cast by the votes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet my hope is that by reflecting vpon thy selfe, I shall be cleared and acquitted by thine.</p>
   <p>And in confidence heereof I haue to thy <hi>censu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> submitted this ensuing <hi>Apologie,</hi> which perchaunce to the <hi>Vulgar</hi> may seeme somewhat strange, because their eares haue bin so long inured vnto, and consequently their fancies fore-stalled with the contrary opinion. But to thee I trust, who judgest not vpon report, but vpon tryall, neither art swayed by number and lowdnes of voyces, but by weight of argument, it will appeare not onely just and reasonable in that it vindicates the glory of the Creator, and a trueth as large and wide as the world it selfe, but profitable and vsefull for the raising vp of mens mindes to an endeavour of equalling, yea and surpassing their noble and worthy <hi>Predecessours</hi> in knowledge and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; it being certaine that the best <hi>Patternes</hi> which wee haue in them both, either extant at this present, or recorded in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of auncienter times, had neuer beene, had they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that there was alwayes an inevitable declination as well in the <hi>Arts</hi> as matter of <hi>Manners,</hi> and that it was impossible to surmount those that went before them.</p>
   <p>I doe not beleeue that all Regions of the World, or all ages in the same Region afford wits alwayes alike: but this I think, neither is it my opinion alone, but of <hi>Scaliger, Vives, Budaeus, Bodine,</hi> and other <hi>great Clearkes,</hi> that the witts of these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages being manured by industry, directed by precepts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by methode, tempered by dyet, refreshed by exercise, and incouraged by rewardes, may bee as capable of deepe speculations, and produce as <hi>masculine</hi> and lasting birthes, as
<pb facs="3"/>
any of the ancienter times haue done. But if we conceiue thē to be <hi>Gyants,</hi> &amp; our selues <hi>Dwarfes,</hi> if we imagine all Sciences already to haue receiued their vtmost perfection, so as wee need not but translate and comment vpon that which they haue done, if we so admire and dote vpon Antiquitie as wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate and envy, nay scorne and trample vnder foot whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the present age affords, if wee spend our best time and thoughts in clyming to honour, in gathering of riches, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing our pleasures, and in turning the edge of our wits one against another, surely there is little hope that wee shall euer come neare them, much lesse match them. The first step to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a man to the atchieuing of great designes is to be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that by endeavour he is able to atchieue it, the next not to bee perswaded that whatsoeuer hath not yet beene done, cannot therefore be done. Not any one man, or nation, or age, but rather <hi>mankinde</hi> is it which in latitude of capacity an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres to the vniversality of things to be knowne. And truely had our Fathers thought so reverently of their predecessours, and withall of themselues so basely, that neither any thing of moment was left for them to be done, nor in case there had beene, were they qualified for the doing thereof; wee had wanted many helpes in learning, which by their travell wee now injoy. By meanes whereof I see not but wee might also advaunce, improue and inlarge our patrimony, as they left it inlarged to vs: And thereunto the Arts of <hi>Printing</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,</hi> the frequency of goodly <hi>Libraries,</hi> and liberality of <hi>Benefactours,</hi> are such inducements &amp; furtherances, that if wee excell not all ages that haue gone before vs, it is only because we are wanting to our selues.</p>
   <p>And as our helpes are more &amp; greater for <hi>knowledge</hi> &amp; <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> so likewise for <hi>goodnes</hi> &amp; <hi>vertue,</hi> I meane, since the beames of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> displayed themselues to the World, which for the rooting out of vice &amp; planting of vertue no <hi>Christian,</hi> I hope, will deny to be incomparably more effectuall then any other Religion that euer yet was heard of in the World: Or if others should chance to make a doubt of the certainty of this truth, yet cannot you who preach it, &amp; publish it to others. Doubtlesse being rightly applyed without apish superstition
<pb facs="4"/>
on the one side, or peevish singularity on the other, it workes vpon the Conscience more forceably, &amp; consequently hath a greater power of making men not outwardly &amp; formally, but really &amp; inwardly vertuous. And if we should look back into <hi>Histories,</hi> &amp; compare time with time, we shall easily finde that where this Profession spred it selfe, men haue generally beene more accomplished in all kind of morall &amp; civill vertues then before it took place.</p>
   <p>It is true indeed that in processe of time, thorow the <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, covetousnes, luxury, idlenesse,</hi> &amp; <hi>ignorance</hi> of them who should haue bin lights in the Church, it too much degenerated from its <hi>Originall</hi> purity, &amp; therevpon manners (being formed by it) were generally tainted, this corruption like a leprosie diffusing it selfe from the head into all the body: But together with the reviving of the <hi>Arts</hi> &amp; <hi>Languages,</hi> which for sundry ages lay buried in barbarisme, the rust of <hi>superstition</hi> was likewise in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places scowred off from Religion, which by degrees had crept vpon it, &amp; fretted deepe into the face of it, and the <hi>Arts</hi> being thus refined, &amp; Religion restored to its primitiue bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, manners were likewise reformed euen among them, at least in part &amp; in shew, who as yet admit not a full reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in matter of <hi>Religion.</hi> A foule shame then it were for vs who professe a thorow reformation in matter of <hi>doctrine,</hi> to be thought to grow worse in matter of <hi>manners, GOD</hi> forbid it should be so, I hope it is not so, <hi>I</hi> am sure it should not be so: <hi>That grace of God which hath appeared more clearely to vs then to our fore-fathers, teaching vs to adorne our profession with a gracious and vertuous conversation, to deny vngodlinesse and worldly lusts, and to liue soberly, and righteously, and godly in this present world:</hi> sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of our selues, righteously in regard of others, and godly in regard of religious exercises.</p>
   <p>If then we come short of our <hi>Auncestors</hi> in <hi>knowledge,</hi> let vs not cast it vpon the deficiencie of our wits in regard of the <hi>Worlds decay,</hi> but vpon our own <hi>sloth;</hi> if we come short of them in <hi>vertue,</hi> let vs not impute it to the <hi>declination of the World,</hi> but to the malice and faintnesse of our <hi>owne wills;</hi> if we feele the scourges of God vpon our Land by mortality, famine, vnsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable weather, or the like, let vs not teach the people that
<pb facs="4"/>
they are occasioned by the <hi>Worlds old age,</hi> and thereby call into question the <hi>prouidence,</hi> or <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>wisedome,</hi> or <hi>iustice,</hi> or <hi>goodnes</hi> of the Maker thereof; but by their and our <hi>sins,</hi> which is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les both the truer &amp; more profitable doctrine, &amp; withall more consonant to the Sermons of <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; his <hi>Apostles,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of God</hi> in like cases. And withall let vs freely acknowledge that <hi>Almighty God</hi> hath bestowed many blessings vpon these latter ages, which to the former he denyed, as in sending vs vertuous and gracious Princes, and by them the maintenance of piety, &amp; peace, &amp; plenty, &amp; the like. Lest thorow our ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude he vvithdraw them from vs, and make vs know their worth by wanting them, which by injoying them wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not.</p>
   <p>But <hi>I</hi> will not presume to advise where I should learne, only I will vnfainedly wish and heartily pray, that at leastwise your <hi>practise</hi> may still make good mine <hi>opinion,</hi> maintained in this Booke, &amp; refute the contrary &amp; common errour opposed therein, that you may still grow in knowledge and grace, and that your vertues may alwaies rise &amp; increase together with your buildings. These latter without the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but as a <hi>body without a soule.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Yours to doe you service to the vtmost of his poore abilitie</hi>
   </p>
