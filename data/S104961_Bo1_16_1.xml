   <head>To the right worshipfull the Ladie Anderson, wife to the right honorable Lord chiefe Iustice of the common Pleas.</head>
   <p>MY boldnes being much, may passe the bounds of duty, but the goodnes of your honourable husband (good Madame) passeth so farre the commendacion of my penne, that vnder his iudgement and shield (that is so iust a Iudge) I make a sauegard to this my presumption, that hazardeth where I am vnknowen to present any peece of Poetrie or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of greater effect, yet aduenturing by fortune, to giue my Lady your sister somewhat in the honour of the Queenes Maiestie, in the excellencie of her woorthy praise that neuer can decay. I haue translated some ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses out of French, that a Poet seemed to write of his owne mistresse, which verses are so apt for the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Phenix of our worlde, that I cannot hide them from the sight of the worthy, nor dare commit so grosse a fault as to let them die with my selfe: wherfore and in way of your fauour in publishing these verses, I dedicate them to your good Ladishippe, though not so well penned as the first Authour did polish them, yet in the best manner my muse can affoorde, they are plainly expressed, hoping they shalbe as well taken as they are ment, so the blessed and great Iudge of all daily blesse you.</p>
