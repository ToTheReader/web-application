   <head>The preface or Epistle to this Sermon.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I looked amonge pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of myne olde studied notes and sermones (most gentle Lady) by chaunce I founde a draught of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that was prepared, to haue bene preched at your buryall. This was when your Ladishippe was so dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sicke at Chelsie. Then was I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of one of your cheefe officers to prepare a sermon for your burial, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was thought to come shortly, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thynge made a greate many of vs your seruauntes ful heuy. But in such a case no thought wylle helpe. And I knowyng that suche a thyng wolde be loked for at my hande, with an heuie harte I prepared this present sermon (althoughe it be nowe a litle more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated) to be in a redines, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of all them, that should haue bene present at your buriyng, to lerne them<pb facs="3"/>howe they should preare themselues to die. And now (thākes be vnto god,) whiche dothe ordre all thynges to the best, so that, that sermon whiche was prepared for to haue edified &amp; ben pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to other then, mai be profitable to teache your good Ladishippe now, in readyng of thesame, bothe to lyue and to die. It shall not be onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to you, but also to as many as shal either reade it or heare it. I praye you good madame remember this one thynge well, althoughe death dyd but dalye with you then, to put you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce that ye be mortall, suer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he will come again a nother tyme, and execute his office vpon you euen in earnest. And whē this shalbe, ye cā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, therfore be alwaies in a redy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for as our Sauiour Christe saith: Ye know neither the daye nor yet the houre. &amp;c. watche therfore and be all times in a redines. Heare I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to note &amp; beare in mynde, that the exhortaciō that I purposed to haue
<pb facs="3"/>spoken to them that should haue bene hearers alyue at your buryng: Nowe heare I speake thesame (by my penne) to you, ye thankes be vnto god beyng aliue, and may by readyng of thesame knowe what should haue bene spoken vnto other. And thoughe it maye bee sumwhat merueiled at, why that I name you so often in this my preface, as though al y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whole exhortacion wer made onely vnto you. The cause why I name you so often is ths. In your name or your person, I admony she as mani as shal either heare or reade this poore exhortacion. Remember good Lady, remēber, yea euen in your most prosperite, what ye shalbe in aduersite Remember in your pleasaunte lyfe, what ye shalbe after your dolorous death. It is not for naught, that the wise man saith, <hi>Memorare nouissima tua, &amp; in eternum non peccabis,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member (saith he) thy last end, (ernest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and often, &amp; I warraunt the) thou shalt neuer synne, wyllyngly. And so <pb facs="4"/>consequently, thou shal neuer be dā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. A worthy bill of remembraunce, often to be loked vpon: Yet moreouer I truste (good Lady) that these doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whiche are necessary for al maner of persones, shalbe also your instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for there is no person so perfecte, no nor yet so well lerned, but he or she, may be better, bothe in learnynge and liuynge. There is no persone so wittie or wise, but by hearyng of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doctrine, he or she maye bee made wiser: accordyng to the saiyng of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon in the firste chapiter of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbes. <hi>Audiens sapiens, sapientior eris:</hi> The wise hearyng, shalbe wiser. Moreouer, that that I write to your good Ladishippe nowe, for your good instruction, both to liue and to die by, I doubt not but that ye will imparte and communicate the same, with your moste dearly beloued husbande, my es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specyall good Lord and maister▪ which I am sure wilbe as gladde to heare it, as your Ladishippe wyll bee to reade<pb facs="4"/>it, for he that so often vouchedsaulf to heare me preche, wyll nowe I doubte not heare that that I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten▪ for I haue euen now with as good an harte written vnto you, as I was wonte to preache before you. And am now as ready as euer I was to do you seruice if time and place would suffer. But bi y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> grace of god, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which wilnot be now brought to passe, a nother time God wylling shall wel come to passe.</p>
   <p>¶ I woulde wyshe nowe that this poore exhortacion ware euen as a glasse afore your eyes, and as a bill of remembraunce afore your myndes, bothe to thynke how that ye do lyue, and also howe that ye should liue, and consider ernestly, what ye do, &amp; what ye be commaunded of God to do, Let the holy scripture in all these thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, be your rule. Also consider, what ye be now by the goodnes of god, and what ye shalbe hereafter by the course of nature. What ye haue receiued at goddes handes, &amp; how that ye vse such<pb facs="5"/>thynges so receiued, ye muste remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber also, that he that dothe receiue muche at his lordes handes, muste ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue a compte of muche. And he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a good accompte of many thinges wel bestowed accordīg to his maisters minde, shall haue greate thankes, and be sette ouer muche more after then he was before Mathew .xxv. I trust that both my good lorde and you also, will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be content wyth my writyng now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, both boldely, plainly and truly, as well as ye haue bene content in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes past to heare me preche before you bothe boldly, truely and plainely. And not onely contented to heare me so preache, but also, to defende me so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng. Yet moreouer I truste, that your wisedome, knowynge my rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, rusticalnes and plaines, will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consider the thynges that be here writen, with the meanyng of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to loke for suche thynges as ye knowe, by your olde experience not to be in him▪ that is▪ Colors of rethori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cke,<pb facs="5"/>Eloquence of speche, Craftie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiaunce of matter, Fine termes, pure Englishe, and ortographically writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, &amp; suche like, wher as the prouerbe saithe, where nothynge is, the kyng loseth his right. So your good Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe muste be fayne to be contented with suche as heare is, seyng y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he that sent your Ladiship this, would with al his harte, haue sent you a better made thyng, if there had bene any better in his store house, Therfore I besech you my good Lady, take it in good worth nowe, and when god geueth better, ye shal haue better, Last of al I would be gladde, that you of your accustomed goodnes, would vouchesaulfe to take the payne to loke ouer this poore ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ernestly &amp; often. Yet because it is sumwhat long: I haue diuided it in to v. partes, that ye may reade ouer one parte at once, and so at length all. I woulde desire you at the leste wise to loke ouer, the first and the sconde par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and that as I haue saied, bothe<pb facs="6"/>ernestly and often. For although it be, very good &amp; expedient to know diuerse playsters and medicynes for dyuers sores and sickenesses, yet we muste vse those moste, that we knowe will helpe ouer sores and diseases best.</p>
   <p>¶ Nowe when I had made an ende of this poore exhortacion, it came into my mynde, that a newe yere was at hand, a tyme wherin, both men &amp; women, be wonte to gratifie there fryndes with suche giftes, as are bothe pleasaunte and profitable in this lyfe. But I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to gratifie you my especial good Lady, and maistres, with suche a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel or gyfte, out of the treasure house of god, that if ye kepe it wel and vse it wel, it shalbe vnto you, both pleasaūt, profitable &amp; permanent, not onely for this present lyfe, but also for the life that is to come, &amp; shall dure for euer. Other imagyne in this mery tyme of Christmas, to make ther frindes mery &amp; gladde in body. But I go about to make my fryndes (amonge whom my<pb facs="6"/>Lorde and you bee the chefe and all) mery and gladde in couscience, that is, when ye so lyue as though ye ware euer redie to die, and gladde to be in heauen, with your Lorde Christe, who euer preserue my good Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, your good Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe and al yours bothe in honour heare, and in glory ther. Amen.</p>
