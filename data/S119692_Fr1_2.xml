Though my selfe be nothing comparable, &amp; not so much as worthy to carry their bookes after such learned men, yet I may take example frō them.</p>
   <p>And although (Right Reuerend) I know right well, that you not onely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour religion, but are an earnest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor thereof, &amp; that I need not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and stirre you vp therein: yet the principal scope of this my writing is, &amp; of this my dedication, in most humble &amp; earnest sort to desire you, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>s you haue done much good already by your printed labors, so you would vouchsafe yet more and more, to further Gods church &amp; the ministerie by this means. Among whom my selfe beeing but a mean member, haue reaped great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by your labors. For the which, as we of the ministery chiefly, are to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge gods goodnes for raising vp such an instrument in his church, so as many
<pb facs="3"/>as haue beene furthered &amp; bettered by your painfulnesse, are also to account thēselues beholding vnto you, as I am, I speak it vnfainedly. I heare being one of your neighbour Diocesse, that you haue great care of a learned ministery, and at the entrance of your honourable place in VVorster, you shewed your selfe a forward man therein. I beseech your Lordship to pardō my presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to take my meaning in good part. For them that are vnlearned, and eyther would, or by any means are like to enter into the ministery, where you haue to doe, either you may aduice thē (as no doubt you doe) to stay a longer time, till they be sufficient, or debar thē, or exhort and counsell them to take vpon them another course of life. For those beeing vnlearned, that are already placed, who considering their ovvne wants and weaknesse, might bestowe some part of their liuing vppon suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and able men, to helpe to discharge that vvaightie dutie which lyeth vpon thē to performe in that behalfe; if they be vnwilling this way, &amp; of themselues wilbe studious &amp; painful, endeuouring
<pb facs="4"/>to discharge a good conscience in their place and calling, no better helps can they haue then learned bookes. Who if they would but follow the direction which you haue already set foorth, I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">

      </gap>sure them they may doe much good in theyr congregation. Nowe as Kings and Princes desirous to gouerne theyr people well, doe not onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them to liue in due obedience and ciuill order, but also doe prescribe lawes &amp; statutes, that thereby they may be directed to liue as they ought to do: so such men as your selfe vnder Kings and Princes, beeing appoynted great Gouernours, &amp; hauing a great charge, doe well to perswade your Clergie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your iurisdiction, that they haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall care to instruct the people cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them: but they doe better, that by all meanes they can deuise, doe help and further them, to make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ministers.</p>
   <p>The example of your Lordshippes painfull preaching, is a notable incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in this behalfe, but if it would please you as yet further, to preach to the by your painfull pen, they might at

<pb facs="5"/>of soule or no, we care not; but rather then we should not haue the meanes to liue in this life, (for this is theyr onelie scope in continuing in the ministerie,) require the blood of soules, and vvhat thou wilt at our hands. And so sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse men, they sell themselues body &amp; soule, vnto euerlasting woe &amp; destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
   <p>To this speech Ma. Doctour <hi>Some</hi> aunswereth wisely and discreetly. I am so far (saith he) from beeing a defence, to ignorant eyther Leuites before, or Ministers nowe, that I confesse freelie, that their entrance into the priest-hood and ministerie, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="4 letters">
         <desc>••••</desc>

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eeuous sinne.</p>
   <p>If the Lorde hath or shall punish them senerely for theyr intrusion, into so high a calling, they cannot plead not guiltie. If they doe it is in vaine, for at Gods barre, they shall not be acquitted. You write that the ignorant Ministers, whom you call sencelesse men, doe sell themselues body &amp; soule to euerlasting destruction: Your speech is true; <hi>Illi viderint:</hi> Let them if they be not grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb facs="5"/>and shamelesse, looke into it. All that I say vnto it is, the Lorde for his Christ his sake; heale that sore. It is not so grieuous (thankes be to GOD) as it was, I assure my selfe it will be lesse, I would to God it were none.</p>
   <p>So farre Maister Doctor <hi>Some,</hi> who I am perswaded vttered this, not so much addicted vnto learning, (beeing himselfe a man verie learned) as princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallie vpon a good conscience, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the vvaightie charge that lyeth vppon the Minister to performe, to teach, to confute, to comfort, vvhich cannot bee performed vvithout lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
   <p>Novve in token of a thankfull mind, for that good which I haue alreadie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by your publique painfulnesse, (both by priuate meditation, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique practise, for the which the Lorde be praysed,) I haue made bolde to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this Booke vnto your Lordship, not so much for patronage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, (which also I desire) as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend sort, once againe to exhort you, and to drawe you on, to be mindfull of vs of the ministery; and to remember
<pb facs="6"/>my humble request heerein.</p>
   <p>Concerning the Reader, he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade himselfe, that that doctrine shall most preuaile with his auditory, that standeth vppon diversities of instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, leading the minde onward, with a kinde of v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
