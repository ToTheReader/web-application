      <hi>Jf any either haue or doe</hi> spoile the Church or Churchmen of their maintenance, I referre them to <hi>this which immediatly followes, and</hi> to the fourth Proposition in my Treatise of the Church, and to my whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise against Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</head>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Mich. 2. Iere. 5</note>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a grosse sin to grind the faces of others, and to spoile them of that they haue: Gods iudgementes against Oppressiō, doe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proue this. But to robbe the church, and Churchmen is a fowler sinne, and will haue greater ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce from almightie God. Is there any calling vnder heauen, that pleaseth God more, and doth greater seruice in a Christian kingdome, then the noble estate of the ministerie? Are they not the Lordes Embassadours,<note place="margin">Malach. 2. Mat. 5. <hi>1.</hi> Cor. 4. Ephe. 4. 2. King. 2.</note> the salte of the earth, the light of the worlde, the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of Gods mysteries, the buylders of Gods Church, and the charriot &amp; horsemē
<pb facs="5"/> (as Elizeus said of Elias) of a Christian kingdome? If they be so, &amp; that by their sound preaching,<note place="margin">Luke 10.</note> Sathan falles downe from heauen like lightning, &amp; y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> walles of Ierusalem are built vp, is it not most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they shoulde not bee robbed of the churches maintenāce, which belongeth of dutie vnto thē? Is is not a certaine truth, &amp; in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> eyes of all men, that many in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landish &amp; incorporate townes doe open their purses very willingly, &amp; boūtifully (for mē of their place) for the maintenāce of godly preachers, &amp; doth not almightie God, besides y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> heauenly cōfort he giues thē, repay those good mē with increase of earthly cōmodities? Doth almighty God like of this Christian dealing? &amp; do godly men both iustly &amp; greatly cōmend it: and wil not gracelesse Cormorants be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which in steed of helping the Lords plough forward, hāg it vpō the hedge, by making foule hauock of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> churches main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenāce? If these which either haue or doe feed vpō y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church, (as the eagle doth vpō the carrion) did see the goodly companie of students in Cambridge and Oxeforde, or coulde consider what sharpe wittes,
<pb facs="6"/> and excellēt learning &amp; vertues almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie GOD hath geuen to many of them, or woulde bee moued with the sight of those holy assēblies, wherin Gods trueth is soundly taught, and his people singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly comforted, would they not condēne their vile course, and be heartily sory for their monstrous dealings? If this I haue already remēbred will not mollifie and bend their hearts, then let them cast their eyes vpon many Churches in this noble lande, which eyther want the preaching of the word, or if they haue it, they haue it strawberie wise, that is, once a yeere: let them I say, looke vpon the wofull estate of those places, and if they be not hewen out of Okes, and haue heartes of flint, it will breake them in pieces. If answeare be made, that a sufficient number of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers cannot be had to furnish the whole lande, I graunt they say somewhat: but sure I am, that if very fit men in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities &amp; abroade, were heartened and employed accordingly, many should not be drowned in ignorance and poperie as they are, and many treacheries against y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> religion and Prince, would more easilie
<pb facs="6"/> appeare, and the number of skilfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters (which are very precious iewels in a Christian kingdom) would increase accordingly. For who are there, that haue spent their time profitably at their books, &amp; are excellētly furnished for the building of Gods Church, that would either hyde their talentes in a napkin,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> or burie them in the earth: yea rather, that are not with all their heartes desirous to blowe the Lords siluer Trumpets,<note place="margin">Num. 10. Ezech. 33.</note> to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ouer Gods citie, and feders of his flocke: and what hope is there that these worthy men shall be employed, when the Churches maintenance is not giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them accordingly, but rather pulled from them most shamefully: yea, what meane men are there, that will to their great charge maintayne their sonnes in the vniuersities for the benefite of Gods Church (for very fewe of greater calling dedicate their sonnes as Anna did Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel to the Lords ministerie) when they see that learning, vertue and religion, are not preferred and rewarded for learning, vertue, and religions sake: and that (as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristodemus of Lacedemon saide, money,
<pb facs="7"/> money is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> mā, without money either gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uē to corrupt patrōs, or corrupt brokers, the Churches allowance is very hardly come by. Lent shrift is found fault with long ago, but sure I am, that the shriuing or rather shauing of the Churchemen, as it is more costly then Popishe shrift, so is it in some sorte, as greate an enemy to Gods religion, as that trumpery was. If that which I haue set downe in my Treatise of the Sacramentes, or in this booke can not worke the good (I meane the vnfained conuersion) of suche, as ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue, or doe poll the Church, let them remember, that euen the popishe sort, (howsoeuer they are wide, both of white &amp; butte, in many weighty pointes of Gods religion) doe both mislike and condemne the giuing and taking of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or pensions for cleargy liuinges, and thinke it a very absurd thing (as it is indeed) that anie patrone, because he hath right according to the lawe, to present a fitte man, shoulde pull away either the whole, or the least part of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> churches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision. Secondly, that the time will come, when these gracelesse cormorances
<pb facs="7"/> shal sing this song with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> king of Babilō, <hi>vocetur Daniel,</hi> sende, sende,<note place="margin">

Let thē remēber (I say) y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the time wil come, whē they shall sing this sōg with these vngracious princes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they either haue or doe poll godlie mē of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> churches maintenāce.<note place="margin">T.
