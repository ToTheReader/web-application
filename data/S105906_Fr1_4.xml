      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S no hight (good Friend) can bee attained unto, but by the order of degrees, beginning at the lowest, and by little and little aspiring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the highest, without omission of anie; even so, no man can rightlie conceiue any Science, Arte, Historie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>nclination of all men, (for the most parte) would bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For as rash Writing proveth unprofitable for learners to write; so hastie reading of the Arte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, will avayle little unto those who would practise the same, according to these Proverbes, which haue some affinitie together, <hi>Legere, &amp; non intelligere, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligere est:</hi> And oftentimes, <hi>The more haste, the</hi>

      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And as hee is not the owner of the Fruite of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> Orchard, who leapeth in over the Dykes thereof, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Fruites before they bee rype, not daring to enter at the Yate of the same: even so hee who turneth over manie Leaues in the midst of a Booke, without due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration what is contayned in each one particularlie, and orderlie, (with the revolution thereof) as it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and entereth not at the beginning, may well gette some tasting of greene Fruite, to asswadge his appetite a while, (though hee spill his Teeth:) but the right use of all indeede belongeth unto him, who is the Master of the Keyes and Entrie, walketh thorow orderlie as he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> listeth, and but plucketh as bee eateth. Wee see they are not the fattest Sheepe which make most travell, and over-hale their meate, when they haue plentie; but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se which make a slow pace, rest themselues oftentimes, and ruminate, or revolue, that which they gather.</p>
   <p>Therefore, since there is little pleasure, without sone industrie, and that few thinges can be blowne up at once, like Glasses, neyther by action, nor consideration; haue a little patience, (I pray thee, both for thine owne profite, and my credite) to reade, consider, and practise this Worke, even forwardes, as it is set downe, without a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap> omission at all, and as little intermission as thou mayest, lest thou hardlie escape the former inconvenients, and by occasion thereof blame mee innocentlie for thine owne fault.</p>
   <p>I confesse, it is farre yet from that sublimitie of stile.
<pb facs="5"/> whereat I hope it will bee: yet accept of it as it is. (as a Pledge of my Loue) untill it shall please GOD that I amende it: for the Building can bee but sober, which is begunne, accomplished, plenished, and garnished, all in such haste, without both longer deliberation, and greater preparation.</p>
   <p>If anie parte heereof may seeme eyther obscure or doubtfull, (as I trust there bee fewe) misconstrue not mine intention and meaning therein, because it tendeth to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hy weale, in so far as I am able: but I advise thee to seek <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>esolution rather of those who bee well experimented, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>han eyther to rest in discontentment, or yet pronounce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>imes a fault will appeare to bee, where it is not.</p>
   <p>And if thou, through thy diligent searching, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ere examining, finde some indeede, (as at this time I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>annot altogether cleanse it) judge verie charitab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ie: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>he rather because it is farre easier to finde a fault in a Worke even well wrought by another, than to worke the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ike thy selfe without a fault, found by some other who perhaps cannot doe so well. I haue seene a young Mason, that could scarcelie hew a Stone, espie a defect in a fayre Palace, accidentlie in one day, which an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, each one whereof more Skilfull than hee, haue bene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eaven yeares in building.</p>
   <p>So, it is verie easie unto thee, having as it were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans Candle in thine hand, to beholde him, and his doinges therewith▪ for thou holding it up unto him while as hee writeth, and thou the meane time standing ydle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hy selfe, thou mayest easilie perceiue when hee writeth
<pb facs="6"/> wrong: because, though his face bee towardes the Pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> as thine is, yet his minde is bended to manie airthes at once, and thine onelie to one: hee hath to consider, and to choose out of manie thinges what is best to bee written, as also both what hee hath written, and hath to write, the Matter, Inditement, Method, Language, and Letters, but thou hast onelie to take notise what is done, and the manner of the doing: hee hath not onelie thee to please in his doinges, but another who perhaps hath as c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an head, and yet of a contrarie minde: the third of another opinion: and so foorth. And therefore, though one man could doe never so well, it is verie hard, yea, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for him to please multitudes, because of his one opinion, device, plotte, and conceite, and of their plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie and diversitie of opinions, devices, plottes, and conceites.</p>
   <p>In like manner, because it is farre easier to finde a fault, than mende a fault, if in my time thou come speede by finding, I hope thou wilt play the parte of a discreete Premonitor, and eyther advertise mee thereof mildlie and favourablie, that I may timouslie amende the same, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> the next <hi>Impression,</hi> (GOD willing) and I will gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> thee heartilie thankes for thy good will: or if thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> not, I beseech thee, to passe by the same with silence and modestie, untill it bee repaired, eyther by mee, or so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> other. But if otherwise thou make choyse to declare the same to others, who perhaps will rather make it ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, by jesting; than blamelesse, by amending, thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestest as much thine owne follie, as my negligence▪ for none liue without faultes, and though thou com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="6"/> not such, yet perhaps an hundreth worse daylie: for in so doing, thou both wishest, and seekest, rather the infamie of one, wherewith to feede thy solatious and phantasticke humour, than the common weale of all, whereat thou art bound to rejoyce.</p>
   <p>Againe, if indeede thou makest choyse to become a Challenger and detracter of others, by thy scandalous or slanderous reporte, it is a sure token that thou art desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of wisedome and discretion thy selfe: yet if thou hast anie courtesie, or gentilitie, though never so little, I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>erswaded thou wilt neither steale a dint of mee behinde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>y backe, yea, scarcelie before my face, untill thou first advertise mee, that I may bee as well guarded with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>espondent weapons to defende, as I haue heere armed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>hee wherewith to persue: I meane, thou wilt not fayle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>mplie written of before, (without anie colouring of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ther mens Workes) and write as largelie thereon, as I, under GOD, haue done of this; that, if it bee pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

   <p>So having no farther occasion in this place, to detaine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
