   <head>THE PREFACE TO
THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Could much haue vvished that Sir Francis Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinges,
vvho geueth himself for author of a
certayne iniurious pamphlet, published some
monethes past, agaynst Catholiques, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled:
<hi>Avvache-vvord,</hi> or vvhosoeuer made
that byting libel for him, vvith intention to
dishonor him vvith the title, as on the one syde, he nameth
himself knight (and all men knovv the Hastinges to be of a
verie honorable familie, and one also to be knight of that
name) so on the other, had he obserued some terme and stile
of nobilitie or gentrie in his vvryting: in vvhich case, I had
either vvholy spared this labour of ansvvering him at all,
leauing him only to the censure and rebuke of his equals, for
medling in so base an excercise, as calumniation and rayling
is, in this his old yeares, or at leastvvise, should he haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
his check and refutation, vvith that regard of vvorship
and honor, as othervvise had byn due to his rank, place,
and person.</p>
   <p>But fynding him so far forgetful of all knightly tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in his tongue, and of all ciuil cariage in the drift and
current of his book, as he holdeth no rule or limit of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie
at all, but inraged rather (as it seemeth) vvith a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
veyne of inuectiue spirit, spareth neither God nor man,
so far forth as they concerne the catholique cause, or the cause
them: he must beare vvith me, and lay it to his ovvne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits,
<pb facs="3"/>
if I be driuen to encounter vvith him in some more
egar and sharp manner, at certayne meetinges, then either
I allovv of by myne ovvne lyking, or then the reuerend res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
I carie to his house and familie, and the particuler affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
I feele tovvardes some of his ovvne name and linage,
vvould othervvise haue induced me.</p>
   <p>VVho vvill not confesse, but that lying, forging, and fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
ignorant vaunting, odious scoffyng, malitious calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations,
seditious interpretations, bloodie exaggerations,
Barbarous in sultations ouer them that already are in affliction
and calamitie, ought to be far from the nature, pen, and
tongue of a knight or gentleman? and yet these are the flovvers
or rather furies of this skolding discourse, as aftervvard you
shall see by that vvhich is to be treated. VVherin if the lyues
honors, states, and liuinges, of home-borne subiectes, vvere
only touched, and brought in question (as they be) it vvere
more tolerable, though no vvay tolerable, being don vniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly,
but the heat of this hastie knight resteth not here, but
rusheth further, to the open assault of forayne monarches also,
their honors, fame, and reputation, vvhich is lesse tolerable,
and consequently, hath need of some more sharpe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
reiection.</p>
   <p>The violence of the Puritan spirit is not vnknovven to the
vvise of England: vvherunto also France and Scotland vvil
beare sufficient vvitnesse. It hath byn kept dovvne many
yeares, by the valour and prudenee of the Protestant, and
the knovven professors therof haue byn held leane and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie
by her Maiestie, to no smale benefyt of publique peace
and so may be stil, vvhyle the Catholique partie hath
also some poyse and svvay in the balance agaynst them. If
Sir Francis be one of them, it may seeme perhaps expedient
in his vvisdome, that (her Maiestie grovving novv fast in
yeares) thinges be brought to some trial by garboile in her
dayes, for that aftervvard, more then one parte may chance
<pb facs="3"/>
to ioyne agaynst them: vvherfore if they might novv oppresse
the catholique partie by the hand of her Maiestie, their ovvne
vvould serue aftervvardes more easely to do the lyke agaynst
her and hers, and the vvay and meanes to effectuate them
both may seeme perhappes no vvise to be more potent or
speedie, then to dryue many at home to desperation, by
feares and terrors of oppressions, and by opprobrious iniuries,
and personnal slaunders, to inforce forayne princes, of the
same religion, to implacable yre and indignation. And this
is the proper course that Sir Francis taketh, throughout his
vvhole sedious vvach-vvord. VVhich to couer the better, he
falleth to extreme flaterie of the other syde, espetially of
the state, and of her Maiesties person in particuler; vvhich
are the fittest baytes to couer such hookes, as angle after popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
fauor, for a further fetche.</p>
   <p>To this man then I am to ansvver, as the substance and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his accusations, fictions, or calumniations, shall
leade me, reducing all that I am to saie, for better order and
memorie, to eight or nyne principal heades, branches, and
argumentes, vnder the name of encounters, vvherin I dout
not, but the apparent truth of diuers poyntes vvil come to
light, vvhich hitherto haue layen hidden and obscure, in the
vnderstanding of many, hoping that the discret reader vvill
passe ouer these fevv lynes, vvith a beneuolent, or at least,
an indifferent eye; reseruing the final iudgment of all, to the
Lordes of her Maiesties Councell; vvhome, I my self haue
chosen for vmpires and arbitres of the vvhole controuersie,
and so I end this entrance and vvil passe to my first combat
and incounter vvith Sir Francis Hastinges.</p>
   <signed>Your harty freend that vvisheth your best and greatest good, N. D.</signed>
