      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLE Reader, with the vnskilful archers of our times, I did first aime and shoote at the publique good and profit, according to the trust reposed in me, and now as one that hath lost his arrowe, and missed his marke, I have at al adventures dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the second time, to the ende that my second labours may drawe home my first losses, if my hande be fortunate to pearce the secret partes of thy tender and kinde affections, and move in thee a friendly acceptaunce of these my rude labours; if not, looke no more for my returne to accompany the pleasaunt fieldes, and meddowes, for henceforth I take vp my habitation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst the rockes and deserts, where my arrowes may not pearce, nor the strength of my bowe withstand the bitter windes, and the harde and hoary frostes, where I shall no more play the foole with <hi>Solon</hi> in the market-place, but the wilde man in the desertes. But if thou shalt vouchsafe to recall so vnskilfull an archer againe into the fieldes, I may perhaps winne a bet, that shall pay for the losse of a rubber. Receive then, <hi>Solon</hi> his folly, not as a testimony of his skill, but rather of the goodwil he beareth vnto thee, and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whereof if thou shalt make acceptaunce, the same is thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and not his: which with thy bounty and goodnes, hast now overcome as well the giver, as the gift. But if thou shalt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it by his owne proper woorth, he hath fore-tolde thee the valewe thereof, and before thy face hath now waighed the same in equall ballance, with <hi>Solon</hi> his follie, but not with his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
