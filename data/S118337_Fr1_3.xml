                 <title>The Spanish pilgrime: or, An admirable discouery of a Romish Catholicke : Shewing how necessary and important it is, for the Protestant kings, princes, and potentates of Europe, to make warre vpon the King of Spaines owne countrey: also where, and by what meanes, his dominions may be inuaded and easily ruinated; as the English heretofore going into Spaine, did constraine the kings of Castile to demand peace in all humility, and what great losse it hath beene, and still is to all Christendome, for default of putting the same in execution. Wherein hee makes apparant by good and euident reasons, infallible arguments, most true and certaine histories, and notable examples, the right way, and true meanes to resist the violence of the Spanish King, to breake the course of his designes, to beate downe his pride, and to ruinate his puissance</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendly Reader, thou hast in this little Pamphlet an incomparable treasure, a rich store-house and magazin full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious speeches, true Histories, rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, liuely reasons, and wholsome counsels: the which if their Maiesties, and the Kings, Princes, Potentates, and Common-weales of Christendome would embrace, follow, and put in execution, without doubt they should soone obtaine and find a medicine for so many mischiefes, a remedy for so great and continuall afflictions and intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable trauels, wherewith their Subiects haue for so many yeeres wrastled and contended. And I dare assure them, that by obseruing the aduise here giuen them, they shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue their Estates in time to come from all danger: for euen as the great fishes doe persecute and deuoure the small and little ones; so in like manner those neighbours which are most mighty and puissant, doe despoile and consume the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who are of lesse puissance. Now we know that there are two especiall reasons for which the Authour hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed and drawne out at length this his Discourse, enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with Histories so singular, and beautifying it with such rare authorities and examples. The former is: for that, as he hath endeuoured liuely to depaint vnto vs our enemy, and to make vs know the naturall disposion of those Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of whom we haue great cause to take good heed; seeing that all that which he hath spoken, doth set forward this his intent and purpose, he saw it would not be any inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to vse therein some prolixity. If a man by compact, as
<pb facs="5"/> bound thereto by another, or of his owne proper motion and free will, and vpon curiosity, would vndertake a voyage of some three or foure leagues, not hauing any time prefixed nor limited for dispatch thereof, what harme would it be vnto him, if in his passage he doe find some Gardens where he may recreate and refresh himselfe, from the trauell and wearisomenesse of the way? So doe you my Masters reade this Treatise at your pleasure, vse it for your recreation, and take your delight in the sweete odours of her flowres and pleasant posies. You neede make no great hast, there is no man that doth vrge you thereto. A second reason of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity of this Treatise, is, for that as the Author is driuen of necessity to handle the vertues and the vices of diuers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and sundry Nations: so his will was, that each of them should haue his due desert: the good and those that haue done well, praise and honour; but the euill and vitious, blame and reprehension. In the end of this Treatise you shall find the explication which he promiseth, Fol. 143; in the which there are many things both of great curiosity, and also as necessary to the matter in hand as any of the rest. For that in knowledge, vnderstanding, and experience, hee doth farre exceed me, as his worke doth shew apparantly. Touching the which briefly, I dare not affirme any thing, but this, that each word of his is a sentence, and that each sentence containeth many. I must confesse, that to some persons in particular, his Treatise will be ill accepted: but what remedy? he hath spoken but the truth, and what he affirmeth he proueth, and hee alledgeth nothing without his Authour to iustifie it. And truly I for my part am of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion: that it is not against reason, to publish the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and vices of some one particular person, which being true, may be made knowne to euery man, especially when the knowledge thereof may redound to the great good and benefit of the weale publike. But to come to an end, let me entreat you to take in good part that which I haue said.</p>
