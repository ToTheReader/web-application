Insomuch, that when I had well considerd alltogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I saide with miself, concerning this, as did a certein lerned mā, not long ago, by Homer: This is the fift time, I haue redde ouer this author: and as oft as I reade him, so oft som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what I finde, that I marked not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and that hath neede to be deeply pondered: so y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I fansied, at the first,

he was easie: but now, methinks, he requires a verie heedfull, &amp; a musing reader. Wherfore, not without mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous greate pleasure, espyeng: y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> either in priuate life, to attein quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and contentation: or in office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, to winne fame, &amp; honour: or in euerie estate, bothe to auoyde disorder, and enormitie, and also to keepe a right rule, &amp; commēdable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour: this boke playnly is y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of wisdom, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> fortres of iustice, the master of manlinesse, the schoole of temperance, the iewell of cōmeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: I wisshed, many mo to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teners of such sweetnesse, as I had partly felt myself: &amp; to declare, that I mēt nolesse, thā I wisshed: I laied to, my helping hand: endeuouring, by translation, to do likewise for my contriemēne: as Italiās, Frēchmē, Spaniardes, Dutchmē, &amp; other fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reins haue liberally done for theyrs. So, chiefly for our vnlatined people I haue made this latine writer, eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish: &amp; haue now brought into light, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> from them so longe was hidden: &amp; haue caused an aunciēt wryting to beecōme, in a maner, newe agayne:
<pb facs="4"/>
and a boke, vsed but of fewe, to war cōmon to a great meany: so that our mē, vnderstāding, what atreasure is amonge them, for the fashioning of their life: and beeing by nature most of all other nations giuē to ciuilitie, &amp; humanitie: whē thei shall be aided, &amp; directed by these perfite precepts: may, in all pointes of good demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, becōme people perelesse.</p>
   <p>Yet iudge I all this labour litle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthe, &amp; smally, or nothing able to preuaile: withoute your honorable lordship were patrone herof: to whō I do dedicate bothe my good hert, &amp; my worke also: (I call it mine, as Plautus, and Terence called the comedies theyrs, which they made oute of Greeke) not as to teache your lordshipp ought, that you haue not allredy: but by your authoritie, to gett it the more estimacion w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> other. For as Tullies treatise, beeing so full of lerning, asketh alerned mans iudgement: which whoso refuse, thei showe themselues to be vnwise: euē so such a noble Coūseler of Englād seemeth most meete to receiue so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Senatour of Rome into a
<pb facs="4"/>
straunge region. Doutlesse among so many honorable deedes of your lordships, it shall not be the leste ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable: if ye do Marcus Tullius this honour, to welcōme him hither: and to be the verie cause, that so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Romane may becomme fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with our English men.</p>
   <p>So shall a worthy pere be worthylie entreated: as very curtesie requireth: so your lordshipps iudgement must needes be well lyked: which is wōte to alow louely knowledge, &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: so wyll the cōmon people more hyely esteeme the thing: as it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for them to do: and the soner also will they folow these hollsome lessons: which is full necessarie, in a well ordered state: to be short, your lordship, for a chosen patrone: my translation, for a welcome worke: &amp; Tullie shall be takē for such a Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as he is. And like as Marc{us} Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the authoritie of a father, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended these bokes to his yonge Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero: so whē our English youth shall beholde them once authorised by so reuerend a father in god: nodoute, they will be the rather in loue with
<pb facs="5"/>
them: and will counte it pleasaunt paines taking, here to enriche them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with enformations of vertue, ensaumples oute of stories, morall doctrine, politike prudēce, antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, varietie of maruailous maters: so conningly, &amp; oratorially treated, and endited: as hee was able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, &amp; expresse: who was the first, and the chief, that euer cladde ladie Philosophie in Romane attire. Thus, verie lothe to let your lordship from your weighty affaires, I make an end: &amp; praye god, longe to preserue your hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable lordship in helth, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
