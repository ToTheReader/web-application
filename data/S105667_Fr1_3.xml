   <head>To the curteous Reader.</head>
   <p>IT is reported of the Eagle, that
she opposeth her yonglinges against the
face of the Sun, meaning therby, to make
trial, and haue certaine knowledge, which
bee natural Eagles, and whiche bee bastard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
branches: they that can looke directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Sun, she admitteth for her owne,
those that are constrayned to winke, shee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudeth
out of her nest. Her in I may resemble
my selfe to the Eagle, who being the inuēter
of this treatise, haue laid it open to the eies of
alimen: that is, to the eies of the world: which
Ouid in his metamorphosis applieth to the
Sun:<note place="margin">Sol oculi Mundi.</note> now if it be indewed with this felicitie,
that it can abide the stern visage of seuere sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
the pearsing eies of curious Gentlemen,
&amp; the critical censures of the learned Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mickes,
I wil chalenge and cherish it as a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
issue: otherwise refuse and reiect it,
as misbegotten: hauing more of Amphitrio,
then of Iupiter: of fancie then of reasō. I haue
long time sacrificed my studies to Angerona,
the Goddesse of silence, laying my finger on
my lippes, and saying nothing: foreseeing
that if I shoulde rubbe the galle, rippe the
impostume, ransacke the kannell of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
opinions, (worldlye I tearme them,
as beeing bredde in the worlde, receiued
of the worlde, and practised by worldlings:
by worldlinges, I meane the most and the
worste, most fonde and worst minded), I
shoulde stirre vppe Waspes, and haue my
wordes intertained with nipping gloses, and
<pb facs="5"/>
returned home with a bitter farewel: but sith
it is no shame to write against such, againste
whome not to write is a great shame: I haue
taken courage vnto me, and brought against
thē a cōpleat legion. If I shold haue inueigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Satires, I shoulde haue seemed too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
if I should haue iested by Epigrammes, I
might seem too captious: if by Commedies.
I should coppy out their liues, they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōpt
me too scurrilous: if by tragedies I shold
lamēt their maners, they wold iudge me too
scrupulous: therefore vsing the name of
Christian Philosophie, I doe meane nether to
fray thē, with the title, nor to flatter thē with
the treatise: but mine indeuour is speciallie
bent, to allure them by lenitye, to win them
by parley, and to conuince thē rather by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
then by confusion: but if this first
trumpet which I haue sounded against them
do giue me a signe of their obstinate resistāce
after this legion displayed, I will encounter
thē (by the grace of God) with a whole armie
of reasons: setting thee curteous Reader on
the top of Tarpey, where thou maist easelye
behold the cōflict and warfar of the Romans
&amp; Sabines, fighting in the valleis of Hetru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria:
neither bend thy body to the one side nor
wag thy hand to the other: but with both eies
behold both, so shal we both be beholden to
thee, and being iustified by a righteous sē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tēce,
giue thee the comēdation of an vpright
Iudge. Farewel &amp; be not partiall.</p>
