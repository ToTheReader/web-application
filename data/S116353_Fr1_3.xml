   <head>LECTVRES OR SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONS VPON THE WHOLE BOOKE of IVDGES: and first, the entrance into them.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Confesse, it is no small matter for a man to take vpon him to set foorth Lectures or Sermons of any part of the word of God, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of an whole booke thereof: and the rather for that it is a matter of much greater difficultie and danger so to doe, then to preach them (seeing for mine owne part, I would easilier be brought to preach three Sermons, then to set foorth or penne one:) and besides, we see that learned men (I speake of many) who might for their excellent gifts profit many, and doe the Church much good, are haraly drawne thereto. I leaue their reasons to themselues: perhaps they thinke it a needlesse worke to set foorth more bookes. For mine owne part, I knowing that many would reade little, if there were not new bookes set foorth, I thinke it to good purpose to labour in that kinde: especially when the things set foorth are for the quickening vp of the present drowsie age. And so I testifie my iudgement by my writings, that I am of another minde: not for that I would dissent from learned men, or seeke glorie and praise by this my practise, when (to speake as the truth is) I confesse freely, that <note place="margin">Reasons of this my attempt.</note> as I come many degrees behinde them in gifts for that purpose: so I would not take vpon me this exercise of writing, vnlesse I were led to it by waightie reasons: but in the simplicitie of my heart I speake it, that I set myselfe to this worke, as I can haue time and leisure from my publike imployment in my Ministerie, and other priuate duties, euen to keepe myselfe from danger in this euill world, as idlenesse, too much tampering in the world, and such like needlesse and hurtfull besinesse, as well as for the desire I haue to benefit any other hereby: and besides, I thinke it better to benefit the Church while wee liue, being but a short time, (other may rise vp after to perfit such beginnings) then to burie our gifts vtterly, and so to depriue it altogether of the same by death.</p>
   <p>Also I see that euery age of men hath sundrie troubles annexed to it (the old as well as the young) and occasions are offered of sinning and offending God many waies by one occasion or other, which are not thought of before they come. In so much as when the danger of youth and of the former yeeres of our life is passed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wara peace, and without any grosse and iust offence to others (which yet to doe is few mens cases, and rarely obtained, and not without much striuing and watching to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the straight gate:) yet the diuell so much the more enuieth our credit in the Church, and the comfort we haue from God, in such an estate, especially the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: and therefore hee doth the more bend his force against such, that hee may in their latter end disgrace them by winding them into some reprochfull and foule of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: that so he may (as much as in him lieth) make their former vertues and part of life, to be ridiculous and of no account.</p>
   <p>And therefore, as I am not ashamed to confesse, that I haue receiued wonderfull
<pb facs="7"/>
cause of thanksgiuing to God, for his so great bountie and fauour towards me (the most vnworthie) in my younger yeeres, to keepe me from the infection of the time, and sins of the age wherein I haue liued, (yet God be mercifull to my many slips and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities) so I am not (I say) ashamed to confesse, that I feare in this my declining age, hasting apace to the graue (as with griefe of heart I haue seene in many) that I may possibly, yea and that full easily, be drawne to an vnprofitable, earthly, idle, and dead course of life, and thereby, to greater offending of God, and blemishing of my profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Ministerie, vnlesse I should labour to preuent it by some set labour and study, and so to hold fast that which I haue receiued of the Lord: and that is, by the occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying and vsing the gifts which he hath giuen me, as in this kinde of studie, namely of writing, I may: and also if I should not endeuour to grow forward in grace, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 17.</note> and in the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ, (from the which a man may be easily hindred by the error of the wicked) rather then to looke what I haue done heretofore, I might easily flatter myselfe thereby, and so (at least) stand at a stay: or (which is worse) goe backe, and so lose my part of happinesse with them that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to the end. For I make chiefe account of that, hauing it not in fruition as yet, but by hope onely: and I know it may easily and many waits be hindred and staied, as Satan can handle the matter, and as I see many goe to worke. And for this cause I desire to be occupied vntill the Lord come, and in this manner, hauing more then one foote in the graue. And to the end I may tye myselfe to liue the freer from dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous falles and offences, while I am here a stranger and absent from home, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I say, I haue set myselfe to this kinde of worke, as being not able through debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of body, and lamenes, to trauaile abroad, and helpe other neighbours, more then at home, by preaching, as I haue done since I first began (where my labour was desired:) and by conferring much, as occasion was offered, as I vsed in health to doe. And if any laugh at this which I haue said of my fearing myselfe, as thinking it meere folly, I cannot doe with it, neither am moued for their so censuring me: but I tell them this, that while they feare not their frailtie also but count it foolishnes, they hast apace to vtter miserie.</p>
   <p>Now for taking this booke in hand, to set out my Sermons vpon it, which I haue before preached, though I haue gone ouer, in the course of my Ministerie, many other besides this: I take this booke in hand, not as making comparison betwixt it and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bookes of Scripture: but partly seeing no Lectures or Sermons are set out vpon it, that I know, to giue light and helpe to such as need it: and partly at the earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of those that heard my Sermons on it: and if I may know and perceiue my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in this to be thought worth the setting foorth, I would be willing, as much as in me lieth, to doe the like in some other booke. In this worke, beside the people, who are not brought vp in learning, who may see that their whole life may be directed hereby and may much profit by it, so I intended also in it to benefit Students and Preachers, who are not yet experienced: nor best furnished with matter for the edifying of the hearers: so that beside the fruite they may reape hereby in common with the people; so they may learne how to make vse of the historicall part of the Bible, and learne to draw doctrine and instruction out of the examples thereof, fit for the people (and that out of the bad as well as the good) euen as well as out of other Scripture: which all haue not learned to doe, neither haue attained vnto: and therefore doe oft times of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer violence to the Scriptures, by making allegories of them, and so wresting them to another sense then the holy Ghost hath made of them; without which manner of handling them, they can draw none or little matter out of the most examples in the
<pb facs="7"/>
stories of them: and so beside that their doctrine is not soundly gathered, so they giue too fearefull suspition to the ignorant, that such parts of the Scripture are barraine and drie, while they doe by such shifts, and yet indirect, so hardly draw matter and doctrine out of them, when yet it is certaine and cleere, that they are full of sound instruction.</p>
   <p>But to come to my purpose, I will now set downe some generall things before I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the text, which may giue some light to the better vnderstanding of the whole book: such as I gather partly, by obseruing &amp; laying together that which I read in it, (comparing one thing with another:) and partly out of that learned and reuerend Father Master <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> whose workes neither the most priuate men can vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, nor many Ministers, though they may vnderstand them, can come by, neither if they can, shall they finde there, that which shall be much for their simpler hearers benefit.</p>
   <p>And first let the reader marke, how this booke agreeth with all the former, from Genesis to the end of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and what is the summe of them and this. Concerning the booke of Genesis, after mention is made (in the beginning of it) of the creation of the world, and the generations to the flood: it doth afterward shew, how God chose his people out of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his posteritie, and how they were sent into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt to auoid the famine. In Exodus these things are the principall: how the people of God multiplied and increased in the land of Egypt, till there rose a King who cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly oppressed and vexed them sore: and how they were deliuered out of the bondage, which they were in there, by <hi>Moses:</hi> and how they had lawes giuen them, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them And this last point is the summe of Leuiticus also. The booke of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers declareth their diuers resting places in the desert, and their goings forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the land of Canaan. In Deuteronomy, <hi>Moses</hi> being to depart out of this world, and to leaue the people, doth most faithfully repeate the law to the generation which came after the former, and which then liued, I meane, to the posteritie of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Then came <hi>Ioshua</hi> and led the people into the promised land, and diuided the land of the Amorites and Canaanites, which partly was subdued and gotten out of their hands, and partly remained to be conquered: he (I say) diuided it amongst the twelue tribes, according to the commandement of God, after he had brought them ouer Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, slaine many of the Kings of Canaan, and possessed their cities and grounds in that countrey. This is the summe and contents of the booke of <hi>Ioshua.</hi> After his death, (to come to our purpose) the Lord gouerned his people the Hebrewes, being placed in that land, by Iudges: whom to that end he indued with excellent gifts, and by them deliuered and kept the people out of the hands of their enemies, who as yet did all the daies of the Iudges remaine in great numbers to vex them.</p>
   <p>But to vnderstand better the meaning of the word [Iudges] a materiall point in this booke to be vnderstood, though to iudge signifie to know the cases of such as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and be at variance, and to giue sentence of iudgement betwixt men: yet these Iudges mentioned in this booke, had not that office, neither were called Iudges in that respect. But (as the word signifieth also, to reuenge and to redeeme out of bondage) thus did those Iudges deliuer and redeeme the people, as in this booke is at large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. (I speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> not of <hi>Samuel,</hi> who is said after, to iudge them also, by deciding <note place="margin">1. Sam. 7. 6. and 15.</note> controuersies and ciuill causes) But these Iudges had that office assigned them of God, to deliuer the people (as I haue said) out of their enemies hands, and so to iudge them: and therefore were called by that name of Iudges, and this booke that intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of them and their acts throughout, is called, <hi>The booke of Iudges.</hi>

And briefly to lay out the state and condition that these people, the Hebrewes, then liued in: whereby the office of the Iudges may the better be vnderstood: they hauing not yet conquered the land, were occupied (as at their first entrance into it, and after <hi>Ioshuas</hi> death a while) in subduing it, and their enemies: but afterward they suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to remaine, and become tributaries to them, and were thereby (as God saw it meete, and as need required) in great perill and miserie by them, and then, because they were his people, lest they should haue been vtterly destroyed, these Iudges were raised vp by him, without the election of men, to rescue and deliuer them. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when they were at rest, and peace, God gouerned them not by those Iudges: (therefore <hi>Iphtah,</hi> when he was desired, would not raigne ouer them) neither had they authoritie ouer them: but he vsed the help of someother excellent persons, fit by their vertues and gifts for that purpose, and they ruled the people: but the Iudges (as I said) were stirred vp by the Lord, in great dangers, brought vpon them by their enemies, to be helpers and deliuerers vnto them, and to keepe them in peace af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, while they lined. So that these Iudges were not chosen by succession, as Kings: neither by the voyces of the people. but were raised vp by God (as wee haue heard) indifferently, as well out of one tribe as another: and how meane and vnfit soeuer they were before, for that purpose: God did furnish them by and by after he had stirred them vp, with most excellent gifts for that end, to the which he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. And it went farre better with the people while they were vnder them, then it did afterward, when they would needs haue a King to raigne ouer them. For they did alwaies deliuer the people of Israel out of the calamitie with which they were oppressed: whereas their Kings did sometimes waste them, and bring them into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, and were (the most part of them) Idolaters.</p>
   <p>And although vnder the Iudges, the people were somtimes oppressed grieuously by strangers, and especially vnder <hi>Samson</hi> by the Philistims (for why? we must know, their horrible sinnes deserued it, and prouoked God to deale with them in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:) yet they were neuer led into captiuitie while they liued with them. Againe, there were few of the Kings good men, in Israel, not one: the Iudges (for the most part) were all such. A good testimonie whereof, we haue in the Epistle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes: where we thus reade of the commendation of them: <hi>The time would be too short for me to speake of Gedeon, Barak, Iphtah, and Samson:</hi> these the holy Ghost commendeth. And though some of them (as men) did sometime fall, yet we are to thinke they returned and rose vp againe: seeing the Scripture (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) doth neuer condemne them. So that in respect of them, and by their helpe, (if the people could haue seene it and made benefit of it) we may say, they liued in a golden age.</p>
   <p>Now whereas it is not so apparantly to be seene, that this booke doth set foorth Christ vnto vs, in all the commendations of these Iudges: (who yet is the end of all bookes of Scripture) to such as demaund about it, I answere: that Christ is not cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set foorth in any of those bookes of the old Testament first written: but darkly, and by types and figures, as God saw it meete for those ages: and so wee are to thinke of this booke, where the deliuerances from so great enemies, as are mentioned herein, are types of that great deliuerance and redemption of men wrought by Christ, out of the iawes of the diuell. And let the commending of sundrie of those Iudges by the holy Ghost satisfie vs, that they could not haue been good men, nor haue liued by faith, as they were said to haue done, if they had not beleeued in Christ, and been sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby. Besides, what authoritie shall we giue to the old Testament, if they who
<pb facs="9"/>
are commended in it, to haue been men of God, as diuers Kings and Prophets, with many other, did not liue and walke by faith, (seeing it is not expressely set downe) without which they could not please God?</p>
   <p>Now the summe of this booke is thus much: first, a declaration generally, of the estate of the religion and manner of worshipping God, which these Israelites vsed in their Common wealth from the death of <hi>Ioshua</hi> to <hi>Eli</hi> the Priest, (for the storie of <hi>Ruth</hi> containes things done in the daies of the Iudges, Ruth <hi>1. 1.)</hi> and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly this booke layeth out their sinnes, and Gods calling them out of them by sundrie warnings and iudgements, vnto repentance, with many fearefull examples of their reuolting and turning backe againe: whereby may bee seene how corrupt they were both in religion and manners: and this booke is a liuely glasse (if we well consider it) of this our age.</p>
   <p>The parts of the booke are three. The first setteth downe the slouthfulnesse of the Tribes in executing the commandements of God against their enemies, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment threatned for it, Chap. <hi>1.</hi> and <hi>2.</hi> and their slouthfulnesse is illustrated by the contrarie course of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> (who were forward to goe against them) as in Chapter <hi>1.</hi> to verse <hi>21.</hi> is to be seene. The second part is from the <hi>2.</hi> chapter to the <hi>17.</hi> which treateth of the Iudges, and their great actes, according to occasions offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who in their due time were raised vp. The third part is from chapter <hi>17.</hi> to the end: and setteth foorth some odious and monstrous acts committed in those confused times, when there was no ordinarie Gouernour: and therewithall, the punishments which followed.</p>
   <p>The author of this booke is vnknowne, but yet the booke is canonicall, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed also by the new Testament. The time of the actes of it, from the death of <hi>Ioshua</hi> to <hi>Eli</hi> the high Priest, is gathered to be about <hi>300,</hi> yeeres. The end of this booke (as shall better appeare in the particular handling of it) is to instruct and perswade vs, in this latter age of the world, to carry our selues vprightly, and in a streight and well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred course, both in prosperitie and aduersitie: I meane, to hold the feare of God in both, and to keep hope and patience in and through out this our pilgrimage, with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and repentance: which if we do, God will be no lesse with vs, then he was with the good people mentioned herein.</p>
   <p>The order which I purpose to obserue in the Lectures vpon this booke, is first to giue the short summe of the Chapters: then to deuide euery Chapter into parts, for the better distinguishing the points thereof, that they may be better vnderstood, and more clearely seene into: thirdly, I giue the sense of the verses more fully, and lay forth the doctrine with the reasons, and vse thereof, though for the most part, they be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies expressely set downe, which manner of handling the diuerse histories of this booke (as also I thinke the same of our preaching out of all other Scriptures) namely, that after the meaning and sense, apt and fit instruction should bee drawne out, with the application to the present state, need, and vse of the hearers, plainely and pitbily as may be for their best edifying I hold meetest to be vsed.</p>
   <p>And I weuld to God, that there were consent giuen therto of al Preachers, and that this course were aimed at: I wish that euery one did not follow his owne priuate course who hath neuer learned any good way or order of preaching. Whereby it commeth to passe, that some fill their Sermons with the froth of their owne braines, or the bare au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of men, and least proofe is brought out of the Scriptures: Also some preach darkely to the little benefiting of the hearers, not to mention all which were endlesse.
<pb facs="10"/>
And although for many other things I leaue the consideration therof to my reuerend and learned brethren, yet in this I hope without ostentation, and arrogating ought to myselfe, I may be allowed to speake: in regard of the long time which I haue spent in studying, learning, and practising (as I haue been able) the holie exercise of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And now to end these my Lectures, this I say: that beside the varietie of much good therein contained, there are some points to good purpose, occasioned touching faith, and repentance: and sundrie directions giuen how to seeke the Lord when we haue slipped, and how to beare trouble aright.</p>
   <p>Thus much I thought good to say before I enter into the seuerall Sermons, euen to this end, that some good light may be giuen, as to him that marketh duly it may appeare. Now I will proceed to the text itselfe.</p>
