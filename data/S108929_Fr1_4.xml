   <head>THE AVTHOR TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a thing notorious, good Christian reader, that the bread, vvhich vve dailie eate, is not so necessarie for the maintenance of our natural life, as is the doctrine of the vvoord of God, for the conseruation of oure spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life. This doctrine teacheth vs tvvo principal things, to prate, and to vvoorke; vnto vvhich tvvo, be reduced al others vvhat-soeuer. Of these tvvo things infinite bookes haue ben vvriten. But for as much as this doctrine is so neceessarie at euerie foote-steppe that vve make (by reason of the continual dangers, and temptations of our life) I haue determined to resume heere in fevv vvoords (gathered out of al mie bookes) that vvhich hath seemed to me most fit for this purpose;
<note place="margin">Sixe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of this booke.</note> to the end thou maist easilie beare about vvith the in thie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, that vvhich ought to be alvva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s vvriten in thie heart. And therfore I haue heere gathered and put together <hi>Sixe briefe treatises;</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> one of <hi>Mental praier,</hi> taken ovvt of mie booke of Praier and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, vvith al the fourteene meditations abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiated, vvhich vvere there set doune. And this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
<pb facs="7"/>I haue put in the first place, because these me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, besides that they giue vs abundant matter vvhereof to meditate, be also the best persuasions and motiues that can be found, to bring men to liue vvel and vertuouslie. So that yf they serue not in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning for the exercise of meditation, yet they vvil serue for persvvasion to induce men to the feare of God, and changement of life. But because al men dooe not so much giue them selues to th'exercise of meditation, ether for their diuers affairs, or for other reasons vvhich they may haue; therfore that these also vvant not the succour and help of praier, I haue added an other treatise of <hi>vocal praier,</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> conteining manie praiers, vvhich serue to obteine such vertues, as be most necessarie for th'edification of our sovvles.</p>
   <p>Trulie al holie scripture doth euerie vvhere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto vs, the neede vvhich vve haue of these tvvo exercises, because they be the vveapons, vvhich vve haue most readie and at hand against our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by vvhome vve be alvvais enuironed; &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vve must goe vvel armed vvith them, as long as our life lasteth. Heerehence it is that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour the night of his passion armed his disciples vvith praier,
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.41.</note> saying vnto them; <hi>vvatch ye and praie that ye enter not into tentation:</hi> and Dauid armed him self vvith meditation vvhen he said;
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 118.29.</note>
      <hi>vvere it not</hi> (o lord) <hi>that thy lavv is my meditation, I had then peraduenture
<pb facs="7"/>perished in my humilitie:</hi> that is, I vvas then verie likelie to haue fallen vvhen tribulation came vppon me. Seeing therfore that these tvvo vveapons be so assured and prooued for our vvarfare, it seemed to me conuenient to put them in this brife ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, that by such meanes they might be alvvais at hand.</p>
   <p>Novv for so much as in the beginning vve diuided the vvhole summe of Christian doctrine into these tvvo things, praier, &amp; vvoorke; hauing spoken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie of praier as vvel Mental as Vocal, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it ensueth that vve treat hence forvvard <hi>of vvoork,</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that is of <hi>the instruction and order of our life,</hi> hauing cheefelie regard of such as nevvlie begin to serue our Lord. And because of those som there be, that begin this life remainning still in the vvoorld, som others entering into Religion; for these last also I haue laid dovvne an other treatise, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
      <hi>in vvhich the thornes and brambles of our euil inclinations and passions be rooted out, and in their place ar set the plantes of vertues,</hi> vvhich doe order and perfectionate our sovvles. And albeit these tvvo last treatises maie seeme to be different in the titles, neuertheles the documents conteined in them both (especiallie those vvhich concerne vertues) serue no lesse for the one treatise, then for the other: because such as desire to be saued, haue no other vvay for the same, but to goe <hi>from vertue to vertue,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>.8.</note>
      <hi>vntil they see the God of Gods in Sion,</hi> that is in
<pb facs="8"/>the glorie vvhich is to com.</p>
   <p>Besides this, to th'end there vvant nothing for the dailie instruction of our life. I haue put heere also tvvoe other little treatises, vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one is of <hi>Penance and Confession:</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the other is <hi>of preparation for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the blessed Sacrament of the altare.</hi>
