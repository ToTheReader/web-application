      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST dread Soueraigne, your Maiesties gratious acceptance of my late <hi>Treatise against Recusancy,</hi> causeth me to present vnto your Highnes this poore Mite, which out of my penury I offer into the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surye of the Church: being no way comparable to the Talents which others out of their great plentye, <note place="margin">Luc, 21, 2.</note> haue cast into the offrings of God. Albeit the right worshipfull <hi>S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. George More</hi> knight, hath learnedly and religiouslie handled the same subiect, yet may I tread the same wine-presse againe, by the example of <hi>Saint Augustine,</hi> which confuted the <hi>Arrians</hi> whome <hi>Athanasius</hi> had confuted before him, and the learned of our age which dayly write bookes, notwithstanding others before them haue written bookes of the same argument. And as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in his time, because there were many haeretikes, wished that all men which were able to write, would write against haeresie: so because now <note place="margin">Contrà men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da: Chap, 6.

      </gap> Atheisme.</p>
   <p>The state of religion dependeth vpon the state of the Pastors and Ministers. And therefore <hi>S. Iohn</hi> prophecying of the decay of it, first discouereth the defects of them, as the cause therof: That he of

      <hi>Ephesus</hi> had lefte his former loue: he of <hi>Pergamus</hi> had them which <note place="margin">Apoc, 2, 4. &amp; 14, 15. &amp; 20.</note> maintayned the doctrine of <hi>Balaam</hi> and the <hi>Nicholaitans:</hi> he of <hi>Thyatira</hi> suffered <hi>Iezabell</hi> to make the people commit fornication, and eat meate sacrificed to Idols: he of <hi>Sardis</hi> had onely a name that he liued, but was dead: he of <hi>Laodicia</hi> was neither hotte nor colde, <note place="margin">Apoc, 3, 1. 15, &amp; 16.</note> but such a one as the Lord would spewe out of his mouth, that he which tooke vpon him a greater charge then all they, should haue onely hornes like the lambe Christ Iesus: but as for his doctrine, he should speake like the dragon <hi>Sathan.</hi> And <hi>S. Paul</hi> prophecying of <note place="margin">Apoc, 13. 17</note> that great Apostasie and reuoliment from true religion through the world, shewed the cause to be in him which tooke vpon him to be the vniuersall Pastor of the world, That he should be an aduersaerie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting <note place="margin">2, Thes, 2, 39.</note> him-selfe aboue all that is called God: that sitting in the Temple of God, he should not shew himselfe as the minister of God, but as God. The holy Ghost deriued the corruption of religion, and calamitie of the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> from the base condition of the Priestes in the dayes of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> saying: that he made Priestes of <note place="margin">1, King, 12, 31</note> the lowest of the people. And it is a curse denounced against them from God by the Prophet <hi>Malachye,</hi> that their Priestes should be <note place="margin">Mal, 2. 9.</note> despised and vyle before the people.</p>
