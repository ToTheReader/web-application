foe to Rome. Neuerthelesse, Aristotle, who all his daies in a maner had bin an Atheist, yet crying, <hi>O Ens entium mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screre mei,</hi> in his last and lost day, caused the people to thinke <hi>y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      </hi> he had some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God. Whereupon afterward being dead, they eternized his name. So now I in like sorte doe hope, thou wilt suspence thy fauourable censure, and grant me a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of course, that I may vse the like excuse, differing in effect, as an aunswere for my defence: which if it seem <hi>sero</hi> to any one, yet <hi>serio,</hi> as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued of the Philosophers &amp; husbandmen, who with one assent agreed, <hi>perfectionē prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris esse aliquam priuationem consequentis,</hi> proceeding frō the selfe same stocke: for the

So this my little one and first borne hath more imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (I confesse) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore craueth some pardon: for as Hercules, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and ouercame by his wreathes and victories, the most part of the world, and when hee could proceede no further, thereat ending and making a full period, caused pillers to bee set vp, which were termed after his name, on which was written <hi>non vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra:</hi> But of late daies, <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus Columbus,</hi> finding a farther passage, and going beyond Hercules his <hi>non vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> in respect thereof there were other pillers set vp, on

which was written, <hi>Plus vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra.</hi> So I in like maner (gētle Reader) with Hercules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal in number, though farre interiour in qualitie, wading as far as my simple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie could affoord, and my slender wit allow, according to that small talent of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and knowledge I had, hauing more perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and compild this my little pamphlet, that I might well with Hercules say, <hi>Non vltra.</hi> Of which I was by some domestical yonker pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily bereft, beeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at not a little mooued, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most discomfited, vnlesse the entire loue and feruent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiō I bare towards my high renowned Lord, &amp; towards the young vertuous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man his sonne, M. <hi>Iohn Eger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>

who ioyntly as a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsiā Quintessens, reedified the wracke of my decay, and caused mee againe to take heart of grace, &amp; to redouble my courage, that I was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rather enforced by affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than perswaded by reason, to attempt with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus, the finding out of <hi>Plus vltra,</hi> fearing to incurre the backbiting of the enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which might say, that my sting was lost in the first assault, and my courage was quailed in the bud; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that saying vnto mee, that Milo Crotoniates vsed to apply to himselfe, beeing not able to attempt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any Chiualrie or Act, which before hee vsed: and thereupon beholding his armes and thighes, lamented

and cried, <hi>At hi iam mortui sunt.</hi> So should it be saide of me, His spirits are dead, his courage abated, that hee can performe and accomplish no more.
