   <p>These are to advertise thee that these Letters are Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without the privitie of those that sent them, but I suppose that they will not take it offencively, that all such as are well-willers to the cause of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> should bee made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the common occurrences which fall out there, and I suppose they would the rather suffer it, if they knew or were made acquainted with the false Rumors which often passe heere for current, vntill wee heare the contrary by such Letters as these are: I haue not prefixed any long preamble to the ensuing Relation, neither is it stuffed with any superfluous coniectures, but you haue them printed in the same wordes and phrase in which I received them.</p>
