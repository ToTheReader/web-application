And the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt affection whiche I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue vnto your honour &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual fame / impelleth me often tymes to deuyse / and reuolue in mynde: what seruice or pleasur my simplenesse might do / cōuenient and acceptable vnto your hygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: therby to testify the honour / the loue / &amp; obsequy: whiche I knowlege my selfe to owe vnto your magnificēce.

and compare my symplenesse and impotence with your preeminēt dignite: I fynde myselfe gretly insufficiēt to parforme or attempt any besynesse or warke which I may condynglie present vnto your honorable presēce. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles after many cōsyderaciōs: the gracious regarde of benynge grauite which I beholde in your coūtenance: and the euident signes of humilite whiche outwardly apereth radica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e in your noble hert: reconforteth myne insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience &amp; inboldeth my spirites / some thyng to write my custome whiche I may present into your gracious handes: as a perpetual memo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rial: an and euident testimony of my deuout seruice / &amp; amorous affection against your ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gnificent hyghnes. In this consyderacion I haue reuolued many &amp; diuerse volumes / stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyeng of which one: the trāslacion: might cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>respond with your noble estat. But at last I haue remēbred that a mercyal matter is most cōgruent vnto a marcial &amp; victorious prince. Wherfore I haue attempted to translate into our maternal langage the auncient cronicle &amp; famous hystorie of the warre: and dyuers ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayls which the romayns dyd agaynst the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran Iugurth: vsurper of the kyngdome of Numidy. Whiche hystorie is writen in latyn by the ronowmed romayne Salust: whose wordes in latyn I haue also added vnto the marge of this my trāslacion to thintent that such as shal dysdayne to rede my translation in englysshe: may rede this hystorie more cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendyously &amp; more obscurely writen in laten. Which hystorie: parauenture shal apere more clere &amp; playne vnto theym in many places by help of this my trāslation. Which shal nat be tedyous to such as be lerned &amp; vndestande la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn: but vnto many noble gentylmen whiche vnderstande nat latyn tong {per}fetly I dout nat but that this my labour shalbe both pleasure &amp; profet. For by the same they shal haue some help toward the vnderstādyng of latyn: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che at this tyme is almost contēned of gentyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. And also they shal vnderstande a ryght fruytful hystorie: bothe pleasant / profitable / &amp;
<pb facs="5"/>
ryght necessary vnto euery degre: but special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to gentylmen / whiche coueyt to attayne to clere fame and honour: by glorious dedes of chyualry. But I dout nat: but that some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnyous detractours shal maligne agaynst this my besynes and {pro}fitable labour / sayeng that to a preest and man {pro}fessed to obseruāce of religion: it is farre cōtrary &amp; dysagreynge to intermyt hymselfe with warfare: or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyt with thyng{is} of batayle: outher by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des / counsel / or writynge. But to stoppe the mouthes of such calumniatours: moost soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne prince: mesemeth ryght &amp; cōuenient in this place: somwhat to write aswel cōcernyng the cōmodities &amp; laudes of hystories: as aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenent vnto myne owne excusacion. And first I knowlege it moch more cōueniēt: a preest to arme hymselfe with constance / holy scripture / purenesse of lyfe / &amp; radyant vertues: and with suche socours &amp; armour defended: boldely / &amp; valiātly / to byd batayle agaynst vyc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>s: to pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sue the obstinate synners of this worlde. And to cōtende also agaynst the temptaciōs of his carnal cōcupiscēces / agaynst these mundayne blandimētes &amp; delectacions: and agaynst his gostely ennemies suggestyōs. For vnder this maner (as affermeth the holy man Iob) man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes lyfe vpon yerth is but a warfare / &amp; a very mase of miseries: an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ricate circuite of vary able / and ineuitable errours. For certayne I deny nat: but that such ought to be the warfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of a man within holy orders: auowed &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myt vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy minysteries &amp; auters of god. But this other temperal warre is permytted vnto wordely lyuers: and may nat be omyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: namely in this worlde oppressed with ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rāny of iniuryous and odyous exacto<seg rend="sup">r</seg>s and oppressours: whose obstinate presumpcions / assautes / &amp; inuasions can nat otherwyse be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pressed: than by violence / armour / &amp; batayle: vnder ministracion of good and ryghtwyse princes defenders &amp; mayntayners of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men wele. Than it is lauful: a preest to write suche actes for example of our posterite: for perpetual remembraūce of the laudes of good
<pb facs="6"/>
princes / which haue ben here in erth the scour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges of god to correct tyrannes &amp; synners. But great is the laude &amp; many be the cōmodities &amp; vtilities of hystories. An hystore is the recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of tymes passed: the lyght of verite: the maistres of mannes lyueng: the presydent of memorie: the messanger of antiquite. And (as Titus Liuius recordeth in his prologue) the knowledge of hystories among other thinges is most holsome / necessary / and {pro}fitable. For euery good example which in them is writen: is set for a warnyng &amp; monycion vnto princes and gouernours therby to rule &amp; order them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: &amp; a cōmen wele. And euery exāple of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable fortune of tyrannes / is set as a monici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the same gouernours nat to be of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous behauour / lest at last they may fal īto ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke miserable ruyne &amp; calamite. And also (as sayth Cicero) a man to knowe nothing of that which was done before his tyme &amp; remēbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: that is as who sayth alway to be a chylde. But it is a thyng very comely: &amp; necessary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other: to knowe these cronycles &amp; noble actes of aunciēt tyme &amp; remēbrance to kepe in mynde the order &amp; courses of antiquite: and to haue in <abbr>mynd</abbr> the knowledge of exemples for euery mater &amp; purpose. For in likewyse as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to aged men is more credence &amp; auctorite gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen / than to yong men: bycause of experiēce of many thyng{is}. So such noble &amp; diligēt mynd{is} as delyteth in redynge hystories: may haue knowlege nat onely of the dedes of one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes lyfe: but also of the dedes most famous of al tymes syth creation of the <abbr>world</abbr>. <abbr>Wherfor</abbr> (as sayth Dyodorus) it is a comely &amp; fayre thyng / moche necessary &amp; cōmendable: a man to refourme &amp; amende his lyfe / by example of an other mannes faut{is} &amp; dāmages. Wherfore Demetrius Phalerus the great philosopher: often warned &amp; counselled the kyng Ptolomy to excercise hymselfe in often redyng of bokes of hystories. For in so doynge: princes shall fynde writen in bokes before their eyen ryght many thyng{is} cōcernyng their wele / honour / &amp; fame: which their frend{is} dare nat be bolde to
<pb facs="6"/>
tell them for drede of dysplesure: fathermore without the knowlege of hystories neuer man coude become good oratour. For (as affer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Quintilian) hystories be of such myght and effect that they may norisshe the speche of an oratour withsoft and swete lycour. These premisses with otherlyke consydered: moost magnificent prince: me thinketh it thing nat inconuenient a preest to write of hystories of warre: and also me thynke both plesant &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to noble men to exercyse themselfe in re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyng the same. For brefely to speke by ryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wysie batel: the lawes of god &amp; man be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned: vice &amp; vicious men corrected: vertue / and good men rewarded and exalted. Oure fayth agaynst infideles defended: rebellers &amp; tyrannes subdued: and finally all thyng{is} dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted &amp; to due order reduced. Fathermore the sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me redyng of hystores semeth to auayle nat a lytel to the knowledge &amp; cōtempt of this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sytorie pleasure mundayne &amp; mysery of this vncertayne lyfe. For whan hystories represēt before our syght the valyant and bolde herted knyghtes shyning in armour: &amp; richely apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled: on comely coursers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

What els is all this: but a vayne ostētation of yertly opulence: and caduke glorie prepared besely / assembled la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriously / and exposed folysshly &amp; furiously vnto distruction &amp; {per}dicion. But agayn anon after: whan we rede &amp; se in the same hystories the valiaūt mennes bodyes prostrate: the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kases of kynges / dukes / erles / knyghtes / and pages mengled all togyder: all pride &amp; conten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion abated. The bryght harnesse dyed with blode: the wounded coursers drawynge after them the deed bodyes of their lordes: the men cryeng: the tentes &amp; townes brennyng. What is all this sight w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> otherlyke? Forsoth nought
<pb facs="7"/>
els but an euident spectacle of mannes brutall crudelite: and an exāple of mundayne vanite: declarynge the immoderat &amp; insaciable desyre of dominion of yerthely princes: and prouing that vnto man welth is intolerable / &amp; cōfoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his owne foly. These manyfolde and holsome exāples: represented before our sight by reding of cronycles: hath moued my mynd to trāslate this present hystorie forth of latyn into our maternal langage. But among all other noble men of this region: most hye and myghty prince: ye seme vnto me most worthy and cōueniēt: to whose grace I shuld decycat this hystorie: bothe for myne owne duety to be obserued anenst your magnifycence: and also for the excellent worthynesse of your merites &amp; great polycie of chyualry / whiche lately haue apered in you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

In whiche noble &amp; glorious acte ye haue {pro}ued your selfe lyke vnto myghty Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius. But this I omytte: as thynge euidently knowen to euery man: lest I myght seme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to recoūt these your strong dedes for adu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lacion: than for true relation. Wherfore most myghty &amp; magnifycent prince: pleas it your hyghnesse of gracious beniuolence to accepte this smal present / trāslated by yo<seg rend="sup">r</seg> beedman to pleasure &amp; profet of al gentylmen of this regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but namely of your hyghnes &amp; of the noble men of your {pro}geny &amp; affynite.
