   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloued, marueile not that after so many exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon the Lords Prayer, this Pamphlet steppeth vp, as if so be it had some thing to say besides that which hath been alreadie spoken: to confesse the truth, I gesse it may occasion the iudicious reader to enter into a more inward view of Christs purpose in propounding that prayer: perhaps also the manner of handling the seuerall petitions may giue some light: but my intent was none of these, when I intended to publish the treatise: onely the cleering of my selfe from vniust accusations, and the satisfying of a few friends moued me ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: but whatsoeuer it be, and howsoeuer vttered, I pray thee of charitie to construe (a thing indifferently done) to the better part: especially those few questions resolued in the latter end of the treatise. I doe here ingenuously confesse that I am far from the opinion of them which separate from our Church, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the set forme of prayer (although from some of them, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued part of my education in Cambridge) for I doe verily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure my selfe vpon such grounds as I haue deliuered in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, that a set forme of prayer is not vnlawfull: yet as Moses wished that all the people of God could prophecie, so doe I wish that all the people of God could conceiue prayer: the rather for that personall wants, blessings, and iudgements are not compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed particularly according to their seuerall circumstances in any forme of prayer possibly to be deuised: wherefore I desire that no man mistake me in this treatise: I doe iudge that there is no one doctrine or opinion contrarie to the doctrine of this Church in all this tractate: in respect whereof I hope it shall finde more indifferent censure at thy hands. And for that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit which some perhaps haue intertained at the hearing of the doctrine when I taught in Lincolne, I doe also as freely and
<pb facs="5"/> truly protest, that I neuer durst admit (I blesse God for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie) so blasphemous a thought into my minde, as to surmise whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the prayer, commonly called the Lords prayer, be the prayer which Christ taught his Disciples, or no: for I doe with my soule confesse it to be the same prayer in substance which Christ deliuered to his Disciples: therefore I pray thee gentle reader, whosoeuer thou art, to accept this treatise, and to blame neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie rather than me for publishing it: for the phrase and style it is homely, I confesse, and plaine; for I doe not intend the benefit of the style to the learned, but to the vnlearned for the better vnderstanding of the matter: the truth and homelines may well sort together, and the truth is not to be reiected for her plainnes, rather I wish that men in heauenly matters could frame themselues to the capacitie of the meanest, which is the surest way: seeing that learned men can vnderstand things plainly deliuered, but the vnlearned cannot conceiue the easiest doctrines, except they be deliuered also after an easie manner, with homely, familiar and easie speeches. Now if any man attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this plainnes of mine vsed in this treatise to ignorance and want of skill, I will not endeuour to weede that preiudice out of his minde, seeing that I professe it to be a part of my studie to speake plainly: and I see no reason that seeing speech is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the minde, the interpreter should need of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpreter or commentary. So crauing againe thy charitable censure, I bid thee hartily fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in the Lord. <hi>Pray for vs brethren.</hi>
