   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>INDE Bro: after many dayes not hauing visited you by any let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor lykwise receaued any from you, I thought Good, and now high tyme, to wryte these few vnto you, not so much to acquainte you with any now matter worth labour, as to make knowne more at large, and manifest what hath be fallen me longe since my arriuall in these partes. Neither take it in ill part that I haue not certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed you so much ere now: euen then (perchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce) when you first heard some rumor of me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Catholicke faith, for I would not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shly moue such a matter, or with out firme foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation acquaint you with that, which I should not be able to defend. for you may not think me ignorant of what opposites I may suspect in such a case, wherefore I thought it more secure for
<pb facs="3"/>
both parties, to deferre it vntill this tyme. Maruail not therefore, I pray you, either at my matter or manner of wryting, but patiently attend the end, and I doubt not but the sequele will giue you better content, or at least no iust cause of offence. The dutie to our Mother, loue to your selfe, and the rest our poore Brothers and Sisters is cause of both, and therfore though I beginne more abruptlie then I would or had intended, it is to avoyd prolixite where the matter it selfe is so vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
   <p>Most trulie therfore was it sayd of an auncient Sainte: <hi>Oft tymes that vvhich vvee knovv not through our sloth the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me by teares is made knovvne vnto vs. and an afflicted mynd more certaynly findeth out a fault comitted; and the guilt vvhich she remembred not in security, shee clearlie perceaueth being troubled.</hi> This is the cause why almightie God, in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture so often admonisheth vs,<note place="margin">Iob <hi>c.</hi> 4.9.</note> whoe as Iob saith, <hi>dvvell in hovvses of clay,</hi> to pull dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne our plumes and enter into consideration what state wee stand in which certenly me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes may most aptlie be applyed vnto vs, for who (to omit the relation of our goulden age, and dayes wherin wee dranke full cupps of pleasure and delight with all content and least remembrance of God, and thankes for his benefits as wee ought) with these worldly afflictions so depressed as wee? Who of his, most supposed s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ndes so forsaken as wee? Nay who by his owne blood and nearest kindred so
<pb facs="3"/>
hardly dealt with all as wee? But what?<note place="margin">Iob 2.9.</note> shall wee hearken to Iobs wyfe, and <hi>blesse God and die?</hi> No but rather with patient Iob in the next verse answeare, <hi>thou hast spoken lyke one of the foolish vvomen, if vvee haue receaued good thinges of the hand of God, evill thinges vvhy should vvee not receaue?</hi> Also the <hi>Prophet Esaie</hi> thundereth out the most terrible comparisons he could deuise, to a wake vs out of this damnable Lythargie of carelesse inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our state, and telleth vs saying: And <hi>behold he shall come in hast speedely &amp;c. he vvill not slumber nor sleepe &amp;c.</hi> all which threatninges in my vnderstanding seeme to haue some peculier reuerence more vnto me then you for as much as God hath not once or twice moued me by often conference,<note place="margin">Esaie 5 27.</note> of the Catholicke faith but also I haue had Catholicke bookes which might haue satisfied any man not altogether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse, as indeed at that tyme I was; for when at my frindes request I began to read, to witt, <hi>The Suruey of the nevv Religion,</hi> and that there did many thinges occure repugnant, or rather confuting my affectionate religion in which I was nourished, my patience by no meanes would search any further into it, but with all contempt did vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reiect it., which how foolish a thinge it was I appeall to your owne iudgment. for admitt there were a Turke and a Christian contending about religion, and (as sure it is) no way to be saued, but by the one only true Christian and Catholicke faith notwithstanding will obstinatlie content himselfe with his Turcisme in which he had his being and
<pb facs="4"/>
bringing vp, and not heare the contradiction of his Alchoran by the knowledge of any other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, how vniuersall or warrantable soeuer would you not repute him a madd man, and altogether inexcusable? certenly you could not doe lesse; much more an astrauagant Christian, bred out of the Catholicke Church, which not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he hath heard of by the generall cōsent of all, yea of her most spitefullest enemies to haue bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the Romane Church, are so to haue continued the first six hundred yeares pure and vnspe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ted, with out stayne or corruption, yet not witstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he will not geue eare to this faith or religion, or vnderstand the cause iustly why he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it, would you not, I say, condemne this man as worthy of double punishment? certenly such an one was I but God for his longe patience and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference whoe out of his infinite goodnes and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie hath thus, through so many troubles and straunge accidentes at length brought me to the true knowledge of his seruice, and porte of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I render all humble thankes, earnestlie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring his grace of perseuerance, and if it be his good will and pleasure, to seal the profession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with my blood and life.</p>
   <p>Now therefor Lo: Bro: not to detayne you longer from my intended scope, if you approue of that comparison, borroweed from a christian and a Turke, then I pray let me craue the same of you that you will at least graunt me that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, as vprightly, not passionate or led with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; to peruse this my labour, it being awork indeed conducing to no momentary pleasure or profit but taken in hand for your eternall good
<pb facs="4"/>
and future ioye and glorie in the world to come where no sinister chance or froward fortune can euer bereaue you of it. In this labour (I say) my trauells first present themselues vnto you for some speciall causes hereafter notified; which verily I may account a trauell to <hi>Damascus,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act 9.28.</note> wherin a good <hi>Annanias</hi> (by our Sauiours ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment) hath caused to fall from myne eies those scales of ignorance where with I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly blinded so that I may rightly say <hi>truth is great and preuaileth.</hi>

   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>Thus out of these few to omitt many moe, wee see how all heretiques like serpentes, in imitation of that old serpent the Deuill, who came with scripture euen to our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, do lurks vnder the tree of knowledge (I mean the scripture) that so they may more cunningly conueigh their deadly poyson; and surely though these examples of auncient ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes were sufficient to teach euery man humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, seeing as a prudent man doth well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, <hi>he that will need be his ovvne Scholler hath commonly a fooll, to his master;</hi> yet wantes there not neither sufficient occasion euen in our tymes to be carefull in this so waighty a businesse: for how shall I thinke the protestantes in these dayes to agree vpon the true sense of scripture, when they cannot a gree about the translation it selfe, which must be the grownd where vpon they worke: by which dissention also they shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to haue descended in doctrine from the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se old heretiques in the primitiue church. For doth the protestant beleeue the scriptures not to be receaued so fully and wholy as the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, or (as it pleaseth him) papist doth but rather certayne chapters and bookes, which seeme to him (or rather indeed, to this braine sicke phansie) not so a greable to the purity of the ghospell, to be cutt of and excluded the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of holy writt? the same did the <hi>Carpocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. Seuerians</hi> and <hi>Manichees</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned all the old testament as a thing fayned from an euill beginning a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d yet certainlie not without scripture, as you may set in the
<pb facs="6"/>
example of <hi>Marcion</hi> first produced. In lyke manner <hi>Cerdon</hi> denyed all the <hi>Euangelistes</hi> except <hi>S. Luke; Cerinthus</hi> all except <hi>S. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thevv;</hi> the <hi>Seuerians</hi> also tooke away the <hi>Actes</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and with the <hi>Ebionites</hi> all the epistles of <hi>S. Paul;</hi> the <hi>Alogians</hi> likewise estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> for an inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cerinthas.</hi> Now that you are one with these (at least in this point of mayming scripture) is manifest, for do not the most excellent of your whole clergy, and first publishers of your ghospell, <hi>Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Illiricus,</hi> and the <hi>Magdeburgenses</hi> exclude many of the Apostles epistles from all communione of holy scripture, vnder pretence of examining it by the rule of the deuyne worde? Certainly they can by no meanes dissemble it, in the epistles of <hi>S. Iohn, Iude, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrevves,</hi> which in this my compendium, were to longe to proue at large; but to come yet more nere you. Do not also your later Doctoures in this especially imitate these their predecessours? yes most exactly, as heere is sufficiently confirmed. In the fourth disputation had with <hi>F. Campian</hi> the Iesuit in the tower of London, your Doctoures did expresly censure these bookes (by the authority only of fower or siue) to be Apocriphall, to witt, the booke of <hi>vvisdome, Syrach, Iudith, Toby, the 4. bookes of Esdras, Baruch, Ecclesiasticus, Hester, and the Machabees,</hi> in the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the ghospell of <hi>S. Luke, S. Paul, to the Hebrevves, the second epistle of S. Peter, the tvvoe last epistles of S. Iohn, S. Iames, and the Apocalypse, Luther</hi> also calls the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb facs="6"/>
of <hi>S. Iames</hi> a strawen epistle, and of no truth, and not worthy the spirit of an Apostle. All which compared together your Doctours in this opinion of paring scripture, cannot but drinke of the same cuppe with those old condemned hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</p>
   <p>But after; seeing their folly, and that they could by no means defend, what thus rashly they had enterprized, by often mutation and change they came to that text which you now haue; but yet euen to this day, with what dubitation this is done and correction (or rather to speake truth corruption) their often impressions doe manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly testifie, and I thinke you are not ignorant, how many seuerall translations there haue beene within these few yeeres, I can remember thee since my first acquaintance with London; which mutabilitie plainly argueth they are those fond builders of whome our Sauiour maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are shaken with euery blast, because they build not vpon the rocke which is the church, <hi>The piller and firmament of truth.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.15.</note> But vpon the shallow sandes of their owne vnsetled braines: and this I speake not of my selfe, but by the testimony of themselues, which you may see more conuenient and at large hereafter, yet it shall not be discomodious if in the meane ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me wee examine one of their chiefest linguists in England; M. Broughton therfore in his epistle to the Lordes of the councell desireth them to procure speedily a new translation, <hi>because that</hi> (saith he) <hi>vvhich is novv in England is full of errours.</hi> And in his aduertisment of corruptions to the protestante Bishops saith:
<pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>That there publicke translatiō of scriptures into English is such as it peruerteth the text of the old testament in eight hundred forty eight places, and that it causeth millions of millions to reiect the new testament, and to runne to eternall flames;</hi> will not then euery man, that hath but any feeling of his soule looke about him, seeing as I said before. <hi>Euen our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes are iudges on my side;</hi> neither can it be excused by saying they are but smale differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, seeing M. Broughton heere saith that it <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Millions of Millions to runne to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall flames.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Wherefore good Bro: as you loue your owne souls healthe, and would avoyde these eternall flames, passe not ouer these slightly, or with me (as I once did) reiect the farther search this, because it doth so manifestly detect your horrible abuses, which may seeme incredible; but if you will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any one of them you shall find it as euident &amp; much more at large: this concerns eternity, this concerns your soule, yea this doth admonish you of the eternall glory or perpetuall misery both of body and soule in hell flames without redemption; wherfor once more I beseech you, as you tender your eternall weale or woe, and haue some feeling of Gods fearfull iudgments,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.41</note> as this dreadfull sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from our Sauiour: <hi>get you avvay from me you cursed into fier euerlasting, which was prepared for the Deuill and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> Neyther may you thinke (as some in England, I speake what I haue knowne) that a man may be saued by any religion for to such our Sauiour will say:<note place="margin">Matth. 7.11.</note>
      <hi>not euery one
<pb facs="7"/>
that saith to me Lord, Lord shall enter into the kingdome of heauen: but he that doth the will of my father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Deere Bro: if this be true as it cannot be false, proceeding from truth it self, then I pray with all attention and diligent study seriously examine this laboure, for S. Paul doth likewyse tell you, that there <hi>is one Lord one faith one Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, one God and father of all;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.5.</note> wherfore vpon due examination being conuinced in conscience, let not a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      <hi>neither do I make my life more pretious then my selfe so that I may finish the course &amp; ministerie which I haue receaued of our Lord Iesus to testifie the ghospell of the grace of God:</hi> yea especially, I say,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.10</note> take courage when as our Sauiour saith <hi>he which is not with me, is against me, and he which gathereth not with me scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</hi> And in an other place he bides vs enter by <hi>the streight porte: because the broad gate,</hi>

   <p>

      <hi>their is nothing that a Christian man ought so to feare, as to be separated from the body of Christ, which is the Church, as it is one Catholique Church for if he be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the body of Christ, he is no member of him, but who soeuer hath not the spirit of Christ, he is not of Christ.</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me good mother in this my so longe and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious a discourse, I know your feruent zeal
<pb facs="15"/>
and feare of God (but what? misled) required none at all, the nature of an epistle, a much shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But the daunger in which you liue, and the desiere I haue of your saluation, with the rest of your whole family in the same state of perdition, could not, as I thought be satisfied with a briefer.</p>
   <p>Excuse, I humbly beseech, you my so plaine dealing, I doe (as I tould you in the beginning) but as good Surgeans and Phisitians are wont, who are most loueing to their patients, when most cruell to their diseases, and loue no lesse when they Cherish by fomentations, oyntments, and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritiues, then when they chastice by bitter potions, cutings, and cruell launcinges, because both-heale. I once more beseech you therfore, and as farre as I may presume coniure you, that for the glorie you are to giue vnto God, the dutie you owe his Church, the ioy you may purchase to his Saincts and Angles,<note place="margin">Luc. 15.7.10.</note>
      <hi>which reioyce more at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of one sinner that doth penance then at Ninty Nine iust which need no penance▪</hi> yea for the example you may and ought to giue your family, and the whole world, the comfort and eternall crownes of glorie, which by your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion your frindes and Children shall reap, the feare you ought to haue of Hell, the hope of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and desire of your owne saluation you would vouchsafe to weigh and penetrate the daungers where with you are inuironed. I will not vrge you any farther in this kind, but only craue of you to propose to your self death, Hell, Heauen, Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gment, Eternity, and that you would not preferre your owne priuate opinion, seeing as, a prudent man did well obserue: <hi>he that vvilbe his ovvne

Scholler hath cōmonly a foole to his master</hi> not I say to preferre any iudgment before Gods Church which he promised should neuer erre in all antiquitie. Neither let vs so esteeme of this life (which as the scripture saith is a vapour, a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, yea nothing) that wee forget heauen and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Alas, Deere Mother, as our Sauiour saith <hi>vvhat doth it profitt a man to gayne the vvhole vvorld and susteine the losse of his ovvne soule?</hi>
      <note place="margin">Matt. 29.19.</note> Old age tells you that you are in the wayning of your dayes, that your glasse is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most runne, that your spring, yea sommer is spent, you are in the fall of the leafe and your winter is at hand; the axe is laid, to the root, and where soeuer the tree shall fall, there it will a bide, you haue serued the world hitherto in sin and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, to leaue it novv, is not so much to leaue it, as to preuent it, for shortlie it vvill leaue you for the vnexpected coming of death, you vvant not of your neerest knired whose suddayne departure may be sufficient examples, yea the only death of our father (nosmale griefe to me) may suffice vs in this.</p>
   <p>To haue erred hitherto is humane, to perseuere (as I may tearme it) is beastly: you haue giuen your life past, to heresie and her accomplices, giue at least the remnant and surplus to God and his Church: you haue giuen as one saith the maine croppe io the enimie of mankind the redeemer let at least glean the reproofe of your haruest, and he will requite you as he promiseth a hundreth fold, and with life euer lasting.</p>
   <p>O Mother, Pardon yet once more I earnestly beseech you, my bouldnes and rough manner of
<pb facs="16"/>
writing;<note place="margin">2. Cor. 116.</note> I confesse with S. Paul <hi>I am rude in speach,</hi> yet tolerable in opening to you the meane how to escape so great a daunger, as the eternall perdition both of body and soule, in which perill (as I said) you dayly sleepe in, your tyme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is but short and you haue a great account to render; your conscience (vpon the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of these) cannot but vrge you, your sinnes call vpon you, the iudge expecteth you, imbrace then the Roman Catholicke church for your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and God will euer be your father, accuse your self and God will excuse you, be sorrie for your sinnes and they shall not be imputed vnto you, permitt the priestes sentence to passe on you, and Gods wrathfull sentence shall not touch you. If you will mount the hills of Armenia, enter the arke of Christes Church, if you will ascend the higher heauen, enter this lower, yea this is the way and only meane. To haue liued hitherto in sin and heresie is daunger, to dye in this estate (as our Sauiour and his Apostles witnes) is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne damnation.</p>
   <p>But I haue beene to longe and therfor must ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abruptly conclude, then any way finish this my present discourse wherfor as my last greeting and farewell I humbly beseech you, for the tender good of your owne soule, and so many which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon you (a great account to answere for) to wouchsafe the reading, or at least relating by some other, these my paynes and trauells taken in your be halfe; that so at length (all poyntes and doubtes clearly proued) you may with the people in Esdras say:<note place="margin">
