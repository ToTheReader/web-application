   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Carcely had I finished the former discourses in answere of N. D. his Ward-word, but there came to my handes a pamphlet of the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, and entitled, <hi>A relation of the triall made before the king of France, about some matters of religion, &amp;c.</hi> made in disgrace not onely of the Lord of <hi>Plessis,</hi> my honourable friend whom I loue, but also of true religion, which iointly with him I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse. In his former treatise N. D. playeth the fencer, here his maship playeth the scribe, in <hi>Dolmans</hi> dialogue he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth himselfe a statist. His owne friendes charge him with Turkeied machiauelisme: whereby it appeareth, that among other parts he playeth now and then <hi>Machiauel</hi> or <hi>Mahomet.</hi> In his discourses against the Lord of Leicester, and the L. Treasurer late deceased, and others, he playeth the libeller. And as one saith of <hi>Pasquin,</hi> he is put to play all parts. For as <hi>Pasquin</hi> taketh vpon him diuers persons, and speaketh now like an Angell, now like a diuell; now like a king, and presently like a begger; now like a pope, and eftsoones like a poore parasite; now like a merchant, and by and by like a man of warre; yea and abhorreth not to play the part of a poet, a curtisan, or a Iebusite: so our friend <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> transformeth himself into all shapes, and playeth all parts, saue the part of an honest man. As<note n="a" place="margin">Plato in Ioue.</note>
      <hi>Plato</hi> saith in like case of one, he turneth himselfe like to <hi>Proteus</hi> into all formes, turning vp &amp; down without order. <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. He is also like to Empusa, whom<note n="b." place="margin">In ranis.</note> Aristophanes doth thus describe:

               <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
            </gap>, &amp;c.</l>
      </q> He saith that Empusa sheweth her self somtime like a great beast, sometime like an oxe, sometime like a mule, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time like a dog. So likewise our aduersarie sometime bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and fauneth like a dog, sometime pusheth like an oxe, sometime he hath no more vnderstanding, then a mule. But men of iudgement suppose, that he is of nearest alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to <hi>Pasquin,</hi> and not vnlike him both in shape, maners, and language, as his great practise &amp; skill in Pasquinadoes do declare. Wherefore as before I haue encountred this furious fencer in his challenge made to Sir <hi>Fr. Hastings</hi> in the <hi>Wardword:</hi> so here I purpose to meete with his turning deuises in this <hi>Relation</hi> sent from Rome to his consorts in England, with a purpose to disgrace vs. neither do I meane to leaue him, into what forme soeuer he shal turne himself.
<q>
         <note n="a" place="margin">Horace.</note>Effugiet nunquam haec sceleratus vincula Proteus.</q> Vnlesse it would please God to giue him grace to turne from his wicked wayes, and treasons, &amp; to returne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and to a due consideration of his dutie.</p>
   <p>You may thinke him a strange and variable fellow, that taketh paines, to signifie as farre as from Rome into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, what had passed hard by our dores, &amp; wherof we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse, but haue more certaine and speedy intelligence, then himselfe, or others residing at Rome. But such is his noble pleasure. From a fencer, and a Iesuite, &amp; a great Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin of the Romish synagogue, he is now turned into a base scribe, and relator of Romish newes: and beleeueth that his report wilbe the rather receiued, especially comming thus turned &amp; disguised from Rome; which is the fountain from whence the popish sect receiue all their traditions. It may be also that he hopeth to draw a great hand vpō vs by his triūphing relatiō cōcerning the trial passed betwixt the L. of <hi>Plessis,</hi> &amp; the pretended B. of <hi>Eureux,</hi> which in Rome
<pb facs="231"/> was heard with great applause, and well liked by his holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But if he had better considered of the matter, &amp; could haue imagined, that his relatiō shold haue receiued oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, &amp; his collections, answere; I beleeue he would haue spared his labor, or rather spent it in some other libelling discourse; wherin his skil is greater, then in disputing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For first no man can haue lesse reason to exclaime vpon falsifications, &amp; corruptions of ancient authors, then the popish sect. Neither can it proue, but a matter very dangerous to the pope, to haue this point wel examined: whose authoritie and doctrine doth for the most part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon false legends, forged acts of councels, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit writings set out vnder the name of fathers, and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous falsifications. It will also be a meanes to detect the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood of the Romish synagogue, that long since by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch</hi> was called <hi>Fucina d'inganni,</hi> or the mint of falshood and iugling tricks, &amp; of the whore of Babylon, that is most famous for her illusions, deceits, and false dealings: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the kingdom of antichrist, that is so powerfull in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious<note n="a" place="margin">2. <hi>Thess.</hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</note> lies, and all deceiueablenesse of iniquitie.</p>
   <p>Secondly, it wil appeare by examination of particulars, that the L. of <hi>Plessis</hi> was most vniustly charged with falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in his booke published against the masse: and that <hi>Iames Peron</hi> pretended bishop of Eureux, notwithstāding all his aduantages, which the kings fauor, and partialitie of the auditorie, and other circumstances could affoord him, was not able to iustifie his challenge.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, we will plainly proue, that the popish sect haue gained nothing by this conference but shame &amp; confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if a Gentleman that maketh not profession of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, were able in so vnequall termes to stand against so proud an aduersarie, so mightily supported by the princes fauour; what might be done, if the chiefe teachers of our side were vpon good conditions to dispute before indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

Therein also for thy further satisfaction we purpose both to examine his relation, and to answer his obseruations and petitions: <hi>and to remoue this reproch</hi> (as<note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Reg. c.</hi> 17.</note>

If <hi>Parsons</hi> meane to reply, let him pul off his visor, and come barefaced into the field, and he shall not want those that will encounter him.</p>
   <p>This small Treatise, together with the rest that go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I commend to thy reading, to let thee vnderstand the great pouertie of the aduersarie,<note n="a" place="margin">

The principal points haue beene sufficiently handled both in French &amp; English before; yet shall it not be amisse to remoue all their cauils, and to encounter such winding serpents in al their turning deuises. If the matter answere not thy expectation, thou must impute it to the basenesse of the subiect, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the relators narration. The discourse will not bee long, and therefore much labour it cannot cost thee to reade it. Reade therefore and iudge who they are, that are to be charged with false and fraudulent allegations, which is now the different betwixt <hi>Parsons</hi> and vs.</p>
