   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>ICAVSE this tale hath nowe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ben told you M. Iewel, that in your bookes you corrupte and falsifie the holy Scriptures by priuate interpretation, that you denye certaine General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, as for lacke of age and yeres, that you misconstrue other most Auncient Councels, and Fathers, partly by figuratiue Phrases, lightly applied in very weighty maters, partly by paring away their wordes, yea some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by lopping of certaine their whole workes (which and such other the like, haue ben hitherto, as it is wel knowē, your ordinary and shameles shiftes): I thought good at this time writing particularly vnto you, to touche briefly some other mater, that might more edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, if not to cal you home againe vnto the Churche wherein you were baptized, who seme to stande obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> you haue once attempted, yet to stay some, and to reuoke others, to the felowship of that Citie and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of God, which was neuer hidde vnder the Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shel sithens the first erection and publication of it, but stoode alwaies vpon a Hil,<note place="margin">Math. <hi>25.</hi>
      </note> and can by no meanes be at any time hidde, as Christe him selfe hath warranted vs, the Prophetes haue fortolde vs, and the Psalmes haue sounded vnto vs.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>And thus to do I am the rather moued, for that some of your Ministers, and many of your deceiued fauourers, as we heare say, seing now your forgeries espied, your corruptions detected, your lies manifested, your insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiēcie brought to light, beginne to take an other way, how to abuse the people, kepe some credite, and cōtinue the course of your pleasant Gospel. Yea for sooth they say now, that these controuersed points be no maters of the Faith, no Articles of the Crede, but Schole points of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie, and that it sufficeth to beleeue in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Sonne, in the holy Ghost, and to beleeue the birth, passiō and resurrectiō of Christ, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rest at libertie.</p>
   <p>They, that teache this dangerous peece of dostrine, seme to skimme of the froth of that olde Nouatiā He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, not calling to remembrance Chore, Dathan, and Abiron, who, as S. Cyprian saith,<note place="margin">Cyprian. lib. <hi>1.</hi> epist. <hi>6.</hi>
      </note> beleued in one God, worshipped one God, called vpon him, and lyued in like Law and Religion, as Moyses and Aaron did. Yet bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they diuided them selues by schisme from the rest, and resisted their Priestes and Gouernous, Gods heauy hande lighted on them.</p>
   <p>And touching this mater, who seeth not that there be expressed in the Crede other Articles to be beleeued of them, which wilbe saued, as to beleeue the Churche, Remission of sinnes, euerlasting life, and that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe in the Trinitie excludeth not these, and that in
<pb facs="3"/>
these there is not one meaning among Heretiques, and Catholikes, <hi>not one and the same Lavve of the Crede,</hi> as S. Cyprian calleth it? For when they be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, beleeue you Remissiō of sinnes, and life euerlasting through the Churche, they answer not truly. For they haue not y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Church, without the which there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and then can it not auaile them to beleeue in the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoste, as Chore, Dathan, and Abiron had a right beleefe of God, which neuerthelesse were damned. As, touching Faith, it is necessary besides the Article of the Trinitie, to beleeue the other Articles, that the Church holdeth: so touching Vnitie, it behoueth a man to ioyne him selfe vnto the whole body of Christ the Catholik Church, from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of whose Head, that is the ministerial Head, and gouerneth ouer al vnder Christe, who so euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth, he entreth Schisme, and vntil he returne, and be duly reconciled, he remaineth a dead member, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut of from the body. The Nouatiās, the Pelagiās, the Donatists, erred not in the Article of the Trinitie, yet are they reputed Heretikes of condēned memorie. S. Augustine auouched that the beleefe of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Pelagians was not sufficient, although they touched not the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees maladies. For (saith he) there is mo then one kind of infection, as of bodies, so of mindes.</p>
   <p>The Donatistes beleeued in the Trinitie, vsed

Baptisme, read the Gospel, kepte the feastes of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,<note place="margin">August. in Psal. <hi>54.</hi>
      </note> and the solēnitie of Easter. <hi>In these they vvere vvith me,</hi> saith he, <hi>and yet not altogether vvith me. In Schisme not vvith me, in Heresie not vvith me, in many things vvith me, in a fevve, not vvith me. In those fevv, by the vvhich</hi> (they were) <hi>not vvith me, the many could not helpe them in vvhich</hi> (they were) <hi>vvith me.

   </p>
   <p>Marke wel this M. Iewel, and consider of it adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly. Be the pointes wherein ye dissent from vs, I meane from the Catholique Church, neuer so fewe, and neuer so smal, as they be many, and great in dede: if ye ioine not in charitie and vnitie with the Churche, ye are not annumbred with the Church, ye are not of the Church. If not of the Churche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> then haue ye not parte with Christ, whose Passion worketh the effecte of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation only vpon the membres of the Churche.</p>
   <p>Luther the Founder of this fifth Gospel geueth this Censure of you, and of your felowes of Peter Martyrs,<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>2.</hi> Fol. <hi>263.</hi>
      </note> and Caluines schoole. <hi>Frustra illi in Deum patrem, &amp; filium, &amp; Spiritum sanctum credunt. omnia (inquam) haec nihil illis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt, quando hunc Articulum negant, eum{que}
<pb facs="4"/>
falsi insimulant, qui de Sacramento dixit, Hoc est corpus meum.</hi> They beleeue in God the Father, and in the Sonne, and in the Holy Ghoste in vaine. Al these thinges (say I) profite them nothing, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as they denye this Article (he meaneth the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Christes real Presence in the Sacrament) and make him a false reporter, who said of the Sacrament, This is my Body.</p>
   <p>Gather then therevpon, if Luther him selfe be in any credite with you, that it sufficeth not to confesse the groundes of the Faith in general, as Heretiques do commomly, if there be contempte, or breache in speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al mater implyed in the general: and that to beleeue in the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Goste, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the storie of Christes doinges in flesh, is not y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, excepte the faith be kepte orderly, and wholly without wicked breache made in any one point.</p>
   <p>Neither can you M. Iewel smoothe the worlde vnder the shewe of this beleefe. For were it so that you offended not in Schisme,<note place="margin">Num. <hi>16.</hi>
      </note> as Chore, and his felowes did, that you abbridged not the vniuersal Churche, as did the Donatistes, that you bangored not in the Sacrament of Baptisme, as the Pelagians, that you denied not the Sacrament of Penaunce, as the Nouatians, that you bereued not the dead of the Sacrifice of the Church, as the Aërians, that you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned
<pb facs="5"/>
not the blessed Sacrament of the Aulter, as the Caluinistes of our time: yet could you not say, that your onely beleefe in the Trinitie, and of Christes chiefe doinges, is a sauing beleefe. For infidelitie or vnbeleefe about any one pointe of those thinges that are to be beleeued,<note place="margin">Basil. lib. de Spiritu sancto.</note> is an vtter denial of the whole Godhead, saith S. Basil.</p>
   <p>What vntruth you mainteine in many and great pointes of the Faith, I may let passe in silence, sith your selfe haue in publique audience professed it, by open writinges confirmed it, and doo stil defend it. Some of your erroneous pointes I haue detected, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and so other learned men haue confuted many others. Let that be iudged by those who can iudge, and vnto whom iudgement belongeth. Let it be tried, how you beleeue not truly, and wholly in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
   <p>We may beleeue Christe, who is our Lorde and God, and we may beleeue in Christe. To beleeue Christe, is to beleeue that Christe is. To beleeue in Christe, is to beleeue al to be true, that Christe spake and taught,<note place="margin">August in Iohan. Tract. <hi>29.</hi> De verb. Dom. Ser. <hi>61.</hi> &amp; in Psal. <hi>77.</hi>
      </note> with beleeuing to loue, and with beleeeuing to go into him, to cleaue vnto him, and to be incorporate in his members, as S. Augustine teacheth, that is asmuche in effecte, as with beleefe to haue Charitie.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>For he that hath Faith without Charitie, beleeueth that Christe is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and yet beleeueth not in Christe.</p>
   <p>If we should here discourse vpon some particulars of your newe deuised Faith, and precisely presse what <hi>S.</hi> Augustine saith is to beleeue in Christe, your Faith and doctrine were like to be prooued no faith.</p>
   <p>Christe is true God, equal with God the Father, and therefore as he is God, he is not a Priest no more then his Father is, nor, as God, euer made he any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. You teache in the <hi>.14.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>M. Ievvel maketh Christe a Priest, and to haue made Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Godhead. VVhich is hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</hi>
      </note> Diuision of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie in your <hi>.17.</hi> Article. pag. <hi>578.</hi> (whereto now I haue made answer in my Reioindre) that <hi>Christ tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his Godhead, vvas the Priest, and made the Sacrifice,</hi> for these be your very wordes. Of which you can not excuse your selfe by saying, they are the wordes of any Doctor. For neuer was there any that so taught, or said. Which wordes are cleane contrary to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Faith, which the holy Scriptures do teache, and which hath bene beleued in the Churche euermore. And by the same you seme to haue an other Christe, then we haue. For our Christe in one person hath two natures: to wit, the Nature of God, and the Nature of Man. Touching the Godhead, or the nature of God, he is in no point at al, in any one iote, lesse then his Father. For the Godhead receiueth no degrees. Neither can any thing be said, deuised, or imagined, touching the
<pb facs="6"/>
Godhead, which is not altogether cōmō with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Father, and the Sonne:<note place="margin">Ioan. <hi>10.</hi>
      </note> as he him selfe said, <hi>Ego &amp; Pater v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num sumus. I and the Father are one</hi> (thing, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or substance). And the Apostle saith, of Christe, that,<note place="margin">Philip. <hi>2.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Being in the forme of God, he thought it no robberie to be equal vvith God.</hi> Yet say you, Christe, <hi>touching his Godhead vvas the Priest and made the Sacrifice:</hi> Of which, these absurdities and most horrible blasphemies do folowe.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that, whereas to do Sacrifice, is <hi>cultus La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae,</hi> a seruice of worship, and a recognizing of supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie in him to whom the Sacrifice is made: Christe, making Sacrifice to his Father, <hi>touching his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> as you say, is inferiour to his Father, and doth seruice to his Father, touching his Godhead.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, seing that Priesthood is a dignitie, and an excellencie, such as in this worlde none is greater, or at the lest a Qualitie: if Christ be a Priest touching his Godhead, as you M. Iewel do say he is: vndoubtedly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God the Father also was a Prieste, and had the same Qualitie, or els God the Father wanted one dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie or Qualitie, which God the Sonne had touching his Godhead. But God the Father neuer was Priest: Ergo, as before you made Christe inferiour to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touching his Godhead, for makinge Sacrifice to his Father as beinge God: so nowe you make
<pb facs="6"/>
Christe Superiour to his Father, for hauing an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, Dignitie, or Qualitie touching his Godhead, which God the Father had neuer.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, you make by this meanes twoo seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and distincte Godheades of God the Father, and God the Sonne. For if to be a Prieste belongeth to the Godhead of Christe, the same also belongeth to the Godhead of the Father. But Priesthood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth in no wise to God the Father: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Godhead of the Father, and the Godhead of the Sonne, are twoo manner of Godheades of seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and distincte powers, not equal, and one, the one Godheade hauing Priesthoode, the other hauing not, or, whiche is al one, the one God beinge a Prieste, and the other being no Prieste: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wil folowe, there are twoo Goddes, not One one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God.</p>
   <p>O horrible blasphemie. After these longe Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and multiplying of Heresies, our Protestants are nowe come to be right Arians, and professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the most blessed Trinitie.</p>
   <p>If to auoide this most haynous and detestable Heresie, you wil say, that God the Father also touching his Godhead is a Prieste, then tel vs, what hath he to sacrifice? To whom shal he do that humble seruice and worship? Or is he a man also as Christe is,
<pb facs="7"/>
and did he suffer death, as the olde Heretikes taught, called thereof, <hi>Patropassiani</hi>?<note place="margin">Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passiani.</note>
   </p>
   <p>The Truth is. Christ touching his Godhead is not a Priest, ne made not the Sacrifice touching his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head (as very blasphemously you haue written): but only touching his manhood.</p>
   <p>Marke the point good Reader, as being of most weighty importance. Christe is both God, and Man. But what he doth touching the manhoode, that doth not the Father, nor the Holy Ghoste in the same sorte. Marie, what he doth touching his Godhead, that in al pointes God the Father, and God the holy Ghost, doth equally with him. Which is the cause that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth vs to beleeue, that not the Godhead, or whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie tooke fleshe, but only the second person in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Least if the Godhead had done it, or if it had bene done touching the Godhead, we should be constrained to say, the whole Trinitie was incarnate, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Faith. Now if Christe touching his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head coulde do that, which the Father and the Holy Ghoste should not do: the Godhead were diuided, and peaces, or partes were made thereof (it being immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, indiuisible, one, and most excellently perfect) so that touching that parte of the Godhead, whiche were in Christe, Sacrifice might be made, but tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that, which were in the Father, and the Holy
<pb facs="7"/>
Ghoste, sacrifice might not be made.</p>
   <p>Here we shal trie how this nowe broched Arian, wil purge him selfe. Here shal we see, whether this Heresie shal also be soothed, bolstered, and shoulde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp, as your other Heresies are, or no. Last of al here shal we see, whether you wil recant, and retract this abominable Heresie, as in your Sermon of the <hi>.15.</hi> of Iune last at Paules Crosse, you promised and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to doo, if you could be conuinced of any. Of this I say no more. But if this blasphemie may be mainteined in this newe English Churche, vndoubtedly this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Churche (ô pitiful case) wil proue a professour of Arianisme, yea I feare, at length of worse, if worse may be. Certainely our Christe neuer taught this doctrine, neither was euer any such thing attributed vnto Christe by Gods worde, nor by the Catholike Churche: wherefore you seme not to beleeue in our Christe.</p>
   <p>Christ said of the Spiritual Rewlers,<note place="margin">Luc. <hi>10.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>he that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth you, heareth me, he that despiseth you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth me,</hi> and so taught obedience vnto his Church, and also vnto that chiefe Gouernour, whom he institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Head of the same, and appointed to be his Vicare. For wheras he said,<note place="margin">Ioan. <hi>21.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>feede my shepe,</hi> he meant, that the sheepe should obey him, whom he ordeined their feeder, or Pastor. Whereof it foloweth, that who so euer refuseth to be fed, that is to say, to be gouerned
<pb facs="8"/>
and taught, by that general Shepeherd, he forsaketh the state and order of a sheepe,<note place="margin">Math. <hi>25.</hi>
      </note> and becōmeth a Goat, and therefore to be placed at the lefte side, when the great Shepeherd of al Shepeherdes shal come to sorte his flockes. Christ commendeth vnto vs the Sacrament of Penaunce, in which if we sinne after Baptisme, we are reconciled to God by a Priest, whereunto Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes belongeth. Christ also requireth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmance of Vowes. This doctrine you receiue not, you teache it not. You beleeue not our Christe.</p>
   <p>Christ (saith S. Irenaeus) at his last supper tooke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his handes the creature of bread, blessed, and gaue thankes,<note place="margin">Iren. li. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>32.</hi>
      </note> saying. <hi>This is my body,</hi> and taking the Cuppe likewise, <hi>he confessed it to be his bloude, and taught the nevve Oblation of the nevve Testament, vvhich the Churche, receiuing it of the Apostles, offereth vp to God in the vvhole vvorlde.</hi> Christian people hath euer bene taught from the Apostles time to this day, that to be his true Body, and his true Bloude, whiche are offered, an vppon credit of Christes saying, doo adoure and worship the same. You teache not this doctrine. You beleeue not, that Christes wordes do implye this much, you teache the contrary. Thus you beleeue not in our Christe.</p>
   <p>That Christe sitting at the right hande of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="8"/>
in heauen, is at the same time in the handes of them who receiue the Sacrament of the Aulter, bothe Sacrifice, and Sacrificer (as S. Chrysostome teacheth and the Church beleeueth) you teache not, you receiue not, you beleeue not. Whereas Christ consecrateth the hoste by the ministerie of the Priest, saying, <hi>this is my body, this is my bloude</hi>: his saying being true, and you not beleeuing, how beleeue you in Christe?</p>
   <p>Christ said,<note place="margin">Math. <hi>5.</hi>

      <hi>A Citie built vpon a hil can not be hidde,</hi> meaning it of his Church built vpon him selfe. You teach, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the true Church of Christ hath hen hidde these almost a thousand yeres, and so hidde, that before Luthers time, al Christians were in palpable darknes. How then beleue you in Christ? Christ said to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples bearing the person of al y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Church.<note place="margin">Math. <hi>28.</hi>

      <hi>Behold, I am vvith you al daies vntil the end of the vvorld.</hi> And againe.<note place="margin">Ioan. <hi>14.</hi>

      </note>Nay beleeue you in Christ at al? S. Augustine tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that Heretikes beleeue not, that Christ came in flesh. <hi>Charitie</hi> (saith he) <hi>brought him vnto flesh. VVho so euer therefore</hi> (thus he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth) <hi>hath not Charitie, he denieth that Christ came in fleshe.</hi> And to proue that an Heretike hath not Charitie, thus he reasoneth. <hi>Tu non habes Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem, quia pro honore tuo diuidis vnita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> Thou hast not Charitie, bicause for thine owne honours sake thou diuidest vnitie.</p>
   <p>There for sure trial of Preachers, whether they haue the spirite of God, or no, comparing them, as S. Paule doth, to earthen pitchers, he biddeth men to prooue them by the sounde. <hi>Pulsate, tangite vasa fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilia, ne fortè crepuerint, &amp; male resonent.</hi> Knocke the earthen pitchers (saith he) tinke them with your fingers, least perhaps they be crackte, and geue a broken sounde. You are crackte, you are crakte M. Iewel. We haue knockte you, and we finde, that your sound is not whole. How so? Bicause you haue not the Charitie and loue of vnitie.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="9"/>You say (I knowe wel) y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> you haue Charitie, and that ye diuide not the Vnitie, but that we the Papistes (for so ye cal the Catholiques) be they, by whom the Vnitie is diuided. No, no, M. Iewel. It wil not serue you so to say. For when men were once One, and in one Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient felowship or Communion (as ye and we were in One Auncient Church, before Luther brake the knot) he diuideth Vnitie, which departeth from his felowes and former godly companie, to ioyne him selfe with a newe companie, not he who abydeth stil in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Auncient companie. Say therefore what ye wil, S. Augustine plainely prooueth, that ye are they, which haue broken the Vnitie. For this can not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, which by him is spoken, as it were to your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: <hi>Tollis te ab vnitate Orbis terrarum &amp;c.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Tract. <hi>6.</hi> in epist. Iohan.</note>
      <hi>You vvithdravv your selfe from the vnitie of the vvhole vvorlde. You diuide the Church by Schismes, you rent the bodie of Christ. He came to gather together, you crie out to the ende to set a sundre.</hi> It is you M. Iewel, and your fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that diuide your selues from the Vnitie, in whiche the whole worlde was ioined and knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. We remaine in that Faith, which we founde the worlde in when we were borne, and in whiche the worlde hath continued sithens the Apostles time. You shal neuer be hable to shewe, that (<hi>Orbis
<pb facs="10"/>
terrarum</hi>) the round world is at this day, or euer was, of your side.</p>
   <p>Wil ye haue it appeare euidently, howe ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide yourselues from the Vnitie of the worlde? Your selues do confesse it in the Apologie of your English Synagogue more then seuen times. There ye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that Frier Luther, and Zuinglius were the firste that beganne to set abroade the Gospel, and that al the light was quite extinct, and that al the fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines of the pure water of life were vtterly dryed vp, before they came.</p>
   <p>Thus it is cleare to the simplest wittes that are, forasmuche as ye condemne the vniuersal Churche dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed ouer the whole worlde, departe from it, and ioyne your selues to Luther, Zuinglius and Caluine, that ye make breache of the Vnitie. Of al this it is concluded, that you lacke Charitie, and therefore though ye haue neuer so much Faith, by S. Augustines doctrine, wel may it be, that ye beleeue Christe, but in Christe ye beleeue not.</p>
   <p>If it be so then that ye beleeue not in Christ, (whiche neuer the lesse S. Augustine declareth to be vnderstanded in respecte of deedes, not of wordes, for many <hi>confesse Christe vvith mouth,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Tit. <hi>1.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>and denie him vvith deedes,</hi> as S. Paule saith) and that therefore chiefly ye beleeue not in him, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="10"/>
ye are voide of Charitie, as being gone from the Vnitie of the whole worlde: so many as loue Christe, and feare to lose the parte they hope to haue with Christe, wil study how to kepe them selues like sounde wheat in the safe Floure of Vnitie, and wil not by the puffes of any your preachinges,<note place="margin">Ephes. <hi>4.</hi>
      </note> or writinges, seme they neuer so sweete and pleasant, suffer them selues, like light Chaffe, to be scattred into your damnable sectes and diuisions.</p>
   <p>Neuerthelesse, if ye glorie, and crake of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes that ye haue in our countrie of England, where the trompettes of your pleasant Gospel haue ben soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and twite vs of our smal number (smal I meane in respect of such as make open profession there to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, for otherwise Gods secret and vnknowen nū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doubtelesse is right great): we tel you, a Pecke of wheat is more worth, then a Sacke of Chaffe.

      </note> y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> when the Winower shal come with his Fanne, the wheat shalbe layd vp in his Garner, the Chaffe shalbe cast away into vnquencheable fyre. God send you grace to see the perilous state ye stand in, and both to beleeue in Christ rightly, and otherwise as to saluation is behooful: that so the people, for whom Christ hath shed his bloud, be no more with most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine lossé of their soules seduced by you, and so to ioine in vnitie with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Catholik and Vniuersal Church.

when I shal vnderstande, I shal right hartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioise in you, as nowe I am right sorry for you, and with good wil, if euer I write vnto you, say (whiche nowe I may not say) Farewel.<note place="margin">
