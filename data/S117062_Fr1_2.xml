   <p>ALthough the revealing of the Revelation and the song of songes doe yeeld cleere and notable arguments, sufficiently to make knowne the happie and longed for voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iewes, yet the due regard of such a divine mysterie doth require that we bring forth &amp; laie to every litle sparke, taken from the aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of God, which maie yeeld more cleere and evidēt proofe of that truth which mortall men doe not yet sufficiently conceive &amp; see into. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold therefore how this truth is confirmed not of one or two, but of three such wittnesses, as are beyond all exception. Daniel is added to Iohn and Salomon,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1.2. <hi>With.</hi> 10. 14.</note> who among the visions of God almightie, doe plainly testifie that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of his nation to be performed in the last times was also revealed, what speciall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the good <hi>&amp;</hi> great God made of all these, doe those singular commendations testifie, which the Scriptures have honoured them withall. Iohn he is the disciple whō Iesus loved, Salomon was the king beloved of his God,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.23.</note>
      <pb n="4" facs="3"/> whom his name was called Iedediah;<note place="margin">
         <hi>Nehe.</hi> 13.26. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.11.19.</note> 2. Sam. 12.25, Daniel also is a man of desires, because in his time he was most accepted and beloved of God. It must not therfore seeme strange, if God made known his secrets unto them after a speciall maner,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.14. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.12.</note> for the secret of the Lord is present to them that feare him. Vnited forces do allwais best prevaile, and the more helpes they associate and ioyne together, the stronger they are, A three fold coard is not easily broken.</p>
   <p>Although therfore thou doe somtime doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinglie read over the Revelation of Iohn, &amp; the songe of Salomon for the newnes and strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the matter, yet when by Daniels coming in, such an admirable cōsent of Scripture, giveth such cleere lighte to confirme the matter in hand, feare not to embrace the truth with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes unto God: for here all these, not by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conspiration, but by divine inspiration, doe proclaime one and the same thinge.</p>
   <p>How much also Daniels testimonie is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of in this matter, thou shalt farre better perceive by his owne words wel understood, thē by mine, as the ēsuing expositiō plainly sheweth.</p>
   <p>That truly is of great weight that Daniels prophecie is deputed and appointed for the Iewes, to whom notwithstanding he bringeth no comfort, if that resurrection spoken of 12.2. be understood of the last and generall resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, properly so called, which without all doubte both in matter and time doth fall-in
<pb facs="3"/> together with their deliveraunce in verse. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde then after the Iewes three last enemies be vtterly overthrowne; that is to saie, The Romane empire, which is called the King ch. 11.36. and is described by his properties verse 37.38.39. and the Saracens, whom he noteth and nameth, The King of the South vers. 40. and lastly, the Turkish empire stiled with the title of the King of the North vers. 40. &amp;c. Behold I saie, a plaine and cleere pourtraiture of the Iewes vocatiō, not onely vndertaken and begun 44.45. but consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and perfect ch. 12.1.2.3. where it shall bee made manifest (<hi>I</hi> think) without obscuritie. That the resurrection there, is the full restoring of the Iewish nation out of the dust of destruction and their calling to the faith in Christ, wherby those that are dead in sinne are truly raised up againe according to that of the Apostle, If the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead. Rom. 11.15.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15.</note>
   </p>
   <p>And that the mindes of good men maie the lesse be disquieted in the expectation of so great a felicity and happines. Lo the very times of this deliveraunce opened to thee, as well of it begun whē tidings out of the East shall trouble the Turk vers. 7. and 11. as when fulfilled, when the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish name and empire both shall bee vtterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, The greatnes of the Kingdomes vnder the whole heaven shalbee given to the people of the Saints of the most high, vers. 12. True it is
<pb n="6" facs="4"/> indeed that almost all these thinges are otherwise caried and applied by interpreters very wel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of the Church: but Truth is ever wel accepted and enterteined of the ingenuous, to which none can prescribe a rule, or overrule, not space of times, of patronage (or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) of persons,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Virgin. Velan. c. <hi>1.</hi> August. de lib. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitr. <hi>3.</hi>
      </note> as Tertullian speaks well. Yea, if a scandall be taken (or arise) because of the truth, it is more, profitable to permitt the scandall, thē that the truth should be left. He doth sparingly refute other mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but mildly after his maner alwaies, where they prejudice and hinder the truth.</p>
   <p>The controversy is cheifly concerning Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, whom he endevoureth to proove by a multitude of weighty reasons, That he must of necessitie be excluded out of every particle of this prophecie which he hath here vndertakē to handle. Assuredly he bringeth admirable light to the right vnderstanding of the whole prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Daniel. Weighing then all thinges in an equall ballance, lay apart all prejudice against the truth discovered, and pray earnestly with mee. That the Deliverer may come out of Sion, who may vtterly overthrow his enemies, the Beast with Gog and Magog, and that he may thorowly turne away vngodlines from Iacob. Farewel.</p>
