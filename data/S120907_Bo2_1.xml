      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, there being so much spoken as thou maist perceiue, by the fore-going Treatise, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cruel, inhumane, treacherous, perfidious; yea, unnatural practises of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in these parts, and elswhere, which may sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate him in his deserved colours, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beholds him may mourn to see this <hi>Hazael</hi> so to tyrannize over the innocent, and that the Lord should permit, and the earth bear such an unheard of monster; yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much more might be added in sundry other particulars, as the Dutch Chronicles mention, and other Writers haue well set out: amongst which, although I my selfe be a stranger by Nation to them; yet since the time of my abode here, having attained some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the Language, I haue thought fit to adde some further particulars, which in my reading I haue observed, and could adde many more; but my purpose being onely to annex a few things, I wil not enlarge, lest I adde another Treatise. But before I come to what I intend, I haue thought fit having some oversight in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of this Treatise aforegoing, to note by the way, the ill tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating of one word, in the 21 folio, it is touching the Princesse of <hi>Parma,</hi> the Translator termes her <hi>a crafty Queane,</hi> wheras the word beares no such sence in the Dutch, but signifies one that hath a sharp wit to deceiue, as is said of the serpent that beguiled <hi>Eue.</hi> Beside, that <note place="margin">The Dutch word <hi>Ghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sante</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour or Messenger.</note> that is translated <hi>Embassadour,</hi> speaking of such as were sent from the States to the King, I conceiue to be more fittingly rendred <hi>Messenger.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>First, thou art to understand, gentle Reader, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was lovingly received here in the 17 Provinces, and a solemn oath was taken on both parts; the King for his part swore to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all their Lawes and Priviledges, and they to him all due homage and allegance: He presently demanded of them a summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. wherupon the States did assemble, and collected for him 40
<pb n="2" facs="50"/> millions of Florines, of <hi>Brabants</hi> mony, to be paid in nine years, and they paid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t into his Exchequer; and although it was more then they had paid before to his predecessours, yet upon this he did take great displeasure against them; and, as they write, he for this did hate them to death.</p>
   <p>But he pretended this to be the cause of his wroth, because he saw that there were some among them, that did defie the Pope and all his Religion: but that could not be, for the Citie of <hi>Aelst</hi> was as superstitious in that Religion as <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe; for they did perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Reformed Religion even unto death: and yet for all that both they, and 170 far villages that belonged unto them, were by them plundered and spoyled of all their goods, and many of them wounded and tormented for to confesse where their mony was, and many were killed. Thus much by the way.</p>
   <p>My scope and chiefe intent, is to shew the first and just cause of the warres in the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> wherby the diligent Reader (not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affected) may clearly understand, that the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> did not rebelliously take up Armes against a lawful Prince, (as some ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly thinke and speake) but justly and religiously defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against a perfidious Tyrant who sought their ruine, by all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible meanes he could, and the subversion of the whole State. A long while they patiently underwent his cruel oppressions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolierable vexations, as the Histories clearly manifest; til there was no hope, but either they must become slaues in soule and body, worse then that of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they and theirs for ever, or else be butchered by mercilesse executioners of a cruel Tyrant. This Tyrant having a purpose to innovate all things, to root out the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient inhabitants, and to frustrate all the Lawes, Customes and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which himselfe had sworn to maintain, knew not how bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to effect his evil ends, then by raysing a bloudy Inquisition to set over them for their government; which said Inquisition (raised <note place="margin">The inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was there 4. yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> in <hi>Spain)</hi> concluded and pronounced certain Articles, the tenth of February 1568, which were confirmed by the King, the 26 fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Now because it may appear I doe them no wrong in this charge, I wil lay down the Articles themselues verbatim.</p>
   <p>The most sacred Office of Inquisition so often attempted in the Netherlands by his Majestie, and hindered untill this time, shall bee
<pb n="3" facs="50"/> instituted and advanced in this manner, which is most expedient.</p>
   <p n="1">1 They must perswade the Emperour, being gone astray, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly confederated with heretickes, that hee resigne his kingdomes unto his Sonne, with the whole administration of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</p>
   <p n="2">2 That the Emperour with his two sisters, having given over all affaires, leaving the Netherlands, shall retire into Spaine unto Vs, being assured that they shall never returne more to doe any harme.</p>
   <p n="3">3 These being dispatcht, we must also draw the king to us, &amp; keep him for ever that he part not, and not suffer any Flemmings to haue accesse or conference with him.</p>
   <p n="4">4 That the King write unto, and command the Clergie of the Netherlands, that with the Inquisition they should accept of 15 new Bishops, the which should be free from all secular jurisdiction, yea in cases of treason.</p>
   <p n="5">5 The subjects of the Netherlands through their malice &amp; way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse, will revolt and moue seditions and tumults, pleasing to all but to our companie.</p>
   <p n="6">6 The Princes and Noblemen, heads and authouts of those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, with the subjects, must be taken away, and the others reduced unto reason.</p>
   <p n="7">7 They shall hire at our charge theeues and spoilers of Churches and Images, whose offences shall be by all the world imputed to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, by some subtill meanes, and so we shall vanquish them.</p>
   <p n="8">8 That all Comerce, Negotiation, Liberties, and Privileges, shall be rooted out, and that all be reduced to extreame povertie, whereby the realme shall be permanent for Vs.</p>
   <p n="9">9 No man of all those Countries (except he be of our faction) shall be held worthy to liue; and finally all to be rooted out: and all Goods, Possessions, Arts, and Trades, and all Orders to bee taken away, untill there may bee a new Realme, and a new people.</p>
   <p n="10">10 In this action the wise and valiant Duke <hi>Alva</hi> shal be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in person; whereas any other, were he of the blood Royall, or a Prince, shall be of no esteeme: so as being suspect, yea in the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest matters, they must be dispatcht.</p>
   <p n="11">
      <pb n="4" facs="51"/>11 No Contracts, Rights, Promises, Donations, Oathes, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and solemne Assertions of the Netherlands, shall bee of any force for the inhabitants, as being guiltie of high treason.</p>
   <p n="12">12 But aboue al we must haue an especial care that in these matters of so great weight and moment, wee proceed not violently, but by meanes, by degrees, and that discreetly, to the end the Princes, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and inferiour subjects may mutinie amongst themselues, so that one may persecute, yea execute the other until at last the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be executed himselfe. For in all Christendome is there not a Nation more foolish and indiscreet, and whose levitie and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie may sooner be deceived then these Netherlanders, and God punisheth them accordingly.</p>
   <p>There were other Articles found in President <hi>Vergaes</hi> chamber at <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> and there Printed; and those are more cruel then these.</p>
   <p>By these articles and unlimited power of these lawlesse Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, no man had any assurance of life or goods for a day, but were in danger continually to be called into question, either for the law of their God, or for some work of mercie, which either religion, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral equitie, or the bond of nature called for: or else if they had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for none of these, they would impose such unreasonable taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which if the Cormorants had not their gorges crambed full, they would make prey of all, whether by right or wrong it mattered not. But my purpose being to avoyd prolixitie, and to passe by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rtinencies and needlesse repetitions, I wil come to that I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In the yeare 1565 a match was concluded for the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the nuptials were solemnized at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> whither all the Nobilitie and Gentry of the countrey were invited, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there met of them about foure hundred, who like faithfull <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> being grieved to see the daily oppression of their brethren by the hard task-masters of the Inquisition, who not onely robbed them of their goods, but also by inhumane cruelty, and unnaturall butchery, deprived them of their liues, who daily led them as sheepe unto the slaughter: The consideration hereof they joyntly layd to heart, and hereupon (being met upon this occasion) they resolved to present al petition to the Princesse of <hi>Parma,</hi> which they did the 5 of April
<pb n="5" facs="51"/> next following. The Earle of Breedrod delivering the petition, humbly requested a favourable answer. Three dayes after they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this answer, viz. they should send two of their Noblemen to the king, by whom she would write in their behalfe. The Lord of Barlaymont being present, after their departure sayd <hi>(like a flattering Courtier)</hi> they were a company of Rascals and Beggars.</p>
   <p>It was concluded that the Marquesse of Bargen, and the Lord of Mountigny should goe into Spain, who humbly presented their suite to the King, but could get no answer in 16 monthes after.</p>
   <p>The 26 of August <hi>anno</hi> 1566, the Princesse of <hi>Parma</hi> sent for the Gentrie, telling them she had received letters from the King, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining promise that all should be well, and that the Inquisition should cease. And for the Proclamations they should not be of force, but his Majestie would take such order as they and the State should wel like of. The Princesse also gaue them toleration for their Religion, on condition they should not deface, nor break downe the ornaments of the Churches: for, there had been before this time vilde and lewd persons that frequented the meetings of the Reformed; these went into the Papists Churches, stole their silver and what was worth carrying away, and brake down their Images: but the Reformed suspected that this was done by the appointment of the Princesse; neither was their suspicion without good ground, for it is to be se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n in the Kings letters, <hi>Art. 7,</hi> that she had order to hire this raskal company to doe this villany, which fact was imputed to the <note place="margin">Emanuel de Miter sayth, that in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they took 50 of them at one time, and hanged 22 and whipped the rest.</note> Protestants, to the end that they might not onely be odious there, but also seem guilty, even in the judgment of other Nations; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the offenders were punished with imprisonment, yea, with death, even by the Reformed themselues, who jointly confessed the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unlawful, and were so farre from giving occasion of offence in this nature, that Papist Burgers themselues offered good security that no such thing should be attempted by them. Who then can make any doubt that they were free from having any hand in those outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges laid to them, the very opposites in Religion being Iudges, who as appeares were willing to undertake for them; now as their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse brought so good effect for their persons, so did the Lord worke that the truth of Religion found many friends likewise, the Lord wondrously prospering the course of Reformation, in so
<pb n="6" facs="52"/> much them that in short space they had in <hi>Flanders</hi> 60 Assemblies, some Churches they themselues builded, but were by Duke <hi>d'Alva</hi> soon cast down, who erected gallowses of them, and hanged them upon them.</p>
   <p>The Princesse of <hi>Parma</hi> also began to entertain souldiers with pretence to apprehend the Church-robbers, but intended indeed to take away the ancient Liberties and Priviledges of the <hi>Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> wherfore sending certain companies to <hi>Valencyn,</hi> the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants denyed them entertainment, who for that were proclaimed Rebels the 14 of December, soon after they were besieged, sacked, and many of them put to death.</p>
   <p>But before they of <hi>Valencyn</hi> denyed entertainment to the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the Nobility had received letters out of <hi>Spain,</hi> from the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse <note place="margin">He preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but his aime was to get their lands and goods.</note> of <hi>Bargen,</hi> shewing, that the King was exceedingly incensed against the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> that he had in the presence of many vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be fully revenged of them, though it were with the hazard of all his Countries; that he would make them an example to all the world, and would invite the Pope and Emperour to assist him in this quarrel. Vpon the receit of the letters the Nobility assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Dortmond</hi> to consult what were best to be done, but conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not any thing, some judging it safest to joyn, and make head to resist his tyrannical furie, other seeking rather to escape by flight.</p>
   <p>Now was the Inquisition again brought in contrary to the Lawes and Liberties of the Country, which the King was sworn to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, for execution wherof there were appointed 12 Inquisitors, commanding them to receiue the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> these were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The bloudy Councel,</hi> and so they were indeed, which <hi>Rome</hi> well knew, refusing it, <hi>anno</hi> 1559, when as they fel upon the Inquisitors house, set it on fire, wounded the chiefe of them, brake open the prison, and set at liberty the captiues, and would haue burned a Cloyster that belonged unto them, had they not been by fair means disswaded by two Lords in the Citie, <hi>viz, Marc. Antonio Colunus,</hi> and <hi>Iulio Caesar.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Likewise <hi>Venice, Naples</hi> and <hi>Millain,</hi> though they be Papists, would not suffer it; the Marchants of <hi>Lisbon</hi> who are as superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Romish Religion as any in the world, yet they did offer
<pb n="7" facs="52"/> the King two millions and a half, that they might not haue it in their parts.</p>
   <p>Yet the cruelty of this Inquisition did here increase, and many souldiers came into the countrey, that some of the countrey for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook their houses, and resorted towards Freezland, and some did stay at home, and went to meet Duke <hi>Alva,</hi> and welcomed him into the Countrey, and shewed him all the kindnesse they could, but <note place="margin">As the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

         </gap> Gentry at Brussels, 1568.</note> he very shortly took off most of their heads, so that he did so terrifie the inhabitants, that there fled out of the countries more then an hundred thousand houshoulders, besides many that were taken in flying, were taken and hanged, and all these had their goods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscated to the King.</p>
   <p>The Prince of Orange, and the Earle of Bredrod, and fiue Earles, eight Lords, and 50 Gentlemen, and they had some fiue thousand of Souldiers being in Freesland, but were most over-throwne by the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> his forces; so that they were driven to Embden land, and there prepared themselues to the sea.</p>
   <p>Now the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> did command all the inhabitants to pay the hundreth peny of all their goods, and of all that was bought and sold; the which some of the States did yeeld unto: And then he commanded them to pay the twentith peny: and then hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the tenth peny of all things that were bought and sold, so often as they should be sold. Some of the States did make their humble petition to the Duke, and to the Princes, shewing them that it would driue all trading out of the land. The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> told them that he would haue it, though it did ruinate al the land; but if he saw them to doe their best to pay it, he would deale favourably with them. But he sayd that it was against the kings ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <note place="margin">All the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, insomuch as they were forced to prepare more, and filled them also.</note> if they should not pay it, seeing it was his pleasure to require it. And now did the Inquisition imprison and execute many of the richer sort, as wel Papists as of the reformed Church: and if they were rich there was no escaping for them. And whosoever was found to haue any hand in way of suit and petition to haue the tenth peny to be remitted, they were adiudged to haue committed high treason against God and the King; and all these must forfeit life and goods to the king, and not any of their children to enjoy one peny worth of the same: but (poore Orphanes) they must begge their
<pb n="8" facs="53"/> bread. And some that had been buried certaine months, they caused them to be digged up, and hanged on the gallowes, and some to be burned, because they had not the sacrament, and confessed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their death; but it was because he would confiscate their goods to the king: yea when these insatiable gold-thirsty and blood-thirsty wretches wanted colour to cover their injustice and cruelty, they had their officious imps (false witnesses) suborned by <hi>Iesabel,</hi> to get <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi> vineyard; witnesse <hi>Martin Hutton,</hi> who was one of the Inquisitors Clarkes, and (being committed to prison) did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that hee had made many false testimonies against sundry rich persons, some whereof were of the reformed Church. Here might fitly be brought in the hundred Marchants of <hi>Granado,</hi> who were of the Romane Religion, and were never other; what pretence had he to cause them to bee murthered all in one night, and then presently to command all their goods to be brought to his treasurie or Exchequer, whose estate was worth more then 28 hundred thousand pound sterling? Now as this tyrant was a devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and destroyer of the liues of men, so did hee presume to usurpe further not onely upon civil ordinances, but upon the things of God; so that those that were married in the reformed Church, he forced to be married againe: and if they were rich, hee tooke them from their husbands, and gaue them to his souldiers to make prize of them. Those that were baptized in the reformed Church, he compelled to be baptized againe, contrary to Gods word, and to the decree of the ancient councels, so that intolerable were the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens this cruel <hi>Pharoh</hi> layd, so execssiue was his cruelty, that he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all places with blood, <hi>bloud touching bloud,</hi> as the Prophet speaks. For in smal townes hee executed 50, and in great townes 200, and 300 or 400. And in places as men travelled from one towne to another, they might see many that his souldiers had hung up in trees to death, and some were worth 80 thousand guldens, and some lesse: yea this tyrant did confiscate so much lands and goods, as by his account sent into Spain, did amount yearly to 8 tun of mony sterlin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, besides the many thousands that he and his souldiers had. All the money that he did exact out of this land in 6 yeares, did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to more then 50 millions of gold. And if any were knowne to haue any thing that did belong to any that were put to
<pb n="9" facs="53"/> death, and had not brought it to the knowledge of the Inquisition, they did loose both life and goods: yea the 16 of February 1566 he gaue sentence in his court at <hi>Madrill,</hi> that they were all traytors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God and himselfe. At Vtrecht he beheaded a widow that was 84 yeares old, because she had before lodged a preacher one night, whose living was worth foure thousand guldens yearly. And at Mastricht a father for lodging his son that he had not seene in a long time, that was fled for religion, was put to death. And at that place there was one put to death for giving a widow a pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>k of coin for an almes, whose husband this bloody court had put to death. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny women were put to death, because they received their husbands in the night that were fled for religion; yea they haue killed women great with child, and ripped up their bellies, and taken out the child and killed it: and some they haue fleyed aliue, and covered drummes heads with their skins, and some they haue tyed to a post, and made a small fire round about them, and so rosted them to death.</p>
   <p>At Naerden they received the Spaniards friendly into the towne, <note place="margin">The like cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty they did at Oudwater</note> who promised them both their liues and goods; and as soone as they came in, they commanded them to come to the State-house without their Armes, the which they did, and the Spaniards gaue fire upon them and murthered them all: and then they ran about in the town, and ravished the women, and after killed them and fired the towne. The yong children that lay in the cradle, they quartered them, and took them upon their pikes, and so went up and downe the towne, rejoycing in their crueltie.</p>
   <p>Such savage cruelty is scarcely to be found in any History, what Christian heart can hear it, and not be affected with deep sorrow, yet behold some monsters herein haue been found, that haue been so farre from humanity herein, (for he that hath humanity in him will commiserate others calamities) that they haue applauded it, as if he had in all these outrages done God good service. Amongst the rest, I shall content my selfe at present, but to name the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope, and one of his chiefe sonnes in this businesse. The Pope sends his Legate to commend these so rare expio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="54"/> his good service in maintaining the Romish Religion, and subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of hereticks. Howbeit that his chiefe son I mentioned (excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this man of sin, in the sin of cruelty, as if he would verifie himselfe to be ten fold more the child of Satan, then his father the Pope) thinkes not so well of it, his name is <hi>Vergas,</hi> the President of this bloudy Inquisition; for going shortly after into <hi>Spain,</hi> he told the King, that he and Duke <hi>d'Alva,</hi> did marre all in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> by shewing so much mercy to those people.</p>
   <p>Concerning this Duke <hi>d'Alva,</hi> of whose outrage and cruelty so many haue felt, and perfiduous dealing which many haue found by lamentable experience, wherby may easily appeare of what stamp his excessiue mercies are, even such as the Wiseman speakes of, <hi>Pro. 12. 10, the tender-mercies of the wicked are cruel.</hi> In which he prides himselfe, boasting he had slaughtered eighteen thousand and six <note place="margin">These words he spake at a banquet, as he sate at the Table, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing he had done the King so good service.</note> hundred, in form of justice, in six yeares times, and ten times so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he and his Souldiers murthered otherwaies. And many more would he doubtlesse haue murthered, had not the Lord restrayned and limited him, for his desire herein was as hell, that cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: Witnesse the purpose of his proceeding against the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> because they did not collect the tenth peny so as be desired. He sware that he would haue it, and before he would let it fall or remit it, the Sunne and Moone should leaue their shining, so he went to Brussels, and commanded the executioner to prepare ladders and ropes to hang up that night in their doores 70 of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and gaue them his warrant in writing what they should be: But God in his providence prevented this his cruel purpose, in that <note place="margin">Anno 1573 April. 1.</note> there came newes that the Graue of Mark had taken in the Brill; so the tyrant did not goe forward with his bloody enterprises. <note place="margin">I haue instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced but 4 or 5 towns, but there were scarce any town escaped their cruel fillaging, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they had bribed their Commanders with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing largegist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Thus having given you a taste of some of those many things I haue observed concerning the intolerable oppression, &amp; worse then salvage cruelty of the Spaniards, exercised upon the people, which they endured and laboured under the space of sixteene yeares; I wil now leaue these cruel tyrants to the Lord for judgment, and address my selfe to speak somewhat further concerning this Earle of Mark, who had those Gentlemen with him that fled. Before this hee had layne with his shipping in England, but the King of Spaine sending his Embassadour to our Queen (who was then in peace with him)
<pb n="11" facs="54"/> to desire her that she would not suffer his subiects to haue their harbour in her land, and that she would not giue them or suffer them to haue any reliefe whereby they should make head against him: and hereupon the Queene sent and commanded them out of her har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and she commanded that they should not be suffered to haue any provision in her coasts, so that now they had no other meanes but onely God, who did in his mercie provide for them better then they expected. For they were purposed to haue gone for the Tassel, and to haue taken some towne about that part; but when they came neere that part, they had the wind contrary that they could not come there, so they went for the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se, and came with their ships before the Brill, and there they went presently and tooke it; yet the Duke of Alva had his forces in the towne, neere so many as they were, whom they presently killed and chased out of the towne, and out of the Iland. The Prince of Orange being in France, and hearing what had happened, he sent them souldiers with as much speed as could be out of France. And within one moneth after Duke Alva sent cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine companies to Vlishing to keep that place strong for himselfe, and many of the commanders were come into the towne: So the Magistrates commanded the citizens to come presently upon the Statehouse, so they told them they must lodge the Spaniards in their houses; and they knowing how they had used the citizens in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they came, they told the magistrates they would not haue the Spaniards in their towne. The Magistrates asked them which of them it was that did refuse to receiue them. They sayd, All of them. So the Magistrates seeing them so earnest against the Spaniards, they joyntly tooke their Armes, and killed and took prisoners all them that were in the town, and with their Ordenance they shot at his ships where the Spaniards were, and they made away. And of those that were takē, there were the names of about 80 that they had in writing frō Duke Alva that dwelt in the Iland, that they should put to death. <note place="margin">Hee had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed those to be executed because they were the chief that stood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the tenth peny.</note> So those of the Bril sent their souldiers with speed to help them. And shortly the Prince of Orange came with forces and defended them; and some other townes seeing the crueltie of the Spaniards, forsooke the Spaniard, and joyned with them, and took the Prince of Orange to be their Protector, yet the States notwithstanding did remain in obedience to the King some seven yeares after.</p>

   <p>Again it is further worthy to be noted, that these Provinces did three times send to the King their Noblemen, but could obtain no mercy, and many more times they went to the Princesse of <hi>Parma,</hi> and made their humble pet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>on for redresse of their oppression, but could not obtain any savour, then they made friends to the renowned Queen of England, and to the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and to the Emperour, who did earnestly entreat by their Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours for them. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> answered their Embassadours with these words; he bade them tell their Masters, <hi>That they should meddle with their own subjects, and not with his, for he knew wel enough how to rule his subjects without their counsel.</hi> Now when our Queenes Majesty found his unreasonablenesse and cruelty, then and <note place="margin">Ann. 1575.</note> not before, she assisted them with Armes.</p>
   <p>His own son Prince <hi>Charles</hi> did intreat for them, that it would please him to let them haue their Laws and Priviledges, and that they might not be so oppressed; and withall he told his father that those Countries did belong to him, and that they were given him at <note place="margin">Marplam in his Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle an. 1567</note> his Baptism, for the which his father sent him to prison, and he never came out again. If the Lord would not haue forgot what <hi>Amalek</hi> did, long after, for smiting the weakest and hind-most of his people, how may we in equity forget the infinite murthers, and spoiles, this cruel Tyrant hath executed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath prevailed? And who can forget in special that bloudie attempt against our selues, in the year 1588.</p>
   <p>If I should trace this Tyrant from place to place, I should runne in infinitum, having made the name of Christianity hateful, by his cruelty, amongst the Heathens that know not God further then the light of nature: for it is confessed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselues, that some of the cheife of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who were to be burnt to death, <note place="margin">They were exhorted by a Popish Priest to minde, that after this use, there was one place for joy, and an other of torment.</note> being told of heaven and hel, they asked whether the <hi>Spaniards</hi> went when they dyed It was answered to heaven, <hi>Oh then sayd they, we will never come there, for we wil never come where the Spaniards are.</hi> But not to run so far, I wil rest content to keep me within the bounds I chiefly intended concerning these Countries. When the Citizens of <hi>Leyden</hi> were in great extremity, by reason of a long sieg, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> proffering conditions of peace, if so be they would yeeld up the Citie and themselues to them, they returned answer; <hi>Not while they
<pb n="13" facs="55"/> had a right hand to hold the sword, or a left to eat;</hi> but if they should be driven to fal into their hands, they would rather burn the Citie and drown themselues, then to subm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t to them, of whose perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse they had had so lamentable experience: and when some of the Citizens pressed a yeelding, in respect of the extremity of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, a Burgermaster, called <hi>Peter Adrianson</hi> said; <hi>Loving friends, I confesse the famine is great, and that some doe die for want of food: yet rather let us agree to eat up one another, as it shall fall by lot, begin with me first, and devide me amongst you.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>At <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by the appointment of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour did come into the Citie in battel order, and marched up and down their streets, and shot into their houses, and made a tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous noise, as if they had been so many devils, for one day and two nights, and took the keyes from the Magistrates, and set watch at <note place="margin">They did this as wel to the Spiritualty, as to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralty nosort excepted.</note> the Ports; wherby they put the Citizens in so great fear, that many women with childe fell in travel, and some dyed with feare: and they went by 12 or 20, into the best houses, and commanded them to prepare them the best cheere, as boyled and rost, and other dainty dishes, as they list to call for; and besides beer, they would haue at least two sorts of wine. And all the chiefest Citizens houses had at least ten of these guests. And they all cryed out for mony, and said that they would haue 15 moneths pay, before they went out of the <note place="margin">They did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them two parts in mony, and the third in cloth, but they cryed all for mony.</note> Citie, of them; and the Magistrates told them that they would procure them in cloth, and apparel, and mony the summe; but they all cryed out for mony, and that mony they would haue before they went away; so at the last, the Magistrats got the mony, which did amount to 400 thousand Guldens. And the charge they were at, which these companions did cost the Citizens, was 600 pound sterling the day, and thus they were oppressed with them 28 daies, <note place="margin">I doe make but a short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of some of the cruelties they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yet there stands in the Chronicle, one quire or paper of their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cruelty.</note> in which time they had made them all rich suites, some of sattin and velvet, and some of cloth of gold: and one of them had a cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of velvet, with these words in letters of gold. <hi>I am the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Bride-well Master.</hi> And thus they got rid of them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. And about two yeares after they came again, and then they used the Citizens much more cruelly, for these divels did bring straw, and set on fire, and put it into the houses, wherby they set nine rich streets on fire, and burnt them with many rich and costly
<pb n="14" facs="56"/> goods, and rif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ed the Citizens of all their rich and costly jewels, <note place="margin">That they are now and haue been this 30 year more qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, I easily yeeld it. But why? not that they haue changed their former nature, for they still hold the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer principles of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Trent, but being more subtill, and finding their Kingdom is more weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they dare not so presum as formerly.</note> and silver-workes, with their money, and three dayes did they tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the inhabitants for money: and in this time there was murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the citizens aboue foure thousand. The money they took at that time is reckoned for more then 40 tun of gold, beside the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels and the losse they had by fire, was as much as the rest. And thus was the best citie of Marchants in Europe ruinated.</p>

   <p>Divers things being manifested of the Spaniards cruelty, I will adde <note place="margin">In the yeare 1580, the States pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King Phillip to haue lost his right, by reason he violated his bath.</note> one instance of their trechery, &amp; that of a famous person to his neerest familiars; yea when he pretended sweetest familiaritie and friendship. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6. a Spaniard by birth, invited divers Nobles and Cardinals to a banket, with a purpose to poyson them all. The meetest instrument he made choyce of to effect this, was a Spaniard, one <hi>Caesar Burgia,</hi> his sworn servant. The Pope shewed himselfe wonderfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to avoyd suspition, and drank a carouse to them all; willing that his trusty servant to fill from such a bottell he knew well: which he did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effectually to the Pope himselfe as well as to the rest. After the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany <note place="margin">A Spaniards kindnesse to his friends.</note> was departed, the Pope perceiving by an alteration in himselfe, what was done, and that he must die now also, sayd to <hi>Burgia, This is a right Spanish trick.</hi> It is written of them that they are so expert in these exploits, that if <hi>Judas</hi> himselfe were aliue, he might goe to them to Schoole.</p>
   <p>I doe beseech the Lord to shew mercy to my natiue Country, that they may never come under the government of the Spaniards, and giue them hearts to repent of their transgressions, and that they may sincerely imbrace the Gospel of Iesus Christ, to their endlesse comfort, Amen.</p>
