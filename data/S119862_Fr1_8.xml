THis is thy doome, I by prophetick spirit,</l>
   <l>Presage will be the guerdon of my merit:</l>
   <l>Yet be no Burre, no trencher-flye, nor hound,</l>
   <l>To fawn on them whose tongs thy measures wound.</l>
   <l>Nor beg those niggards eyes, who grudge to see</l>
   <l>A watch unwinded in perusing thee.</l>
   <l>And if state-scratchers doe condemne thy jests,</l>
   <l>For ruffling sattens, and bespangled vests,</l>
   <l>Tell them they're cosend, and in vain they puffe,</l>
   <l>Thou neither aim'st at halfe-ell band or ruffe;</l>
   <l>And if thy lines perchance some <hi>Ermins</hi> gash,</l>
   <l>Tis not thy fault, twas no intended lash.</l>
   <l>Thy pensill limbs <hi>Don Fuco's</hi> portraicture,</l>
   <l>And onely dost his native worth immure</l>
   <l>Within these tilick rindes: nor is thy rage</l>
   <l>Against the Cow lists of this yongest age.</l>
   <l>Thy rithmes cry <hi>Pax</hi> to all, nor dost thou scatter</l>
   <l>Abuses on their shrines, their Saints, or water;</l>
   <l>And if some civill Satyr lash thee backe,</l>
   <l>Because he reads my title, sees my black,</l>
   <l>Answer ith' Poets phrase, and tell them more,</l>
   <l>My tale of yeares had scarce out-sum'd a score</l>
   <l>When my young phansie these light measures meant</l>
   <l>The Presse: but Fate since canceld that intent,</l>
   <l>Nor claim'd the Church as then a greater part</l>
   <l>In me than others, bate my title Art—</l>
   <l>But now the scean is chang'd? confest it is</l>
   <l>Must we abjure all youth, borne, bury this?</l>
   <l>Such closet death's desertlesse, in this glasse</l>
   <l>Read not what now I am, but then I was:</l>
   <l>In this reflection may the gravest see</l>
   <l>How true we suite, I, this, and this with mee.</l>
   <l>These thornes pickt out, whose venome might have bred</l>
   <l>A gangrene in thy Reader, struck thee dead.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="9"/>
Thou mayst perhaps invited be to court,</l>
   <l>And have a brace of smiles t'approve thy sport.</l>
   <l>Those, whose grave wisdomes, <hi>Wise</hi> do them entitle▪</l>
   <l>(Whose learned nods low dignorance can stifle)</l>
   <l>Some of times numbers on thy lines will scatter,</l>
   <l>If not cald from thee bv some higher matter,</l>
   <l>Laugh out a rubber, like, and say 'tis good</l>
   <l>For pleasure, youth and leasure, wholesome food.</l>
   <l>Some jigging Silk-canary, newly bloom'd,</l>
   <l>When he is crisped, bathed, oyld, perfum'd,</l>
   <l>(Which till the second chime, will scarce be done)</l>
   <l>Vpon thy feet will make his chrystals run,</l>
   <l>Commend the author, vow him service ever,</l>
   <l>But from such things his Genius him deliver.</l>
   <l>Some sleeked Nymphs, of countrey, citie, court,</l>
   <l>Will, next their Dogges and Monkies, like thy sport,</l>
   <l>Smile, and admire, and wearied will (perhaps)</l>
   <l>Lay thee to sleepe encurtaind in their laps,</l>
   <l>Oh happy thou! who would not wish to be</l>
   <l>(To gaine such dainty lodging) such, or thee?</l>
   <l>Say, to please them, the Poet undertooke</l>
   <l>To make thee from a sheet thrive to a booke,</l>
   <l>And if he has to beauty giv'n a gem,</l>
   <l>He challengeth a deck of thankes from them:</l>
   <l>And if some winning creature smile on thee,</l>
   <l>She shall his L. and his <hi>Bellama</hi> bee.</l>
   <l>Betwixt eleven and one, some <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Will snatch a phansie from thee, and put on</l>
   <l>A glove or ring of thine to court his lasse,</l>
   <l>Twixt Tearme and Tearme, when they are turnd to grasse.</l>
   <l>Some <hi>Titius</hi> will lay by his wax and bookes,</l>
   <l>And nim a phrase to bait his amorous hookes.</l>
   <l>But stay, I shall be chid, me thinkes I heare</l>
   <l>A censure spreadits wings to reach my eare,</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="10"/>
Tell me I am conceited: then no more,</l>
   <l>Go take thy chance, I turne thee out oth' dore.</l>
