      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE long and still declining state of the Christian commonweale, with the vtter ruine and subuersion of the Empire of the East, and many other most glorious kingdomes and prouinces of the Christians, neuer to be sufficiently lamented, might with the due consideration thereof worthily mooue euen a right stonie heart to ruth: but therewith also to call to remembrance the dishonour done vnto the blessed name of our Sauiour Christ Iesus, the desolation of his Church here millitant vpon earth, the dreadfull danger daily threatened vnto the poore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder thereof, the millions of soules cast headlong into eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, the infinit numbers of wofull Christians (whose grieuous gronings vnder the heauie yoke of infidelitie, no tongue is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse) with the carelesnesse of the great for the redresse thereof, might giue iust cause vnto any good Christian to sit downe, and with the heauie Prophet to say as he did of Hierusalem: <hi>O how hath the Lord darkened the daughter of Sion in his wrath? and cast downe from heauen vnto the earth the beautie of Israel,</hi>

      </note>
      <hi>and remembred not his footstoole in the day of his wrath?</hi> All which miseries (with many others so great, as greater there can none be) the prince of darkenesse and author of all mischiefe hath by the persecuting princes of all ages, and auntient heretickes, his ministers, laboured from time to time to bring vpon the Church of God, to the obscuring of his blessed name, and vtter subuersion of his most sacred word; but yet by none, no not by them all together so much preuailed, as by the false Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> borne in an vnhappie houre, to the great destruction of mankind: whose most grosse and blasphemous doctrine first phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied by himselfe in Arabia, and so by him obtruded vnto the world; and afterwards by the Sarasin Caliphes (his seduced successours) with greater forces maintained, was by them together with their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire dispersed ouer a great part of the face of the earth, to the vnspeakeable ruine and destruction of the Christian Religion and State: especially in Asia and Affricke, with some good part of Europe also. But the vnitie of this great Mahometane Monarchie being once dissolued, and it diuided into many kingdomes, and so after the manner of worldly things drawing vnto the fatall period of it selfe, in processe of time became of farre lesse force than before, and so lesse dreadfull vnto the Christian princes of the West, by whom these Sarasins were againe expulsed out of all the parts of Europe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting one corner of Spaine,<note place="margin">Granado in Spaine was recouered from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasins by king Ferdinand in the year <hi>1491</hi>
      </note> which they yet held within the remembrance of our fathers, vntill that by their victorious forces they were thence at length happily remooued also, after that they had posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the same about the space of seuen hundred yeares. In this declination of the Sarasins (the first champions of the Mahometane superstition, who though they had lost much, yet held many great kingdomes both in Asia and Affricke, taken for the most part from the Christians) arise the Turks, an obscure and base people, before scarce knowne vnto the world, yet fierce and courageous, who by their valour first aspired vnto the kingdome of Persia, with diuers other large prouinces: from whence they were about an hundred threescore and ten yeares after againe expulsed by the Tartars, and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retire themselues into the lesser Asia: where taking the benefit of the discord of the Christian princes of the East, and the carelesnesse of the Christians in generall, they in some good measure repaired their former losses againe, and maintained the state of a kingdome at Iconium in Cilicia
<pb facs="5"/>
(now of them called Caramania) holding in their subiection the greater part of that fruitfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, still seeking to gaine from the Christians what they had before lost vnto the Tartars. But this kingdome of the Turkes declining also, by the dismembring of the same, there slept vp among the Turkes in Bythinia one <hi>Osman</hi> or <hi>Othoman,</hi> of the <hi>Og<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>zian</hi> tribe or familie, a man of great spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and valour, who by little and little growing vp amongst the rest of his countreymen, and other the effeminate Christians on that side of Asia, at last like another <hi>Romulus</hi> tooke vpon him the name of a Sultan or King, and is right worthely accounted the first founder of the mightie Empire of the Turks: which continued by many discents directly in the line of himselfe, euen vnto <hi>Mahomet</hi> the third of that name, who now raigneth, is from a small beginning become the greatest terror of the world, and holding in subiection many great and mightie kingdomes in Asia, Europe, and Affricke, is growne to that height of pride, as that it threateneth destruction vnto the rest of the kingdomes of the earth; labouring with nothing more than with the weight of it selfe. In the greatnesse whereof is swallowed vp both the name and Empire of the Sarasins, the glorious Empire of the Greekes, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed kingdomes of Macedonia, Peloponesus, Epirus, Bulgaria, Seruia, Bosna, Armenia, Cyprus, Syria, Aegipt, Iudea, Tunes, Argiers, Media, Mesopotamia, with a great part of Hungarie, as also of the Persian kingdome, and all those churches and places so much spoken of in holy Scripture (the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes onely excepted;) and in briefe, so much of Christendome as farre exceedeth that which is thereof at this day left. So that at this present if you consider the beginning, progresse, and perpetuall felicitie of this the Othoman Empire, there is in this world nothing more admirable or strange; if the greatnesse and lustre thereof, nothing more magnificent or glorious; if the power and strength thereof, nothing more dreadfull or dangerous: which wondering at nothing but at the beautie of it selfe, and drunke with the pleasant wine of perpetuall felicitie, holdeth all the rest of the world in scorne, thundering out nothing but still bloud and warre, with a full persuasion in time to rule ouer all, prefining vnto it selfe no other limits than the vttermost bounds of the earth, from the rising of the Sunne vnto the going downe of the same.<note place="margin">

         </gap>.</note> The causes whereof are many and right lamentable, but for the most part so shut vp in the counsels of the Great, as that for me to seeke after them, were great follie: yet amongst the rest, some others there be, so pregnant and manifest, as that the blind world taketh thereof as it were a generall knowledge, and may therefore without offence of the wiser sort (as I hope) euen in these our nice dayes be lightly touched. Whereof the first and greatest, is the iust and secret iudgement of the Almightie, who in iustice deliuereth into the hands of these mercilesse miscreants, nation after nation, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vpon kingdome, as vnto the most terrible executioners of his dreadfull wrath, to be punished for their sinnes: others in the meane while, no lesse sinfull than they, in his mercie enioying the benefit of a longer time, calling them vnto repentance. Then, the vncertainetie of worldly things, which subiect to perpetuall change cannot long stay in one state, but as the sea is with the wind, so are they in like sort tossed vp and downe with the continuall surges and waues of alteration and change; so that being once growne to their height, they there stay not long, but fall againe as fast as euer they rise, and so in time come to nothing: As we see the greatest Monarchies that euer yet were vpon earth haue done, their course being run; ouer whom, Time now triumpheth, as no doubt at length it shall ouer this so great a Monarchie also, when it shall but then liue by fame, as the others now doe. Next to these cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from aboue (without offence be it said) is the small care the Christian princes, especially those that dwelt further off, haue had of the common state of the Christian Commonweale: whereof euen the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie greatest are to account themselues but as the principall members of one and the same bodie, and haue or ought to haue as sharpe a feeling one of anothers harmes, as hath the head of the wrongs done vnto the feet, or rather as if it were done vnto themselues: in stead of which Christian compassion and vnitie, they haue euer and euen yet at this time are so deuided among themselues with endlesse quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, partly for questions of religion (neuer by the sword to bee determined,) partly for matters touching their owne proper state and soueraignetie, and that with such distrust and implacable hatred, that they neuer could as yet (although it haue beene long wished) ioyne their common forces against the common enemie: but turning their weapons one vpon another (the more to bee lamented) haue from time to time weakened themselues, and opened a way for him to deuour them one after another: Whereas with their combined forces (the greedie enemies greatest terrour) they might long since not onely haue repressed his fur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

By

ciuile discord the noble countrey of Graecia perished, when as the father rising against the sonne, and the sonne against the father, and brother against brother, they to the mutuall destruction of themselues called in the Turke, who like a greedie lyon lurking in his den, lay in wait for them all. So perished the kingdomes of Bulgaria, Seruia, Bosna, and Epirus, with the famous islands of the Rhodes and Cyprus, betraied as it were by the Christian princes their neighbours, by whom they might haue easily beene relieued. So the most flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing and strong kingdome of Hungarie (in the reliques whereof, the fortune of the Turkish Empire hath longer stucke than in the conquest of any other kingdome, by it attempted, whatsoeuer) diuided in it selfe by the ambition of princes and ciuile discord, the weaker still calling vnto his aid the mightie power of the Turke, is long since for the most part become vnto him a prey, the poore remainders thereof being at this day hardly defended by the forces of the Christian Emperour and of the princes his confederats, sildome times meeting together with such cheerefulnesse or expedition, as the necessitie of so great a matter requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Vnto which so great a cause of the common decay, may be added the euill choice of our souldiours emploied in those warres, who taken vp hand ouer head out of the promiscuous vulgar people, are for most part vntrained men, seruing rather for shew and the filling vp of number, than for vse, and in no respect to be compared with the Turks Ianizaries and other his most expert souldiours, continually euen from their youth exercised in feats of armes. Not to speake in the meane time of the want of the auntient martiall discipline, the wholesome preseruatiue of most puissant armies, which breedeth in the proud enemie a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Christian forces, with a full persuasion of himselfe, that he is not by such disordered and weake meanes to be withstood. But to come neerer vnto the causes of the Turks greatnesse, and more proper vnto themselues, as not depending of the improuident carelesnesse, weaknesse, discord, or imperfections of others: first in them is to be noted an ardent and infinit desire of soueraignetie, wherewith they haue long since pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised vnto themselues the monarchie of the whole world, a quicke motiue vnto their so haughtie designes: Then, such a rare vnitie and agreement amongst them, as well in the manner of their religion (if it be so to be called) as in matters concerning their state (especially in all their enterprises to be taken in hand for the augmenting of their Empire) as that thereof they call themselues <hi>Islami,</hi> that is to say, men of one mind, or at peace among themselues; so as it is not to be maruelled, if thereby they grow strong themselues, and dreadfull to others: ioyne vnto this their courage, conceiued by the wonderfull successe of their perpetuall fortune, their notable vigilancie in taking the aduantage of euery occasion for the enlarging of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, their frugalitie and temperatnesse in their diet and other manner of liuing, their straight obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of their auntient militarie discipline, their cheerefull and almost incredible obedience vnto their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Sultans; such, as in that point no nation in the world was to be worthily compared vnto them: all great causes why their Empire hath so mightily encreased and so long continued. Whereunto may be added the two strongest sinewes of euery well gouerned commonweale, Reward propounded to the good, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment threatened vnto the offendor; where the prize is for vertue and valour set vp, and the way laied open for euery common person, be he neuer so meanely borne, to aspire vnto the greatest honours and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments both of the Court a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d of the field, yea euen vnto the neerest affinitie of the great Sultan himselfe, if his valour or other worth shall so deserue: when as on the contrarie part the disloyall or cowardly is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from the same soueraigne power nothing but disgrace, death, and torture. And yet these great ones not contented by such commendable and lawfull meanes still to extend or establish their farre spreading Empire, if that point once come in question, they sticke not in their diuellish policie to breake and infringe the lawes both of Nations and Nature. Their leagues grounded vpon the law of Nations, be they with neuer so strong capitulations concluded, or solemnitie of oath confirmed, haue with them no longer force than standeth with their owne profit, seruing indeed but as snares to entangle other princes in, vntill they haue singled out him whom they purpose to deuour; the rest fast bound still looking on as if their own turne should neuer come, yet with no more assurance of their safetie by their leagues than had the other whom they see perish before their faces. As for the kind law of nature, what can be thereunto more contrarie, than for the father most vnnaturally to embrue his hands in the bloud of his owne children? and the brother to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the bloudie executioner of his owne brethren? a common matter among the <hi>Othoman</hi> Emperours. All which most execrable and inhumane murthers they couer with the pretended safetie of their state, as thereby freed from the feare of all aspiring competitors (the greatest torment of the mightie) and by the preseruation of the integritie of their Empire, which they thereby keepe whole and entire vnto themselues, and so deliuer it as it were by hand from one to another, in no part dismembred or impaired. By these and such like meanes is this barbarous Empire (of almost nothing) growne to that height of maiestie and power, as that it hath in contempt all the rest, being it selfe not inferiour in greatnesse and strength vnto the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test monarchies that euer yet were vpon the face of the earth, the Romane Empire only excepted. Which how farre it shall yet farther spread, none knoweth, but he that holdeth in his hand all the kingdomes of the earth, and with his word boundeth in the raging of the sea, so that it cannot further passe.

and glorie of this so mightie and dreadfull an Empire, growne for the most part out of the ruine of the Christian commonweale, with the vtter subuersion of many great and flourishing kingdomes, and wofull fall of many moe right puissant and mightie princes, not without griefe to be remembred: I long since (as many others haue) entered into the heauie consideration thereof, purposing so to haue contented my selfe with a light view of that which might well be for euer of all good Christians lamented, but hardly or neuer remedied; vntill that afterwards led with a more earnest desire to know the strange and fatall mutations, by this barbarous nation in former time brought vpon a great part of the world, as also so much as I might to see so great a terrour of the present time, and in what tearmes it standeth with the rest, I had with long search and much labour, mixt with some pleasure and mine owne reasonable contentment, passed through the whole melancholie course of their tragicall Historie: yet without purpose euer to haue commended the same or any part thereof vnto the remembrance of posteritie, as deeming it an argument of too high a reach, and fitter for some more happie wit, better furnished with such helpes both of nature and art, as are of necessitie requisit for the vndertaking of so great a charge, than was my selfe, of many thousands the meanest.

Not to speake in the meane time of the diuersitie of the reports in the course of the whole Historie, such as is oftentimes most hard, if not altogether impossible to reconcile. Notwithstanding all which diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, with many others more proper vnto my selfe, hauing with long labour and diligent search passed through the course of the whole Historie, and so in some reasonable sort satisfied my selfe therein, I thought it not amisse, as well for the worthinesse of the matter, as for the zeale I beare vnto the Christian common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, and for the satisfying also of some others my good friends, much desirous of the same, to make proofe if out of the dispersed workes of many right worthie men, I could set downe one orderly and continuat Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of this so mightie an Empire, with the great and fatall mutation or rather subuersion of many right strong and flourishing kingdomes and states (the proper worke of all mightie rising Empires, still encreasing by the fall of others) wherewith this proud monarchie hath alreadie daunted a great part of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so many and so strange, as that moe or more wonderfull were not euer to be seene in any of the greatest monarchies of auntient time or memorie, and so together, and as it were vnder one view and at one shew, to lay open vnto the Christian Reader, what I was glad to seeke for out of the defused labours of many: a worke so long and laborious as might well haue deterred a right resolute and constant mind from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking thereof, being as yet to my knowledge not vndergone or performed by any: wherein among such

varietie, or more truly to say, contrarietie of writers, I contented not my selfe, as a blind man led by his guide happily of no better sight than himselfe, to tread the steps of this or that one man, going for a while before me, and by and by leauing me againe stumbling in the darke: but out of the learned and faithfull workes of many, according to my simple iudgement to make choice of that was most probable, still supplying with the perfections of the better, what I found wanting or defectiue in the weaker, propounding vnto my selfe no other marke to aime at than the very truth of the Historie; as that which is it selfe of power to giue life vnto the dead letter,<note place="margin">The order of the Authors proceeding in the writing of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie.</note> and to couer the faults escaped in the homely penning or compiling thereof. Which the better to performe, I collected so much of the Historie as possibly I could, out of the writings of such as were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues present and as it were eye-witnesses of the greatest part of that they writ, and so as of all others best able, most like also to haue left vnto vs the very truth. Such is the greatest part of so much of the Historie of the Greeke Empire, as I haue (for the better vnderstanding of the rising of the Turkes) in this Historie set downe, gathered out of the doings of <hi>Nicetas Choniates, Nicephorus Gregoras,</hi> and <hi>Laonicus Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocondiles,</hi> all writing such things as they themselues saw, or were for most part in their time, and neere vnto them done. Such are the wonderfull and almost incredible warres betwixt old <hi>Amurath</hi> the second, and his foster child, the fortunat prince of Epirus, of the Turks commanly called <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and by that wayward tirant at his death together with his kingdome deliuered as it were by inheritance vnto his sonne, the great and cruell Sultan <hi>Mahomet</hi>; all written by <hi>Marinus Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>letius,</hi> himselfe an Epirot, and in all those trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some times then liuing in Scodra, a citie of the Venetians ioyning vpon Epirus. Such is the wofull captiuitie of the imperiall citie of Constantinople, with the miserable death of the Greeke Emperour <hi>Constantinus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeologus,</hi> and the fatall ruine of the Greeke Empire, written by <hi>Leonardus Chiensis,</hi> Archbishop of Mity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene, being himselfe then present, and there taken prisoner. Such is the lamentable Historie of the Rhodes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for most part out of <hi>Ia. Fontanus</hi> his three bookes <hi>de Bello Rhodio,</hi> a learned man, then present and in great credit with <hi>Villerius</hi> the Great Master, at such time as that famous island, after it had by him and the other worthie knights of the Order beene most wonderfully of long defended, was to the great ruth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome taken by the great Sultan <hi>Solyman.</hi> Such is the most tragicall Historie of <hi>Baiazet, Solyman</hi> his youngest sonne, collected out of the notable Epistles of <hi>Augerius Busbequius Legationis Turcicae,</hi> he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe then lying embassador for the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> at Constantinople, and present in <hi>Solymans</hi> campe at such time as he himselfe in person went ouer with his armie into Asia, to countenance his eldest sonne <hi>Sely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> who succeeded him in his Empire against his valiant yonger brother <hi>Baiazet:</hi> and beside, well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the great Bassaes <hi>Achmet, Rustan, Haly,</hi> and others, oftentimes mentioned in the Historie follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Such is also the Historie of the taking of the auntient citie of Tripolis in Barbarie from the knights of Malta by <hi>Sinan</hi> the proud Bassa, written by <hi>Nicholas Nicholay</hi> lord of Arfeuile, present at the same time with the lord of Aramont, then embassadour for the French king vnto <hi>Solyman.</hi> So might I say also of the miserable spoile of the fruitfull and pleasant islands of the Mediterranean, made by <hi>Lutzis Bassa, Solyman</hi> his brother in law and great Admirall, with the submitting of the island of Naxos to the Turkes obe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>sance, written by <hi>Iohn Crispe,</hi> at that time duke of the same island. And so likewise of diuers other parts of the Historie, too long to rehearse. But for as much as euery great and famous action had not the fortune to haue in it a <hi>Caesar,</hi> such as both could and would commend vnto posteritie by writing that whereof they might truly say, They were themselues a great part; many right excellent Generals contenting themselues with the honour of the field, and their glorie there woon, leauing the honourable fame thereof to be by others reported. For lacke of such most certaine authors, or rather (as I before said) eye-witnesses, I gathered so much as I could of that remained, out of the works of such, as being themselues men of great place, and well acquainted with the great and worthie personages of their time, might from their mouths as from certain Oracles report the vndoubted truth of many most famous exploits done both by themselues and others: as might <hi>Pau. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius</hi> from the mouth of <hi>Muleasses</hi> king of Tunes, from <hi>Vastius</hi> the great Generall, from <hi>Auria</hi> the prince of Melphis, <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour his Admirall, and such others: or els out of the writings of such as were themselues great trauellers into the Turkes dominions, and withall diligent obseruers of their affaires and state, as were the phisitions <hi>Pantaleon, Minadoie,</hi> and <hi>Leunclauius</hi> (of all others a most curious searcher of their antiquities and Histories) vnto which great Clarkes and some others of that learned profession, we may worthily attribute the greatest light and certainetie of that is reported of a great part of the Turkish affairs. But these in the course of so long an Historie failing also (as by conferring that which is hereafter written, together with their Histories, is easily to be perceiued) to perfect that I had taken in hand, I tooke my refuge vnto the writings of such other learned and credible authours, as of whose integritie and faithfulnesse the world hath not to my knowledge at any time yet doubted: yea for these few late yeares I was glad out of the Germane and Italian writers in their owne language to borrow the knowledge of these late affaires as not yet written in Latin, wherein if the reader find not himselfe so fully satisfied as he could desire, I would be glad by him to be better enformed, as being no lesse desirous of others to learn the truth of that I know not, than willing
<pb facs="7"/>
to impart vnto others that little which I know. Thus much I thought good to set downe, to persuade the Christian Reader of the truth of the Historie following, wherein he shall find matter enough to wonder at, and no lesse strange than that whatsoeuer it is that is written of the greatest monarchies of auntient time, vnto whom for power and maiestie it yeeldeth litle: But so much the more worthy our consideration than they, for that their periods alreadie run, and so their furie ouerpast, this in our time so flourisheth, and at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent so mightily swelleth, as if it would ouerflow all, were it not by the mercie of God first, and then by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of some few of the Christian princes neerest vnto so great a danger with their great charge to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall glorie and benefit of the Christian commonweale mightily checked and kept within some bounds and compasse. This Historie for the most part thus as is aforesaid passed through, and brought to some good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, was yet by me againe laid aside, and like ynough euen as an abortiue fruit to haue perished in the birth before it was growne to perfection, had I not many times fainting in the long and painefull trauell therewith, by my especiall good friend Sir <hi>Peter Manwood</hi> of S. <hi>Stephens</hi> in the countie of Kent knight of the honourable order of the Bath, a louer and great fauourer of learning (in whose keeping it so for the most part many yeares in safetie rested) beene still comforted and as it were againe reuiued, and now finally encouraged to take it in hand, and so at length as I might to perfect it: vnto whom (being the onely furtherer, stay, and helpe of these my labours) thou art for such pleasure as thou findest therein (if it be any) in courtesie beholden. Now what I for my part haue in this my long trauell performed, I leaue it to thy good discretion to consider, contenting my selfe in so great a matter to haue bin willing to haue done som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; wishing no longer to liue, than in some measure to be profitable to the Christian commonweale, which long since in my nursing mother house Lincolne Colledge in Oxford, where I was sometime Fellow, I did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to persorme, as it should please God in time to giue me meanes and occasion: in which mind I hope by the goodnesse &amp; mercie of Christ so long as I liue to continue. Only this fauor (to conclude with) I request of thee That if in this so long and perplexed an Historie (by peecemeale of so many diuersly handled) written by me in a world of troubles and cares, in a place that affoorded no meanes or comfort to proceed in so great a worke, thou chance to light vpon some things otherwise reported than thou hast elsewhere read them (as I doubt not but thou maiest) not therfore forthwith to condemne what thou here findest, being happily taken from a more certaine reporter than was that whereunto thou giuest more credit; or at leastwise not written by me, as mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in any thing to preiudice thy better iudgement, but to leaue it to thy good choice in such diuersitie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to follow that which may seeme vnto thee most true. By which courtesie thou maiest hereafter encourage me to performe some other worke to thy no lesse contentment. So wishing thee all happinesse, I bid thee farwell. From Sandwich the last of September. <hi>1603.</hi>
