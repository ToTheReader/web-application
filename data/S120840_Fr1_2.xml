         <desc>••••</desc>
      </gap>on, like a Princesse presuming upon the kingdome, kirks, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the earth. But by the soveraigne providence of that unchangeable God, who directeth the steps of man, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>th put in his own power the time to plant and the time to pluck up that which is planted, is so oversweyed &amp; in the most varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and different humors of men so limited, that some as the scoffers of the last dayes, laughing at mutation, say, Where is the promise of his comming: Others to wit, the wicked man in his prosperitie, persecuteth the poore, saying he shall never be moved: A third sort, viz. the slavish time-server, like soft waxe, flexible to every n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>w forme, boweth to mutation, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her variant colours his crowne and contentment: And the best sort, the wise Christian, hating change, and loving constancie, striveth to walk circumspectly, redeeming the time from the dangerous currant: All these, and others what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, whether by sinne irregular, or by grace sincere and straight, by supreme wisedome, are so disposed that they must needs serve the holy proiects of Iustice and Mercie for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and salvation of his chosen.</p>
   <p>In this continuall course Mutation so prevaileth upon suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding generations, that as they are distant from the first times, they decline from primitiue innocencie, and as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb facs="3"/>
to the later dayes, they participate of their evils. Yea so forcible is Defection (the daughter of this Mutation) in the congregations of the faithfull, that the vacant places of the righteous departed are seldome or never filled againe, their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours followeth them, and they are forgotten. If the kirk bee in Aegypt, Ioseph dieth, and there ariseth a new king there who knew not Ioseph. When the people enters into the land, Iosua and that generation is gathered to their fathers, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generation ariseth up after them which neither knoweth the Lord, nor the works which he had done for Israel by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Iosua, in Aegypt, at the red sea, in the wildernesse, and at the entrance into the promised land. And in the land it selfe, after Athaliahs troubles Ioash, whose life was saved by Iehoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada, and in whose dayes he did that which was righteous in the sight of the Lord, after his death h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>arkneth to the Princes who make obeysance to the King, and leaving the house of the Lord God of their fathers, serve idols, but Ioash re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth not the kindnesse done by Iehoiada, but slayeth his sonne.</p>
   <p>As by these strange alterations fearfull eclipses were brought upon the face of common honesty, likely to banish religion out of the earth, so under the ends of the world surpassing the preceeding generations in loue decayed, and iniquitie multiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, if it were not the rich mercy and undeserved loue of the Lord not to suffer the rod of the wicked to rest upō the lot of the righteous, but now and then in the middest of confusions brought on by Mutation, to refresh them under the sweet sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of peace and prosperitie, the very elect could hardly escape. If adversitie beare the sway, the people of God are in hazard to put out their hands to evill: and if prosperitie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, then the kingdome of heaven is likened unto a man who sowed good seed in his field, but while men slept, his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie came and sowed tares among the wheat, which may not be gathered up till the harvest, lest the wheat also be rooted up with them. When the Lord his field shall be once infected with such venemous mixture of false teachers, &amp; their foolish disciples, renouncing their own libertie, &amp; slavishly submitting
<pb facs="3"/>
themselues without triall to follow their seducers in lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes and avarice for atchieving their own vitious hopes, if Israel were not poured from vessel to vessel, they should freeze upon their dreggs like Moab, &amp; so loose not only their come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countenance, but the health and life of their substantiall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: the deceitful colours of these supervenient weeds so daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the eyes of the common sort, for the most part more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall then spirituall, and either vailed with black ignorance, or blind hypocrisie, that religiō in her natiue simplicitie &amp; purity seemeth to them an handmaid rather then a mistres, if she bee not busked with some new guise of one alteration or other.</p>
   <p>In this change, if a Priest or a Levit, or any of the ancient shall happen to weep for the first Temple, by the meanes of mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thus d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>faced, or enquire for the old way, by ignorance in the reasonlesse multitude, by pride in high places, and perversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of reputed learning, he maketh himselfe a prey, a troubler of Israel, and not meet to liue. There ariseth no small stirre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that way, whole cities are filled with confusion, and the cry goeth up for the Diana of the time. If Paul himselfe were gotten, he would not passe with <hi>pestilent fellow,</hi> but stone him to the death before he be heard; yea when the furie of Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inflameth the minds of Barbarians, if they see a viper of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity on a mans hand, they say surely he is a murtherer, and if no inconvenience follow, he is a God. So madly are the hearts of men set in them, privily to blind themselues with the beams of their own particulars, and the world with open shew of seeming zeale for justice and religion.</p>
   <p>The toyles &amp; tossings of these Circaean changes, are ever so unsavourie to a man of a quiet spirit, that if the wronged inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie of a just cause, shamelesse violence done to the rights &amp; priviledges of religion, and the intolerable pride practised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst famous kirks vnheard, could be closed up in any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble silence, honest men knowing very well that the railings of reprochers never woundeth a good conscience, could rather choose to sustaine a legion of bitter aspersions, for peace to preach the Gospell, then either to interrupt their owne tranquilitie, or giue the least cause of suspition to any,
<pb facs="4"/>
that they were brought from the sweet course of their pure, peaceable, and simple wisedome, to contend for their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fame and reputation, and so to hinder the preaching of Christ. For what matter is it though men be despised, disgraced and scorned, so long as the Lord may bee honoured thereby. But when the night of securitie shall bee so dark, and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse pride ascend to such a height, that not onely the lower sort, but men of great spirits and places can with a deafe eare passe by the wrongs done to sincere professours, faithfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and martyrs of good memorie, but by a sort of bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish patience, suffer a substantiall truth to be borne down, and blasphemed, and for a forlorne tradition, or worm-eaten cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie shamefully shot forth; yea a setled forme of godlinesse by long and happy experience universally approved, to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed for far-fetched devices of needlesse novelties; and the best subiects, walking in knowledge of their dutie, &amp; consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious conversation, without any just cause openly traduced, that they are not Caesars friends, in a false policie to make the righteous cause odious to authoritie. If there be any children of Moses, to esteeme the rebuke of Christ greater riches then the treasures of the world, or of zealous Elihu, to haue his wrath kindled against violence done to a just cause, &amp; wrongs to harmlesse men otherwise deserving, with what eares shall he heare the terrour of that trumpet, <hi>Jf we deny him, he will also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny us,</hi> and the spirit of grace with courage raising his blast by a sweeter inforcement, <hi>If we suffer with him, we shall also reigne together:</hi> especially now in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>se back-sliding dayes, when men who not onely seemed most forward to root out Papists, but zealous that reformation then professed by themselues, and praised as the work of God, might stand and grow; haue now by some secret (but strange) inspiration of inchanting Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not onely sharpned their tongues, that their words might be as the pricking of a sword, but also dippped their pens in gall to write and speak against their brethren; and for a muddy and mysticall conformitie (who can tell to what) but abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed in Scotland ever since reformation, as the rest of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man trash; howsoever of late, without shame of contrarie pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
<pb facs="4"/>
in mens owne persons, hurled in againe to be the wall and tower of new Episcopacie, cunningly brought in by her Intrant the constant Moderator, and solemnly set up to remain the Atlas of their kingdome, with full power of Lordly domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be exercised over the kirk for the fiue Articles, the fundamentall lawes of that usurped authoritie, and to put forth and hold forth the lawfull and necessarie assemblies of the kirk, as enemies to the power of Princes. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily both reason and experience making plaine, that the kings of the earth were never pressed downe with any lawfull assembly Ecclesiasticall or any way disseysed of kirk Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, with which the Lord originally had possessed them: but Episcopacie, as time hath favoured her insatiable desires, by dispossessing and bringing downe both kings and kirks, hath set up and holdeth up Papistrie, ever evill masters, like fire and water, but never better servants then treacherous slaues lying in wait to oppresse their masters.</p>
   <p>It may be that the Patrones and urgers of this course wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly aime not at the reducing of Papistrie, and for any thing yet known, charitie would they should not bee misdeemed in that grosse sinne. Neverthelesse, as a certaine learned man sayth of some of the Ancients, that unwittingly, and against their wills, they made a way for Antichrist: so it may be feared of some so diligent to catch occasions, by envy to exclude and degrade them that are good and painfull, and so ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their own fault, that rather then they wil leaue them, they paine themselues to devise how to raise up troubles in the kirk, and driue men from it into conventicles and corners, very farre different from the wise Pilot, vvhen the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest inforceth, emptieth the ship of some things to saue the rest, but they cast out the Pilots of the ships themselues, to saue these Romish wares, trifles and customes, as they tearme them: and againe so negligent to censure great corruptions in such as are praised for their readinesse to admit by implicit faith whatsoever is offered, and to stand in contention about mens traditions, likely to say the kirk waste. Although they do not intentiuely seek to bring in Papistry, yet whiles in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb facs="5"/>
thus to uphold their owne Lordships over Gods heritage, they presse their own traditions more then the weightier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the law, the practise of the ceremonie more then the observation of the Lords day, kneeling at the receiving of the sacrament out of the Ministers hand, more then the catechising of the people, and true meaning of the Lords institution, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the conforme hypocrite, ignorant or sencelesse, aboue the wise Christian rooted and grounded in the Gospell, they giue a great hope to the limbs of Antichrist to settle their tottering kingdome, and a more easie entrance for the whole body of abhominations, then they are aware of. England feeleth and feareth already, and Scotland hath cause to fast and pray, that the opinion &amp; practise of these ceremonies may be removed as farre from them, as busking and balling should be from chast women. It is a prodigious presage, that statutes such as they are, and procured as they were in favours of dangerous novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, should be more vehemently urged, and with greater rigor put in execution against the true servants of God for modest adherence to a truth never condemned, and for refusall of needlesse rites never proved to be lawful by Gods word, nor by any good appearance like to proue profitable, then all the good statutes standing in force against idolatry and Idolaters, blasphemers and murtherers, &amp; open contemners of the Lords word and his service, as if the whole obedience of a Christian subiect were inclosed in the practise of certain rites justly cast forth of this kirk in the ignominious dust of other errours: or Christian charity were confined to the divided brotherhoood of indifferent things..</p>
   <p>State Divines think better of government once received, then that it should be tossed and interrupted with all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie tides of rituall controversies. Wisedome (say they) will rather tolerate some evill in a tried forme of government, then in a government vntried. Yea though a thing bee well done, yet it looseth the credit, if it savour of noveltie. If a man might say with an upright heart, that which I maintaine is the doctrine of the holy fathers, I haue their witnesses at large, taken out their owne bookes, if for such a cause he be casten

people against them, let the soules of his servants be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord their God, and the soule of their enemies shall God cast out, as out of the middle of a sling. It is a dangerous case to be carried with a bent resolution to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame, and to rake together foule untruths, not considering what may be spoken most truely, nor what may be ratled out most disgracefully like a swelling brook that soone gathereth much filth. These slanderous calumnies are like a thorn stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the hand of a drunkard; it is hard to judge whom they shall hurt. They are but a pretended quarrell against honest men by prejudice to condemn their cause before it be heard, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proverbe, <hi>He that would haue his dogge killed, giveth forth first that he is madd.</hi> If these be reall crimes, they are farre aboue the omission of a ceremonie; let them be truely libelled, carefully cognosced, wisely discerned, and condignely puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. If undeserved calumnies, let the Lord impute them to none, and let no man impute them to the Lords people, their owne consciences witnessing before God, that such things they never thought, but rather let them be rejected as senceles scoffings of Sarcasticall bitternes crossing Christianity, and contrarie to gentlenes and loue. To burie them in silence had been their best condition, but when all meanes are sought to make the faithfull even to stink among the inhabitants of the land, it can no wise beseeme the ministeriall calling to secret the truth, and by a cowardly kind of modestie to betray a good cause malitiously wounded through the sides of honest men, craftily burdened with scandalls for bearing down their cause in a dangerous time. When so many not onely commons in the profession, and novices in the ministerie, but some great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors fall away no lesse from their wonted faithfulnesse, then from the ancient order whereby they were kept in the course of their ministerie, are now by the force of time become other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise minded, undertaking by their publick teaching and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, by their private conference, and all other meanes, not onely to perswade this new conformitie so farre contrarie to the forme whereunto they were delivered, but also with great hate, and unkindly carriage to their brethren and old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

   <p>There is here from a ready minde and a good will, the wise mans aneugh, a word of peace and puritie lossed, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie found, and Conformitie urged, to hold out old V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, to inlarge affected indifferencie, and to set up the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of absolute Conformitie in the stately chaires of both kirk and kingdome. The full historie and ample treatise of
<pb facs="7"/>
the birth, education, and high promotion of this respected couple Indifferencie and Conformitie, with the controversies brought in Scotland, and increased thereby, requireth larger volumnes then any Aurelius of this time will bee nicknamed <hi>Pupillus</hi> for necessarie charges to such a work, while better oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. This Scotized conformitie for the present must stand at the paines of Archippus and Epaphras, two honest Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, and venturing themselues upon the stage to bee glowred upon by every evill eye, or rather casting themselues upon thornes, to be gored by every sharpe tongue. They are both good Patrons where ever they be. Archippus must take heed to the ministerie which he hath received of the Lord, that hee fulfill it, and Epaphras a servant of Christ laboureth fervently for you in prayers, and by all meanes that you may stand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat in all the will of God. Archippus desirous to strengthen himselfe by learning, and Epaphras ready to lay out his Talent to exchange, haue diligently survayed the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Kirk of Scotland concerning the forenamed parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, &amp; painfully searched the doctrine of indifferent things, shooting up in a short abridgement their best observations for present use, and clearly shewing, how conformitie came in by little and little without feeling, like Poperie comming to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by Ceremoniousnesse and Ambition, the ceremonies furnishing her with a seeming beautie to allure, and Ambition an vnresistable power to afray. They intend no way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge or extinguish the worthy volumes of the learned, but rather to spurre men of good conscience, and meet gifts to search and set forth fully and in perfect order these worthy purposes according to their great zeale to a sound religion so long professed, and by the blessing of God upon their labours, to gain such as respecting their conscience more then their credit, with vertues tincture shall blush after the sight of the evill they haue committed, with hearty repentance turning their praise of men to the praise of God to their ioy and comfort, as Augustines Retractations are the glorie and crowne of all his writings. So much the rather as the causes of their yeelding haue been, in some lack of acquaintance &amp; sight
<pb facs="7"/>
of the matters in question: in others simplicity, presuming that nothing would be required, but that which they might safely yeeld unto: in a third sort, a desire to be imployed in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the kirk, thinking it more easie to beare these corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then to abide rigour: and a fourth sort deceived by poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, thinking that their yeelding with protestation should limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to them the ordinarie forme whereunto others are tied, without altering at least in many inconveniences that may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue upon the obedience required. It were a worke of singular loue to help such, and many others under the restraints of feare and other infirmities, who undoubtedly, if they were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to use their own libertie without hazarding themselues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pikes of the law, would with great joy returne to their best beloved profession, and by their happy repentance quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring to confusion the reioycing of Papists &amp; Atheists, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Ministers and professours to their faces, and saying plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they hope ere it be long, to see them all either come to them, or come to nothing. But feare them not, they are lying Prophets, evill men and seducers they are, and shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived: but continue thou in the things that thou hast learned, and been assured of.</p>
   <p>In this case of good Christians falling by infirmitie, &amp; proud enemies bragging of their hopes, let it not be thought strange, that the louers of the primitiue beautie of the reformed kirk, earnestly wish to haue it restored againe, and for that cause mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly shrink at a new statute standing in the contrary. First, he breaks the band of obedience, sayth one, who doth it without cause. If the refusers haue not alledged causes iustifiable in the consciences of any, who will debate the matter between God and their own soules, let them be better taught. Authority may crush them, it cannot perswade them. 2. The first act an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nt kneeling, wherupon the alledged disobedience is grounded, is to be better considered, at least in the doctrinall part, where by the words of the Psalme, as it forceth the text, it maketh knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling necessarie, and not indifferent, contrarie to the judgement of the most inclinable sort, who openly professe, that if autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie would be pleased to favour the former order of the kirk,
<pb facs="8"/>
they would gladly return thereunto. Againe, it is granted, that the kirk of Scotland hath used since the reformation of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to celebrate the holy communion to the people sitting, where the true reason moving them so to do, viz. <hi>(The table of the Lord is then most rightly ministred, when it approcheth most neer to Christ his own action: but plain it is at that supper Christ Jesus sate with his disciples: and therfore do we iudge that sitting at a table as most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to that holy action)</hi> is omitted, and another convoyed in, to wit (by reason of the great abuse of kneeling vsed in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous worship of the sacraments by the Papists) which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed should be granted to be a reason of very great weight. But how weak a removall of this reason is insert in the act to cast out sitting and bring in kneeling, let them declare in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, that haue changed upon such a reason, and urge others to doe the like, if all memorie of by-past superstition be passed out of Scotland, or if it be not rather renued and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. But in these matters for good reasons, men must sparingly speak. 3. It hath never been, neither can be proved by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Magistrates commandement simply and nakedly considered, without some warrant of the word of God, can be reputed a true spirituall guide to lead the conscience of a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in a matter of religion, or action of Gods worship in such assurance, that he may say in the presence of God, my opinion is sound, and action acceptable, because the magistrate hath commanded it, men being assured that Magistrates may erre in their iniunctions; and assemblies convened by the kings maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties authoritie, may command and inact things unlawfull and unprofitable. Ask the scripture, whether ever the good Kings among the Iewes, or else where, brought in any speciall action or ceremony into the service of God, without some speciall warrant from himself, or whether they did devise ought, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the devices of ecclesiasticall assemblies in their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and impose the one or the other upon the Levits, or upon any bearing office in the sanctuarie, restraining them from their publick function without obedience to it; or whether ever by any of the messengers of God, the people were taught, that for the outward form and circumstance of Gods worship, a civill
<pb facs="8"/>
statute or constitution of the kirk, without further searching of the scriptures, might be their ground, upon which they might build their obedience unto God, without further inquirie. 4. It is a received rule of Christian libertie, at least should be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed kirkes, that the ordinances of the kirke are presented unto Pastors and people, not with necessitie of beleeving, but with libertie of trying, according to the rule, <hi>Try the spirits.</hi> It is the Lords own priviledge, that his iniunctions are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without questioning. It is likewise permitted by royall provision, that where the law was otherwise, men may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly content themselues soberly &amp; quietly with their owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but also presse by patience, and well-grounded reasons either to perswade all the rest to like of their judgements, or where they see better grounds to incline thereto. It is the part of a temporizing hypocrite, of the servant of men, and not of the servant of God, to frame their actions to that which is cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded without any cōscience of a truth, whether they know it or not, polluting the world with a brutish obedience, whiles without any reason in him that obeyeth, and whiles against the knowledge, whereby God hath inlightned his own mind.</p>
   <p>In this insuing treatise persons are spared and sundry things hieroglyphically and summarily set down which must bring to readers lesse acquainted with these matters some obscuritie, but be not offended. Soberly and quietly peace is sought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preiudice of any person or purpose, so farre as the clearing of the truth may suffer. You haue here to remember that old caution propounded by a Father to the Emperour, <hi>Take away the perill of the statute,</hi> &amp;c. It is permitted to the maintainers of novelties, to use a continued, plentifull, and running speech, which here is not to be found. For if the entising speeches of mans wisedome were true tokens of wisedome indeed, the swallowes as they are swifter, may justly bee sayd to bee aboue man in wisedom. <hi>Paul</hi> for the truth is rude in speaking, his presence weak, &amp; his speech contemptible. But <hi>Tertullus</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding against him in a mask of eloquence, is admired for his pompous stile.</p>
   <p>The matters in question every where are so backed with all,
<pb facs="9"/>
meanes of credit in the hands of the one partie, and so borne down by vehement cries in the weaknes of the other. Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on having now turned up-side-down, that where before the truth had favour to be spoken &amp; heard without fear. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies now a man must needs lay his hand upon his care for hearing the partie absent, or fall in folly and shame to answer a matter before he hath heard it. The truth is not to be measured by the means of them that speak for it, and all calumnies are but swines flesh, though they be dressed after a divers fashion. The cause in controversie wronged by the violence of the time, may justly complaine of <hi>impar congressus</hi> in respect of worldly helpes in the particulars following, and many moe. The new course hath the countenance of the world: But it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with the ancient profession, as with the Gospell it selfe; <hi>Haue any of the rulers beleeved in him.</hi> Excepting alwayes the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Peeres of the land, whose loue is more large then their credit. 2. The most part of the ancient ministers &amp; professors, are removed either out of this life, or out of their former mind, and many out of their places, and such as arise up, and are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ministerie, must sweare &amp; subscribe to maintaine and defend privatly and publickly the alterations inforced. 3. There is very few to be found having courage for the truth, to honor God with their credit &amp; riches: such receiue the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell with a provision of safetie to their own estate, &amp; the poore who receive the Gospell, are willing, but not able both to doe and suffer for the truth. 4. The pations and proctours of this new plea are richly rewarded with a fat b nefice, or great sume of the taxation and benefic s promised: but the defenders are ready to be respected with <hi>Depriue</hi> and <hi>Confine. 5.</hi> They haue a strong assistance, but the other are few &amp; weak, and if they be permitted to remain in their places, they are tied to the daily pains of their callings, and ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e of their families; and if they be thrust forth, they are forced to provide for their owne necessities, having no time for these matters, but stolne houres. 6. The one partie hath libertie to meet with full help of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite meanes, few or many, where and when, at their owne pleasure. The other if two or three of them meet upon their
<pb facs="9"/>
lawfull affaires, it is a scandall of Conventicle, &amp; a matter of chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge. 7 They are judges of their own cause, and haue at their right hand the power of Kirk and policie; but the cause of the other is like the widow &amp; the fatherlesse, no man will heare it. 8 To them all the Presses are open and expenses furnished: Printers beyond sea are troubled upon suspicion of having the copies of the other. 9 Their assertions are probations: the contrary cause acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for a found truth in secret, is in publick respected as an errour. 10 Threatned dangers maketh men afrayed to reade, write or print in favours of the one; all may be done to the advancement of the other with great commendation. 11 For loue of peace and lack of meanes, necessary purposes, as the answer to a rabble of untruthes known to a many yet living, hatched by <hi>Joan Fani Andrea Arch ep,</hi> and favoured with a latine complexion of some despised Doctor, and idle for lack of patients, and presented to the world under the triumphing title, <hi>Refutatio libelli de regimine Ecclesiae Scoticanae.</hi> The answer to the Doctors, <hi>Lyndesay, David Brechin,</hi> &amp; <hi>Michelson,</hi> their bragging and begging pamphlets: The answer to Mercenary <hi>Tilen</hi> his pragmaticall paraenesis &amp;c. are hid from the light, while neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie call for them.</p>
   <p>Finally, were there a change made of the prosperous case of the one cause with the adversity of the other, or would the world but smile or frowne equally on both; they would not busie the Printer and Reader so much. But the aequivalent of that old truth, <hi>poore Luther made many rich,</hi> is in some sort verified in this cause: and that which preaching substance against Papists could not procure, pleading for ceremonies against Protestants hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. The Defenders haue no other comfort, but that they deliver their soules, discharge their consciences and serue for witnesses <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> the truth, and least they be witnesses also against thee, Take h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ed with a crying conscience for keeping it, and that will proue unpleasant. Think not their labours like the circlings made by <hi>Archimedes,</hi> when <hi>Marcelius</hi> was on the sea and nigh unto the ports of Syracuse, except thou remember also that by his weake
<pb facs="10"/>
meanes the Citie was a long time defended against the Roman ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, albeit at albeit last with the losse of his life. Neither be thou over vvise to say, they might haue been like the good Geographers, who seldome trouble themselues with the description of smal Brooks, but waite on till by confluence they make great rivers, and are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened into sea. For had the riverets either been dryed up in time, or yet were drained in severall chanels, the maine streame would not swell so big, nor the great Whore, that sitteth upon many waters proue so stately amongst us. Onely first, for stirring up thy own soule, think with thy selfe how like the times of our Kirk may prooue unto the darkenesse of the ninth Centurie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ, which the Centuriatours obserue to haue proceeded of foure pregnant causes: 1 the excessiue loue of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ns writtes with the neglect of Scripture: 2 the praeeminence of some persons aboue others: 3 the multiplication of ceremonies and humane inventions: 4 persecution and oppression of the most sound in heart and judgement. Secondly, for judging of the Defenders part, consider that howsoever they be commanded to loue such as hate them, and pray for such as persecute them, yet how small rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they haue to beleeue that they who persecute them, thinke that in so doing they doe God good service. And thirdly, for thy own resolution, remember that the sentence of Christs throne, and the voyces of men in the world are farre different. Thy times and wayes are in the Lords hands. Set thy selfe in his presence; view the course as it began, proceeded, hath been resisted, should be refused, and may end, and see whether it shall be any griefe or offence of heart unto thee on that day, that thou hast kept thy selfe in the loue of the truth from the beginnings of defection, the end whereof no flesh can see, and every heart may justly feare that it shall be beyong English Conformity, in so farre as their lukewarm nesse hath been towards the hot, and ours is after it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cold. The Lord giue wisedome in all things. Now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultlesse before the presence of his glorie, with exceeding joy, To the onely wise God our Saviour, be glory and maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
