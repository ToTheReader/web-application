   <head>OF GOVERNMENT AND OF THE MOST RENOWMED LAWMAKERS THAT HAVE PVT IT IN PROOFE, AND of the most famous Authours that haue written thereof, specially of PLATO and ARISTOTLE; togither with a Summe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of their Common-weales.</head>
   <p>WHo so vouchsafeth to consider the restitution of good learning which hath happened in this age, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament which all Arts and Sciences haue recouered by the dilligence of diuers men of skill: shall haue cause to wonder to see, how almost the meanest scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are set again in their perfection; and the skill of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, being the worthiest, the behoofullest, and the needfullest of all others, is left alone behind: without the which, men who naturally be companiable, cannot in any wise maintaine their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying and societie together. Grammer, Poetrie, Rhethorick and Logicke, haue beene handled by infinite persons, and inlightened with innumerable expositions, annotations, corrections, and translations. The mathematicall sciences were neuer better known, neither were Astrology and Cosmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy euer better vnderstood. What is more to be wondered at at this day thā to see the whole world discouered, whereof the most part hath continued so long vnknowne? And to see the vttermost coasts of East &amp; West, North and South, intercommune together, and men that are seperated with so many seas, and so farre distant one from another, to meet together by the meanes of sailing, made safer and easier by many new inuentions? As for naturall Philosophy and Phisicke, I may well vphold that they were neuer in greater perfection among the ancient Greekes and Arabians, then they be at this time, wherein a great number of beasts, roots, hearbs, trees<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> gums, liquors, fruits, minerals and other simples haue ben brought to light, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of men haue made many wholesome remedies that were not put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise aforetimes. Who knoweth not the chaunge that is befallen in the Art of Chiualrie, as vvell by Sea as by Land, and that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner both of besieging and of defending Fortresses, is farre differing from that vvhich hath beene of old time? Yet notvvithstanding the Cannons, Harquebushes, Pistolets, and other Artillerie of fireworke beeing brought to such perfection as they bee, are no impediment,
<pb facs="7"/>
but that there bee as braue Souldiours and valiant captaines as euer there vvere. Building, painting, and musicke are set againe vvelneere in their first state: and men haue taken so great paines in eloquence of pleading, and knowledge of Law, that it is not possible to attaine to more. But as for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, vvhich deserued to bee more laboured in than they all, as vvhich comprehendeth and ruleth them all, it hath beene let alone, vvithout recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any light of learning vnto this day. The cause hereof in mine opinion is, that the men of skill vvhich could haue beautified it vvith their vvritings, haue vtterly forborne the dealing vvith matters of State, to giue themselues vvholly to the searching out of the truth, setting their soueraigne felicity in contemplation: and that those vvhich haue ben called to publicke charge and offices, haue commonly had no great skill, or if they haue had any, they haue vvanted leisure to vvrite. Insomuch, that by the forbearing of the learned to practise, and by the forbearing of the practisers to studie, this science (vvhich is vnperfect vvithout skill and experience ioined together) hath come behind hand as I said afore.</p>
   <p>As for my selfe, although I be not of anie excellent skill, nor of anie great experience: yet notwithstanding, foras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uch as I haue spent my vvhole life in studie to the least disauantage that I possiblie could, and long time fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the courts of great Princes, abiding ordinarily about such persons as haue had the charge and managing of matters of State, to the intent, to match my meane knowledge of learning with some experience of practise: I haue applied my mind chiefly to this science, attempting to further it to the vttermost of my power. Therfore hauing determined to treat thereof, I thought it not to be from the matter, to shew first of all the dignitie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, and antiquity thereof. Secondly, I vvill speake of the Law-makers that haue put it in practise, and finally, of the Authors that haue vvritten therof; specially of <hi>Plato</hi> &amp; <hi>Aristotle,</hi> repeating breefly the substance of their Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales, the vvhich I vvill compare togither, to shew the fruit that may be reaped by matching thē together. The vvhich matters being high, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, very profitable, &amp; hitherto not treated of in French, I vvil lay forth as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily, briefly, &amp; fitly as I possibly can: praying the readers of thē to giue thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues attentiuely to the vnderstāding of so goodly &amp; profitable a matter.</p>
   <p>First of all therfore to come to the vvorthinesse &amp; profitablenesse of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, it is the science vvhich teacheth how to gouern mankind aright, according to the nature of ech country and people, &amp; according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity of the times: how states are to be founded, maintained and reformed when need requireth: how Common-weales, Kingdomes &amp; Empires are to be ordered to the benefit of the subiects, and to the honor of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates. It is the science vvhich hath the vnderstanding of all affaires, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting all men what to do or leaue vndone, vvhich ouerlooketh all estates, beholding the meanes of their changes, ruines and preseruations: vvhich maintaineth all other arts and trades, as well the Liberall Sciences as han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrafts, setting downe vvhether they bee to bee receiued or no; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb facs="7"/>
euen the most honourable of them, as the professions of chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, of Oratorie, of Iustice, and of housekeeping; and in at one end (which is the soueraine vvelfare of man) comprehending the ends of all the others. That is it vvhich hath first shewed vnto vs the forme of Law both naturall and ciuill, humane and diuine, priuate and publicke, vvritten and vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; vvhich hath inuited vs to liue friendly togither for the remedy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vvants: vvhich hath taught vs both the beginning and the end of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane societie, and that there vvas an vniuersall and euerlasting Law printed in mens hearts, and sowen in their brests long time afore there was any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances vvritten, or any citie founded; upon the vvhich Lawe all other particular, locall, and temporall Lawes ought to be grounded, and by the same also ruled, moderated &amp; expounded. It hath deriued equitie from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the intent to applie it to all cases that happen from day to day, and hath made vs truly to vnderstand, that Law &amp; Iustice consist not in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but are naturally graffed in humane creatures. By this Science vve know the dutie of Princes towards their Subiects, of Magistrates tovvards their Princes, and also tovvards priuate persons: What Offices are most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and most honourable: what obedience honor and reuerence the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours owe to their superiors: how men ought to behaue themselues in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in selling, in exchanging, in prizing, in giuing, in receiuing, in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, in bargaining, and in pleading. In great disorder should vvee be, if it had not knit vs together by marriages, kinreds, alliances, and households, deuided inheritances, stablished successions, and ordained seates of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. For otherwise vve could not haue knowne our own from other mens, or kinsman from a stranger, or the seruant from the maister. To bee short, vvithout this science it were not possible to liue either publickly or priuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor in anie vvise to deale vvel vvith men or mens matters. For by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring and rewarding of vertue, by the discommending and punishing of vice, and by the reducing of all our doings to an vprightnesse, it hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured vs a meane to liue happily in quietnesse and concord vvith conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And it is the more perfect, in that it procureth the vvelfare, not of some particular persons or companies onely, as other trades doe, but also vniuersally of all mankind, and of the vvhole vvorld, vvhich according to the opinion of the Stoikes, is the true Citie, and as you vvould say, the Common-weale of all men liuing.</p>
   <p>Thus haue you heard the excellencie and profitablenesse of Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: consider ye now the antiquitie thereof, and by the same meanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider also the law-giuers, vvhich did first put it in practise, and afterward the Authors that haue vvritten thereof. <hi>Aristotle</hi> (who thought the vvorld to be eternall) doth in the seuenth booke of his Common-weale, deeme this sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to haue ben inuented long ago, and also manie or rather infinit times since to haue beene forgone and lost. <hi>Plato</hi> in his third and sixth bookes of lawes, affirmeth that it began vvhen townes and ordinances of townes first
<pb facs="8"/>
began, at such time as men vvere multiplied vpon the earth. And he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that in vnaccountable and almost infinite length of time, innumerable cities haue been builded and also destroied, and become one while of smal, great; and another while of great, small; one while euil of good, and another while good of euill: vvhich chaunge hath befallen not onely in Cities and Townes, but also in Nations and Countries, yea and euen in mighty king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Empires, founded at the beginning with great prowesse of the first lords of them, &amp; afterward marred by the lazinesse of their successors, or else diminished by little and little through the long continuance of time vvhich maketh an end of all thinges. <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timeus</hi> and in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Meteores,</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Naturall Questions, thinke it to haue come to passe through the fatall Law of the World, as wel by the mouing of the first Heauen, vvhereupon all other mouings and the vvhole course of nature dependeth, as by the meetings and goings asunder of the plannets, to vvhom the Elements and all things compounded of the elements, are obedient. And peremptorily they father the destructions vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: imputing the most generall sort of them vnto excessiue vvater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floods and burnings by fire, and the lesser sort to vvarres, plagues, famines, and earthquakes, of purpose to clense countries from vvicked inhabitants, vvhen the naughtinesse of them is growne vp to the highest pitch. After vvhich riddances, the men that come vp next, vvere verie simple and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Then some one or two being found among them to be of greater vvit then the rest, did purchase great reputation by teaching thē good behauior vvith some shew of Religion, as <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Sesostris</hi> did in old time in AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt, <hi>Saturne</hi> in Italy, &amp; <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Amphion</hi> in Greece. On the other side, need taught them by little and little thinges necessarie, after the vvhich fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the things that serue for honor and pompe, vntill at length, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer superfluitie succeeded againe. Those excellent personages staied vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hauing of such interchangeable intercourse of Arts, states, and other inferior things: With vvhom the most renovvmed Astrologers agree; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that they vvill needs determine not onely the liues and fortunes of men, but also the prosperities and aduersities of cities and Nations, as <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> hath done in his Quadripartite according to the ancient Chaldees and AEgyptians, and after him the Arabians and also some Christians: adding thereunto the continuance of sects, as did <hi>Peter Ally</hi> a diuine of Paris and Cardinall of Cambray, in his concordance of Diuinitie and Astrologie: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vvhom did set themselues <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of Mirandula in his fift booke against Astrologers, and <hi>Viues</hi> in his second booke of Christian truth. But to returne againe to our matter. If vve looke throughly into all antiquity, vvhereof anie remembrance remaineth vnto vs, vvee shall finde, that the people vvhich inhabited in old time the Countrie vvhere vvee dwell now, vvere as rude and vnciuill three thousand yeares agoe, as are Sauages that haue lately beene discouered by the Spaniards and Portingales
<pb facs="8"/>
towards the West and South parts of the vvorld. They dwelt scattered here and there in caues of mountaines, and in Forrests vnder Cabines, vvithout law, vvithout Iustice, vvithout Counsell, vvithout Magistrate, vvithout Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and vvithout any forme of marriage. Afterward being increased by little and little, they communicated one vvith another, and began to draw into companies, vvherevpon insued Hamlets, Villages, Townes, and finally Cities; the good men being not onely induced to such meeting for friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships sake, but also inforced by the necessities and aduersities that pinched them, vvhich draue them to helpe one another. At the beginning they liued together in a certaine naturall simplicity, as yet vncorrupted by ambition or couetousnesse, and vnmarred of false opinions. Euery companie obeied the eldest among them, vsing his vvill for their Law, and demeaning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues simplie according to vse and custome. Afterward, as leaudnesse did increase, it stood them on hand to make lawes, and for the obeying of them to create Magistrates vvith authoritie, that they might represse the ouer-lustinesse and malapartnesse of the vvicked. For although man be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ciuill, and more companiable than any other mortall vvight, and to that purpose is indued with reason and speech, that he might communicate with others: yet notwithstanding forasmuch as he is subiect to passions vvhich oftentimes doe trouble him, and to leaud lusts vvhich incessantly restraine him from the good, it vvas needfull to set him downe some commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vvhereby to bridle such affections, and to set them again in the right vvay of Iustice. Whereunto some excellent personages hauing the skill of gouernement haue strained themselues to prouide a remedie by appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting trades of liuing and lawes to folke in diuers countries at diuers times; and for that cause they vvere called Law-makers. And these haue alwaies furthered that inuention of theirs vpon God, the first cause and originall fountaine of all goodnesse: as vvho vvould say, it is not possible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine ignorant &amp; froward folke, vvithout Religion and the feare of God, vvhich is the foundation, stablishment, and maintenance of all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveales. The famousest Law-giuer that vve knovv of, vvas <hi>Moyses</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God, vvho by Gods commandement gaue the Lavv to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues at their departure out of AEgypt. There haue beene other Lavv-giuers in other places, vvho likewise haue fathered their Lawes vpon God vnder diuers names, according to the diuers opinions of the Countries vvhere they vvere: As for example, <hi>Zoroastres</hi> the Lavv-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Bactrians and Persians, fathered his Lavves vpon <hi>Oromases: Trismegist</hi> the Lavv-giuer of the AEgyptians vpon <hi>Mercurie: Zamolxis</hi> the Lavv-giuer of the Scythians vpon <hi>Vesi: Charondas</hi> the Chalcidian vpon <hi>Saturne: Minos</hi> the Candian vpon <hi>Iupiter: Lycurgus</hi> the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian vpon <hi>Apollo: Draco</hi> and <hi>Solon</hi> the Lavv-giuers of Athens vpon <hi>Minerua:</hi> And <hi>Numa</hi> the Lavv-giuer of the Romanes vpon <hi>Ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>: all of them mingling their temporall gouernement vvith Religion,
<pb facs="9"/>
which in old time was accounted the onely wisedome; and none other were taken for wise, but such as deliuered foorth Religion, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it vnto men. A good while after the decease of <hi>Numa,</hi> because his lawes and the Lawes of other men, as well afore him as after him, were found vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; ten men vvere appointed in Rome with absolute authoritie for the time, to ouerlooke them and amend them, and to adde vnto them such other Lawes as they knewe to bee needfull for the gouernement of their State. And to that end they sent to Athens, Lacedemon, and other places, where they heard there was any good State of good gouernment: From vvhich places they tooke manie constitutions vvhich they mingled with their owne, and brought them all into twelue Tables, vvherein they comprised the whole bodie of the Romane Lawe, and the vvhole order of ciuill gouernment. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his first Booke of his Orator, affirmeth that they farre passed all the bookes of the Philosophers both in authority and profite. And <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> in his third Booke of the first <hi>Decade,</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the excessiue multitude of the Lawes that were in Rome in his time, vvriteth that the Fountaine of all Iustice both publicke and priuate, vvas contained in the twelue Tables.</p>
   <p>After the making, publishing, and receiuing of those Lawes, there came vp Lawiers, who vnderstanding the lawes and customes that were vsed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly in the citie, and the formes of pleading, gaue counsell in euery se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall matter, and shewed men how they should bring their actions, as well in criminall cases, as in matters of trespasse. They shewed the order of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing their actions, of taking exceptions, of seeking delaies, of giuing vvarnings, and taking defaults, of making inquisitions and informations, of pronouncing sentences, of putting in and drawing backe of Appeales, and of giuing definitiue iudgement: vvherethrough their authoritie grew so great, specially at Roome, that no Testament or last Will, no Stipulation or Suretiship, no Obligation or bond, no couenant, no composition, no bargaine, no contract of Marriage, nor any other matter of importance passed vvithout their priuitie. And men resorted vnto them, not onely in cases concerning the ciuill Law, but also for all their other affaires and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. They vvere of counsell vvith the Emperours, vvith the Senatours, vvith the assemblies of the people, and vvith the cases of their freindes: They vvere called to counsell both in peace and vvarre. By reason vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they vvere called men of skill, and their profession vvas called the skill of Law; because that that profession could not be demeaned vvithout ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great skill and discretion; nor vvithout much seeing, hearing, reading, and vnderstanding, nor vvithout the knovving of things done in old time, nor vvithout the knowledge of the common disposition of mankind, and the nature of right and equitie, nor vvithout marking the manners and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of diuers Nations, specially of their ovvne. These Lavvyers had their cheefe scope and svvay in Italie, and vvrote infinite Bookes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="9"/>
that matter; as <hi>Seuerus, Sulpicius, Scaeuola, Papinian, Vlpian, Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> and others. Their verie Office vvas to expound the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Pretorian proclamation, of the constitution of the Senate, of the decrees of the people, of the ordinances of Princes, and of all other Lawes: to shew the reason of euery of them, to informe men which of them vvere to bee kept, or renued, or abrogated, according to place, time, person, and other circumstances, after the same maner that the Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothets did in Athens. The Historiographers wrote the warres, and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred the other publicke doings, as <hi>Herodotus, Thucidides, Polybius, Salust, Titus Liuius, Tacitus,</hi> and innumerable others did in all Languages. Some Orators gouerned States, and were assistants in consultaions of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke affaires, whereof they wrote Orations, as did <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Other some being more giuen to contemplation, applied not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so much to dealing vvith the people and vvith the Citie matters, as the former sort did, who commonly meddled in all things: But foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they were indued with great wit, and had attained to great skill, by meane of the great rest and leisure which they had, they sought out the truth of all things concerning God and man. And as touching Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales, they conferred them one with another, and by so doing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuored to yeeld causes and reasons of their continuances and decaies, and to shewe by what meanes euery of them was stablished, why some were better gouerned and some worse; which was the best Common-weale, who was the perfect Common-wealeman, and who is the true Prince and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. Such vvere <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Heraclides</hi> of Pont, <hi>Theophrastus, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caerchus,</hi> and <hi>Plutarke.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The first professors of Philosophie, vvondering at the heauens and the Starres, and at their reuolutions and effects; and beholding the earth, the vvaters fresh and salt, the aire variable, the burning fire, and all thinges as vvell simple as compounded contained within the compasse of the vvhole vvorld, in multitude innumerable, and in beautie vvonderfull: bent their vvits to the finding out of their properties, agreeings, and disagreeings, to know vvhereof they vvere made or engendred, how long they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, vvhere they became, vvhen and how they perished, and vvhat in them vvas mortall and corruptible, and vvhat diuine and euerlasting. They marked the moouings of the Starres, their meetings, their oppositions, their distances, their appearings, their hidings of themselues, their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, their swiftnesse, their flovvnesse, their colours, and the maruellous accidents both generall and particular vvhich they cause, according to the ansvvereablenesse of the parts of Heauen and Earth one to another, the disposition of the matter vvhich they meet vvithall, and the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the seasons vvherein they reigne and vvorke.

Gallond and in great Brittaigne, and the wise men among the AEthiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Chaldeans, and AEgyptians followed all that manner of Philosophie. Afterward the Greekes, as <hi>Pythagoras, Thales, Democritus, Heraclitus, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedocles, Parmenides, Melissus, Xenophanes, Eudoxus,</hi> and <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> imployed their wits about the searching out of the secrets of the world. Neuerthelesse, forasmuch as they thought it odious both to God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to blaze abroad those things differently to all men, for feare least the making of them too common, might cause them to bee despised of the rascall sort, some of them did darken them expressely, with numbers and figures of Geometrie: and other some wrapped them vp in couerts of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and set them downe in measured verses, to the intent, to make their workes the more durable through the delightfulnesse of the fables and the sweetnesse of the verse. <hi>Plato</hi> changet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>his fabling into making of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, retaining still the vsing of fables also in manie places. <hi>Aristotle</hi> left both versifying and fabling, and chose rather to write in whole continued Oration, than in dialogue wise, at leastwise for ought of his that is come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs to this day. But as touching naturall Philosophy and Astrologie, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> maketh very small reckoning of them, but giueth himselfe chiefly to reasoning of manners, of vertue, of vice, and altogether of good and euill. He was the first of all the Greek Philosophers, that drew Philosophy from gazing vpon the Heauens and vpon Nature, to applie it to the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Housesholds and Common-weales, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> reporteth, who in the first Booke of his Commentaries, writeth thus of him.</p>
   <p>
      <q>
         <hi>Socrates</hi> (saieth hee) spake not of the matter or stuffe of all thinges, ass manie Philosophers doe, neither occupied he his wits in considering how the world was created, and by what necessitie the Heauenly thinges are made: but shewed, that such as gaue themselues to such kind of gazing or contemplation, were fooles. First hee demanded of them whether they thought themselues so sufficiently skilfull in humane thinges alreadie, as to proceed from them to the speculation of the other: if not, then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they thought themselues to doe well, in leauing humane matters to gaze vpon the heauens. He vvondered that they perceiued it not to bee vnpossible for them to attaine to the knowledge of those things, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how those vvhich seeme most skilfull in them, agree not among themselues, but behaue themselues like mad men one towards another. For as of fooles, some feare not the thinges that are to bee feared, and some are afraid vvhere no cause is, some are not ashamed to doe and say openly vvhatsoeuer commeth in their head, and other some dare not disclose themselues in companie, some yeeld no reuerence at all neither to Temple nor to Altar, nor to any deuine thing, and other some vvorship both blockes and stones and brute beastes: so among them which busie themselues about the searching out of the nature of all things, some think there is but onely one Beeing or Beeer, and some thinke there are
<pb facs="10"/>
infinite multitudes of thē vvithout number. Some thinke that all things are moued, &amp; some that nothing is moued: some that all things are created and doe perish, and other some that nothing vvas created, nor anie thing dooth perish. He demanded of them yet further after this manner; namely, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that as they that haue the knowledge of thinges belonging to men, can skill to doe them themselues, and to teach them vnto others; so vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the searchers of the heauēly things do think, that by their knowing by vvhat necessitie ech thing is ordained, can vvhen they list make the vvind to blow, and the shoures to raine, or alter the seasonablenesse of the yeare vvhen need is: or vvhether they had no such hope, but rested vvithin their only bare knowledge how euery thing vvas made. After that manner spake he to such as did set their minds vpon such curiosities. Vnto other men hee disputed ordinarily of things pertaining to man, discussing vvhat vvas god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and vvhat vvas vngodlinesse; vvhat vvas honest, and vvhat vnhonest; vvhat vvas right and vvhat vvrong; vvhat vvisdome, and vvhat folly; vvhat manlinesse, and vvhat covvardlinesse; vvhat vvas a Common-vveale, and vvho is a Common-weale man; vvhat it is to raigne, and vvhat manner of one he ought to be that should command. Manie other things also did he discourse, vvherof the knowledge might (in his iudgement) make mē good and honest: esteeming them vvorthie the name of slaues, vvhich vvere ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of them. And in the fourth booke of the same his Commentaries, <hi>Xenophon</hi> saith of him againe: He deemed those men to haue a good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, vvhich soone conceiued of the thing vvhich they studied, &amp; bare vvell avvay the things vvhich they learned, and vvere desirous of those Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences vvhich teach vs hovv to liue vvel in a house and in a Common-weale, and generally to vse all men and all things as becommeth vs. For he vvas of opinion, that if those persons were well instructed, they would not only be happie men in their priuate behauior, and in the vvel ordering of their own houses, but also make the vvhole cities and Common-weales happy where they dwell.</q>
Notwithstanding, <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> witnesseth, that euen vnto his daies the men of Athens had opinion, that <hi>Xenophon</hi> (of hatred to <hi>Plato</hi>) wrote the aforesaid vvords purposely against <hi>Plato,</hi> because that in his books he brought in <hi>Socrates,</hi> discoursing of Naturall Philosophy, Geometry, and Musick. But in very deed <hi>Plato</hi> himselfe maketh him to speak well nigh the like things in his <hi>Phedon.</hi>
      <q>When I vvas yoong (saith <hi>Socrates</hi>) I had a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous desire to learne the Science vvhich is called the Historie of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For I thought it to be a verie excellent thing to vnderstand the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vvhy all things are done, wherfore they perish, and by vvhat means they be maintained. Oftentimes tossed I my selfe vp and downe in considering such doings from the beginning: as for example, to knovv vvhether that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heat &amp; cold haue receiued some putrifaction, thereupon (as some haue said) liuing creatures are ingendred and sustained. And againe, vvhether the cause of wisedome in vs bee blood, or aire, or fire, or none of them all:
<pb facs="11"/>
but rather that our hearing, seeing, and smelling do come of the braine: of the vvhich sences spring memorie and opinion, and likewise of memorie and opinion taking their rest, do spring vp skill by the same means. Againe in considering the corrupting of those things, and the inconueniences that happen in the skies and earth, I vvas vtterly grauelled in the end, because I vvas faine still to vnlearne the same things, vvhich I thought I had learned afore. Also <hi>Plutarke</hi> vvriteth of him in <hi>Solons</hi> life, that hee loued chieflie that part of morall Philosophy vvhich treateth of the gouernment of Common-weales, as the most part of the vvise men of that time did, vvho sought to haue no further insight than of the thinges that are in common vse among men, vvherethrough they purchased the renowme of vvisedome, by being vvell seene alonely in matters of state and gouernement.</q>
   </p>
   <p>As for <hi>Socrates,</hi> although he vvas of excellent skil, vvisdome, and sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of vvit, and verie eloquent, yet did he not vvrite any thing. But <hi>Plato, Xenophon,</hi> and other of his Disciples conueied into their bookes the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses vvhich hee had made at diuers times, or rather for the reuerence vvhich they bare vnto him, they published the most part of their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions vnder his name, to giue the more authoritie vnto them. The Greekes affirme <hi>Plato</hi> to haue been the first among them that vvrote anie bookes of Common-vveale matters. He imagining that vve cannot knovv anie thing ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>tainely by the bodily sences, because they fill vs vvith manie errors and false imaginations, but only by the vnderstanding and reason of the mind, held opinion, that there vvere certaine vniuersall formes, shapes, or patternes of all nature and artificiall things, vvhich hee tearmed <hi>Idaea,</hi> vvhereof the things themselues tooke their beeings, vpholding that they abode euerlastingly seuered from the matter or stuffe, alwaies in the verie singlenesse and purenesse of the godhead it selfe, and are conceiuable only by vnderstanding: and that the other shapes vvhich vvere produced of them, vvere but shadovves and Images of them, subiect to continuall alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, euer breeding, euer dying, euer increasing, euer deminishing, euer gliding, euer falling, euer beginning, and euer ending. According to this opinion, he did cast in his imagination a certain <hi>Idaea</hi> of a perfect Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvealth, and rather diuine then humane: for that perceiuing mankind to be alvvaies trauelled and troubled vvith dissention, that those vvhom in times past by innumerable lavves and ordinances inuented to remedy &amp; redresse the same, had nothing profited therein, but to the contrary, all things rather seemed to impaire: hee esteemed that to plucke vp and extirpe the hatreds and partialities of men, there could be nothing more expedient then to set before their eies a community, not only of all good things, but also of things namely vvhich Nature it selfe hath made and framed proper to euery man, as of eies, eares, and hands, to the end, that vvhosoeuer should see, heare, or doe any thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> should imploy all his actions vvhatsoeuer vnto the vse and common profite of all men, thinking also that both vvomen and children
<pb facs="11"/>
ought likewise to be common, therby to breed and intertaine loue among the cittizens: who by that means hauing nothing in perticular, should ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bee touched with one like ioy and greefe, according to the occurrence, and effect of their affaires. Not that in any sort he esteemeth it an easie thing to be done (as hee himselfe affirmeth in the beginning of his first booke of the Common-wealth, as also about the end of the ninth) but rather for the nouelty therof, that it should be found a thing most strange &amp; admirable, as not being vsed or once allowed of in any place whatsoeuer, but that the example and forme of polliticke perfection, wherevpon in argument and word he had framed this Common-wealth, peraduenture being in heauen, and visible onely to those that would attentiuelie behold the same with the eies of good intelligence, to the end, that hauing seene and beheld it, they should by imitation assay all meanes to conforme themselues vnto it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting therefore this forme of a Common-wealth, framed and deuised according to the patron by him conceiued vvithin his high and diuine spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, hee was much more pleased and satisfied therewith then in all his other works, as it well appeareth by the beginning of <hi>Timee,</hi> wherein hauing col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the principal points of all his politick discourse, he sheweth his great and singular affection vnto the worke, withall wishing to find some excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Ora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>r or learned Poet, to giue it the true praise and commendation which it worthily deserueth. For that therein there is such grauity of senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, eloquence of words, and varietie of exquisite proposition, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to finde a thing more artificially wrought. Now hauing purposed to represent vnto vs the image of a most perfect, true, and iust Common-wealth, hee hath intituled his vvorke by the name of Pollicie or Iustice, principally inforcing himselfe to shew that it is Iustice, because hee estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it to be the true and only rule of Politicke institution, wherevnto all humane actions ought wholly to be referred. The Heauens by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall moouing, running and compassing about this earthly mould, stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp &amp; quickeneth the seeds of all things whatsoeuer that are inclosed &amp; cast into the superficiall part thereof, which being and remaining within the earth, are nourished by the water, brought forth and sprung vp by the force of aire and fire, and then to make them ripe, are quickened by the naturall influences of the celestial plannets, specially the sunne and moone: who by their admirable and strange vertues doe still disperse &amp; cast forth in euerie place a perpetuall and continuall desire of naturall production, thereby at all times and seasons to fill and to replenish the world with new creatures, plants, hearbes, trees, stones, and mettals, and to continue them in their kinds for the vse of man, for whō only all things on earth are made and created. Who notwithstanding their reasonable and polliticke produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, cannot receiue or reape anie fruit thereof without Iustice, Law, and Magistrates, who by good reason are rightly tearmed the Ministers of God, ordained and appointed for the gouernement and conseruation of mankind, in due and reasonable proportion to distribute and deuide
<pb facs="12"/>
among them those goods and things vvhich daily by the most diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God are giuen and sent vnto them: seeing then that Iustice is of such force and efficary, there can be no better nor more necessary vvorke done nor procured vnto man, then by all meanes to mooue and stirre him vp vnto the same, vvithout the vvhich, they neither can nor may liue either solitarie or in companie vvhatsoeuer. Therefore doth <hi>Plato</hi> deserue great praise among all such as haue either stablished Common-weales or vvritten of the forme of Gouernement; specially, for that hee groundeth not the principles of his Common-weale vpon richesse, power of men, or conquests, as most men doe; but vpon Iustice, the vvhich hee preferreth before all thinges: in consideration, that in vvhatsoeuer coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and States of Gouernement it is duly knowne, and sincerely obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, vvith true Religion and the pure seruing of God, it maketh all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, sutes in Law, and dissentions to cease, and procureth great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the persons that follow it. <hi>Socrates</hi> disputing vvith <hi>Thrasyma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Glaucus,</hi> and <hi>Adimant,</hi> dooth in his first Booke and in a part of his second, examine certaine definitions of Iustice, and compare it vvith vniustice by laying them together, to the intent, that beeing the better knowne, the one may bee the more reuenced, and the other the more misliked and hated. The vvhich manner of teaching by contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>s, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in manie Sciences, and is of vvonderfull force. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Phisicke speaketh not onely of health, but also of Sicknesse: and Musicke speaketh not onely of Concords, but also of Discords: to the intent, to doe the contraries the better: namely, to maintaine health, and to keepe good tune. Likewise, Morrall Philosopie giueth vs knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, not onely of the thinges that are delightfull and profitable in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deed, but also of the thinges that are vnhonest, vnpleasant, and hurtfull. For the good cannot bee perfectlie perceiued, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> vvorthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie esteemed, but by conferring it vvith the euill: neither can the euill bee vvell eschewed and subdued, vvithout the helpe of the knowne good.</p>
   <p>Therefore <hi>Socrates</hi> treating of the Iustice that is to bee in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveale, and in man, seeketh it first in the Common-weale vvhere it is most apparant, as in the greater thing, and aftervvard in man, vvhere it is lesse apparant, as in the lesser thing. And vpon that occasion, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the Originall of Common-weales, Kinreds. Degrees, States, Trades, and exercises of people, in vvhat sort they may mainetaine Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice amoug them, and vvherein consisteth the commoditie of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, by comparing a vvell ordered Common-weale with a corrupt one. And because the gouernment of all Common-weales dependeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bringing vp of the commoners: throughout his whole third Booke, and in a good part of his fourth, he traineth them vp from their verie infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, according to their natural inclinations &amp; dispositions: but specially the keepers, that is to say, the Magistrats and men of war, whom aboue all men
<pb facs="12"/>
he vvill haue to be vvell instructed in true religion, vvithout corruption of poeticall fables. Then returneth he againe to his discourse of Iustice, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it to be the vnion of the foure principall vertues, wisdome, stoutnes, temperance, and particular Iustice.</p>
   <p>And that the Common-weale is iust or rightfull, vvhere euerie vertue doth his proper dutie, as well towardes the commanders as towardes the obeyers, of vvhat sort or qualitie soeuer they be: and likewise that the man is iust vvhere the like consent of the foresaid vertues is found, because there is the selfesame behauiour required in euery seuerall person, which is to be required in a whole Common-weale. That in the soule of man there are three parts, Reason, Wrath, and Lust: that Wisdome serueth to guide Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Stoutnesse to restraine Wrath, and Temperance to bridle Lust. That in a Commonweale the Gouernours doe represent the image of Reason and Wisdome: the defenders resemble Wrath and Stoutnes, and the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrafts and merchants are like to Lust and Temperance. And therefore the Commonweale or the Man is then iust, when in the Common-weale the vertues, and in the Man the partes of the Soule, doe their duties due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without incroching one vpon another: and that the Common-weale and the Man are vniust where the contrarie befalleth, forasmuch as vniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is nothing else but the transgressing of the said duties and offices: like as the sicknesse of the bodie is the disorder and disagreement of the foure humours, and the health of the bodie is their good agreement in due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion togither.</p>
   <p>In the fift booke hee treateth of the communitie of goods, wiues, and children. Hauing set his Common-weale in that order, in his sixt booke he describeth the office of the Princes which are to rule it. The which he continueth on withall in the seuenth booke, rehearsing particularly what sciences they ought to learne, &amp; in what order. And forasmuch as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered that there be many sortes of Common-weales differing from his, he compareth them with it, in the eight and ninth bookes, declaring verie cunningly the changes of the one sort vnto the other, and therewithall also their vices and discommodities. Finally, because most men are so bent to their owne profit, that they forget all dutie and conscience, to the intent to induce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ll men to doe vvell, in his tenth and last booke he declareth that rewards are appointed for the righteous, and punishments for the vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, not onely in this present life, but also in the life to come. At the first hee did put forth no moe but the first two books, against the whichh Xenophon (beating him a little grudge) did set himselfe, and vvrote the Institution or bringing vp of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> vvherein hee expressed the image of a rightfull kingdome and a martiall King, of purpose to set foorth the kingly gouernment, differing from that which <hi>Plato</hi> did set downe in his Common-weale. Whereat <hi>Plato</hi> vvas so sore offended, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward taking occasion in his third booke to treate of the kingdome of the Persians, and comming of purpose to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to the intent to picke a
<pb facs="13"/>
quarrell to <hi>Xenophons</hi> vvorke, he acknowledged <hi>Cyrus</hi> to be a hardie and valiant Prince, howbeit that he neuer had any honorable bringing vp. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Plato</hi> had finished his Common-weale, he made also twelue books of Lawes, vvherein he speaketh himselfe vnder the name of his host of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. And in pretending to giue lawes to the Greekes, he examineth three Common-weales, vvhich flourished at that time in Greece: namely, the Candian, the Lacedemonian, and the Athenian; abating, adding, and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring many points in them, to make one better of them all. Moreouer, to the same purpose, he vvrote two other Treatises, the one intituled <hi>Minos,</hi> vvherein he defineth and deuideth Lavv; and the other Gouernement, as vvherein consisteth the skill of gouerning, and hovv the same ought to be vsed. <hi>Cicero</hi> affirming himselfe to be a follovver of <hi>Plato,</hi> and glorying of himselfe for his matching of eloquence vvith Philosophy, made sixe books of Common-vveale in dialogue vvise in the Romane tongue, applied chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly to the Romane State, vvhich bookes are lost by the iniury of time: and as manie of Lawes, conformable to the twelue Tables, of vvhich there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine but only three, and those vnperfect and corrupted.</p>
   <p>Novv then, vvhereas the first Sages gaue themselues vvholly to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of the heauens, and of nature; and <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> bent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues chiefly to Morall Philosophie, <hi>Aristotle</hi> succeeding them, comprised all the parts of Philosophie most happily. I vvil not at this present meddle vvith anie other of his vvritings, but reserue my treating of them to some more conuenient time. I vvil speake but only of those vvhich serue my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent turne. First of all he gathereth the institutions of two hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Common-vveales, as vvell Straungers as Greekes. Then vvriteth he to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, concerning Raigning: Afterward hee made eight bookes of gouernement full of great Learning and Wisedome, in the vvhich he hath brought all the skill of gouerning into forme of Art. In his first Booke hee sheweth from vvhence Ciuill societie proceedeth, vvherein it consisteth, and to vvhat end it is to bee referred; beginning at the first and singlest parts thereof. Next hee treateth of the meanes vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to get goods, vvhich serue to mainetaine both housholds and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-vveales, and fetcheth the true causes of gouernements from Nature. In the second place, afore hee enter into the principall matter, hee exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the most Renovvmed Common-vveales of his time, and bevvraieth the vvants of them all. Then comming to the third point, vvhich is the right beginning of his Gouernement, he shevveth vvhat a Citie is, vvho is a Citizen, and vvhat a Common-vveale is, hovv manie sorts of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveales there are, hovv euery of them is stablished, and hovv men be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be gouerned by some one sort rather than by another, vvhich things he goeth through vvithall in his fourth booke. In the fifth booke are set down the alterations, decaies, and preseruations of States. In the sixt he speaketh interchangeably of the Gouernement by a fevv, and of Gouernement by the multitude; of either of their vnderkinds, resemblances, proprieties,
<pb facs="13"/>
and communicatings: of the Magistrates needfull for either state, and of their charges. In the seuenth, which absolutely is the perfect Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, and wherein consisteth the happinesse of cities: he treateth of the scituation, commoditie, and ornament of a Citie: of the condition of the territorie about it: of the number and quantities of the inhabitants, of marriage, and of procreation and bringing vp of children: the training of whome he toucheth in the eight and last booke which is vnperfect, where he discourseth particularly in what exercises and what trades they ought to be entred at the first.</p>
   <p>Now that I haue briefly rehearsed the principall matters set downe in the Common-weales of Plato and Aristotle, I am to tell you wherefore I determined to ioyne them togither, and to shew you the importance and profite of that ioyning. Certaine it is that there was neuer any man fully and wholly perfect in this world, how great grace soeuer God bestowed vpon him, but that with notable vertues, alwaies some notable vices haue been matched. Therefore no maruaile though Plato and Aristotle being excellent personages, and such as had gained the prize of knowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, haue now and then erred, specially in this matter of Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Out of doubt Plato had done the better if hee had contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the order, elegancie, and grauitie which hee kept in the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Common-vveale, and not medled vvith the communitie of goods, wiues, and children, nor taken vpon him to appoint men &amp; vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men their seuerall charges and offices. For doing vvhereof hee is blamed, not onely by them of his ovvne time, but also by all those that haue come after him, of what religion soeuer they haue held, who vvith one consent haue reiected that fashion as too too straunge and impossible. Likevvise Aristotle had auoided many rebukes if hee had shevved himselfe more carefull of religion, whereof he seemeth to haue small regard, and not ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued mens turnes more to profit and ease than to godlinesse, whereof Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath great care in all his bookes. For euery vvell ordered State or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monvveale hath such need of religion to be matched vvith ciuill gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they seeme too vnseparable. Religion printeth and setteth the feare of God and the loue of their neighbours in mens heartes, ruling the exposition of the holy Scriptures, and the offices of the persons that are appointed to the seruice of God. And ciuill gouernment directeth the affaires of peace and warre, wherein there would be neither vprightnesse nor faithfulnesse, without the feare of God and the loue of man, which are chiefly enioyned in all religions. And therefore it shall be verie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to read both Plato and Aristotle, that vvee may learne of the one the things that pertaine to God and godlinesse (I meane next vnto the holy Scriptures:) and of the other the things that belong to the gouerning of men and mens affaires.</p>
   <p>If it be obiected, that many excellent personages haue been forward in times past, and are to be found still at this present, who beeing destitute of

      </gap>learning, haue by the onely naturall drift of experience, fitly orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red publicke affaires, and happily gouerned their dominions. I answer, that if this naturall good gift and experience of theirs had been matched with learning, they had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>n more cleer-sighted and better assured of their doings. Soothly in all Artes three things are necessarie to the purchasing of perfection: namely, Nature, Learning, and Experience. Nature is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and forwardnes; Learning quickneth vp nature, and being aided vvith order and method, guideth it by generall precepts and vniuersall grounds; and Experience assisted with imitation, confirmeth both the other by the continuall holding on of many particular actions. Any one of them alone hath verie small force: Nature of it selfe is vnsufficient, Learning vvithout nature is fondnesse, and vvithout Experience vnprofitable: like vvater that stands sodding in a marrish, or like hearbes and fruits that are alwaies ouershadowed. But when all three of them doe meet togither, then bring they forth the excellencie vvhich we so greatly commend and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at in all things. In Leachcraft although the bare practitioner doe by his experience sometimes hit well vpon the healing of some disease, yet is it euident, that hauing Art and cunning matched vvith his experience, so as he discerne the nature and cause of the disease, marking the complexion, age, and manner of liuing of his patient, and thereunto considering the qualitie and quantitie of his medicines, and applying them in due time, he shall the better performe the dutie of his science, and commonly the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attaine to the end thereof. Also in like case, the pilot that can skill of the Art of sailing, and knoweth the diuersities of the seasons of the yeere, the nature of the Sea and of the vvinds, the alterations of the aire, and the moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings of the heauens, shall ordinarily performe his voiage better and more sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ely than hee that goes to it but by rote, and can no further skill than of the mariners Card, floting vvhich vvay soeuer the tide and fortune driues him. Also that the General of a field shall the more wisely gouerne an army, giue or receiue battell, besiege fortresses, &amp; such other things, vvhich mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the skill of martiall learning vvith the experience of vvarre. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vvhosoeuer taketh vpon him to found a new State, to restore a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied, to preserue a long continued, to reforme a corrupted, or to gouerne a stablished, if he be a politicke fellow by nature, and moreouer vvell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed and experienced in the case, so as he haue iudgement to consider aduisedly the natures of euery of them, and to discerne their beginnings, increasings, strengths, decaies, changes, and instants of ending one in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, hee shall fare much the better by being so schooled and prepared aforehand. Nay (vvhich more is) I say that otherwise he shall see nothing at all in that behalfe for the most part of his time, but shall go groping like a blind man, and commit many vvorse errors than the ignorant phisitian and pilot, because the case vvhich he vndertaketh is of farre greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and concerneth moe folke, as namely the tranquilitie, welfare, and honour of a vvhole countrey or Nation, or of a State sore attainted with the
<pb facs="14"/>
diseases of excesse and couetousnesse, or laied open to the great torments and perrillous stormes of warres both at home and abroad, or tired with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite fluds and vvaues of troubles beating vpon it vncessantly: by meanes vvhereof it hath need of great vvisdome and continuall watchfulnes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the safety thereof.</p>
   <p>I thinke I haue nowe performed almost that I promised, for yee haue here the excellencie and profitablenesse of Ciuill gouernement, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall ye haue ben certefied what men of old time haue set vp states of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment or vvritten of them, and yee haue seene the Common-weales of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> compared together: By which means I thinke yee be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very wel affectioned towards this noble science, so as I shall not need to exho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>t you any further thereunto. For if yee haue respect to honor, vvhat science is there that behighteth greater honor than ciuil gouernment doth, which calleth you to the ruling of cities, lordships, and kingdomes, wherein the soueraine authority among men consisteth? If yee be desirous of profite &amp; riches, it is the way to get great goods, &amp; to increase the wealth of good houses. If yee couet to bee mighty, how may a man bee more aduanced or come to greater credit and authoritie, than by the managing of Publicke affaires? If yee like of knowledge and skill, vvhat other facultie shall ye find that hath more excellent grounds, or vvhich aimeth at a more commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble end? If ye desire pleasure and contentment of mind, vvhat can be more pleasant to a man that is vvell borne, or vvhat can more become him, then to knovv the manners, lawes, customes, ordinances, alliances, confederati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, forces, reuenues, &amp; antiquities of his owne country? If ye vvould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase endlesse praise by vvel doing, &amp; cōtinue your name euerlastlingly to posteritie, vvhere shall ye meet vvith fitter and goodlier matter to vvorke it on, than to giue lavves to Nations; considering the glory that <hi>Minos, Licur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and other Lavv-makers haue obtained, vvho vvere canonized for gods after their deaths, and honored vvith Temples, Praiers, and yearely feasts? Grammer, Rhetoricke, and Logicke, serue but onely to speake vvell and to reason vvel. Poetry serueth but for pleasure, the searching of Antiquities, the knovvledge of Languages, and the conferring and correcting of copies, are more curious than profitable, and carry a man but a little beyond the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of youth and the custome of schooles. The vvriters of histories are oft reproued of vntruth, and agree not togither. Eloquence hath euermore ben suspected: insomuch, that euē in Athens vvhere it florished most, they vvere forbidden to moue affections, and to vse Proems &amp; Perorations. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Mathematical sciences, &amp; the considering of the natural mouings, are for thēselues, &amp; not for others. The iudgements of Astrology be vncertain. In the iudgement of <hi>Plutarke,</hi> the metaphisicks do smal good. Phisick serueth the turn of the rich rather then of the poor, vvho be not able to buy the strāge droogs, or to pay the Apothecary.

good, feeding men vvith formalities and long processes. But as for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, it is the principall rule of all Liberall sciences and handicraftes, the orderer of all worldly exercises, the mother of discipline, the mistres of manners; behoouefull for schooles, behoouefull for occupations; bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to the field, beneficiall to the towne; needfull on sea, needfull on land; profitable for warre and profitable for peace. There is not that house, that floting shippe, that Citie, that Nation, or that people be it neuer so rude and barbarous, vvhich consisteth not of commanders and obeyers, and consequently retaineth not some forme of gouernment. It is to be found euen in the vvhole vvorld, and in euery particular person, so as the superiour commmaundeth the inferiour, and the soule the bodie. It trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vp children after a free manner in good manners and sciences, it quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth the courages of young men with hope of offices and promotions in time to come, it assuageth the griefes euen of the most aged, vvith the authoritie and reputation of their counsell and experience: it relieueth the poore, maintaineth the rich, pleaseth the good, contenteth the vvise, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Magistrates, directeth Kings and Emperours, ruleth States, linketh the inferiours and superiours togither vvith vprightnes, adorneth prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, comforteth aduersitie, promising euerlasting praise to true Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in recompence of their extreme paines, and of the griefes and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasures vvhich they receiue by vnderminers of their state and enuious persons. It maintaineth iustice, defendeth right, obserueth lawes, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth sutes aud quarrels, bringeth in gentlenes, driueth away rudenes, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth good vvill, putteth away ill vvill, quickneth vp diligence, blameth idlenes, banisheth superfluitie, riddeth away couetousnes, honoureth ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, punisheth vice, is milde in deedes, graue in vvords, easie to hearken, discrete in giuing answer, warie in execution, stout in publicke dealings, constant in perils, vnflexible to fauour, vnflexible to partialitie, vncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible by mony, inuincible against force and feare, the holder of humane fellowship in mutuall concord, amiable conuersation, and quiet safetie: the ground of publicke peace, the vvelspring of equitie, and the verie life, order, counsell, and quickener of Common-weales: in respect vvhereof it ought to be learned, practised, and honoured in all places, and of all persons. Receiue therefore, receiue this noble Science, vvhich is offered vnto you at this day: studie, vvake, and take paines to compasse it, to know it, and to vnderstand it, that by applying it to the right vse, ye may become profitable to your countrey, helpefull to your friends, and seruiceable to your rulers, vvhose good and loiall subiects you be.</p>
