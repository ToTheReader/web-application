   <head>The preface of A. Hircius, or Oppius vppon the last booke of the Commentaries of the warres in Gallia.</head>
   <p>COMPELLED BY THY continuall calling vpon me, (my frend Balbus: least through my daily refusal I might seme, not so muche to excuse my self by the difficultie of the matter, as to seke delaye for slouthfulnesse, I haue taken in hand a right difficult matter: I haue patched vp the Commētaries of our Caesar concerning his doinges in Gallia, nothinge comparable eyther to the things he wrate before or since: and I haue finyshed his last booke which he left vnperfect, from the things that were done at Alexandria, vnto the ende, not of the ciuill discord wherof we see no ende, but of the life of Caesar. The which who so euer shall reade, wold God they knewe howe vnwillinglye I toke vpon me to wright them, to thentent I be not blamed of folly and arrogancy for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling my self with Caesars wrightings. For all men agree vppon this, that there is no
<pb facs="252"/>
thing done so workmanly by others, whiche giueth not place to the elegancy of theis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries: which were put foorth by him to thentent that wrighters should not want the knowledge of so noble dedes: and they are so highly allowed by the iudgement of all men, that occasion of matter maye seeme not to be ministred, but rather to be quight taken from other wrighters. The which thing I must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des more wonder at than all others. For other know how wel &amp; exquisitely, &amp; I know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides also, howe easly &amp; swiftly he performed thē. There was in Caesar, not only abundance of matter and elegancy of wrighting, but also most certain knowledge how to expresse his deuises and conceites. For my part, I had not so good chaūce, as to be present at the warres of Aegipt and Affricke: the which warres al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be partlye knowen to me by the report of Cesar: yet notwithstandinge we are wont to heare those thinges that wyth their straungenes do delight vs or make vs to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, after another sort than those things which wee are minded to report againe as vprighte witnesses. But whiles I vnaduisedlye gather
<pb n="239" facs="252"/>
together al the causes of excuse, for the which I shoulde not be compared with Caesar? I do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> thereby runne in daunger of the reproche of arrogancye, in that I surmise any man to be so far ouersene, to compare me wyth Caesar.</p>
   <closer>Fare well.</closer>
