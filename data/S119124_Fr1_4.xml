      <hi>THE</hi> PREFACE OF THE <hi>TRANSLATOR.</hi>

      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y</hi> that which I found in my selfe, when I hapned to reade this tragicall history, and by well peysing the substance of this Author, it was not hard for me to perceiue, that if he spake English, he might worke meruails in soules. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the vnderstanding, to moue the will, to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the hart, to enkindle the minde, to remoue the mists of ignorance from mens wits, to enflame the right beleeuing soule vnto zeale, I sawe matter more then sufficient. Let me deserue the blazon of a lyar, if reading this discourse, the attentiue and impartiall vmpeere admire not, to see howe like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore thornes are to thornes; and grapes vnto grapes; wheat vnto wheat; &amp; chaffe vnto chaffe; sheepe vnto sheepe; both children of darkenes &amp; of light to their forefathers. If therein the weake in faith finde not assurance of Gods assistance; the tempted, discreete meanes of resistance; the sound
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
consolation incredible; the corrupted their soules touched to the quicke. If herein be not many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table singularities of Historicall antiquity, and so many passages of points Ecclesiasticall, that the faith and face of the vniuersall Church of Christ, at those dayes may most liuely thereby be descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; the beliefe, rites, ordinances, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof: euen at those dayes, when the three famous and chiefest Doctors, <hi>Hierome, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> had immediately before together flourished. Argument and forme of the persecution, was no other, then this which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. After the <hi>Vandals</hi> had as an vncatar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted torrent, or mercylesse inundation, ouerrunne <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spayne,</hi> they passed into <hi>Africa,</hi> wrested the same from the Roman Empire, there established the seate of their Kingdome, and iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their newe conquered Dominion, deemed nothing more secure then as the <hi>Mediterrane</hi> Sea did by vast and boysterous waters seuer them from the Empire: so by dissonant &amp; irreconciliable opinions, to deuide the peoples harts from all socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the same, to alienate them from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in beliefe with <hi>Greece &amp; Italy.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, when the <hi>Arrian</hi> heresie (which had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy infected the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and in <hi>Africke</hi> had long since canker-wise crept into many harts) see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med most proper; <hi>Gensericke</hi> their King by
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>
terrour of lawes gaue countenance to the same, &amp; enterprised the vtter extirpation of the faith. Not in deede vrging in expresse tearmes to deny Christ our Lord to be equall to his Father, or to confesse any point of <hi>Arrianisme</hi> against their conscience (for it had beene too palpable abhomination euen to the simplest senses) but only importuning for conformity sake, to suffer themselues to be sprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with water of the <hi>Arrians</hi> handes, vnder cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne forme of wordes different from the Catholike manner, and at least-wise to forsake the accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med sacrifice of the Church, and resort to their pretended prayers. For recusancy of which sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious impieties, such thinges endured the Godly of those times, as haue scant beene heard of: whose calamities make the subiect of this booke. But no wisdome is there against the wil of the highest, nor counsaile against his determination, nor preuc̄tion against his prouidence, nor machination against his might; who first by horrible famin and morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity eased for a season the yoke of his afflicted, and finally after foure-score and tenne yeares, subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Vandals</hi> by the hand of the valorous <hi>Belisarius,</hi> reunited the Prouince both to the Roman Empire and communion of the true faith: Full is the history Ecclesiasticall; full are <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, Sozomen,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions raysed by Iewes and Infidels, against the

      </gap>smoothly deliuered as might be required: the law of a Translator abridging my liberty. For had I not in this case chosen rather to be seene Religious i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>sister, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ond licētiate Paraphrast, more could I haue beautified and graced my labour, to the Reader perhaps, but not to myselfe, who hold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise truth to be the very beauty as of history, so of translation. Neither becōmeth it me to excuse the harshnesse of the <hi>African</hi> names, which <hi>Pliny</hi> aduertiseth scarcely able to be committed to let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. In the edition of <hi>Basil,</hi> two bookes of the three are by chapters diuided, but so vnfittingly to the context of the matter, that a dimme iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may apparantly discerne, that neither <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> nor yet any man of learning was deuiser of such disorderly order, and confused distinction. The whole haue I digested into chapters also, but in a more proper and conuenient sort: as combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the seuerall matters best disposed. At places of marke, or else of speciall difficulty, by the Authors wordes inserted in the margent, shall the iudicious reader be vnpreiudiced of his owne sense. The care of whose commodity might haue further extended my preamble to so important an Author; but that litle said sooner findeth pardon, then doth prolixity.</p>
