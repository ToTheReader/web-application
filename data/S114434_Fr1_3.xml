   <head>The Preface to the
Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Iewes returning from
captiuitie, did so wonder at
their strange deliuerance,
that they seemed to be as
men, <hi>that dreame:</hi> Psal. 126
1. As strange a worke hath
God wrought for the Church of Englād:
for though we are not come from thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to libertie, or from captiuitie to our
owne countrie, hauing many yeares vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our late Soueraigne enioyed both true
religion, and therewith, as the handmaid
waiting vpon her mistresse, all flourishing
peace: yet in respect of our deliuerance
from that danger to the state, which many
feared, the change of religiō in the church,
which some doubted, others desired, we
can no lesse wonder at the Lords strange
worke, and say with the Church of God:
<hi>The Lord hath done great things for vs,
whereof we reioyce,</hi> Psal. 126. 3.</p>
   <p>In this common ioy who shall forbidde
any to reioyce? and where Gods mercies
are so manifest and euident to all the
world, who can hold his peace? But as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
<pb facs="6"/>
are not acknowledged, where first
they are not well considered, nor due
thankes performed, where the grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
is not worthely esteemed: for this
cause haue I addressed this short treatise,
that Gods goodnesse to Israel might be
proclaimed, and that no man be ignorant
what God hath done for vs, that we again
be not negligent to doe to him, that which
becommeth vs, to giue vnto him thankes
and praise.</p>
   <p>Samuel, to disswade the people from al
their wanton desires to haue a king, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
God was yet their king, telleth them,
what the properties of their king shall be,
and how hardly he should vse them, and
how little pleasing vnto them his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was like to be. 1. Sam. 8. As he would
disswade from their vnthankefulnesse to
God in that headstrong request, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
vnto them the hard conditions
of their king: so mine intent is to perswade
to thankefulnesse to God, by setting forth
the princely and Christian endowements
of our gratious Soueraigne, and the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
benefits, which both Church and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth are sure by Gods grace to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
vnder his Maiesties godly &amp; vpright
regiment.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
For this cause haue I sorted out this 122.
Psalme, as seruing most fitly for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
occasion; which I haue deuided into
20. seuerall meditations, shewing so many
blessings vpon this Church and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
answerable to those which Israel
enioyed vnder Dauid.</p>
   <p>1. As Dauid appeased the strife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
him and the house of Saul,<note place="margin">The particular blessings in Israel vnder Dauid, &amp; in England like to be vnder his Maiestie.</note> and
brought all Israel to one gouernment,
which was before deuided: so these two
kingdomes of England and Scotland ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
beene long at variance, and exercised
in time past with long and bloodie bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,<note place="margin">The vniting of two kingdomes.</note>
are now vnited in one: His Maiestie
is the corner stone, that hath conioyned
these two walles togither.</p>
   <p>2. Vnder Dauid true religion was cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued:<note place="margin">Continuance o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> religion.</note>
and by our Soueraigne the faith of
the gospell by his Maiestie truely profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and in his princely bookes protested,
shall still be maintained.</p>
   <p>3. Dauid was a learned prince,<note place="margin">A iudicial and learned prince.</note> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diter
of heauenly songs and sonnets: And
God hath giuen vnto vs a wise and iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
king, whose princely writings do giue
him the preheminence before all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors:
another Salomon, a king and
yet an Ecclesiastes, a learned writer; such an
<pb facs="7"/>
one, as Gratian the Emperour was: of
whome Ambrose saith,<note place="margin">Epist. 25. ad Gratian.</note>
      <hi>Scripsisti tua totam
epistolam manu, vt ipsi apices fidem tuam pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>atem{que}
loquerentur: You haue written (not
an epistle onely) but whole bookes with your
hand, that the very points and letters doe
vtter your faith and pietie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>4. In Dauids time there was free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
to Gods house,<note place="margin">Free accesse to Gods house.</note>
      <hi>I reioyced when they
said, let vs goe vp, &amp;c</hi> And nowe the
doores of Protestants Churches shall be
as wide set open as euer.</p>
   <p>5. Then the faithfull one exhorted an
other saying,<note place="margin">Mutuall confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="3 letters">
            <desc>•••</desc>
         </gap>e.</note>
      <hi>Let vs goe vp to the house of
the Lord:</hi> And now may Christians goe
hand in hand, conferring freely and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
one another.</p>
   <p>6. Dauid in bringing home the Arke,<note place="margin">The example of the Prince.</note>
went before himselfe, and was an example
of godly zeale to his people: So it is our
Dauids godly precept to his princely
sonne, <hi>Teach your people by your example,</hi> p.
24. And such is the practise in his owne
royall person giuing light by his Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
life to all his subiects.</p>
   <p>7. Before Dauids time religion was
vnsetled,<note place="margin">Religion s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>led.</note> the Arke was flitting from place
to place, but he brought it to Hierusalem,
where it staied; and therefore he saith, <hi>Our
<pb facs="7"/>
feete shall stand in thy gates, O Jerusalem:</hi> and
nowe whereas many feared an alteration
of religion at the next change, we verely
hope, that the Gospell hath set sure foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the Church of England, which
both by his Maiestie while he liueth,
(whose happie raigne God in his mercie
many yeares prolong) and by his roiall
posteritie walking in his steppes, we trust
shall be continued to the end of the world:
wherein his highnesse also hath deliuered
his sound iudgement, and constant resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō:
<hi>That in the last estate</hi> (when the church
is deliuered from the thraldome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ)
<hi>without any more generall mutations,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Meditat. vpon the 20. of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelat.</note>
      <hi>the world shall remaine to the consummation
and end of the same.</hi>
      <note place="margin">p. 3. art. 8.</note>
   </p>
   <p>8. Vnder Dauid the cittie flourished,
beeing enlarged with goodly and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
buildings:<note place="margin">Encrease of wealth.</note>
      <hi>Ierusalem was a cittie well
compact and built togither.</hi> And nowe also
we hope by Gods mercie, that men shall
plant vineyards and eate the fruit thereof,
build houses, and dwell in them.</p>
   <p>9. Dauid was brought vp to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
with the ioynt consent of all Israel,
who said,<note place="margin">The generall cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and desire of all.</note>
      <hi>we are thy bones and thy flesh,</hi> 2.
Sam. 5. 1. And it is admirable to consider
the generall resolution of all English peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb facs="8"/>
and the coniunction of their hearts &amp;
affections, both of high and lowe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
their Soueraigne.</p>
   <p>10. Then, the tribes of Israel were not
onely vnited in one kingdome, but were
reconciled among themselues vnited also
in one religion: <hi>thither the tribes went vp,
&amp;c.</hi> So not onely externall warres are like
for euer to cease betweene these two nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Vniformitie in religion.</note>
but one vniforme religion shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
containe them in perfect loue and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:
that neither the Church of Scotland
shall be iealous of the English Church, as
inclining in some things to poperie; nor
the English suspect the other, as affecting
a popular paritie: but as louing sisters &amp;
fellow tribes shall hold one worshippe of
God, and go vp to Ierusalem togither.</p>
   <p>11. <hi>Dauid expelled the Iebusites, not
admitting contrarie religion in Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Religion sincere without mixture.</note>
      <hi>And it is no doubt, but that God will
so direct our Dauids heart, that religion
shall be sincerely professed among vs,
without any mixture or toleration: as his
Maiestie most godly professeth thus;</hi> Is
there not nowe a sincere profession of the truth
among vs in this Isle,<note place="margin">Meditat vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>5. of the 1. of Chron in the applica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</note> oppugned by the nations
about, haters of the holy word? and doe we not
also as Israel professe one onely God ruled by
<pb facs="8"/>
his pure word onel? yon the other part, are they
not as Philistims,<note place="margin">Meditat vpon 20. of the reuelat. 3. p. art. 1.</note> adorers of legions of gods,
and ruled by the foolish traditions of men?
<hi>And again in another place,</hi> We must feare
to fall from the trueth reuealed and professed
by vs, that we may be free from the like pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
&amp;c.</p>
   <p>12. Dauid reformed many things that
were amisse in Israel, he appointed the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites
their courses and seruices, that were
farre out of order. Our zealous Dauid
hath giuen vs great hope of the like, who
in his princely treatise,<note place="margin">Reformation of things amisse. Preface to the Reader. <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> Queene Elizabeth
then liuing, thus writeth: <hi>I doubt nothing,
yea in her name I dare promise, by the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past
experience of her happie gouernment, that
no good subiect shall be more carefull to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
her of any corruptions stollen into her
state, then shee shall be zealous, for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of her conscience and honour, to see
the same purged and restored to the auntient
integritie: and further during her time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
me least of any to meddle in it, &amp;c</hi>
That which his Maiestie promised in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of our late Soueraigne, God shall
direct his wisdome to performe by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
the dealing wherin before, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his princely modestie to call <hi>medling,</hi>
so nowe the whole <hi>managing</hi> thereof of
<pb facs="9"/>
right appertaineth vnto him.</p>
   <p>13. In Dauids time there was both
publikely and priuately a free entercourse
of religion,<note place="margin">Praising of God.</note> the praises of God were in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
mans mouth: <hi>The tribes went vp to
praise the name of the Lord.</hi> Their seruice
was not mute and dumbe, but the temple
did ring and sound againe of Gods prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
And thankes be to God, that the
Church of England is not forced to hang
their instruments of praise vpon the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
with the Israelites in Babylon, and
to intermit the comfortable exercise of
thankesgiuing, as it hath happened in
some changes, but that we haue as great
cause, &amp; as much libertie as euer, to sound
out Gods praises: that we may say with the
prophet,<note place="margin">Psal. 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. v. 2.</note>
      <hi>thē was our mouth filled with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and our tongue with ioy.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>14. Then <hi>were the thrones set for iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and it is Gods mercie, that hath not
giuen vs ouer to the cruell desire of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,<note place="margin">Seates of iustice, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>

that the course of iustice is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted,
but the lawe and seates of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
open for euery man; whose heart do
not his Maiesties princely speeches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue,
thus writing to his noble sonne,
<hi>Preasse to drawe all your lawes and proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

      <note place="margin">p. 9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>and as plaine as you can, &amp;c.

wearie not to heare the complaints of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,

   </p>
   <p>15. <hi>Euen the thrones of Dauid:</hi>
      <note place="margin">A prince no strā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, 15. Benefit.</note> God
gaue Israel no stranger to raigne ouer
them, but one of their owne kinred: And
the Lord hath raised vnto vs a Soueraigne
descended of Dauids stocke, of the royall
blood of the kings of this land; a prince of
the same language, of the Island, of the
English royall blood; yea of the same reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
who, as he is no forrainer, so giueth
counsell to his princely heire,<note place="margin">pag. 55.</note>
      <hi>To haue ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
councels and iustice seates in euery king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
of their owne countrimen.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>16. Dauid would haue euery one <hi>pray
for the peace of Ierusalem,</hi> and not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
it: So, whereas the peace of our
Church hath beene hindred by the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of strange and newe doctrines,<note place="margin">Consent in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> our
hope is, that our Dauid will restore the
peace of the Church, and bring vs to one
vniforme doctrine; whose princely aduice
is,<note place="margin">Pag. 10. l. 1.</note>
      <hi>That if any doe vrge to imbrace their owne
fantasies in the place of Gods word, &amp;c. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
them for vaine men, &amp;c, &amp; graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and with authoritie redact them into order
againe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>17. <hi>Peace be within thy walls:</hi> The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
vnder Dauid were freed from the
<pb facs="10"/>
feare of the enemie:<note place="margin">Externall peace.</note> they needed not to set
watchmen vpon their towers, and garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
vpon their walls. So we trust to haue
peace abroad with other nations: who if
they will be wonne with kindnesse: we
haue a prince that will vse all other princes
<hi>as brethren,</hi>
      <note place="margin">p. 56. <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note>
      <hi>honestly and kindly, and will striue
with euery one of them in curtesie and thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.</hi>
But if they be readie to offend our
nation,<note place="margin">p. 55. <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> we haue a couragious defender,
<hi>that will reuenge and free his subiects from al
forraine iniuries done vnto them.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>18. In Dauids time, plentie and peace
was within their pallaces and houses: and
now we trust,<note place="margin">18. benefit, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall peace and plentie.</note> that euen our children shall
haue cause to blesse this day, wherby they
may obtaine godly education, not distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from their parents by iniquitie of the
times, which was feared, and might haue
iustly befallen vs: that we may say as it is in
the Psalme: <hi>Our sonnes shall grow vp as plāts,
and our daughters as the polished corners of
the temple,</hi> Psal. 144. 12.</p>
   <p>19. <hi>Dauid wisheth all good to Israel
because they were his brethren and neig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:</hi>
      <note place="margin">A louing prince.</note>
      <hi>God hath sent vs a louing prince:</hi>
Who as our naturall father and kinde master,<note place="margin">p. 25. <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note>
thinketh his greatest contentment standeth in
his subiects prosperitie, and his greatest suretie
<pb facs="10"/>
in hauing their hearts.</p>
   <p>20. <hi>Dauid cheifly because of Gods
house procureth the peace of Hierusalem:
Such is the zeale and affection of our Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
to Gods house:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Loue of Gods Church.</note>
      <hi>who holdeth</hi> that the
cheife vertue which should be in a Christian
prince,<note place="margin">Meditat. in 15. 1. Chro. part. 2.</note> namely feruencie and constant zeale to
promoote the glorie of God that hath honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him. <hi>And concerning the Ministers of

   <p>These singular mercies extented to the

And in trueth not only these, but
many other blessings, with a full horne the

   <p>Thus our Iosua well remembreth the
wordes of the Lord vnto that valiant

depart out of thy mouth, but meditate
therein day and night, that thou maiest

degree then or calling is there in the land,
which hath not great cause to reioyce in
the aduancement of so worthie a prince?
I speake not this (God is my record) to
please by glozing speach, for I should so
rather displease; his Maiesties mind herein
is well knowne: <hi>loue them best, that are
plainest with you. p.</hi> 71. but I trust I may
speake the truth without flatterie, and all
the world, I thinke will witnesse with me,
that I haue not fabled. It is fit that Gods
<pb facs="13"/>
graces vpon his Maiestie, and mercies
therein toward vs should be proclaimed
and published, that his highnesse may
thereby be stirred vp to proceed and goe
forward, and the people prouoked to be
thankefull. As herein no nation hath grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cause to ioy then England, to whome
God hath giuen a prince respectiue to all
sorts and degrees in their places, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their necessities: who herein
may be compared with Eliakim, <hi>to a sure
naile, wherevpon all vessels both small and
great doe hang, euen from the cuppes to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of musicke,</hi> Isay. 22. 13. 24. And as
Ambrose applieth that saying in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles:<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Virgini.</note>
      <hi>Species eius sunt cedrus Lebani, quae
ramum nubib., radicem in terris inserit; in

is like the Cedar of Lebanus, which stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the branches to heauen, and the roote to
the earth: so beeing in high estate he respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
the lowly.</hi> I trust of such a prince
England may more truly pronounce, then
Rome of Scipio▪ <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>that Rome could not

through Gods gratious fauour
shall not miscarrie, as long as his Maiestie
liueth.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="13"/>
But because perseuerance is Gods gift,
and there is no mortall nature, but is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to chaunge, it is our part to pray vnto
God, to giue strength and grace to our
Christian prince, to hold out in this godly
course, and that his Maiestie be not snared
or intangled with this great honour,
wealth, and prosperitie, to the which the
Lord hath aduanced him, but may take
heed by the example of the fall of Dauid,
the backsliding of Salomon, the declining
of Asa, that he forget not the lord his god,
that hath exalted him: which by Gods
grace we doubt not, as his highnesse hath
herein <hi>a firme trust</hi> (thus professing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe)
<hi>that it shall please God,</hi>

And God giue vs the people of
