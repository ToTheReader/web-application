seeing your L. to be a Patron of all martiall men, and a <hi>Moece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
of such as apply themselues to studie: wearing with <hi>Pallas</hi> both
the launce and the bay, and aiming with <hi>Augustus</hi> at the fauour of

I presumed to shrowd it vnder your Honors patronage, as one that is
the faut or and fauourer of all vertuous actions: and whose honorable
Loues growne from the generall applause of the whole common-welth

for your higher desertes, may keepe it from the mallice of euery bitter
toong. Other reasons more particular (right Honourable) chalenge
in me a speciall affection to your Lordshippe, as being a Scholler with
your two noble sonnes, Maister <hi>Edmund Carew,</hi> and M. <hi>Robert
Carew,</hi> (two siens worthy of so honorable a tree, and a tree glorious in
such honourable fruite) as also beeing scholler in the Vniuersitie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that learned and vertuous Knight Sir <hi>Edward Hobby,</hi> when he
was Batcheler in Artes, a man as well lettered as well borne and after
the Etymologie of his name soaring as high as the winges of knowledge
can mount him, happie euery way, and the more fortunate, as blessed in
the honor of so vertuous a Lady. Thus (right Honourable) tie duetie
that I owe to the sonnes, chargeth me that all my affection be placed on
the father: for where the braunches are so pretious, the tre<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
