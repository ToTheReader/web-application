Doctour of Physicke to a gentleman, by whom it was published : The former part conteineth rules for the preseruation of health, and preuenting of all diseases vntill extreme olde age. Herein is inserted the authours opinion of tabacco. The latter is a discourse of emperiks or vnlearned physitians, wherein is plainly prooued that the practise of all those which haue not beene brought vp in the grammar and vniuersity, is alwayes confused, commonly dangerous, and often deadly</title>

   <head>THE PVBLISHER to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, let it not seeme strange that I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish vnto thee a priuate letter. There are three principall causes which haue moued me hereunto: First, a world of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples both of moderne and ancient Writers, whose epistles, perhaps priuatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as this was, haue now their publike vse. Secondly, my loue vnto the Authour, a man deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing loue of all, but specially of me, vnto whom I am beholding (next vnto God) for that health which Ienioy. Thirdly, the woorth of the worke it selfe; wherein, looke not for hyperbolicall phrases, or curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affectation: for as in his life he preferreth deeds before words, so in his writings shalt thou finde more substance than shewes. Yet so hath he ioyned
<pb facs="3"/>
profit with pleasure, sound discourse with sweet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; that (if my loue deceiueth me not, and some learned Physicians, who at my request haue perused it) as the Poet sayth, <hi>Omne tulit punctum.</hi> His rules of health (vnto those that will be ruled by them) are full of health: his discouery of bastard Physicians will make wisemen beware: their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, their arrogancie, their rashnesse is here layd open: not with iesting termes (for that he accounteth no lesse than an artificiall iniury) but with such eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonstrations, as he that hereafter shall know them, and will not eschew them, shall be deemed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to his own ouerthrow. I haue named the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part <hi>Healths Preseruatiue,</hi> and the latter, <hi>A Discourse of Empiricks and vnlearned Physicians.</hi> I wish as much good to come vnto thee by this my friends labour, as was meant vnto my selfe. Be thine owne friend. Take heed of Empiricks. And so farewell.</p>
