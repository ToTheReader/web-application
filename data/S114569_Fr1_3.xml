   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the just
saying of an
Ancient, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere
grata
commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione
decet scientiae pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem;</hi>
It is comely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
with thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
the Father of our
knowledge. If this be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
due from man unto man,
how much more due is it
from man unto God? For
though man be called the
<pb facs="5"/>
father of those that are
taught by him,<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 21.</note> yet God is
the Father of those fathers;
even a Teacher of those
teachers: and therefore by
our Saviours judgement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
only the name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in perfection and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.
Those then that have
God to be a Father of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to them, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to this Father the
praise and glorie of this
knowledge. The heavenly
gifts of God, when they
move kindly and naturally,
doe move like the Heavens,
in a circular motion; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to that place and
point from which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb facs="5"/>
first to move; from God
unto God. They come from
him as graces, and returne
to him in the shape of glorie.</p>
   <p>Accordingly, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a measure of grace
from this heavenly Teacher,
by which I am what I am,
I could not but acknowledge
it, and by this acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
returne him glorie for
grace. And because I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
also that others may
have the like grace, that
God also from others may
have the like glorie, I testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
to others that which I
have felt and seene. I have
evidently seene and felt,
that men are taught of God;
<pb facs="6"/>
and so there is a third school
for the Students of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And as they passe from
the Countrey-schoole to the
Universitie, so should they
yet mount higher to a third,
even a Celestiall Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.
And certainly, as the
second excels the first, so &amp;
much more doth the third
excell the second.</p>
   <p>Some perchance may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
with the Servant, Son,
and Heire of the Great <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah;</hi>
Hold your peace, I
know it already. Yet those
that know it, will not envie
that it be told to those that
know it not. There are sons
of the Prophets that must
<pb facs="6"/>
grow up like young plants in
the house of the Lord; and
those have a time when they
know it not, and this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
may meet with that
time. Yea there may be
some Masters in Israel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whose eares perchance it
hath passed, but not entered
into their hearts, that as a
man must be borne, so hee
must be taught from above.
And if this naile be driven
beyond hearing, into know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
experience, and taste,
I hope no man will be sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
for such a gaine. Besides,
too true and common it is,
that the naturall heart of
man willingly lies downe
<pb facs="7"/>
and takes up its rest in the
abilities of Nature; and
fetcheth oracles from thence
(the cause of so many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and differences the
consequences of errours) and
therefore hath it need of
such goads to awake it, and
to make it open the eye and
eare to this heavenly Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</p>
   <p>It is most true, that those
who have not beene taught
in this higher schoole of
Grace, but onely in the lower
of Nature, cannot well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that which they
know not; this schoole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
best learned, known, and
acknowledged, by those
<pb facs="7"/>
whom it most teacheth. And
those who have beene well
taught there, doe well know,
that Christians are herein
better than their neighbors,
even than the best of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
because they are taught
by God, the best, most trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent,
and infallible Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.
The heavenly Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
teacheth them both
what and how to beleeve;
he gives them his heavenly
truths contained in his
Word; and gives them
withall an heavenly mind
to discerne, beleeve, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them. And thus while
a Christian holds his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by an heavenly hand, &amp;
<pb facs="8"/>
both are given him by an
heavenly Teacher: a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
tenure of religion is
far more noble, excellent,
and assured than that of
the Pagan. A Christian
thus taught from above, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves
and worships what
he knowes, whereas the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
worships what hee
knowes not; even that
which be hath received only
by the way of Nature, from
naturall, deceived, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
men: But the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
hath a spirit from God
in Christ Iesus (for if any
man have not the spirit of
Christ, he is not Christs) and
this Spirit gives him a
<pb facs="8"/>
spiritual eye, which an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
hath not; and yet this
eye alone, can truly and
kindly discerne and see
spirituall and heavenly
truths. And for this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
eye, which the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
hath from the Spirit of
God, the Heathens and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans
may say among
themselves of a Christian,
as once an Heathen King
said to his Heathen Subjects
of <hi>Joseph: Can wee find
such a man as this? a man
in whom is the Spirit of
God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And that such Christians
may abound, is the end of
this work, which for ought I
<pb facs="9"/>
know, hath not beene over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought,
nor thereby made
superfluous and unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the present age.<note place="margin">Socin.</note> I
wish that fetching heavenly
knowledge from carnall
reason and humane wit,
have not made it too seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
Yet to turn men back
the more willingly from
this counter-course, I have
brought forth patternes of
some, who have taught and
professed a deniall of their
own wits and reasons, though
acute and excellent; and
have (as it were) quenched
their owne naturall lamps,
that they might get them
kindled above by the Father
<pb facs="9"/>
of lights. Yea, thus did
sundry of them, even in
those times, when humane
wit and reason had made too
great a mixture with the
mysteries of Divinitie. Yet
then did God preserve the
soveraigntie of his owne
light in eminence and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
by the homage of these
mens confessions, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
to that light. And
if such high thoughts and
imaginations (that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
doe most exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
taught of God) doe
thus submit unto it, the
lower should not be high
when the higher are low.</p>
