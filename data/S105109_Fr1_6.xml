         <pb facs="6"/> begotten of a Turkish Stalian that was 24. yéeres of age, and I neuer found in all my life a better horse both for trauel and seruice.</p>
      <p>As touching your mares that you mind to bréed vpō, the larger they are, the better: but if you chaunce to haue any yong mares that you mind to breed vpon, take héed that you first make them to be ridde and handled the 3. yeare, and that you put not them to the horse til they be 4. yeres of age, and it shal be good to handle them gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to let them haue daily erercise in some moderate trauel, for if you let them stand long stil, you shal great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weaken their bodies, and by sodaine &amp; extreme tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling of them after long rest, al fil them ful of disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, so as they shall be verie vnprofitable for a race: for it is not possible to bréed sound colts, vpō vnsound mares and Stalians. Let them also be of good shape &amp; colour: but the shape is much more to be taken héed of, than the colour, for that it is much holpen by the Stalian, &amp; when you would put them to the horse, the best way is, in my iudgement, to let thē run togither at grasse for the space of a month at the least. And see that your mares haue no shooes on their hinder féet, for feare of hurting your Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, and let not your Stalian be too fat, and he woulde also be trauelled a iourney before you turne him out, to the end that he may be wearie, so shall he not ouer-heat himself at the first: and the best time of the daie to turne him out, is, in the morning fasting verie early before the heate of the daie, &amp; afterward, when he hath heated himselfe, the warmnes of the Sun shal come, by means whereof he shall not take any cold: if he driue him selfe into any heat, it shal be good to cause a boy to folow him vp and downe, so as he may not rest till he be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly colde. It shall not be amisse before that you turne your mares and Stalian togither, to trie whether they wil stand still or not to the horse, by offering them some other nag or stoned iade, and if you sée they stand stil, thē
<pb facs="6"/> are they not in horsing: yet haue I séene some iades, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mad on horsing that would strike the Stalian, and yet after they had béene a little wearie, would stand still inough. But if you haue more such conuenient ground, than may you let your Stalian serue your mares, either in the hand, or else in some large barne or close court. But you must put them togither earely in the morning, and late at night, and sée y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> your Stalian be not too ful for feare of hurting himself, &amp; let him be well prouendred.</p>

   <div n="weaning colts" type="part">
      <head>How to weane your Colts.</head>
      <p>PVt them so farre from your mares as they cannot one heare another, into some warme groūd, wher there is good store of long and swéet grasse, and til they be two yeares of age it shall be good to féede them all the winter with fine haie abroad: for by kéeping your coltes at house in the winter, you shall marre them for lacke of exercise. For there is not anie one thing more enimie to health both for man and beast, whether he be yong or olde, than the lacke of such exercise as shall be most agréeing with the qualitie of his age and strength. But if it be in such part of <hi>England,</hi> as the snowe lieth vpon the grounde a moneth or sixe wéekes togither, it shal not be amisse to take thē into the house al the night to let them eate: but in the daie time I would haue you turne them abroad, euen from morning till night, but it were much better to make a house in the field, and place a double racke in the middle thereof: but sée that you paue such on house, or grauell it: for if you plancke it, it shall be verie dangerous for marring your colts, by sly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereon: and if you paue it not, it shall be al myrie, which is verie naught for your colts hoofs and legs, for the drier that they go, &amp; the harder that the ground is, the sounder shall your horse be. It shall be good also the first Summer that your colts be weined, that is to say, when they are a yeare olde and the vantage, that if you shal perceiue by going in good pasture y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> they shal wax
<pb facs="7"/> verie fat, then it shall not be amisse to eate the pasture shorter with more cattell, or else to put them in suche ground as they may trauel somthing more to fil their bellies. This order shal you obserue the first two yéers, but the third yeare it shall be good to put them in some such high ground and short pasture, that they may trauel almost the whole daie before they fill their bellies, and take héede that they haue trées or hedges to shadow them in in the heate of the daie, and also to defend them from the cold in winter: and when you perceiue them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pinched with the cold, you may giue them straw &amp; chaffe to eate vntill it be the beginning of March at the least, then it shal be good to take them into the house for the space of a moneth, or six wéeks, &amp; giue them straw to eate, &amp; chaffe, with a verie litle prouēder in it. But if you haue no chaffe, thē it shal be good to giue thē two parts of chopt straw, &amp; but one part of oats, &amp; whē you haue made them gētle to be drest, it shalbe good to leade them to the water, first with a double cloth girded with a surcingle, &amp; after that they will go gently, you may saddle them, and leade them to the water, with the stirroppes loose, beating against their sides, but take héed y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> al the while they stand in the stable, you lay litter inough vnder thē for feare of sliding: &amp; after you haue made them gentle to go with the saddle, it shall be good to turne them abroad euery day when it is drie weather at 9. of the clock til 3. at afternoone into some field or large court nigh to the stable. If at any time after they are throughly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the stable, they come not home of thēselues, fetch thē not til through hunger they be glad to come. By this means you shal defend your horses when they are yong from sickenesse and diseases, through exercising them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues on this wise, so as when they come to trauel, they shall be sound &amp; durable horses: By this y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> I haue said, I would haue said, that til your coltes b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Summer &amp; winter, let thē fare somewhat harder than they did the 2. first yeres, &amp; the 3. winter I wold haue you offer thē no hard meat, til they be glad to eat straw &amp; chaffe, &amp; that you giue thē no other thing y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> yere nor y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> 4. winter neither, til such time as you take thē vp: but it shall be good the 4. winter to exercise them sadled with a pole or long staffe, without anie man on his back, as shall be héereafter more plainly taught.</p>

         <p>If I let mine horse be almost 5. yeares of age before I back him, he shall become so strong &amp; stubburn as no mā shall bée able to handle him, &amp; also if I let him go abroad till he be glad to féed vpon strawe &amp; chaffe, he shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leane, therefore I would thinke it much better to take vp mine horse in the beginning of Winter before he loose his flesh.</p>

         <p>Where thou saist thy horse will become stubburne,
<pb facs="8"/> thou art deceiued, for by trotting him sadled with a long pole the third and fourth winter, euerie second daie, so long as he shall stand in the stable, in such order as shal be héereafter taught, thou shalt make him so gentle as thou wouldest wish: &amp; thou saiest he shall become leane, and that thou thinkest it better to take him vp at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of winter, this is a dreame me thinkes indéed of an vnskilfull man, but I wil not féed thée with vaine things, but with experience grounded vpon reason: for if thou take vp thy horse in the beginning of winter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he haue tasted of anie hardnesse, thou shalt neuer make him a good stable horse, for whiles the grasse is better then haie, it is not possible that he should eat haie well, but after the substance of the grasse is gone, so that it nourishes so little as good strawe or chaffe, &amp; that the horse will féed therevpon verie well, then it is time to take him vp &amp; not before, for there is no other reason to be found why our horses shuld not eate straw, but that we take them vp while they are so greasie fat &amp; idle by féeding them in déep pasturs where they may fill their bellies in two or thrée houres féeding, whereas in deed it were a great deale better after they be two yeres of age to let them go in such pasture, as they must trauaile al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most halfe the daie before they can fill their bellies. And whereas thou saiest they shall become leane, I warrant thée they shall become neuer a whit the worse therfore, for although thou ride him euerie second daie gentlie, so that he sweat not, thou shalt within one moneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he comes to the house, by féeding him with good straw and reasonable store of prouender haue fullie recouered the former losse, which shal redound to thy double gain, for that he shall euer after be a good stable horse, that if he lacke meate at anie time, ye shall sée him eate his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with greater appetite than our daintie dieted iades bred as we vsuallie doe héere in <hi>England,</hi> shall eate the best haie that you can giue them.</p>
