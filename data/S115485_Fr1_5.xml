      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>OB, tryed of God, by the losse of his Children, Goods and Health, is tempted by his Friends to despaire, and by his Wife to blasphemie; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, continues patient for a while; but at last yeelds to Passion, curses his birth-day, and wishes death. His Wife and three Friends condemne him of Hypocrisie; <hi>Iob</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends his speeches, Gods Iustice, and his owne Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie, blaming his Friends for handling Gods cause to an ill end, and for accusing him without a cause. At length <hi>Elihu</hi> makes a modest agreement betweene them, reprooues them al; him, for not handling a good cause well; and them, for handling a bad cause, though well. Hee teaches <hi>Iob</hi> Gods greatnesse by his works, and that man ought not to pleade with his Maker. In fine, God himselfe out of a Cloud, confirmes <hi>Elihu's</hi> words, by example from his workes, puts <hi>Iob</hi> to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, to confession and repentance, rebukes his three Friends, commands reconciliation, restores <hi>Iob</hi> his Health, doubles his former Wealth, and giues him a second Issue of his body.</p>
