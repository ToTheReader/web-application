   <head>¶ Loue and Liue.</head>
   <head>¶ To the Right worshipfull Esquier maister Iohn Yong, Grace and health.</head>
   <p>I Haue penned for your master<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ships pleasure one of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which maister Streamer tolde the last Christmas, and which you so faine wold haue heard reported by master Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res him selfe. And although I be vnable to penne or speake it so pleasantly as he could, yet haue I so nerely vsed both the order and wordes of him that spake them, which is not the least vertue of a reporter that I doubt not but that he and maister VVillot shal in the reading thinke they heare master Strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer speake, and he him selfe in the like acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall doubt whether he speaketh or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. I haue deuided his oration into three partes, and put the argument before them, and an instruction after them with such notes as might be gathered therof: so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it booke like, and intituled. <hi>Be ware the Cat.</hi> But because I doubt whether master Streamer wilbe contented that other men plowe with his oxen, I meane penne such thinges as he speaketh, which perhaps hee
<pb facs="4"/>
would rather do him selfe to haue (as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth) the glory of both therfore I besech you to learne his mind herein. And if he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree it passe in such sorte, yet that he peruse it before the Printing, and amend it if in any poynt I haue mistaken him. I pray you likewise to aske master Ferres his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein, and shewe him that the cure of the great plague of master Sreamers translation out of the Arabicke, which hee sent me from Margets, shalbe Imprinted assone as I may conueniently. And it I shall perceaue by your tryall, that master Strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer allowe my endeuours in this kinde, I will hereafter as Plato did by Socrates penne such things out of the rest of our Christmas communications, as shalbe to his great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and no lesse pleasure to all them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire such kinds of knowledge. In the meane while I besech you accept my good will, and learne to beware the Cat. So shal you not only performe that I seke but also please the Almightie who alwayes pres you:</p>
   <closer>Amen.</closer>
