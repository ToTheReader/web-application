                 <title>Distractions, or The holy madnesse : Feruently (not furiously) inraged against euill men; or against their euills. Wherein the naughty are discouered to themselues, and others: and may here see at once, who they are; what they doe; and how they ought. Somewhat delightfull, but fruitfull altogether: as ordered to please a little; but aymed to profit much. By Iohn Gaule, vtrusque olim Academiæ</title>

         <q rend="inline large">Haue J need of mad men?</q>
      </hi>
      <pb n="2" facs="16"/> Not one inferres with FESTVS; <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">Much Learning doth make thee mad.</q>
      </hi> Whether you haue need of the Former; Sure I am, I haue need of the Other, and to no other end. I tell you true, I want Wit to be out of my Wits. <hi>It is other than Folly, and Rage, is required to an Holy Madnesse.</hi> Nay but I may take those Two vnto me; for I am Mad outright. I had as good say it, as heare it. They haue likewise said, of
<pb n="3" facs="16"/> Other, and better than I. <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">Haue I need of mad men, that yee haue brought this Fellow, to play the Mad man in my presence?</q>
      </hi> said the gabbling King of GATH, of One that wisely assumed such Behauiour for his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Safety. <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came this Mad Fellow to thee?</q>
      </hi> said the <hi>Seruants</hi> to IEHV, touching the Prophet, that came about a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse of Weight and
<pb n="4" facs="17"/> Worth: <hi>This Mad Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low </hi> (say they) and <hi>wherefore came hee?</hi> Though (as it was told them) they knew both the <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">Man,</q>
      </hi> and his <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">Communication.</q>
         <q rend="inline large">
            <hi>PAVL!</hi> Thou art beside thy selfe:</q>
      </hi> said a new Succeeding, and (perhaps) a new Gaping <hi>Gouernour;</hi> to <hi>One</hi> that well answered for himselfe: <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">I am not mad; but speake forth the words of Truth, &amp; Sobernesse.</q>
      </hi>
      <pb n="5" facs="17"/> And (which I abhorre to repeat) the worst in this wise, was said of <hi>Him,</hi> that was the best of All: <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">Hee hath a Deuill, and is mad.</q> Wicked men, and witlesse; iudge of Others, and Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by themselues. Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are Gracelesse; and the rest (they thinke) are Reasonlesse. The Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome they apprehend not, they say, is Folly. Hee does Foolishly, that does beside their Drift. Hee talkes Nonsense, that speakes beyond their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.
<pb n="6" facs="18"/> The Feruent (with them) are Furious: They count of Zeale, but as Rage: And the Saints Earnestnesse, they call his Madnesse. <hi>HANNAH</hi> is Deuout; and is so thought <hi>DRVNKEN:</hi> And They were said to bee <q rend="inline large">Full of new Wine;</q> that were filled with the <q rend="inline large">Holy Ghost.</q> Be a man Deuout or Zealous; the world will deeme him either Drunke, or Mad.</hi> Are ye so Mad; to think and say so madly of vs? yours (if any) is the
<pb n="7" facs="18"/> Madnesse: Why nure yee others with your owne Brand? Marke but who hath marked you: <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">I will smite thee with Madnesse.</q>
      </hi> The <hi>Wise Man</hi> said it of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men; <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">Madnesse is in their heart, while they liue.</q>
      </hi> Take now your Tongues from vs; turne them against your selues. You had as good yeeld to confesse at first; as you shall bee constrained at last: <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">We Fooles coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="8" facs="19"/> his life Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</q>
      </hi> Themselues are Mad; and they call vs so: that are not Mad, saue mad at them. Shall I moane mee with him in the COMEDIAN? <hi>Ay me! they say I am Mad; when none so mad, as they.</hi> No. As the PSALMIST rather: <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">J said vnto the Fooles, deale not so madly:</q>
      </hi> Then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they would not make me Mad. I enioy their Madnesse, while I seeke to shunne it:
<pb n="9" facs="19"/> Let them care to heed it, and they may doe so by mine.</p>
   <p>But (as I tell you) I haue taken vpon mee, to play the Mad man. Though not with Him, that did so, for his owne safeguard: but so to saue others, haue I done it. As was said of their Ignorance, and Delusion: so let mee say according to my Knowledge, and Zeale: <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">The Prophet is a Foole, the Spirituall Man is Mad; for
<pb n="10" facs="20"/> the multitude of thine Iniquity, and the great Hatred.</q>
      </hi> In my sense; a Foole, and Mad am I: for the great Hatred I haue to thine Iniquitie. My Aime is, and therefore my hope is, I may here say with Him: <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee bee besides our selues, it is to God: or whether we be Sober, it is for your Cause.</q> I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different what I seeme to be, so it be for Gods glory,
<pb n="11" facs="20"/> and his Childrens Good.</hi> The truth then is; I am (as I ought) thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straught: For I am both Warranted, and Vrged to it.</p>
   <p>Warranted. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Holy men, (as they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded) haue gone vp and downe, some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, some Chained, some Loaded, some Wounded: One in a passion, lets fall the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> Another on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose breakes his <hi>Bottles.</hi> One will needs haue another to smite him,
<pb n="12" facs="21"/> Another cannot but must needs smite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusted their Heads, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smeared their Faces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slauered their Beards: They scrabbled with their Fingers, tore their Haires, rent their Cloathes; and (like Mad Men) threw dust into the aire. <hi>The Saints of God haue beene some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times possessed with a Diuine Fury. Our stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest Motions, &amp; Gestures (such as men commonly mocke, and irke) God oft times both bids, and
<pb n="13" facs="21"/> likes. Euen the Vncouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Abruptnesse, of our both Passions, and Actions, serue to discouer our Zeale, our Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our Deuotion.</hi> The <hi>Prophet</hi> tooke him a TILE, pourtrayed the CITY, laid a SIEGE, built a FORT, cast a MOVNT, and set a CAMPE against it. He likewise CVT OFF his Haire, WEIGHED his Haire, DIVIDED his Haire: BVRNT a part in the Fire, SMOTE a part with a Knife, SCATTERED a part
<pb n="14" facs="22"/> in the Wind; and BOVND a Remuant in his Skirts. This was (may I say) a mysticall kind of Madnesse. To haue seene him thus writing vpon a <hi>Tile;</hi> thus busied about his <hi>Haire:</hi> who would not haue thought him mad, that knew not what hee meant? <hi>Hee that hath made the Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish things of this world to confute the Wise; hath his good Purposes, in the idle Acts, and (as wee would thinke) but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth and abrupt Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours
<pb n="15" facs="22"/> of men. In the Foolishnesse of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as of our Preachings, hath God his wise Art, and Ends. God hath stirred vp weake Actions in his Saints and Seruants; so to stirre vp the weake. Those Practices of theirs that haue borne shew of Weaknesse in their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; were not without Worth in their Meaning; and haue had Weight in their Effect.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Vrged. None but Stocks, but may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: Especially, <hi>how ought wee to be vrged
<pb n="16" facs="23"/> against Iniquities?</hi> I haue cause enough to make mee mad: Nay, should I be so, so oft as I haue cause; I should neuer be but mad. <hi>How vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet shall he be (yea euen vncessantly so) the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whose owne Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions must depend vpon others Euils? What mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall it be, in which there will not be to moue him? Besides himselfe; euen all are alwayes ready to prouoke him. Vnhappy he! when so many mad him.</hi> I could (with Others) haue been Sad,
<pb n="17" facs="23"/> and Merry; but I haue chosen (by my Selfe) to bee Mad at Euills. While <hi>Iehu</hi> comes vp against <hi>Iezabel;</hi> what should he but <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">Driue Furiously?</q>
      </hi> but (as there) march on in <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">Madnesse?</q>
      </hi> There is a mad Knot of Euills in the World; and they aske a mad Wedge to sunder them. I will (and spare not) both Launce, and Seare: Nor shal the Diseased howle, and bawle at mee; but rather thanke himselfe.
<pb n="18" facs="24"/>
      <hi>An intemperate Patient, and obstinate, makes, and needs a Physitian both hard and harsh.</hi> I am sorry for <hi>Heraclitus;</hi> that was so Sad him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: because others (hee saw) were Bad. Shall euery Bad man, make mee a Sad man? When (I maruell) shall hee be Merry; whom others Euill may afflict? This were to hurt my selfe, and doe them no good. Alas too tender <hi>Philosopher!</hi> himselfe was to be wept for; that so wept for others.
<pb n="19" facs="24"/> I laugh (in like manner) at <hi>Democritus,</hi> that moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Philosopher;</hi> that made such lests at mens Earnests. How should I thinke him serious; that thought all ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous? I rather like (with <hi>Lampsacus</hi>) to mix both, and fall a Madding: to put vpon mee the very Face of a Fury: and (as a Spie come from Hell) to giue the Deuils notice of mens mischieuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. <hi>There are Euils in the world, to be Sad at, Merry at, Mad at. Wee cannot but waile at mens
<pb n="20" facs="25"/> Miseries, but smile at their Vanities, but rage at their Iniquities. Errours may prouoke vs; but Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties will inrage.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Aske now no more with <hi>Achish;</hi> I answer you at once; You haue all need of Mad men. The Diuine Fury is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy against you; The Furies of Hell are ready for you; a yelling Fury of your owne is within you: Oh suffer another Fury, &amp; shun the other; an Holy Fury! An Holy Fury, to spie out your Euils in your Hearts; to
<pb n="21" facs="25"/> tel them to your Teeth; to curse them before your Faces; to rend them from your Soules; to damne them to their Hell. Neuer more need of Mad men, than now adayes. <hi>No Fiercenesse of men can be enough to curse, and damne the now Sinnes of men: No Fury vnder Heauen; none aboue Hell, is enough to plague them.</hi> I will as disorderly reckon the Disorders of our dayes.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Now are the <q rend="inline large">Euill Dayes;</q> the <q rend="inline large">Perillous
<pb n="22" facs="26"/> Times:</q> for now, <q rend="inline large">The whole world lieth in wickednesse.</q> Since the World was, neuer was the World so wicked as now. It was once the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse of a World; but is now a World of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The Wickednesse that once was, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in a Garden: but the whole World cannot containe the Wickednesse that now is. Nay, the Wickednesse that now is, can containe a whole World: For so he sayes, <q rend="inline large">The whole World li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="23" facs="26"/> in wickednesse:</q> And not Wickednesse only in a World. The World was a Seat of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; but Wickednesse is become a Continent of the World. Quite against the Rule of Reason, the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is the receptacle for the Subiect. Wee are now the worst Generation of Men: Euen they vpon whom the Euill Dayes are come indeed. Our Fathers haue left their Faults be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them: which of Euils in them at first; are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Examples to vs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="24" facs="27"/> them. Wickednesse is now not onely Done, but Taught. Vngodlinesse is growne to a Fashion: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitie and Euill is so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, customarily, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely taken vp: that to be Wicked now, is not onely made pardonable, but thought commendable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs. Wee haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded our Forefathers Euill: and (for our Time) haue set vp Sinne at so high a Pitch; that it were impossible to thinke how Posterity should adde vnto our Iniquities. And this is the woe of all; that
<pb n="25" facs="27"/> Men are irrecouerably Euill. Their corruption hath brought them to a custome; their custome to an Obstinacy; their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie to a Necessitie of being Euill: and that Necessity of being Euill, to an impossibility of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwise. As a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Philosopher</hi> to his Friend; When thou shalt see (said hee) a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in a Market, Theatre, or like frequented place; thinke with thy selfe, there are as many Vices, as Men. I say besides; in a Play-house, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
<pb n="26" facs="28"/> Hall, Court, and Church; there is euer a greater throng of Sinnes, than Men. For, amongst the throngs of Men, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man hath his throng of Sinnes. Not to the Heads of Men only, but to the Haires of their heads, may their Sinnes bee numbred. Men were neuer so many, but one man might reckon all the rest: But the Sins of one man, are more than he can count; much more, than for which he can giue account. What say we of men, and their Sins? You cannot rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
<pb n="27" facs="28"/> more Nations, than you may Abhominations. Besides the Barbarous People, whose Religion it is, to doe Deuils worship; whose Law, to doe Men Wrong: Wee speake of these more Ciuill, more Christian Parts. Loe here! Euery Nation (as I said, and I cannot say more fitly) his Abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The Germane Gluttonous, the Italian Irefull, the Spaniard Proud, the Frenchman Effeminate, the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Deceitfull, the Irish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Idle, the Scottish-man
<pb n="28" facs="29"/> Soothing, and the Englishman (alas the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman!) Euil. Obserue all manner of Men, and their Manners. Turks are Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, Iewes Malicious, and Christians (ah Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians!) Hypocriticall.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>I may say of Any, or of All. Iniquity abounds in all both Nations, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Actions: In all which Innocence is not onely rare, but none at all. Hee spake but too true of these Times, and Crimes of ours: <q rend="inline large">In the last dayes, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous Times shall
<pb n="29" facs="29"/> come. For men shall bee louers of their owne selues, Couetous, Boasters, Proud, Blasphemers, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to Parents, Ʋnthankfull, Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, without natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Affection, Truce-breakers, false Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, Jncontinent, Fierce, Despisers of those that are Good, Traitours, Heady, High minded, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="30" facs="30"/> of Pleasures, more than louers of God, Hauing a forme of Godlinesse, but denying the Power thereof.</q> In these Dayes, Men are Borne, Liue, and Die vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themselues: And are become such strange Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of themselues; that beside themselues, loue they neither God, nor Man. Their owne Lusts only loue they as their liues. Those vices of theirs that please them, they maintaine: Will
<pb n="31" facs="30"/> out-face, rather than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them: rather approue, than forsake them. Euery man now for himselfe: Nay, euery man now one against another. All wilde and sauage <hi>Ismaels,</hi> His hand against euery Man, and euery mans hand against him. His Brothers Knife, at his Brothers Throat: his Brothers Sword, in his Brothers side. Stranger is not safe with Stranger: Nor is Kinne secure with Kinne: And louing Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are as Blacke Swans. The Godly man
<pb n="32" facs="31"/> most of all, is (in this world of wickedones) as a Lilly amongst Thornes; as a Sheepe in the midst of Wolues: With <hi>IOB,</hi> a Brother to Dragons; and with <hi>EZEKIEL,</hi> a Neighbour to Scorpions: A <hi>LOT</hi> in <hi>Sodome;</hi> a <hi>IOSEPH</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> an <hi>ISRAEL</hi> in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> Must either be drawn to doe Euill; or forced to endure it. All that is in this World, is either Snares, or Preyes: There is no way for vs to escape our selues; but by seeking to intrap others. The
<pb n="33" facs="31"/> world is come to such a passe; that wee must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe Wrong, or take Wrong; Kill, or be Killed, Deceiue, or be Deceiued.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Religion (it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest) is but taken vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand: while Pietie, and Honesty lie so vnder foot. They make some Profession, that so they may wrong with losse Suspition. Men walke like Foxes in Lambes skins, that they may the rather deceiue: and come like Wolues in Sheeps Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that so they may the sooner deuoure. <hi>Pharisee</hi>
         <pb n="34" facs="32"/> like, Cleane Outsides, painted Sepulchers, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Walls; they <q rend="inline large">deuoure Widowes Houses, vnder pretence of long Prayers.</q> And what more foule Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, than this so fained Sanctity? How horribly doe men belie their Vices? Their Pride, they call Gracefulnesse, their Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, Courtesie; their Tyranny, Iustice; their Auarice, Thrift; their Lewdnesse, Pleasantnesse; their Profusenesse, Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and their Craft and
<pb n="35" facs="32"/> Subtilty, call they Policy, and Discretion. It was neuer good World since Vice went in Vertues Name, and Habit.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>The Manners of Men haue now brought Lawes themselues into their Subiection. Neuer more Lawes; none more Lawlesse, than now adaies. What Offences are done daily before the Barre of Iustice? Right is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Defended, euen where Right seemes to bee most Reserued. Lawes are bought, and sold: And he commonly hath the best
<pb n="36" facs="33"/> Penny-worth of Law; that hath the worst Cause. Lawes are so many, and so abused; that they are made to discourse, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute Truth, and Right: Whereas were they fewer, and well executed; they would easily and readily determine, and command them both. Nor doth a Common wealth labour so in the multitude of Lawes, as of Lawyers. (I speake not of iust Iudges, and equall Officers of the Law.) But of cunning Catchpoles, and hungry Pettifoggers; that (like
<pb n="37" facs="33"/> swarmes of Flies) pester, and infest a land. These (if you knew all) haue robbed many a Church, wronged many a Widow, starued many an Orphan, and vndone many an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Man. In foule stirres, and Contentions of Men, these thrust in for more filthy Aduocates. Of these I say; Many Lawyers, many Wranglers. Else, how should these men liue, that are raised by others ruines; did they not make worke for themselues. These Seminaries of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention, haue a Cauill, or a
<pb n="38" facs="34"/> Quirke, to make the Law it selfe (which indeed is a Rule of Peace) set Men at oddes and keep them so. As when you send your Water to a needy Empiricke, you must resolue to take Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke: so declare your case to one of these greedie Catchpoles, and you must needs goe to Law. Nay, hee tells you what wrong you haue done your selfe hitherto: and all to bring you (by his meanes) to doe your selfe, and others Wrong. You (like silly sheepe) take this Bryar-Bush to shelter you; and
<pb n="39" facs="34"/> hee all to tatters your Fleece: you two must tugge together ere you part. His is the Gaine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the end, yours (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) both the Losse, and Shame.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>This is also a sore euill vnder the Sunne: Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is set after Wealth Wealth gets vp a Cocke-horse; while Vertue but holds the Stirrop. Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is made but a Page to Riches. The Golden Asse is worshipped; the Ragged Philosopher is contemned. Let a man be Religious, Vertuous, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="40" facs="35"/> Wise; yet this thing is thought to preiudice his best Parts; that hee is Poore: But let him bee Impious, Vicious, Clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, Foolish; yet that he is Rich, makes amends for all the Rest. A Man without Money, is abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red like a Monster: but adored as a Goddesse, is Money without a Man. This same Goddesse Wealth, bewitches vs all to her Worship. For her wee plot, and pray; and ride, and run; and digge, and begge. For base Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres sake, wee are ready
<pb n="41" facs="35"/> to embrace an Enemy, and fall at ods with a Friend. So ours be the Gaine, wee respect not whose is the Losse; yea though the Losse proue our Soules at last.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>The World turns round in a Topsie-Turuy; and euery Thing goes the wrong way to worke. The Asse is got to a Harpe; <hi>Phaeton</hi> will be climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and <hi>Icarus</hi> must goe flie. Euery man irkes his owne Lot: is weary of his present Condition: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more tedious to him, than himselfe. Nor
<pb n="42" facs="36"/> can he containe him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the pale of his proper Calling. Art hath got a tricke to force Nature. Euery Man considers what he Aimes at; not what he is Apt for. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> is made out of euery Logge. Dunses goe for Scholars; Wretches are prest for Souldiers; Idiots vsurpe Authoritie; and Knaues creepe into Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Taylors take Orders; and Weauers will bee Priests. Frogs professe Physicke. Wherein is a Mans least Skill; that is his whole Profession. Men
<pb n="43" facs="36"/> trauell in vntimely Births, labour in vnapt Actions: Like Channels without a Conduit; turne Teachers, when they yet both might, and ought to Learne. They vsually come armed to the Church; goe naked to the Campe: sing at a Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; mourne at a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: study hard in a Play-house; sit fidling in a Senate-house: earnest in a May-Game; and slacke vpon their Seruice. One takes vpon him to swim ouer <hi>Hellespont</hi> on a Horse; Another aymes to ascend <hi>Athos</hi> in a Ship:
<pb n="44" facs="37"/> One lies him downe to sleepe in a Waggon; Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will goe a iourney on his Bed. One takes butterd Pease on his Knife point; Another eats Eggs with Spoones. Bid him speake, &amp; he is mute: say Whisht, and he babbles. He writes Politicks, ere he yet come into a Common-wealth; Commands peremptorily, where he hath small Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; flatly Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, what he least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues. Who knoweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? who hath himselfe? who enters into himselfe? who keepes within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe?
<pb n="45" facs="37"/> who seekes not himselfe without? No man measures himselfe by his owne Feet; by his owne Parts is no man measured. Asses preferre Straw, to Gold: and Dunghill Birds a Barly Corne, to a preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pearle. Baser things are esteemed, and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Better things they neither know how to prize, nor vse. Fooles and Idiots, let fall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, to catch at Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes: let the Bird goe out of hand, and keepe a beating about the Bush. Vncertainties are the
<pb n="46" facs="38"/> most certaine Purchase. All turne Merchant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturers, (for Places, Offices, Dignities; Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, Ecclesiasticall) and buy long Hopes, with a large Price. How many fondly both aduenture, and vndoe themselues, to be well spoken of? Speake him but faire to his Face, and you may haue his Heart out. His Table fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes him with Friends; and they likewise his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And now the Cloth scarce taken vp, but they are ready to rise. Men are all for the Present:
<pb n="47" facs="38"/> And for that, so as it be commodious. What hath formerly beene, is now forgotten. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a quicke Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but no good Memory of one anothers Acts, and Offices. If he cannot so doe, as he hath done; he shall not be so thought, as he was. Former things are Frosted. An old Dogge shall bee hanged; an old Seruing-Man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded; and an old Friend neglected: notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they haue beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly so Vsefull, Painfull, Beneficiall. A man cannot
<pb n="48" facs="39"/> tell whom to trust to; nor how to beleeue him. Beside what his Heart imagines, and Tongue vtters; his very Face betokens Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Hee'll blow hot, and cold both with a wind: Say, and vnsay, nay gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say with a Breath. Will promise Mountaines, and performe Mole-hills: and tell you of more in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, than you shall finde in a Yeare. Nay (which is worst) will both Say well, and Doe well in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. As, many a man hath had a Good Turne done him: not altogether
<pb n="49" facs="39"/> to benefit, but to blinde, and bewitch him rather. A Man speakes a good word for his Friend, and two for himselfe: And commonly so aduises him, as to bring his owne ends about. Two men contend together, and a Third ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrates to eithers losse. Like Dogges, they snarle at one another, till the Bone bee snatcht away from both Great men easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take occasion to wrong Inferiours with authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And the Poore man hath offended enough; in that hee is not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="50" facs="40"/> himselfe. The Poore man must part with his owne Right; or else hee giues not the great Lord his Due. Rich mens Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities are growne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> Poore mens Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities. Like Dogges in Mangers; they haue no need of it, they haue no will to it; and yet they keepe the poore Cattell from their Fodder. If a Man bee once downe the Hill; euery Man is apt to depresse him further. Once gored in the Body of his Estate, how many Hounds pursue him, and trace him
<pb n="51" facs="40"/> still by the bloud of his Wound? He is soone made more miserable; that is once so. None hath lesse paid him, than he, to whom most is due. Whom his Piety doth most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend; him doth their Charitie least reward. It is both the Rule and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, to repell Force with Force: and repay Craft with Craft. So are wee wont to doe to others, as we see they haue done; not as we would they should doe, to vs. Doe a Man Good; and this is thankes enough, that hee doth thee
<pb n="52" facs="41"/> no Hurt. How many are ready to reward Euill for Good: and to wrong him most, of whom he best deserued? What Spiders Webbes are here in the World? Turbulent Waspes burst through; while Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Gnats are intangled. The Gallowes groanes for great Theeues; and small Theeues only groane vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gallowes. What one Man doth, is a Fault, and Punished: What so many doe, is thought well, though worse. Tis strange, that the Greatnesse, and Generality of a Crime;
<pb n="53" facs="41"/> should make it seeme lesse mischieuous, lesse misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, lesse punishable. That belike is Lawfull, which comes once to be Common And (which is last, and worst) Men liue, at Mens lusts: So also, Men perish, at Mens pleasures. And to Kill; is both Courage, and Skill. Murder is made a Mans Art: and tis his Credit, to haue handsomely done the Deed. Besides those that are euill to others; how many are so vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues? How many Giants are there; how many
<pb n="54" facs="42"/> Gulfes of their Estates? They carrie all vpon their Backes; These put all into their Bellies: these feed finely, and rot at a deare rate: They goe gayly, till they bee worth not aboue their wearings. He makes a God of his Belly; Hee a Channell of his Throat; He a Sinke of his Heart; He a Lyer of his Tongue; Hee a Theefe of his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; He a Harlot of his Members. Yet (Oh despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate! Oh damnable!) say the Theefe, Drunkard, Blasphemer, Fornicator; their Thefts, Riots, Oaths,
<pb n="55" facs="42"/> Lusts; are all (if sins) but Veniall Sinnes. No sinne is so great; but is lessened in his Opinion, by whose Mischiefe it is committed. Goodnesse and Truth haue not more Precepts, than Aduersaries thereunto. The Couetous man shrinks and shrugs, at a Lesson of Liberality: It irkes a Prodigall, to tell of Thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse: The Proud man endures not to heare of Humblenesse: The Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hath no Patience, no not so much as to listen thereunto: The Theefe stops his eares at the
<pb n="56" facs="43"/> Charge of Iustice: The desperate Cut-throat is ready to dispatch him first, that would disswade him from the Fact: Tis tedious to talke of Chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before the Lustfull: And Sobernesse to a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, is but as a Tale of a Tubbe. These men will euery one sooner marre the Rule, than mend their Fault. Wicked men will rather abhorre the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, than forsake their Offences. Precepts will doe no Good against them; and Iudgements but make them Worse
<pb n="57" facs="43"/> I will leaue them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Angels Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but indeed the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills Precept: <q rend="inline large">He that is filthy, let him bee filthy still.</q>

         <q rend="inline large">Oppression maketh a Wise man mad;</q>
      </hi> said the <hi>Wise Man:</hi> Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie (say all Good men) will make a Good

It would make a Horse breake his Halter; to see what Fidling, Piping, Morrice-dancing, Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by-horsing in a May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game: but to repeat the Vanities, and Euills of Men; is able to fret a Man out of his Wits. <hi>It is not possible to looke here vpon others; and yet be our Selues.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Whether it come of a Melancholy, a Bloud,
<pb n="59" facs="44"/> a Choler; it makes me Sad-mad, Merry-Mad, Mad-Mad. See me some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bemoaning, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding, and execrating their Iniquities. Any wayes in the world, to tell Men how I lament, scorn, abhor their Euils. While I bewaile the Weak, smile at the Vaine, detest the Wicked; am I so Sad, &amp; Merry, &amp; Mad.</p>
   <p>Sad-Mad. Our <hi>Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> (pardon to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison!) was ANGRY and GRIEVED toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets haue laid Ashes
<pb n="60" facs="45"/> on their Heads, put Sackcloth on their Loynes; smote their Thighes, and set their Eyes open, as flowing Fountaines, to gush out riuers of Teares; and all because of others Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. <hi>This is one of our Perfections, to be touched with others Euils, as our owne.

   <p>Mad-mad. I haue here said enough, not only to excuse mee for it: but (me thinkes) to incourage mee to it. Three speake Truth; one of which is the Mad-man. Thou maist say me Mad: but I speake the words of Sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and Truth.

Away with the fawning Curres, and toothlesse; with the buzzing Beetles, and stinglesse: Giue mee the Dogge that will bite home; and the Waspe that will sting indeed. Take away the Tart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (said a <hi>Bold-Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
      <pb n="72" facs="51"/> for the Freedome of his Speech) and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse from Worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood; and it loseth both the Nature, and Name: Take away my Name too; if you barre me of my Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. <hi>

   <p>Loe! (thou saist) a very <hi>Lamia:</hi> The mad Hagge hath Eyes to put in, and plucke out at will. Hee puts his Eyes (as one of those) in his Head, while he walkes Abroad: but keepes them in a Box, when he stayes at Home. So are we wont indeed, to haue <hi>Lyncean Eyes</hi> to Others: but are as blinde as <hi>Moles</hi> toward our Selues. True, and tis the property of an
<pb n="74" facs="52"/> Eye, to see all, but it selfe. I confesse; <hi>Wee can sooner finde out others Faults; than mend our owne.</hi> But if I blame thee, with what my selfe am also Guilty of; Thou shalt not need vpbraid mee with it: I shall now bee enough to reproach my selfe. If I be no other, than I say thou art: what my Tongue tels to thee, my Heart will not hide from me. What I but call thee once, will it tell mee twice. <hi>Double is his both Guilt, and

      </hi>
   </p>
   <p>But (after mine owne Cure) I here am thy Physitian: and haue so dealt with Iniquities; as doe such with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies. See here thou
<pb n="76" facs="53"/> maist, the Parues Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Parts: toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their seuerall Signes, Grounds, Fruits, Causes, Cures. I haue taken but Three Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents here in hand at once: and they more than I looke for Profit by; more (I feare me) than I shall get Credit by. But Three, to the <hi>Three Furies,</hi> or <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;</hi> whom I meane to match against them. Three shall bee all at once; since Three once were all: <hi>
         <q rend="inline large">All that is in

      </hi>
   </p>
   <p>One thing is; &amp; I would thee note it: I haue applyed it as a soueraign Remedy, against what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer Malady: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding still with a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of Mortalitie, and Death. <hi>Nothing makes a Man more irke his Euill; than to thinke on his End. He that thinkes what he shall then be; will
<pb n="78" facs="54"/> bee wary what hee now doth. Sinne was the only meanes, that brought a Man to Death: but Death is thus the only meanes, to keepe a Man from Sin. He aimd aright; <q rend="inline large">Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the End, <hi>(said he)</hi> and thou shalt neuer doe amisse.</q> To meditate on Death, is as a Curbe against all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Courses: and a Spurre pricking on to pious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Pricke the wandring Snaile but with the <hi>ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTO</hi> of Deaths Dart; and hee straight
<pb n="79" facs="54"/> retires into his Shell: Let the Pilot sit close in the End of the Ship; and hee now gouernes it aright. To haue Death before his Eyes; is the ready way, to haue God before his Eyes. He easily contemnes what is Present, and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing away: that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders what is Euerlasting, and to Come.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I haue no more (nor needed I so much) to say for my Selfe: Only, against Thee (if thou be of them) haue I yet more. All the Cursed Crue; Men of the
<pb n="80" facs="55"/> World, Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> Children of Darknesse, Impes of Confusion, Limbes of <hi>Satan,</hi> Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands of Hell: Ile tell them All my minde, as I meet them. Ile take them, where I finde them: And say no more to thee; till I see thee there.</p>
