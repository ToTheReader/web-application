         <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all the sentences pronounced by our sauiour</hi> Christe in his whole doctrine, none is more serious or more worthy to be borne in remembraunce, then that which he spake openly in his Gospell, saying: <hi>Scrutamini scripturas, quia vos putatis in ipsis vitam eternam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      <note place="margin">Iohn. v.</note>
      <hi>et ille sunt quae testimonium perbibent de me.</hi> Search ye the scriptures, for in them ye thinke to haue eternall lyfe, and those they be which beare witnes of me. These wordes were first spoken vnto the Iewes by our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, but by hym in his doctrine ment to all: for they concerne all, of what nation, of what tongue, of what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession soeuer any man be. For to all belongeth it to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto eternall life, so many as by the witnes of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures desire to finde eternall life. No man, woman, or chylde, is excluded from this saluation, and therfore to euery of them is this spokē proportionally yet, and in their degrees and ages, and as the reason and congruitie of their vocation may aske. For not so lyeth it in charge to the worldly artificer to searche, or to any other priuate man so exquisitely to studie, as it lyeth to the charge of the publike teacher to searche in the scriptures, to be the more able to walke in the house of God (which is the Church of the lyuyng God,<note place="margin">i. Tim. iii.</note> the pyller and ground of trueth) to the establishing of the true doctrine of the same, and to the impugnyng of the false. And though whatsoeuer difference there may be betwixt the preacher in office, and the auditor in his vocation, yet to both it is said, <hi>Search ye the scriptures,</hi> whereby ye may fynde eternall lyfe, and gather witnesses of that saluation which is in <hi>Christe Iesus</hi> our Lorde. For although the prophete of God Moyses,<note place="margin">Deut. xvii.</note> byddeth the kyng when he is once set in the throne of his kingdome, to describe before his eyes the volume of Gods lawe, according to the example whiche he shoulde receaue of the priestes of the leuiticall tribe, to haue it with him, and to reade in it all the dayes of his life, to thende that he might learne to feare the Lorde his God, and to obserue his lawes, that his heart be not aduaunced in pryde ouer his brethren, not to swarue eyther on the ryght hande or on the left: yet the reason of this precept for that it concerneth all men, may reasonably be thought to be commaunded to all men, and all men may take it to be spoken to them selfe in their degree. Though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God him selfe spake to his captayne Iosue in precise wordes, <hi>Non recedat volumen legis huius ab ore tuo,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iosue. i.</note>
      <hi>sed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaberis in eo diebus ac noctibus &amp;c.</hi> Let not the volume of this booke depart from thy mouth, but muse therin both dayes and nyghtes, that thou mayest kepe and perfourme all thinges which be written in it, that thou mayest direct well thy way and vnderstande the same: yet aswell spake almightie God this precept to all his people in the directions of their wayes to himwarde, as he ment it to Iosue: For that he hath care of all,<note place="margin">i. Pet. v. Ephe. vi. i. Tim. ii. Ioh. xiiii.</note> he accepteth no mans person, his wyll is that all men shoulde be saued, his wyll is that all men shoulde come to the way of trueth. Howe coulde this be more conueniently declared by God to man, then when Christe his welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued sonne our most louing sauiour, the way, the trueth, and the lyfe of vs all, dyd byd vs openly <hi>Searche the scriptures,</hi> assuring vs herein to finde eternall life, to finde full testification of all his graces and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites towardes vs in the treasure thereof? Therefore it is most conuenient that we shoulde all suppose that Christe spake to vs all in this his precept of searching the scriptures.<note place="margin">Math. xvii.</note> If this celestiall doctour (so aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the father of heauen, and commaunded as his only sonne, to be hearde of vs all) biddeth vs busily to <hi>Search the scriptures</hi>? of what spirite can it proceede to forbid the reading and studiyng of the scriptures? If the grosse Iewes vsed to reade them, as some men thinke that our sauiour Christ dyd shew by such kynd of speaking, their vsage, with their opinion they had therin to finde eternall lyfe, and were not of Christe rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked or disproued, either for their searching, or for the opinion they had, howe superstitiously or superficially soeuer some of them vsed to expende the scriptures? Howe muche more vnaduisedly do suche as bost them selfe to be either Christes vicars, or be of his garde, to lothe christen men from reading, by their couert slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous reproches of the scriptures, or in their aucthoritie by lawe or statute to contract this libertie of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diyng the worde of eternall saluation? Christe calleth them not onlye to the single readyng of scriptures (saith Chrisostome) but sendeth them to the exquisite searching of them, for in them is eternall lyfe to be founde, and they be (saith hym selfe) the witnesse of me: for they declare out his office, they commende his beneuolence towardes vs, they recorde his whole workes wrought for vs to our saluation. Antechriste therefore he must be, that vnder whatsoeuer colour woulde geue contrary precept or counsayle, to that whiche Christe dyd geue vnto vs. Very litle do they resemble Christes louing spirite mouing vs to searche for our comfort, that wyll discourage vs from suche searching, or that woulde wishe ignoraunce and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of his benefite to raigne in vs, so that they might by our ignoraunce raigne the more frankly in our consciences, to the daunger of our saluation. VVho can take the light from vs in this miserable vale of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and meane not to haue vs stumble in the pathes of perdition to the ruine of our soules?<note place="margin">Psal xxii.</note> who wyll en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie vs this bread of lyfe prepared and set on the table for our eternall sustenaunce, and meane not to famishe vs, or in steede thereof with their corrupt traditions and doctrines of man, to infect vs? All the whole scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, saith the holy apostle Saint Paul inspired from God aboue, is profitable to teache, to reproue,<note place="margin">ii.

   <p>
      <hi>Searche therefore</hi> good reader (on Gods name) as Christe byddeth thee the holy scripture, wherein
<pb facs="21"/>
thou mayest finde thy saluation: Let not the volume of this booke (by Gods owne warrant) depart from thee, but occupie thy selfe therein in the whole iourney of this thy worldly pilgrimage, to vnderstande thy way howe to walke ryghtly before hym all the dayes of thy lyfe.<note place="margin">Psal. i.</note> Remember that the prophete Dauid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth hym the blessed man whiche wyll muse in the lawe of God both day and night, remember that he calleth him blessed whiche walketh in the way of the Lorde,<note place="margin">Psal. cxix.</note> whiche wyll searche diligently his testimonies, and wyll in their whole heart seeke the same. Let not the couert suspitious insinuations of the aduersaries driue thee from the searche of the holy scripture, either for the obscuritie whiche they say is in them, or for the inscrutable hidden misteries they talke to be comprised in them, or for the straungnes and homlynes of the phrases they woulde charge Gods booke with. Christe exhorteth thee therefore the rather for the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of the same,<note place="margin">Hedre. v. i. Cor. xiiii.</note> to searche them diligently. Saint Paul wylleth thee to haue thy senses exercised in them, and not to be a chylde in thy senses, but in malice. Though many thinges may be difficult to thee to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande, impute it rather to thy dull hearing and reading, then to thinke that the scriptures be insupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">Math. vii.</note> to them which with diligent searching labour to discerne the euill from the good. Only searche with an humble spirite, aske in continuall prayer, seeke with puritie of life, knocke with perpetuall perseueraunce, and crye to that good spirite of Christe the comforter: and surely to euery suche asker it wyll be geuen, such sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers must nedes finde, to them it wylbe opened. Christe him selfe wyll open the sense of the scriptures, not to the proude,<note place="margin">Math. xi. Esai. lxi. i. Cor. xii. Apoc. iii. Sapi. i. Iob. xiiii. Sapi. i.</note> or to the wyse of the worlde, but to the lowly and contrite in heart: for he hath the kay of Dauid, who openeth and no man shutteth, who shutteth and no man openeth. For as this spirite is a bening and liberall spirite, and wyll be easyly founde of them whiche wyll early in carefulnesse ryse to seeke hym, and as he promiseth he wyll be the comforter from aboue to teache vs, and to leade vs into all the wayes of trueth, if that in humilitie we bowe vnto hym, deniyng our owne naturall senses, our carnall wittes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: so is he the spirite of puritie and cleannes, and will receede from him, whose conscience is subiect to fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynesse of lyfe. Into suche a soule this heauenly wysdome wyll not enter, for all peruerse cogitations wyll separate vs from God:<note place="margin">Psal. lxviii.</note> and then howe busyly soeuer we searche this holy table of the scripture, yet wyll it then be a table to suche to their owne snare, a trap, a stumbling stocke, and a recompence to them selfe. VVe ought therefore to searche to finde out the trueth, not to oppresse it, we ought to seeke Christe, not as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode did vnder the pretence of worshipping hym to destroy hym, or as the Pharisees searched the scriptures to disproue Christe, and to discredite him, and not to folowe him: but to embrace the saluation whiche we may learne by them. Nor yet is it inough so to acknowledge the scriptures as some of the Iewes dyd, of the holyest of them, who vsed suche diligence, that they could number precisely, not only euery verse, but euery word and sillable, how oft euery letter of the alphabete was repeated in the whole scriptures: they had some of them suche reuerence to that booke, that they woulde not suffer in a great heape of bookes, any other to lay ouer them, they woulde not suffer that booke to fall to the grounde as nye as they coulde, they woulde costly bynde the bookes of holy scriptures, and cause them to be exquisitely and ornately written. VVhiche deuotion yet though it was not to be discommended, yet was it not for that intent, why Christe cōmended the scriptures, nor they therof alowed before God: For they did not call vpon God in a true fayth, they were not charitable to their neighbours, but in the middes of all this deuotion, they did steale, they were adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, they were slaunderers and backbiters, euen muche like many of our christian men and women nowe a dayes, who glory much that they reade the scriptures, that they searche them and loue them, that they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the publique sermons in an outwarde shewe of all honestie and perfection, yea they can pike out of the scriptures vertuous sentenses and godly preceptes to lay before other men. And though these maner of men do not muche erre for such searching and studiyng, yet they see not the scope and the principall state of the scriptures, which is as Christe declareth it, to finde Christe as their sauiour, to cleaue to his saluation and merites, to be brought to the lowe repentaunce of their liues, and to amende them selfe, to rayse vp their fayth to our sauiout Christe, so to thinke of him as the scriptures do testifie of hym. These be the principall causes why Christe did sende the Iewes to searche the scriptures: for to this ende were they wrytten, saith Saint Iohn,<note place="margin">Iohn. xx.</note>
      <hi>Hec scripta sunt vt credatis, &amp; vt credentes vitam habeatis eternam.</hi> These were written to this intent, that ye shoulde beleue, and that through your beliefe ye shoulde haue euerlasting life.</p>
   <p>And here good reader, great cause we haue to extoll the wonderous wisdome of God, and with great thankes to prayse his prouidence, considering howe he hath preserued and renued from age to age by speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all miracle,<note place="margin">Hber. v.</note> the incomparable treasure of his Churche. For first he did inspire Moyses, as Iohn Chrisostome doth testifie, to wryte the stonie tables, and kept him in the mountayne fourtie dayes to geue him his lawe: after him he sent the prophetes, but they suffred many thousande aduersities, for battayles did folowe, all were slayne, all were destroyed, bookes were brent vp. He then inspired agayne another man to repayre these miraculous scriptures, Esdras I meane, who of their leauinges set them agayne together: after that, he proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the seuentie interpreters shoulde take them in hande: at the last came Christe him selfe, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did receaue them, and spread them throughout all nations, Christe wrought his miracles and wonders: and what folowed?<note place="margin">i. Cor. x. Math. xxii.</note> after these great volumes the Apostles also did wryte as Saint Paul doth say, These be wrytten to the instruction of vs that be come into the ende of the worlde: and Christe doth say, Ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore erre, because ye knowe not the scriptures nor the power of God: and Paul dyd say, Let the worde of Christe be plentifull among you: and agayne saith Dauid, Oh howe sweete be thy wordes to my throte: he saide not to my hearing,<note place="margin">Colo. iii. Psal. cxix. Deut. xvi.</note> but to my throte, aboue the hony or the hony combe to my mouth. Yea Moyses saith, Thou shalt meditate in them euermore when thou risest, when thou sittest downe, when thou goest to sleepe, continue in them he saith: and a thousande places more. And yet after so many testimonies thus spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, there be some persons that do not yet so much as knowe what the scriptures be: wherevpon nothing is in good state amongest vs, nothing worthyly is done amongest vs: In this whiche pertayne to this lyfe, we make very great haste, but of spirituall goodes we haue no regarde. <hi>Thus farre Iohn Chrisost.</hi> It must nedes signifie some great thing to our vnderstanding, that almightie God hath had such care to prescribe these bookes thus vnto vs: I say not prescribe them only, but to maintaine them and defende them against the malignitie of the deuill and his ministers, who alway went about to destroy them: and yet could these neuer be so destroyed,
<pb facs="21"/>
but that he woulde haue them continue whole and perfect to this day, to our singuler comfort and instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where other bookes of mortall wise men haue perished in great numbers. It is recorded that Ptolomeus Philadelphus kyng of Egypt, had gathered together in one librarie at Alexandria by his great coste and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, seuen hundred thousand bookes, wherof the principall were the bookes of Moyses, whiche reserued not much more, then by the space of two hundred yeres, were all brent and consumed in that battayle, when Caesar restored Cleopatra agayne after her expulsion. At Constantinople perished vnder Zenon by one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fire, a hundred and twentie thousande bookes. At Rome when Lucius Aurel Antonius dyd raigne,<note place="margin">Iohannes Sarisberi. In policra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico. lib 8. cap. 19. VV. de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus.</note> his notable librarie by a lightning frō heauen was quite consumed: yea it is recorded that Gregorie the first, did cause a librarie of Rome cōtayning only certaine Paynims workes to be burned, to thintent the scriptures of God should be more read and studied. VVhat other great libraries haue there ben cōsumed but of late daies? And what libraries haue of olde throughout this realme almost in euery abbey of the same, ben destroyed at sundry ages, besides the losse of other mens priuate studies, it were to long to rehearse. VVherevpon seyng almightie God by his deuine pouidence, hath preserued these bookes of the scriptures safe and sounde, and that in their natiue languages they were first written, in the great ignoraunce that raigned in these tongues, and contrary to all other casualties, chaunced vpon all other bookes in mauger of all worldly wittes, who would so fayne haue had them destroyed, and yet he by his mightie hande, would haue them extant as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and interpreters of his will toward mankind: we may soone see cause most reuerently to embrace these deuine testimonies of his wyll, to studie them, and to search them, to instruct our blinde nature so sore cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and fallen from the knowledge in whiche first we were created. Yet hauing occasion geuen some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to recouer our fall, and to returne againe to that deuine nature wherein we were once made, and at the last to be inheritours in the celestiall habitation with God almightie, after the ende of our mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie here brought to his dust agayne: These bookes I say beyng of suche estimation and aucthoritie, so muche reuerenced of them who had any meane taste of them, coulde neuer be put out of the way,<note place="margin">Galfride mon.</note> neither by the spyte of any tiraunt, as that tiraunt Maximian destoyed all the holy scriptures wheresoeuer they coulde be founde, and burnt them in the middes of the market, neither the hatred either of any Porphirian philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher or Rhetoritian, neither by the enuie of the romanystes, and of such hypocrites, who from tyme to time did euer barke against them, some of them not in open sort of condempnation: but more cunningly vnder suttle pretences, for that as they say, they were so harde to vnderstande, and specially for that they affirme it to be a perilous matter to translate the text of the holy scripture, and therefore it can not be well translated. And here we may beholde the endeuour of some mens cauillations, who labour all they can to slaunder the translatours, to finde fault in some wordes of the translation: but them selfe will neuer set pen to the booke, to set out any translation at al. They can in their constitutions prouinciall vnder payne of excommunication,<note place="margin">Tho. arūdel. in concilio apud oxon. an 1407. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticlo. 7.</note> inhibite al other men to translate them without the ordinaries or the prouinciall counsayle agree therevnto: But they wyll be well ware neuer to agree or to geue counsayle to set them out. VVhiche their suttle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe in effect, tendeth but to bewray what inwardly they meane, if they coulde bring it about, that is, vtterly to suppresse them: being in this their iudgement, farre vnlike the olde fathers in the primatiue Church, who hath exhorted indifferently all persons, aswell men as women, to exercise them selues in the scriptures, which by Saint Hieroms aucthoritie be the scriptures of the people. Yea they be farre vnlike their olde forefathers that haue ruled in this realme, who in their times, and in diuers ages did their diligence to translate the whole bookes of the scriptures, to the erudition of the laytie, as yet at this day be to be seene diuers bookes translated into the vulgar tongue, some by kynges of the realme, some by bishoppes, some by abbottes, some by other deuout godly fathers: so desirous they were of olde tyme to haue the lay sort edified in godlynes by reading in their vulgar tongue, that very many bookes be yet extant, though for the age of the speache and straungenesse of the charect of many of them almost worne out of knowledge. In whiche bookes may be seene euidently howe it was vsed among the Saxons, to haue in their Churches read the foure gospels, so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed and piked out in the body of the euangelistes bookes, that to euery Sunday and festiuall day in the yere, they were sorted out to the common ministers of the Churche in their common prayers to be read to their people. Nowe as of the most auncient fathers the prophetes, Saint Peter testifieth that these holy men of God had the impulsion of the holy ghost, to speake out these deuine testimonies:<note place="margin">i. Pet. i.</note> so it is not to be doubted but that these latter holy fathers of the englishe Church, had the impulsion of the holy ghost, to set out these sacred bookes in their vulgar language, to the edification of the people, by the helpe whereof they might the better folowe the example of the godly Christians, in the begining of the Churche,<note place="margin">Act. xvii.</note> who not only receaued the worde withall redinesse of heart, but also did searche diligently in the scriptures, whether the doctrine of the Apostles were agreable to the same scriptures. And these were not of the rascall sort (saith the deuine storie) but they were of the best and of most noble byrth among the Thessalonians,<note place="margin">i. Pet. i.</note> Birrhenses by name. Yea the prophetes them selues in their dayes, writeth S. Peter, were diligent searchers to inquire out this saluatiō by Christe, searching when and at what article of time this grace of Christes dispensation should appeare to the world. VVhat ment the fathers of the Church in their writinges, but the aduauncing of these holy bookes, where some do attribute no certaintie of vndoubted veritie, but to the canonicall scriptures.<note place="margin">Ang. contra epistolam permemini. Hieroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. Tertullian. de doctrina christiana. Chrisost. in Mat Ho. 49 Basilius. Hieronimus i. Pet. i.</note> Some do affirme it to be a foolishe rashe boldnesse to beleue hym, who proueth not by the scriptures that whiche he affirmeth in his worde. Some do accurse all that is deliuered by tradition, not founde in the legall and euangelicall scriptures. Some say that our fayth must needes stagger, if it be not grounded vpon the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the scripture. Some testifieth that Christe and his Churche ought to be aduouched out of the scriptures, and do contende in disputation, that the true Churche can not be knowen, but only by the holy scriptures: For all other thinges (saith the same aucthor) may be founde among the heretikes. Some affirme it to be a sinfull tradition that is obtruded without the scripture. Some playnely pronounce, that not to knowe the scriptures, is not to knowe Christe. VVherefore let men extoll out the Churche practises as hyghly as they can, and let them set out their traditions and customes, their decisions in synodes and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayles, with vaunting the presence of the holy ghost among them really, as some doth affirme it in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, let their groundes and their demonstrations, their foundations be as stable and as strong as they blase

Except there be any man, which may beleue that our Lorde God would inspire the righteousnesse of examination, to any one singular person, and to denie the same to priestes gathered together into coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile without number. &amp;c. And there they do require the bishop of Rome to send none of his clarkes to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute such prouinciall causes, lest els say they, mought be brought in the vayne pride of the worlde into the Churche of Christe. In this antiquitie may we in this christian catholique Church of Englande, repose our selfe, knowyng by our owne annales of auncient recorde, that kyng Lucius whose conscience was muche touched with the miracles whiche the seruauntes of Christe wrought in diuers nations, thervpon beyng in great loue with the true fayth, sent vnto Eleutherius then byshop of Rome, requiring of hym the christian religion.<note place="margin">Inter leges Edwardi.</note> But Eleutherius did redyly geue ouer that care to king Lucius in his epistle, for that the king as he wryteth, the vicar of God in his owne kingdome, and for that he had receaued the faith of Christe: And for that he had also both testamentes in his realme, hewylled him to drawe out of them by the grace of God, and by the counsaile of his wisemen, his lawes, and by that lawe of God to gouerne his realme of Britanie, and not so muche to desire the Romane and Emperours lawes, in the which some default might be founde saith he,<note place="margin">Ex archiuis de statu landauensis ecclie, in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopi du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britii &amp; in I. capgrau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Thus farre in the storie. Nowe therfore knowing and beleuing with Saint Paul, <hi>Quod quecunque prescripta sunt, ad nostram doctrinam prescripta sunt, vt per pacientiam &amp; consolationem scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turarum spem habeamus</hi>: VVhatsoeuer is afore writtē, is written before for our instruction, that we through the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience and comfort of scirptures might haue hope, the only suretie to our fayth and comscience, is to sticke to the scriptures. VVherevpon whyle this eternall worde of God be our rocke and anker to sticke vnto, we will haue pacience with all the vayne inuentions of men, who labour so highly to magnifie their tongues, to exalt them selues aboue al that is God. VVe wil take comfort by the holy scriptures against the maledictions of the aduersaries, and doubt not to nourishe our hope continually therewith, so to liue and dye in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable hope, and doubt not to pertayne to the elect number of Christes Churche, howe farre soeuer we be excommunicated out of the sinagogue of suche who suppose them selues to be the vniuersall lordes of all the world, Lordes of our fayth and consciences, at pleasure. Finally to commend further vnto thee good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cause in part before intreated, it shalbe the lesse needefull, hauing so nye folowing that learned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, whiche sometime was set out by the diligence of that godly father Thomas Cranmer, late byshop in the sea of Canterburie, whiche he caused to be prefixed before the translation of that Byble that was then set out. And for that the copies thereof be so wasted, that very many Churches do want their conuenient Bybles, it was thought good to some well disposed men, to recognise the same Byble againe into this fourme as it is nowe come out, with some further diligence in the printing, and with some more light added, partly in the translation, and partly in the order of the text, not as condemning the former translation, whiche was folowed mostly of any other translation, excepting the originall text from whiche as litle va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riaunce was made as was thought meete to such as toke paynes therin: desiring thee good reader if ought be escaped, eyther by such as had the expending of the bookes, or by the ouersight of the printer, to correct the same in the spirite of charitie, calling to remembraunce what diuersitie hath ben seene in mens iudgementes in the translation of these bookes before these dayes, though all directed their labours to the glory of God, to the edification of the Churche, to the comfort of their christian brethren, and alwayes as God dyd further open vnto them, so euer more desirous they were to refourme their former humaine ouersightes, rather then in a stubborne wylfulnesse to resist the gyft of the holy ghost, who from tyme to tyme is resident as that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

Men we be all, and that which we know, is not the thousand part of that we knowe not. VVhereupon saith saint Austen, otherwyse to iudge then the truth is, this temptation ryseth of the frailtie of man. A man so to loue and sticke to his owne iudgement, or to enuie his brothers,<note place="margin">De doctri. christia.</note> to the perill of dissoluing the christian communion, or to the perill of schisme, and of heresie, this is diabolicall presumption: but so to iudge in euery matter as the truth is, this belongeth onely to the angelicall perfection. Notwithstanding good reader, thou mayst be well assured nothing to be done in this translation eyther of malice or wylfull meaning in altering the text, eyther by putting more or lesse to the same, as of purpose to bryng in any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate iudgement by falsification of the wordes, as some certaine men hath ben ouer bolde so to do, litle regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the maiestie of God his scripture: but so to make it serue to their corrupt error, as in alleaging the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of saint Paule to the Romaines the .6. one certaine wryter to proue his satisfaction, was bold to turne the word of <hi>Santificationem</hi> into the word of <hi>Satisfactionem,</hi> Thus. <hi>Sicut exhibuimus antea membra nostra seruirae immundicie et iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati ad iniquitatem, ita deinceps exhib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

VVhat maner of translation may men thinke to looke for at their handes, if they should translate the scriptures to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Gods elect, whiche they neuer did, nor be not like to purpose it, but be rather studious only to seeke quarrels in other mens well doynges, to picke fault where none is: And where any is escaped through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine negligence, there to crye out with their tragicall exclamations, but in no wyse to amende by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of charitie and lenitie, that whiche might be more aptly set. VVhervpon for frayle man (compassed hym selfe with infirmitie) it is most reasonable not to be to seuere in condemning his brothers knowledge or dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence where he doth erre, not of malice, but of simplicitie, and specially in handeling of these so deuine bookes so profounde in sense, so farre passing our naturall vnderstanding. And with charitie it standeth, the reader not to be offended with the diuersitie of translatours, nor with the ambiguitie of translations: For as Saint Austen doth witnesse, by Gods prouidence it is brought about,<note place="margin">De doctr. christi. lib. 2. cap. 5.</note> that the holy scriptures whiche be the salues for euery mans sore, though at the first they came from one language, and thereby might haue ben spread to the whole worlde: nowe by diuersitie of manye languages, the translatours shoulde spreade the saluation (that is contayned in them) to all nations, by suche wordes of vtteraunce, as the reader might perceaue the minde of the translatour, and so consequently to come to the knowledge of God his wyll and pleasure. And though many rashe readers be deceaued in the obscurities and ambiguities of their translations, whyle they take one thing for another, and whyle they vse muche labour to extricate them selues out of the obscurities of the same: yet I thinke (saith he) this is not wrought without the prouidence of God, both to tame the proude arrogancie of man by his suche labour of searching, as also to kepe his minde from lothsomnesse and contempt, where if the scriptutes vniuersally were to easie, he woulde lesse regarde them. And though (saith he) in the primatiue Churche the late interpreters whiche did translate the scriptures, be innumerable, yet wrought this rather an helpe, then an impediment to the readers, if they be not to negligent. For saith he, diuers translations haue made many tymes the harder and darker sentences, the more open and playne: So that of congruence, no offence can iustly be taken for this newe labour, nothing preiudicing any other mans iudgement by this doyng, nor yet hereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing this to be so absolute a translation, as that hereafter might folowe no other that might see that which as yet was not vnderstanded. In this poynt it is conuenient to consider the iudgement that Iohn,<note place="margin">Articulo. 17. cōtra. Luth.</note> once by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rochester was in, who thus wrote: It is not vnknowen, but that many thinges hath ben more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently discussed, and more clearely vnderstanded by the wittes of these latter dayes, aswell concerning the gospels as other scriptures, then in olde tyme they were. The cause whereof is (saith he) for that to the olde men the yse was not broken, or for that their age was not sufficient exquisitely to expende the whole mayne sea of the scriptures, or els for that in this large field of the scriptures, a mā may gather some eares vntouched after the haruest men, howe diligent soeuer they were. For there be yet (saith he) in the gospels very many darke places, whiche without all doubt to the posteritie shalbe made muche more open. For why should we dispayre herein, seing the gospell (wryteth he) was deliuered to this intent, that it might be vtterly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed of vs, yea to the very inche. VVherfore, forasmuche as Christe sheweth no lesse loue to his Churche now, then hitherto he hath done, the aucthoritie wherof is as yet no whit diminished, and forasmuch as that holy spirite the perpetuall keper and gardian of the same Church, whose gyftes and graces do flowe as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually and as aboundantly as from the deginning: who can doubt, but that such thinges as remayne yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen in the gospell, shalbe hereafter made open to the latter wittes of our posteritie, to their cleare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. (Thus farre this wryter.) Only good readers let vs oft call vpon the holy spirite of God our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, by the mediation of our Lorde and sauiour, with the wordes of the octonary psalme of Dauid,<note place="margin">Psal. cxix.</note> who did so importunatly craue of God to haue the vnderstanding of his lawes and testament: Let vs hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye on our knees pray to almightie God, with that wyse kyng Solomon in his very wordes, saying thus.</p>
