   <p>FOR as much as the force and infection of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diseas called the Plague or Pestilence, hath heretofore beene too well knowne and felt in sundrie places of this Realme: and considering that it hath of late begun to increase in many chiefe Citties and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous places; I thought it good to publish to you in time, sundry preseruatiues against the said disease, the better to defende those that are in health, from the infection of the diseased: And also to cure those that are any way infected, grieued, or troubled with the same. And to this I was imboldened, the rather for that it was written by a very learned and approoued Phisition of our time, who desireth more the health of his Country, than by discouering his name seeme vaine glorious to the world. Accept the same I pray you in good part, and thanke God for the Phisitions paines, who hath his desire if it may doe but that which he wisheth: namely expel sickenes, and increase health to this Land. Which God for his mercie sake, prosper and preserue from all plagues and dangers for euermore, Amen.</p>
