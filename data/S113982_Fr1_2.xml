      </hi> Haue presumed to offer vnto the eye of the world, Sermons preached in the eare of the Court, without his leaue J confesse, whose labours they were; but not without hope of thankes from thee and pardon from him. The copies, which were some of them commaunded, some of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated from him, are a warrant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, that the Court which heard them, will be willing to read them: neither doe J see how I wrong him,
<pb facs="3"/>when I publish no more, then was <hi>Publici Iuris,</hi> as soone as it was vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: I am sure I haue satisfied the desires of many, and those of better iudgement then my selfe, who in my hearing haue wished the publishing of them, and thought them worthy of longer life, then to fade with the houre to the which they were dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If thou profit by them, thanke God for him, and as for me, I shall thinke my paines rewarded, if accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy acquaintance and credit with him, thou wilt assure him, that this which is done, is done</p>
