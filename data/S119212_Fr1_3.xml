   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the Angels
left their owne
standing, they
envied ours,
and out of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
became both by office and
practice Tempters, that they
might draw man from that
happy Communion with God,
unto that cursed condition with
themselves. And successe in
this trade; hath made them
both skilfull, and diligent espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
now, their time being
but short. And if neither the
first or second <hi>Adam</hi> could be
<pb facs="6"/>
free from their Impudent As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults;
Who then may look for
exemption? the best must most
of all looke to be set upon, as
having most of Christ in them,
whom Satan hates most, and as
hoping by dis-heartning of
them, to foile others, as great
trees fall not alone; no Age or
ranke of Christians can be free:
Beginners he labours to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
those that have made
some progresse, hee raiseth
stormes against; those that are
more perfect, he labours to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine,
by spiritual pride, and
above all other times he is most
busie, when wee are weakest,
then he doubles and multiplies
his forces, when hee lookes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have all, or lose all. His
course is either to tempt to sin,
or for sinne: To sinne, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
<pb facs="6"/>
some seeming good, to
draw us from the true good, to
seeke some excellencie besides
God in the creature, and to this
end, he labours in the first place
to shake our faith in the Word,
thus he dealt with <hi>Adam,</hi> and
thus he dealeth with all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.
And besides immediate
suggestions, he commeth unto
us, by our dearest friends, as
unto Christ, by <hi>Peter:</hi> so many
tempters, so many devils in
that ill office, though neither
they, or we, are oft aware of it;
the nearest friend of al, our own
flesh, is the most dangerous
traytour, and therefore most
dangerous, because most neare,
more neare to us, than the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
himselfe, with which, if
he had no intelligence, all his
plots would come to nothing;
<pb facs="7"/>
this holding correspondence
with him, layeth us open to all
the danger; it is this inward
bosome enemy that doth us most
mischiefe. When <hi>Phocas</hi> (like
another <hi>Zimry)</hi> had killed his
Master,<note place="margin">Cedren.</note>
      <hi>Mauricius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
he laboured, like <hi>Cain,</hi> to
secure himselfe, with building
high wals, after which, hee
heard a voice telling him, that
though he built his wals never
so high, yet sinne, within the
wals, would undermine al: It is
true of every particular man,
that if there were no Tempter
without, he would be a Tempter
to himselfe; it is this lust with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us that hath brought an ill
report upon the creature: This
is that which makes blessings
to be snares unto us; all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
which is in the world,
<pb facs="7"/>
is by lust,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> which lyeth in our
bosome, and as an <hi>Achitophel,</hi>
or <hi>Iudas,</hi> by familiaritie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeth
us; yea, often-times in
our best affections, and actions,
Nature will mingle with our
Zeale, and privie pride will
creepe in▪ and taint our best
performances, with some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
aime: Hence it is, that
our life is a continual combate.
A Christian, so soone as New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,
is borne a souldier, and
so continueth untill his crowne
be put upon him, in the meane
time, our comfort is, that ere
long, wee shall bee out of the
reach of all tentation,<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 20.</note> the God
of peace will tread downe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
under our feet. A car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
mans life is nothing but a
strengthning and feeding of
his enemie, a fighting for that,
<pb facs="8"/>
which fighteth against his
soule. Since Satan hath cast
this seed of the Serpent into
our soules, there is no sin so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious,
but some seed of it
lurketh in our nature; It should
humble us, to heare what sins
are forbidden by <hi>Moses,</hi>
which if the Holy Ghost had
not mentioned, we might have
beene ashamed to heare of, they
are so dishonourable to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the very hearing of the
monstrous outrages committed
by men, given up of God, as it
yeelds matter of thanks to God
for preservation of us, so of
humility, to see our common
nature so abused, and abased by
sinne and Satan: Nay, so cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
is our Nature of sin, that
the mention of it, in stead of
stirring hatred of it, often kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
<pb facs="8"/>
Fancie to a liking of it:
the discovery of divellish po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies
and stratagems of wit,
though in some respects to good
purpose, yet hath no better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in some, than to fashion
their wits to the like false pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises;
and the innocencie of
many ariseth not from love of
that which is good, but from
not knowing of that which is
evill.</p>
   <p>And in nothing the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of sin appeares more
than in this, that it hindereth
all it can, the knowledge of it
selfe, and if it once be knowne,
it studieth extenuation, and
translation, upon others; sin and
shifting came into the world
together, in Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his
time, it seemes there were some
that were not afraid to father
<pb facs="9"/>
their temptations to sinne, upon
him that hateth it most, (God
himselfe) whereas God is only
said to try, not to tempt. Our
Adversaries are not far from
imputing this to God, who
maintaine Concupiscence, the
mother of all abominations, to
be a condition of Nature, as
first created, onely kept in, by
the bridle of originall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
that from hence, they
might the better maintaine
those proud opinions of perfect
fulfilling the Law, and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
therby. This moved Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> to set downe the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
and pedegree of sin; wee
our selves are both the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and the Tempted, as
Tempted, wee might deserve
some pity, if as Tempters wee
deserve not blame, in us there
<pb facs="9"/>
is both fire and matter for fire
to take hold on, Satan needs but
to blow, and often times not
that neither, for many, if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
stirre not up them,
they will stirre up to Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence.
So long as the soule
keepes close to God, and his
truth, it is safe, so long as our
way <hi>lieth above,</hi> we are free
<hi>from the Snares below,</hi> all
the danger first riseth, from
letting our hearts loose from
God by infidelity, for then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
our heart is drawn away
by some seeming good, whereby
we seeke a severed excellencie,
and contentment out of God, in
whom it is only to be had. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we have once forsaken God,
God forsakes us▪ leaving us, in
some degree, to our selves, the
worst guides that can be; and
<pb facs="10"/>
thereupon, Satan joynes forces
with us, setting upon us as a
friend, under our owne colours;
hee cannot but miscarry that
hath a Pirate for his guide.
This God suffereth, to make us
better knowne to our selves, for
by this meanes corruption, that
lay hid before, is drawne out,
and the deceitfulnesse of sinne
the better knowne, and so wee
are put upon the daily practice
of repentance and mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and driven to fly under the
wings of Iesus Christ. Were it
not for temptations, we should
be concealed from our selves,
our graces, as unexercised,
would not bee so bright, the
power of God should not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare;
so <hi>in our weaknesse,</hi> we
would not be so pitiful and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
towards others, nor so je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb facs="10"/>
over our owne hearts, nor
so skilfull of Satans method
and enterprises, we should not
see such a necessity of standing
alwayes upon our guard; but
though, by the over-ruling
power of God, they have this
good issue, yet that which is ill
of it selfe, is not to be ventured
on, for the good that commeth
by accident. The chiefe thing
wherein one Christian differs
from another, is watchfulnesse,
which though it require most
labour, yet it bringeth most
safety, and the best is no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
safe, than watchfull, and
not onely against sinnes, but
tentations, which are the seeds
of sinne, and occasions which
let in tentations, the best, by
rash adventures, upon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
have beene led into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb facs="11"/>
and by temptation, into
the sin it selfe: whence sin and
temptation come both under
the same name, to shew us that
we can bee no farther secure
from sinne, than we be carefull
to shun temptations. And in
this, every one should labour so
wel to understand themselves,
as to know what they finde a
temptation to them, that may
be a temptation to one, which
is not to another; <hi>Abraham</hi>
might looke upon the smoake
of Sodome, though <hi>Lot</hi> might
not, because that sight would
worke more upon <hi>Lots</hi> heart,
than <hi>Abrahams.</hi> In these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
a wise Christian better
knowes what to doe with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
than any can prescribe
him. And because God hath
our hearts in his hand, and can
<pb facs="11"/>
either suspend or give way to
temptations, it should move us
especially to take heed of those
sins, wherby grieving the good
Spirit of God, wee give him
cause to leave us to our owne
spirits, but that he may rather
stirre up contrary gracious lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings
in us, as a contrary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
There is nothing of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
force, to make us out of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
jealousie <hi>to feare alwayes:</hi>
Thus daily <hi>working out our
salvation,</hi> that God may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to goe along with us, and
be our Shield, and not to leave
us naked in the hands of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
but second his first Grace
with a further degree, as temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
shall encrease; it is he
that either removeth occasions,
or shutteth our hearts against
them, and giveth strength to
<pb facs="12"/>
prevaile over them, which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
providence you cannot be
too thankfull for; it is a great
mercy, when temptations are
not above the supply of strength
against them. This care onely
taketh up the heart of those,
who having the life of Christ
begun in them, and his Nature
stampt upon them, have felt
how sweet communion and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with God in Christ,
and how comfortable the daily
walking with God, is: these are
wary of any thing that may
draw away their hearts from
God, and hinder their peace.
And therefore they hate temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to sin, as sin it selfe, and
sinne, as hell it selfe, and hell
most of all, as being a state of
eternall separation from all
comfortable fellowship with
<pb facs="12"/>
God. A man that is a stranger
from the life of God, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
tentation to sin, as it is sin,
because hee never knew the
beauty of holines, but from the
beauty of a civill life he may
resist tentations to such sins as
may weaken respect, and from
love of his owne quiet, may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
from those sins that will
affright conscience. And the
cause why civil men feele lesse
disturbance from temptations,
is, because they are wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the power of temptation, til
God awaken their heart. What
danger they see not, they feare
not, the strong man holds his
possession in them, and is too
wise, by rowzing them out of
their sleepe to give them occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoughts of escape. None
more under the danger of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb facs="13"/>
than they that discerne
it not, they are Satans stales,
taken <hi>by him, at his pleasure,</hi>
whom Satan useth to draw
others into the same snare;
therefore Satan troubleth not
them, nor himselfe about them,
but a true Christian, feares a
temptation in every thing, his
chiefe care is, that in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
soever hee bee, it proves
not a temtation to him: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
indeed, are more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
called temptations,
than prosperity, because Satan
by them, breedeth an impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sorrow and feare, which
affections have an especiall
working upon us, in the course
of our lives, making us often
to for sake God, and desart his
cause; yet snares are laid in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing we deale with which
