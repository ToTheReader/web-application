   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>VSTVS LIPSIVS, a man of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning enough but too much levitye, hauing runne ouer all religions; and at last set vp his rest in <hi>Poperye:</hi> fell in his declining and doting dayes to open <hi>Idolatrye:</hi> And as he neuer troubled himselfe much with Christ in his life (whose very name a man shall seldome finde in his bookes) so at his end, wanting matter (it seemes) to magnifye Christ, he writes 2. books in praise and honour of 2. Idols: namely 2. old rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or 2. new forged pictures of a Woman with a Child in her armes. Which must needs be taken for pictures of our Ladye: Wherein the prophane wretch blusheth not to write, that at these 2. Images, there are more and greater miracles wrought, then the scriptures speake of to be done by Christ himselfe. A learned lowe-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye Diuine wondring that such Owles durst flye abroade at Noone light, and such tromperye be set to sale in these daies of knowledge, Wrote a short reproofe
<pb n="4" facs="4"/> of the impietyes, vttered in the first of these bookes, which is:</p>
   <q>De Ʋirgine Hallensi.</q>
   <p>Wherein, because the Iesuits were also touched, as being the Fathers of such fooleryes, and the makers of those bolts which such fooles as <hi>Lipsius</hi> do shoote: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon a Iesuite of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> calling himselfe <hi>Clarus Bonar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scius,</hi> (but his true name being, <hi>Carolus Scribanius</hi>) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon him in a Iesuiticall pride the generall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell of the whole order of Iesuits, vndertakes to defend their Innocencie, and their Honour (forsooth) against all the world: and to that end writes a booke, and cals it</p>
   <q>
      <p>
         <hi>The great Theater of the Jesuits Honour.</hi>
      </p>
      <p> Amphitheatrum Honoris.</p>
      <p> In quo Caluinistarum in Societatem crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones iugulatae.</p>
   </q>
   <p>Wherein, after many blasphemies against Christ: ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies &amp; sclanders against Princes: all kinde of lyes against our Ministers, and Professors: he comes at last to defend their freind <hi>Lipsius,</hi> and his legend of our Ladye of Hall: And after he hath abused him that wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, with all despightfull termes, and rayld most artificially, wherein he excels all other Iesuits, (<hi>Parsons</hi> excepted) as far as they, all other Papists: He makes a transition from rayling on men to playing with God: and from disgracing Princes to dallying with
<pb n="5" facs="4"/> Iesus Christ: and not onely defends the legend of <hi>Hall,</hi> Written by <hi>Lypsius,</hi> but further to shew his own devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he makes a Poeme, not to the honour of God, or of Christ the Mediator, But to our Ladye of <hi>Hall</hi> and the Childe Iesus. Wherein, whether the verse be better or the matter worse is hard to tell: But whether his deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein is greater to a Creature, or his blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie against the blood of the Mediator, let the Christian Reader Iudge, by the Poeme it selfe, which hereafter followeth.</p>
