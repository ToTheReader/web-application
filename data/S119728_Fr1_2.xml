                 <title>A discourse of the abuses novv in question in the churches of Christ : of their creeping in, growing vp, and flowrishing in the Babilonish Church of Rome, how they are spoken against not only by the scriptures, but also by the ancient fathers as long as there remayned any face of a true Church maintained by publique authority, and likewise by the lights of the Gospell, and blessed martyrs of late in the middest of the antichristian darknes.

   <head>THE PRINTER TO THE CHRISTIAN <hi>READER.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>CHristian Reader, it is well knowne to all men, how odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously the adversaries of the Churches reformation in England do accuse and defame the seekers of the said re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation with Noueltie, Singularity, Schisme, Error, and with many other such like most foull crimes. The iniquity and vntruth whereof, will through Gods blessing well appeare to euery one that shall read and pervse this present most profitable <hi>Discourse</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Wherein two maine and principall matters, to witt, The Inventions and Traditions of men in Church affayres, and the overreaching Clergy beyond the condition of ordinay Pastors, (wherevnto all the particulars now in controuersie are easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced) are observed in all ages and times since the Apostles to haue ben held by some godly persons and faithfull Witnesses of the truth to haue ben hainous transgressiōs against the ordinances of Christ in his New Testament. So that heerby men may see, that it is noe new thing, that the servants of Christ and the louers of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances should striue now against these Corruptions. For if this be Schismaticall now (I say, to striue against these Corruptions) then surely all the holy Martyrs and pillars of the Gospell in all ages past but chifly since the discovery of Antichrist) were Schismatiks. For they then travayled &amp; laboured (as by this Discourse we may see) in one and the same cause, wherin now the true seruants of Christ doe also labor. But if in former times those were faithfull men, &amp; the true louers of the Gospell of Christ, who hated all mens <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> in matters of the Church, then doubtles soe are these now;
<pb facs="3"/> and it will be manifest to all good men that they are wrongefully traduced and accused in such wise as is before mentioned.</p>
   <p>To which end and purpose this ancient Christian Gentlman hath worthily observed, gathered, and giuen out to the world (as his last service to God &amp; to his people) these testimonies of sundry old and new writers. The which comming vnto my hands, I could not in loue to thee (good Reader) but communicate the same vnto thee The rather considering how many thinges dayly are spoken &amp; written to the contrary by the adversaryes, to dazell the eyes of Gods people in these causes. The Lord Iesus inlighten the minds of all his true Children in all his wayes, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the way, the truth, and the life; and grant us his peace. Amen.</p>
