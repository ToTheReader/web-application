   <head>To the right honorable and my very good Lorde, Syr Iohn Pawlet Knight, Lorde S. Iohn, Leonarde Mascall wisheth prosperous health, with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall encrease of honour.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight honorable, among all sciences that may bee lightly obtayned, and among many goodly exercises and experiences for men, there is none (among the reast) more meete and requisite, or that more doth refresh the vital spirits of men, nor more engender admiration in the effectes of nature, or that is cause of greater recreation to the wearie and traueyled spirite of man, or more profitable to mans life, than is the skil of planting and graffing, the which not only we may see with our eyes, but also feele with our handes in the secret workes of nature: yea, nothing more discouereth vnto vs the great &amp; incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible worke of god, that of one litle Pepin sede, Nut or small plant, may come the selfesame herb or tree, &amp; to bring forth infinite of the same fruit, which also doth shine and shew forth it selfe vnto vs, especially in the spring time, by their diuersitie of shootes, blossoms &amp; buds, in diuers kindes of nature, by the goodnesse and mightie power of the great Lorde and Creator to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his people, in such thinges as commeth forth of the naturall earth, to nourishe, to sustayne and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our lyues. What greater pleasure can there be, than to smell the sweete odour of herbes, trees, and fruites, and to beholde the goodly colour of the same, which in certaine tymes of the yeare commeth foorth of the wombe of their mother and nourse, and so to vnderstande the secrete operation in the same. And to be short, of this labour (in our lyues) we do take part therof with great gaines and reuenues that come ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, where as through ydlenesse there commeth none:
<pb facs="3"/>
therefore to augment the same, it shall be good to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease and mittigate all fond delightes and vaine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, with such lyke vanities, and cleane put out and abolish the delightes of all vices. Wherefore the Poet sayth: let vs prayse the true labouring houre of the true labourer. Therevpon many great Lordes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble personages, haue left their theatres, pleasant stages, goodly pastimes, forsaking and despising their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, not much regarding rich Diademes, and costly perfumes, but haue giuen themselues to Planting and Graffing, and such like. In such sort, that if we should diligently search, and recite all the discourse of aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Histories, as of late dayes we should finde, that the most noble personages through their vertue, hath she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed many goodlye examples, as in one Theatre a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme degree honorable: nor haue had nothing more deare, more requisite, or more greatly in cōmendation, than Planting &amp; Graffing of fruit. <hi>Cyrus</hi> a great king of the Persians (as witnesse <hi>Xenophon,</hi>) did so much delite in the Art of planting &amp; graffing, (which did shew a great prayse and glorie vnto his personage,) that he had no greater desire or pleasure, than when he might occupy himselfe in Planting &amp; Graffing to garnish the earth, to place and order thereon certaine number of trees. The Emperour <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> (as doth recite, <hi>Sextus Aurelius Victor,</hi>) of his owne good will without any constraynt, did leaue the scepter of his Empire for to remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in the fieldes. So much pleasure did he take in planting of fruit, in making of Orchardes &amp; Gardens, which he did make, garnish, and finishe with his owne handes. The Senatours, Dictatours, and Consuls of the Romaynes, among all other things haue commended Planting and Graffing to bee one of the most flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing labours in this worlde for the common wealth, the which was celebrated and counted a great vertue:
<pb facs="3"/>
yea, they did so much esteeme it, that they did hang ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles thereof in diuers places, neuer thinking the tyme more aptly spent, than in Plāting &amp; Graffing, nothing more contenting themselues, nothing more deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any other affayres for the common wealth, than in setting, sowing or planting on the earth. How much we may prayse of late dayes and commend our trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers from other countreys, it is easie to be perceyued and knowne, but of Lords, Gentlemen, &amp; Merchants, which haue had (as it doth appeare) a great regarde in these latter dayes, howe they might folow the example of others: Wherby it hath replenished this our realme with diuers straunge Plants, Herbes, and Trees, very good and necessarie for the common wealth, not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore commonly knowne. And beholde, aboue all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours (for the common wealth) we ought to giue a sure and certaine iudgement, that Planting and Graffing is more highly to be commended and praysed, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other worthie and noble things in this worlde: for this Art hath not onely from tyme to tyme, beene put in vse and practise of labour through kings and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but also it hath bene put in writing of many great and worthie personages, in diuers kinde of languages, as in Greke by Philometor, Hieron, Acheleus, Orphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Musceus, Homer, Hosiode, Constantine, Cesar: and in Latin, by Verron, Caton, Columella, Paladius, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill, Amilius Macer, and in the Portingall tongue by king Attalus and Mago, (the which reciteth the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes) that after their death, the bookes of planting and graffing were brought to Rome, soone after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Carthage. Likewise howe many since haue written onely of zeale and loue for their countrey and common wealth, of the fruitfull arte of planting and graffing: yea of late dayes howe many worthie men by their learning haue written likewise thereof, shoulde
<pb facs="4"/>
seeme that it hath come from their auncesters, as the greatest honour, through the noble inuention of the same. Lykewise I dare boldely affirme, not onely the learned haue written, but also haue bene practisers and inuenters of the same, (as witnesseth diuers hystories) in diuers and many secrete thing, wherein I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, they haue not so learnedly, nor so exactly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but they haue more exactly taught and left in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng things so certaine, that their successours may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily marke, obserue, and keepe the same: for euery one hath written according to the nature of his countrey. The Greekes for Greece, the Barbarians for Barbarie, the Italians for Italy, the French men for Fraunce▪ &amp;c. which writing without the order and practise, doth very small profite for this our Realme of England, the which I can blame nothing more than the negligence of our nation, which hath had small care heretofore in planting and graffing, in some places of this realme (as I haue knowne) where as good and well disposed haue graffed, the euill and malicious person hath sone after destroyed them againe: but if we would endeuor our selues thervnto (as other countreys doe,) we might florish, and haue many a straunge kinde of fruit (which now we haue oftentimes the want thereof) that might greatly pleasure and serue manye wayes both for the rich and poore, as well as in Grece, Barbarie, Italy, or Fraunce, if our nation were giuen so well that way as they are.</p>
   <p>Right honourable, for so much as I haue bene long in declaring of our predecessours, I will nowe leaue, (troubling your honour any further) and rest from the other things accomplishing my desire, beseching your Lordship to take this my simple traueile in good part, requesting no other recompence for my paine herein, but wishing it might be put in a generall practise tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb facs="4"/>
this realme, whereby in small tyme it would grow vnto a great profite and commoditie both to the riche and poore, wherein I should thinke my selfe not onely happie, but also to haue a iust tribute for my desertes, and also this Realme might thereby receyue no small benefite, with prayse of other countreys, in folowing our predecessours in this arte of planting and graffing: some places of this Realme are greatly commended and praysed among others, as Kent for the chiefest, which vertue (notwithstanding) can not be cleane put out or forgoten, specially, when such as your honour shall seeme to fauour the same, and also to see the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde doyngs thereof, in such groundes and Lordships as ye doe possesse, the which at this time hath onely mooued me to attempt vnto your honor this my sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple trauaile, which is not the only dutie that I owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your honour, but as a dewe desert, not thinking my selfe halfe able to recompence your vertuous liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor shewing otherwayes howe to recompence the same, hath boldned me at this time to commende this my simple and rude worke vnto your Lordship, not according vnto your estate and honour, the which had bene more mete &amp; requisite to haue had the finishing of some better worke. Therfore beseching your honor to wey and accept this mine intent &amp; good will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which thing so doing, I shall thinke my selfe not onely happie, but it shall encourage me the more hereafter to take in hande the like or better worke. Thus I beseech the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God and creator, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease your prosperous ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with long lyfe in health.</p>
