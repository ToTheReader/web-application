   <p>I Have something to informe both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Author, the matter, and the translation of this discourse. For the first, that he was a <hi>French</hi> man, and a Lawyer, none will doubt but such as will not read; and that he followed the Court, and was of some eminency there, is sufficiently evident from one <note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ad fin.</hi>
      </note> passage of this worke. But as for his religion, though not absolutely certaine, yet, his many protestations make it more than probable he was no profess'd Protestant. Hee protests frequently not to meddle with controversies of faith, but points of Law and policie; not to oppose the Canons, but Decrees of the Councel of <hi>Trent;</hi> not to wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e in behalf of such as have separated from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (Protestants) but of good <hi>Catholiques,</hi> (hee meanes Papists.) And therefore I have adventured to allow him the name of <hi>Catholique,</hi> with the forename <hi>Roman</hi>; which they of that party will, in spite of all contradiction, needs pin upon their owne sleeves. For I am indifferently confident that for outward communion hee was a member of that Church, some of whose faults are here required to a reformation. As for ought that may bee surmis'd to the contrary, it will not worke much upon any that knowes the libertie of that people, who were never throughly broken to the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of <hi>Rome, I am domiti ut pareant, nondum ut serviant;</hi> and which hath ever bin more eminently conspicuous in those of that faculty whereof the Author is confessedly one. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb facs="4"/>
those many other writers which hee every where urgeth, and of whose testimonies the whole work main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consists, were in their times (ancient Councels and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers excepted) all, or most, knowne Papists: though some of them in these later daies have bin shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly censured for Schismaticall, because not altogether so transcendently Papall. Now for the furth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>r satisfaction of my selfe and others to those ordinary interrogatories, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>; it hath cost me some diligence to draw this <hi>Apelles</hi> from behind the curtaine. Some of my forraigne intelligencers return'd me little but a <hi>Non liquet,</hi> yet the learned Patron of the work shewed me first <note n="†" place="margin">In his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effereau,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques sur la responce au mystere d' iniquité.</hi> part. 1.

Now <hi>VVilliam Ranchin,</hi> (whom I conceive to be the man) was in his time a Doctour of Law, Counsellour to King HENRY the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> sometimes Fiscal Advocat in the Court of Aids at <hi>Occa,</hi> and afterwards A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>turney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall in the Soveraigne Court of Aids at <hi>Montpelier</hi>; one who by his workes in that kind hath deserved well of his profession. Thus much of the Author.</p>
   <p>As for the Work it selfe, it is now almost forty yeares since it was first published; the copyes are growne very rare and (it may be, therefore) deare even in <hi>Paris</hi>: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the love of their friends or the malice of their enemies hath made them so, I know not. It does strongly vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the rights of Christian Princes and the liberties of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches from the grand and yet growing usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Popes, and the bold attempts of pretended Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels. It shews the many hot skirmishes which Princes have beene put to for the preservation of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and how loath they were to part with them. It points at the meanes whereby the State spirituall stole up by degrees to such a height of temporall greatnesse. It un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the shame of that Popish <hi>Helena,</hi> the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>; by laying open the many nullities and injust pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of it. It shewes the weake, the no effects of those
<pb facs="4"/>
strong hopes of a reformation from it: and makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that what by the patients was so earnestly desired as a remedy, was by the fraudulence of the Physician turn'd to a worse disease. It fairely acquits their rejection of that Councell for matter of Discipline, (and why not therein ours for matter of Doctrine?) from the imputation of Schisme, as being driven to the necessity of abrogating that excessive power of the Pope, which hee could not bee brought to moderate: being both forced to shake off that heavy yoke which his ambition was unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, so long as our patience was willing to endure. And (though it be besides the purpose, if not against the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Authour) it ministers just grounds of questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the absolute infallibility of Popes and Councels in matters of faith. Who both joyntly and severally (it is to be fear'd) have been too dareing to entitle the Holy Ghost to their many weakly probable opinions, if not some er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. Whence it is that the present Church is as much pester'd with a glut of Councels, Canons, and Curses, as the Primitive was with heresies: under the weight of which burthen many weaker consciences, if they doe not quite sinke, cannot chuse but groane. Whence it is that the modest and sober libertie of re-examining any thing which hath been once decided, is utterly excluded: which notwithstanding most good men have in all ages beene willing to tolerate, many to desire, and some few bold to make use of. Amongst these few we may well reckon this Author for one. Far was He from the high un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitablenesse of those fierce and fiery spirits that scorn to goe to Heaven in the company of any that are called here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques by the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi>: that pronounce upon all men according as they find them devoted to this their <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>; making lesse conscience of a text of Scripture than a Canon of <hi>Trent</hi>; and like their heathen fore-fathers, <hi>Non alios judices quàm seipsos patientur.</hi> Lastly, this work presents us with many remarkable passages concerning our own Nation; where we may read our present h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ppinesse in our
<pb facs="5"/>
Ancestours miseries: for amongst all those authentique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, which are here recited of the Popes usurpations, I doe not finde any more wofull tragedies of his tyranny than such as were acted upon our Stage. No higher tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyes erected to his ambition, than here. No more rare examples of a devout abused patience, than ours, till ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme necessitie made us despaire into fortitude; when the avarice and exactions of <hi>Rome,</hi> having left us nothing else, to her griefe and our glory, at last robb'd us of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience too.</p>
   <p>Besides these there are other considerations in the work it selfe, which (it may bee) wrought a far far better judgement than mine owne to the approbation of it. In submission to which I have taken the paines to make it speake <hi>English</hi>; and that's all. For as for the quotations, (which might haply be expected from me) my other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments would not allow me strictly to examine them all, but so many as I sought did sufficiently confirme my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Authours fidelity in the rest. For adding more testimonies of my owne out of other authors in the like kinde and to the same effect, however I could fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have done it, yet I obtained so much of my selfe as to forbeare: being much abhorrent from ingaging my selfe in a quarrell of this nature, and creating an adversarie where I might fairely chuse to want one. For my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, I confesse, upon a second review, I finde I have been somewhere too pedantique and precise in keeping to the phrase of my Authour, and otherwhere I meet with a litle <hi>Patavinity</hi> of my owne. But for this I must tell my <hi>Pollio</hi> it was neither necessitie nor chance that cast me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; for I am here of his minde, <hi>Qui non ignoravit vitia sua, sed amavit.</hi> My greater feare is lest there be somethings in the matter which may bee lyable to a juster exception. Which, however they might have beene omitted by the Authour, could not so fairely bee left out by the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: This castrating of dead Authours being a piece of politique cruelty, which himselfe <note n="†" place="margin">
         <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</note> condemnes in their
<pb facs="5"/>
Church, and (I hope) is rarely practised in ours. I doe not deny but here are, amongst many which I could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, some passages which I had rather excuse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> such as need not be approved, yet might well enough bee prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Wee allow a stranger more libertie than a native: and in this consideration I held it a piece of injustice to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, so much violence to my Authour as to subdue him wholly to our domestique customes. Hee still speakes <hi>French</hi> in part, and retaines a few markes of his birth and breeding: yet such as can bee no eysore to those that will observe withall, how, when he barely relates the Lawes of his owne Countrie, he neither censures nor sets rules to ours. For what concernes the distinction of jurisdictions, there is a vast difference betwixt their State and ours. Here, though they are conveyed in severall channels, yet they are all derived from the same fountaine, the King. Whereas there, the Pope shares it with the Prince; and not content with his part, will needs ingrosse the whole. Hence those bitter complaints of the Authour against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Iudges, which, when he drives the naile up to the head, fasten lastly all upon his Holynesse. Thus farre I thought fit to fortifie against future mistakes; knowing that what was well meant might be ill taken; and that it is not ever in the fates of innocency to bee exempt from misconstruction. For other peccadillos I am not very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to excuse them; hopeing that the judicious Readers will not much bogle at them, and the ordinary (it may bee) never observe them; nor doe I meane they shall bee beholding to me for the knowledge of them further than by this intimation: which perhaps may whet some dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler capacities to a sharper enquirie after them, such as thinke they are bound in conscience to finde a crime, because I confesse the possibilitie of a fault: and will be ready to straine at Gnats, who without this caution would have swallowed Camels. And yet I feare there will not want some among them that will receive those things with applause, which I desire may passe with
<pb facs="6"/>
pardon. Nay (it may bee) if the Authour were que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd for some places, the <hi>most</hi> (I doe not say the <hi>best</hi>) would bee content to absolve him, if not ready to reward him. But the Translatour professeth his name in another cense; and is not so sollicitous to please <hi>those,</hi> as answere <hi>these</hi>: to whose graver judgements hee submits both himselfe and these his weake endeavours, in a modest confidence of their candid interpretation.</p>
