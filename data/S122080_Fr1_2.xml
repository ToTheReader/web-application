      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hiles I desired to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late your happy Returne with some worthy present; I fel vpon this: which I dare not only offer, but commend; the royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest Philosopher and wisest king, giuing you those precepts, which the Spirit of God gaue him. The matter is all his;
<pb facs="3"/>
nothing is mine, but the methode; which I doe willingly submit to censure. In that he could not erre: In this, I cannot but haue erred; either in art, or applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or sense, or disorder, or defect: yet not wilfully. I haue meant it well, and faithfully to the Church of God, &amp; to your Honor, as one of her great hopes. If any man shall cauill that I haue gone about to correct <hi>Salomons</hi> order, or to controule <hi>Ezekias</hi> seruants: I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine both of his charity, and wisdom; and appeale more lawefull iudgement: Let him aswell say, that euery Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance peruerts the Text. I haue only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to be the common-place-booke of that great king, and to referre his diuine rules to their heads, for more ease of finding, for better memory, for readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er vse. See, how that God, whose wisdom thought good to bereaue mankinde of <hi>Salomons</hi> profounde commentaries of Nature, hath reserued these his diuine Morals, to out-liue the world; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="3"/>
that those would but feed mans cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositie, these would both direct his life, and iudge it. Hee hath not done this without expectation of our good, and glory to himselfe: which if wee answere, the gaine is ours. I know how little need there is, either to intreat your Lo: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, or to aduise your vse. It is enough to haue humbly presented them to your hands; and through them to the Church: the desire of whose good, is my good; yea, my recompence and glory. The same God, whose hand hath led and returned you in safetie, from all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine euils: guide your wayes at home, &amp; gratiously increase you in the ground of all true honor; Goodnesse. My praiers shall euer follow you:</p>
