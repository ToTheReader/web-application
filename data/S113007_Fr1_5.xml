   <p>AFter I had finished my Former Booke, of the possibility and conuenience of the Reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of oure blessed Sauiour in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>charist, my especiall frende (whō for loue I loue, &amp; for vertue I reuerence) who was the cause of penning therof, insisted vehemently with me, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to an other woorke, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe the worthie disposition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they ought to come who attend to reape the manifould fruites &amp; trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of this Sacrifice &amp; Sacrament. His request for many respects, I could not nor woulde not resist, not onely for the reasons he brought, because the other serued for speculation, this for practtise: the other for deeper Iudg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes, this for meaner capacities, the other tended to informe the vnder standinge, this to moue affections: but also in regard of my owne proper exercyse &amp; deuotion to the blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament: that whyle I endeuored to teach others, I might instruct my self,
<pb facs="5"/> &amp; lyke the water man, who by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his boate forward, makethe his owne iournay: so I by stirring others to seruour, mighte enioy some heate therof my selfe. Yet I neuer minded, to let thē come to sight of the world but only to some particuler frendes, till he assured me of the great good he expected therof to many soules most pretious in gods sight, whose authori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie I permitted to weigh down mine owne Iudgment, &amp; preuaile against myne owne reason, thinkinge that as god did refresh &amp; reuiue Sampson by <note place="margin">Iudic. 15</note> sending forth a spring of cleare water from an assesiawe, as he made a crow the cater and cooke of Elias, as with <note place="margin">3. Reg. 17.</note> the rurall meates &amp; rustick cates pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for Abacuckes reapers, he fed his deare Prophet Daniell, &amp; as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <note place="margin">Da. 14.</note> often with vnfitt instrumentes, he wrought wonderous effectes: so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he might doe by me, whom as vnworthy, he admitted to breake the substance of his Sacrament to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, so he would directe to showe them the maner of eating, to whose ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour
<pb facs="5"/> &amp; glory, I referr them both.</p>
   <p>I am also to aduertyse thee, howe theese meditations, passe in prolixity mine accustomed maner of writinge, yet because I Iudged, they woulde not only helpe a man to receiue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly, but also further him in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spirituall exercyses: I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to folowe my frendes aduyse, who demed the treatise better, when the discourse was fuller.</p>
   <p>Some I know woulde desyre an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parte hereunto ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oyned, as an accomplishment of the whole, that is a Discourse of the frequent vse of this Sacrament; but I thought it superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, because he that reade the these 2 bokes, &amp; weigheth as he oughte the inestimable &amp; superexcellente riches communicated to them that deuoutly communicate, &amp; besides his own frail<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie, the temptations of the deuill, the euill examples and occasions of the world, if he may frequent this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment often &amp; will not, I hould him either verie vnwise, or very vitious: For who is he that feelethe him selfe woun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="6"/> to the harte, and will not seeke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> phisition, at whose handes he were sure to receiue a present remedy? Were it not a follie to perswade this man with many reasons to looke for such a phisition to procure such a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditine, <note place="margin">4. Reg. 5.</note> when Naaman Syrus came so far a iournay with vncertenty to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his leprosie? Were it not mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to perswade a man that were not madde, feelinge him selfe starue for hunger, to eate meate set before him? Were is not doultishnes to exhorte a prisoner cheaned &amp; fettered, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his libertie? Wer it not a want of sense, to perswade the blynde to desyre to see, the deafe to heare, the ignorante to be wyse, if they mighte come by those giftes of nature so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selie as we may by lyke giftes of grace communicatinge as we oughte, with due preparation &amp; denotion?</p>
   <p>He therfore that will peruse the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond treatise, if, as he readeth, he weigh the matter maturely, ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with the balance of catholicke iudgmente, he shall not neede much
<pb facs="6"/> more to induce him, to eate of this foode, as necessary for the soule, as meate for the body.</p>
   <p>Lastly when I cyre my booke of the possibilitie &amp; conueniency of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presence, for breuitie sake I call it the booke of causes of the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that the most part therof is Spente, in declariuge 42. causes of the institution. Moreouer for that myne intention in settinge forth this discourse, was to helpe good catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes to communicate deuoutly and religiously, therfore lest the lengthe of the book should terrifye them and bringe a loathsomnes (as though eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry tyme they communicate, it weare necessary to transcourse the whole tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise) I haue at the end drawne a table where in one prospect, who haith red it once ouer, may call to Memory those heades and pointes that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite. I haue also in two woordes, Feare, and Faithe, comprehended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moste, the substance of the first and last treatise. The seconde is reduced to diuers Chapters, euery one ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ing
<pb facs="7"/> for a particuler receiuing of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament, so that perceiuinge what the woords represent &amp; reading one Chapter, a man may sufficiently though not condingly, prepare him selfe to the Bl. Saccrament.</p>
