   <head>The Author to the gentle Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am constrained (gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) before I go any further to make this request vnto thee. That wheresoeuer thou shalt chance in the reading of this little trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, to finde any faults or escapes either in the print, or in the matter (as there be too many) thou wilt either friendly beare with them, or else curteously amend them with thy penne. And if it be so, that any posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or assumption in any part of my boke doe seeme strange vnto thee (as manye things may doe peraduenture at the first blush, especially being vttered in these dainty daies) that thou wilt of thy friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly curtesie, and zeale which thou bearest to the truth, to the glorie of God, to good letters, and to the edification of the church of GOD, either expunge them with thy penne, qualifie them with the oile of thy
<pb facs="7"/>
fauorable iudgement, or else at the least so to construe &amp; interpret them as they both may stand with the truth, with the time, and with the minde, good meaning, and intent of the author, whose minde was (I call heauen and earth to witnesse) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit all, and to offend none. And therefore if any bee offended at any thing in this booke, it is <hi>Scandalum acceptum, non da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> Offense taken, not giuen. For the auoiding whereof (God is my iudge, who knoweth the secrets of all harts) I haue abstained from some things which I ought to haue spoken of, and othersome which I haue spoken of, I haue so qualified, that I may seeme rather to beare with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the time, than the truth of the cause, aud rather to loue any thing better than schismes &amp; dissentions in the church of GOD, about matters of small impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Therefore (good Reader) in christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charitie I beseech thee to respect my simple meaning, which was to set foorth the glorie of Christ Iesus, and the truth of his word, to the edifieng of his militant church vpon the earth, and withall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the marke that I shoot at (namelie,
<pb facs="8"/>
to insinuate the truth, and to weede out all corruptions, &amp;c.) the end, and purpose of my drift, and to defend this little booke against flouting <hi>Momus,</hi> bragging <hi>Thrasos,</hi> and wrangling <hi>Phormions, Quibus omnia bona odio habentur,</hi> to whom al good things are had in contempt. Thus I commit thee to God (most Christian reader) and to the power of his might, who blesse thee with all graces spirituall and corporall in this life, that long maist thou read, and much maist thou profit, and in the end grant thee eternall life in the heauens, thy inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance purchased with the bodie of Christ Iesus, to whom be praise, glorie, honour, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in all congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for euer. Amen.</p>
