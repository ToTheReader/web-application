   <head>Vpon Master WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, the <hi>Deceased Authour, and his</hi> POEMS.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>POets are borne not made, when I would prove</l>
      <l>This truth, the glad rememberance I must love</l>
      <l>Of never dying <hi>Shakespeare,</hi> who alone,</l>
      <l>Is argument enough to make that one.</l>
      <l>First, that he was a Poet none would doubt,</l>
      <l>That heard th'applause of what he sees set out</l>
      <l>Imprinted; where thou hast (I will not say)</l>
      <l>Reader his Workes for to contrive a Play:</l>
      <l>To him twas none) the patterne of all wit,</l>
      <l>Art without Art unparaleld as yet.</l>
      <l>Next Nature onely helpt him, for looke thorow</l>
      <l>This whole Booke, thou shalt find he doth not borrow,</l>
      <l>One phrase from Greekes, nor Latines imitate,</l>
      <l>Nor once from vulgar Languages Translate,</l>
      <l>Nor Plagiari-like from others gleane,</l>
      <l>Nor begges he from each witty friend a Scene</l>
      <l>To peece his Acts with, all that he doth write,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="4"/>Is pure his owne, plot, language exquisite,</l>
      <l>But oh! what praise more powerfull can we give</l>
      <l>The dead, then that by him the Kings men live,</l>
      <l>His Players, which should they but have shar'd the Fate,</l>
      <l>All else expir'd within the short Termes date;</l>
      <l>How could the Globe have prospered, since through want</l>
      <l>Of change, the Plaies and Poems had growne scant.</l>
      <l>But happy Verse thou shalt be sung and heard,</l>
      <l>When hungry quills shall be such honour bard.</l>
      <l>Then vanish upstart Writers to each Stage,</l>
      <l>You needy Poetasters of this Age,</l>
      <l>Where <hi>Shakespeare</hi> liv'd or spake, Vermine forbeare,</l>
      <l>Least with your froth you spot them, come not neere;</l>
      <l>But if you needs must write, if poverty</l>
      <l>So pinch, that otherwise you starve and die,</l>
      <l>On Gods name may the Bull or Cockpit have</l>
      <l>Your lame blancke Verse, to keepe you from the grave:</l>
      <l>Or let new Fortunes younger brethren see,</l>
      <l>What they can picke from your leane industry.</l>
      <l>I doe not wonder when you offer at</l>
      <l>Blacke-Friers, that you suffer: tis the fate</l>
      <l>Of richer veines, prime judgements that have far'd</l>
      <l>The worse, with this deceased man compar'd.</l>
      <l>So have I seene, when Cesar would appeare,</l>
      <l>And on the Stage at halfe-sword parley were,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius:</hi> oh how the Audience,</l>
      <l>Were ravish'd, with what wonder they went thence,</l>
      <l>When some new day they would not brooke a line,</l>
      <l>Of tedious (though well laboured) <hi>Catilines;</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Sejanus</hi> too was irkesome, they priz'de more</l>
      <l>Honest <hi>Iago,</hi> or the jealous Moore.</l>
      <l>And though the Fox and subtill Alchimist,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="4"/>Long intermitted could not quite be mist,</l>
      <l>Though these have sham'd all the Ancients, and might raise,</l>
      <l>Their Authours merit with a crowne of Bayes.</l>
      <l>Yet these sometimes, even at a friends desire</l>
      <l>Acted, have scarce defrai'd the Seacoale fire</l>
      <l>And doore-keepers: when let but <hi>Falstaffe</hi> come,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Hall, Peines,</hi> the rest you scarce shall have a roome</l>
      <l>All is so pester'd: let but <hi>Beatrice</hi>
      </l>
      <l>And <hi>Benedicke</hi> be seene, loe in a trice</l>
      <l>The Cockpit Galleries, Boxes, all are full</l>
      <l>To heare <hi>Maluoglio</hi> that crosse garter'd Gull.</l>
      <l>Briefe, there is nothing in his wit fraught Booke,</l>
      <l>Whose sound we would not heare, on whose worth looke</l>
      <l>Like old coynd gold, whose lines in every page,</l>
      <l>Shall passe true currant to succeeding age.</l>
      <l>But why doe I dead <hi>Sheakspeares</hi> praise recite,</l>
      <l>Some second <hi>Shakespeare</hi> must of <hi>Shakespeare</hi> write;</l>
      <l>For me tis needlesse, since an host of men,</l>
      <l>Will pay to clap his praise, to free my Pen.</l>
