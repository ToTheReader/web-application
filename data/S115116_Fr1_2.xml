   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the breeding of this small Bodie of <hi>Short-writing</hi> I aymed at the husbanding of the Hand (as of Time and Place) that it might not with distorted Characts be discustomed from good formes of vsuall Letters; and to that end of the selected particles of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall structures, I haue composed part of my <hi>Alphabet,</hi> which with a few short Rules (of the due disposure of the Characters) comprised in two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, containes in effect the whole Art. Touching th' steeme of the Method, the iudicious may satisfie himselfe, put it to the Test, and determine of the difference
<pb facs="3"/> twixt it and other formes, both for ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie compassing and for speedie, close, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and pleasant dispatch. For the Angles, Breaches, Passages, Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and other Dimensions in this and in all other writings, are so manifest to the Eye (of iudgement) that a meere stranger to the Art may plainely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the compendious and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious frame of words, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be a competent iudge of the most actiue, swift, and close penship of seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Inuentions resolued vnto him by exemplarie demonstration. But these cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious incorporations of Letters varied into diuers Spellings by ordinary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, by Incorporation, by Implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doe varie one and the same Writ into seuerall expressions, and so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily incumber the Lexion. A shrewd incumbrance sure, when a iudicious Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor stands alwaies prest at elbow (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at each hand one) to trayne and teach to spell and speake, I meane the
<pb facs="3"/> sence of the Place by precedent and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent dependence, which at an instant doth trace out, lead and tread the road<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to the Reading, and clearely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse all difficulties, which indeed are nothing (for matter of intrication, but rather the very praise of the Inuention, if duly estimated) to the various Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in euery language attributed to the selfe same words, which carrying identitie of sound and composure, doe yet transferre the sence to farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent significations, without any impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of confusion or imperfection to the Tongue. And all these difficulties (admit them such) are easily salued, and halfe the fourth Chapter, and all the fifth saued by applying my Letters to those formes of <hi>Short-writing,</hi> which intimate regionarie Vowels by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitie of Consonants (not by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingence) as mine doth many times, and to which no Alphabet can be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate; for then all coniunctions of
<pb facs="4"/> Characters will be meere Incorporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sans Implication of Vowellage or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trication of the Lecture. But I haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined my selfe to a more exact Method, which recompenseth th'expence of some few more minutes (which yet I may not graunt) borrowed to th'attayning of this <hi>Theorie</hi> with the profitable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of many houres gaine in the <hi>Praxis,</hi> rather than for the idle fond esteeme of a small measure of truant Time (once to be lent but oft repaied with loane) be alwaies bound to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and exorbitant Wanders, which are growne tedious both in Writs and Wits. For euery Practique hath its Art, and euery Art its Compendium, which built vpon a few selected Bases, balks all circulating Complements as deuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and extrauagants, if they pursue not the direct Medium to the Meta in Quest. In approuement of which Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise my Pen (to post to the Post-writ) pitches period with craue of friendly
<pb facs="4"/> entertaine, which obtained shall euer oblige me to challenge the grand Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion S. <hi>George</hi> himselfe to afford thee the like at <hi>Stamford,</hi> where Post-sure the Post-les Posture of one of vs (though neither disclayme the Post) thou mayest finde at <hi>Exeter</hi> Inne, where sans Rest I rest</p>
