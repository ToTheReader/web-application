                 <title>A report of the kingdome of Congo, a region of Africa : And of the countries that border rounde about the same. 1. Wherein is also shewed, that the two zones torrida &amp; frigida, are not onely habitable, but inhabited, and very temperate, contrary to the opinion of the old philosophers. 2. That the blacke colour which is in the skinnes of the Ethiopians and Negroes &amp;c. proceedeth not from the sunne. 3. And that the Riuer Nilus springeth not out of the mountains of the Moone, as hath been heretofore beleeued: together with the true cause of the rising and increasing thereof. 4. Besides the description of diuers plants, fishes and beastes, that are found in those countries. Drawen out of the writinges and discourses of Odoardo Lopez a Portingall, by Philippo Pigafetta. Translated out of Italian by Abraham Hartwell</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost Reuerend Father,
my singular good and
gracious Lorde: In all
humble dutie I do offer
to your grace this poor
and slender present, <hi>in auspicium nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centis
anni,</hi> which I doe most hartely
pray, may bee as happie and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
both for your health and quiet


<pb facs="4"/>
gouernement, as (thanks be to God)
your latter yeares haue beene. It is a
description of a certaine Region or
Kingdome in <hi>Africa,</hi> called <hi>Congo,</hi>
whose name is as yet scarce knowen
to our quarters of <hi>Europe,</hi> neyther is
there any great or solemne mention
of it in any bookes that haue beene
published of that Third parte of the
old World. And because this treatise
doeth comprehend not onely the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and disposition of the <hi>Moci-Conghi,</hi>
which are the naturall inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantes
and people of <hi>Congo,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with all the commodities and
trafficke of that Countrey, very fitte
and pleasaunt to be reade, but also the
religion which they professed, and
by what meanes it pleased God to
draw them from <hi>Paganisme</hi> to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity:</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
I thought good thus to make
it knowen to my countreymen of
<hi>England,</hi> to the end it might be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
for such valiant English, as do
earnestly thirst and desire to atchieue
the conquest of rude and barbarous
Nations, that they doo not attempt
those actions for commodity of Gold
and Siluer, and for other transitorie
or worldly respectes, but that they
woulde first seeke the Kingdome of
God, &amp; the saluation of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
soules, which the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
of mankinde still detayneth in
ignorance: and then all other thinges
shall be put in their mouthes aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
as may bee seene by the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingalles</hi>
in this narration. Written it
was by one <hi>Philippo Pigafetta,</hi> an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
and a very good Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,


<pb facs="5"/>
from the mouth of one <hi>Lopez</hi> a
<hi>Portingal,</hi> together with two maps,
the one particular of <hi>Congo,</hi> the other
generall of all <hi>Africa,</hi> and especially
of the <hi>Westerne</hi> Coast, from 34. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
beyond the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes,
downe along to the <hi>Cape</hi> of
<hi>Good-Hope</hi> in the <hi>South,</hi> and so vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
againe on the <hi>Easterne</hi> Coast
by the great Island of <hi>Madagascar,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
called the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>S. Laurence,</hi>
til you come to the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Socotora,</hi> &amp;
then to the <hi>Redde Sea,</hi> and from <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
into the Inland <hi>Southwards</hi> to the
Empire of <hi>Presbiter-Iohn.</hi> I beseech
your grace to accept of this my poore
trauell, and I will not cease to pray to
Almightie God, according to my
dutie, that hee will multiply many
good years vpon you, vnder the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

gouernment of our most gracious
&amp; soueraigne Lady Queene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth:
wherevnto the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande</hi>
is bound to say, Amen. From
