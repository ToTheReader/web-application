      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey who put to sea, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their severall scopes &amp; purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, so doe they steere their Compasses, &amp; proceed in their travells ansvvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablely. Such as sett out meerely to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy their pleasure, or some private end; vvhen once the heavens begyn to be besett vvith clouds, the vvynds grovve high, &amp; the storme approaching threatens appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent danger, vvhen their companyes are scattered &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from them, or vvhen the foulenes of their stomacks and the noysome humors ther, cause, that they cannot brooke the sea, but vvith much taedious disquiet &amp; sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; They turne their courses &amp; make to shoare vvith as much speede as they may.</p>
   <p>Others vvho seriously intend to make a voyage of it, &amp; are bound for some remote place, &amp; resolved to fetch some precious commodityes from a farr country; they reckon vpon hazards, expect the common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of the sea, &amp; determyne to vndergoe, vvhat ever
<pb facs="10"/>
they doe expect, or shall befall. The conclusion is: vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they are to adventure the losse of their lives, but not vvilling, to loose their voyage, therfore on they vvill: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream necessityes may overbeare them, but no feares can discourage them in ther course.</p>
   <p>As thus it fares in traveling, so fares it also, vvith men in professing the truth; their aymes are severall, &amp; their proceedings sutable therunto: Some take up the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the truth, as a voyage of pleasure: &amp; such vvill be sure, to sayle no further, then that they may see the smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of their ovvn chymneyes: they vvill serveChrist no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then they may serve ther ovvne turnes, and therfore such vvill have no more of the gospell, then they may have their ovvne private vvith it, not only vvithin sight, but vvithin reach: And its admirable to see, vvhat falsenes they discover in ther course, &amp; yet vvhat fayre colores, they putt upon all their procedings, &amp; vvould beare the vvorld in hand, they vvyshnothing but soundnes, vvhen indeed ther is nothing but shevves &amp; appearances, to please a sensuall eye:</p>
   <p>Its not amisse therfore, to take the scantling of both these kinds, that the Iudicious Reader may be able to ovvne them as they appeare in his vvay, either in their vvritings, or behaviours: for the lives of men are
<pb facs="10"/>
like living books, vvhich a vvise man vvill serch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, &amp; observe: To this purposse therfore vve shall shortly consider: 1 vvhat is the cause of this declyning? 2 vvhat be the pretenses, vvherby they labor to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it?</p>
   <p>The cause of this declining, is the entertaynment of the truth upon false grounds: The apple vvhich is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound at the coar, vvill discover rottennes in the skinne aftervvards: vvhen the foundation is not sure the vvhol frame vvil synke,<note place="margin">

   <p>
      <pb facs="11"/>These comforts in <hi>Temporaries,</hi> are like the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; complexion, vvhich is layd upon the face by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed harlotts, vvhich the least violence of cold, or heat takes off immediatly; vvhereas, a sound joy issuing from grounded assurance, is like ruddy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, vvhich ariseth from good blood, &amp; a vvholsom constitution, vvhich the greatest heats or colds may increase, but cannot remoove as long as life &amp; strength lasteth:</p>

         <hi>13 Luk 24. 8 Math. 20.</hi>
      </note> thus the Pharisee vvould not to heaven vnlesse he might go in the crovvd. Or because of the safty &amp; commodity vvhich the Lord somtimes voutsafes to sincere Professors. Thus many turned Ievvs in Esters tyme,<note place="margin">

      </note> not because they vvere the better, but the stronger party; not for the truth of their profession, but for the safty of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.<note place="margin">
         <hi>6 Ihon. 26.</hi>
      </note> These attend upon <hi>Christ for the loaves</hi> and follovv the gospel no longer then profit follovves them. The name of a prison, the noyse of a chaine, makes the truth so deformed in their eye, that they dare not, &amp; therfore vvil not ovvne it. As the leaves of a tree, vvhyle they be fed vvith moysture, dravvne up in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

and cold frost drive back the moysture, they vvither &amp; fall. Like these leaves, is the love of these vvordly gospellers. An instance of this temper is apparant in many of our <hi>Elizabeth Professors</hi> (as they are termed) vvho vvere vvhot at the entrance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, vvhen company, credit, &amp; profite vvere atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants to it: but vvhen the frovvnes &amp; displeasure of authority, like vvynter blasts, plucked avvay their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings &amp; dignities vvhich vvere as the moysture, to feed their desires, they dried avvay in their <hi>(discretion)</hi> &amp; reteined nothing but the name of <hi>auncient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,</hi> like boxes in Apothecaryes shops, vvhich cary fayre titles on the outsyde, &amp; fill up roome, but have not one healing or usefull drugge in them.</p>
   <p>A third sort ther be,<note place="margin">

      </note> vvho at the first appearing of the gospel in a place, are taken up vvith the strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and novelty, eyther of the Doctryne, or the manner of delivery, &amp; ansvverablely vvith some affection make inquiry after it. This vvas their practise, vvhen Iohn Baptist came preaching in the vvildernes,<note place="margin">

      </note>
      <hi>Then vvent out to him Hierusalem, &amp; all Iudea, &amp; all the Region about Iordan.</hi> This also our Saviour acknovvledged as ther indeavor.<note place="margin">

   </p>
   <p>It befalls the Gospell in this case, as it doth vvith some strange commodity: vvhen it first comes to vievv, many see &amp; cheapen, until the price proves too heavy, &amp; then they depart &amp; vvill not buy: So here: vvhen our Saviour sets open the sale of the gospel, in som ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure place, many vvil be comers, hearers, Cheapners, until they finde that the vvord grovves somvvhat high rated, &amp; the conditions of the Gospel seeme too hard, &amp; then they for sake it.

      </note>Others lastly, after some sad conviction of the truth revealed, as also of the necessity and excellency therof, hold it a poynt of honor, to persevere in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense &amp; maintenance of it: and hence for their ovvne prayse, may, &amp; doe Suffer heavy persecutions, as, <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, Exile</hi> in the profession of the truth, the povver vvher of they never approved in the exactnes of it.</p>

   <p>For ther is a nick of temptation, vvhich stuttes the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of these temporizing hypocrites, &amp; discovers them
<pb facs="12"/>
in their colours: &amp; hence it is, that these of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> his generation, could endure banishment, because that hyndred not, but promoted their honor in that kynd of suffering: yet vvhen they came into place of suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, fell to beating of their fellovv brethren, as conceaving the strictnes of their course, caryed a condemnation of their carelesse and pompous sensuality.</p>

   <p>All this I speake, not that I vvould fall out vvith any, vvho is not of the same opinion vvith my self: for I prosesse the contrary, in a vvord of truth: every man abounds in his ovvne sense: Only this seemes somvvhat greiuous, &amp; I conceave also injurious to the truth, that after all hard dealing, she cannot gett an indifferent hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Seing it is the fashion of the vvorld, to have mens persons in admiration, to gayne some countenance therby to their ovvne courses, And therfore to blovv up the fame of mens abilityes, (as they do bladders) to the utmost greatnes they can, that the greater vvarrant they may seeme to have, to follovv their opinions &amp; vvayes. And contraryvvise, the person must be disparaged, vvhen vve vvould have his cause, or vvork come into discredit: a fashionable, but a shame lesse peice of Rhetorick: Thus the vvriting of the Repl: must be <hi>a pamphlet,</hi> his manner of vvriting <hi>

vvere so misshapen in their first frame: vhereas the ansvveare of the Rei: must be lifted up &amp; proclaymed, vvorthy, learned, &amp; judicions: vvhich puts me in mynd of Demetrius his out-crye: 19. Acts: 28. <hi>Great is Diana of the Ephesians:</hi>

   <p>Not that I envy the Drs. Honor, or vvould diminish any thing of his due, but I cannot endure davvbing, much lesse that the prayse of men, should be advanced, to the praejudice of the truth. Laying aside therfore-all prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, &amp; partiality, cast vve the proceedings of the Repl: &amp; Reioy. into the scales of righteous consideration, &amp; vvhere the blame most appeares, let the Reader lay it on, &amp; let-him beare it, to vvhom it is due by desert: And in this search, let no man think, I intend or seek the Rej. his dishonor, for my vvitnes is in heaven, I doe not; nay I dare not doe it. I knovv the righteous judge vvould require it: but it is for the manifestation of truth, and innocency, vvhere ever it is to be found.</p>

   <p>Synnes also are of sundry kynds some are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, some are publike: both these agayne, are lesser scandalls: or more hainous &amp; Capitall Crymes, vvhich threaten apparant hazard to the publike good of a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, or the prosperous successe of the Gospell: Novv out of these distinctions, such conclusions may easily be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, vvhich may give ansvver to the first quaestion, so far as concernes our purpose: &amp; these be 3.</p>

   <p>These be the vvitnesses, vvhich I haue to produce out of the Rej. his ovvne vvritings. All that I desire is, that their depositions may be impartially vveighed, &amp; in this desire, &amp; indeavour, ther is no vvrong done to any rule of piety or charity.</p>
   <p>VVe haue also the Rej. his open practise, as an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant evidence, to contradict vvhat himself professeth in his Praeface, touching the constancy of his opinion, about the <hi>inconveniency onely</hi> of these Cerem: hovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he beares the vvorld in hand to the contrary, &amp; that vvith great confidence: To vvhich purpose, vve intreat the follovving Allegations may be indifferently heard, from those, vvho as vvitnesses can testify his vvalking by their experience.</p>

passionately by him, nor forged by me; he hath left the proof of them, under his ovvne hand upon record, vvhich I novv haue by me, &amp; shall be bould, for fuller satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to sett dovvne his ovvne mynde in his ovvne vvords.</p>
   <p>In the 19. pag. of the Praeface: The Rej. expresseth him self on this manner, <hi>I doe ingeniously confesse tvvo errors in that my Apology; one that I trusted too much to the quotations of the Abridgement, vvhich then I had in vvriting:</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To vvhich M<seg rend="sup">r.</seg> Hildersham thus replyes in his notes: Hovv false the quotations are in the Abridgement, vvill be seene hereafter. But this is manifestly false that he vvas (before the vvriting of his Apologye) decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therby, or that he had a Copy of it in vvriting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that tyme. For the Abrigdement vvas not made till after he vvas deprived: &amp; therfore no man could haue any coppy of it, either in print or vvriting. Nay the large book (vvhere of it is an Abridgement,) vvas not delivered to his Majesty before that day he vvas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived; &amp; the Abridgement vvas made sundry months after. He proceeds Ibid: 19. p. Its true that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters vvere resolved to haue chosen him for one of those three, that should haue disputed for them, (such profession he had made unto them of his full consent
<pb facs="36"/>
vvith them in judgement,) &amp; he had beene one of the disputants, if that (not the Deane of the Chappell; but) the King himself, had not expressely (in his message) excepted agaynst him: vvhich also argues, that his Majesty did hold him to be fully of the mynd, that the rest (vvho had sent him the foresayd book) vvere of.</p>
   <p>In his notes of the 20. pag: he hath these vvords. That ther is no colour of truth in this that he sayth here: i. e. (That vvhen he vvas chosen to be one of those, that should mayntaine their cause by disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he professed to his Brethren, that he could not speake against the things as unlavvfull; but only as inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient) may appeare evidently to any reasonable man. For seing they had in their book delivered to his Majes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty our Kings Father, stated the quaestion not against the inconveniency, but the unlavvfulnes of these things. VVho vvill imagyne, they Vvould euer haue chosen him to be one of the 3 to dispute for them, if he had professed to them at that tyme, that he had nothing to say agaynst the unlavvfulnes of them? These be the dying vvords of that deare servant of God, as I haue them to shovve in black &amp; vvhite.</p>
   <p>If yet the vvitnes of the dead deserue no credit:
<pb facs="36"/>
The Rej. may vvith some small consideration, recall to mynd, hovv after the Revolt, or change of his former opinion, in an occasionall concurrence &amp; meeting of many fellovv Brethren; vvhen they out of humane Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility desired him to take his place according to his yeares &amp; gifts; I say, he may (if he vvill bethink himself) easily recall, vvhat vvords he then openly uttered to this, or like effect: He told thē he vvas unvvorthy to sitt vvith them; to haue respect from thē, since he had betrayed them, &amp; <hi>their cause.</hi> Novv the cause vvhich they mayntayned vvas not inconveniency: but unlavvfulnes in these things. If the Rej. his memory serue him not about this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, let him repayre to Bambury syde to his auncient friends there, &amp; they can testify so much to his face. If then the construction that the King, &amp; state, made of his course, the apprehension his fellovv Brethren had of his practise: nay his ovvne profession may be trusted: Lett all the vvorld, &amp; D<seg rend="sup">r.</seg> Burgesse his ovvne heart judge, vvhether he hath changed his opinion yea, or no?</p>
   <p>In his praeface, ther is not much that expects ansvver. For to omitt his biting language, &amp; devouring vvords, vvhere vvith vve haue cloyed the Reader in the foregoing Catalogue, and unto vvhich ranke many Gibes here may be referred: as That pag. 5. These do commonly call any small company of their party:
<pb facs="37"/>
      <hi>The Church</hi> &amp; <hi>the Christians of such a tovvne.</hi> As if Christ vvere (I say not <hi>divided amongst us) but vvholly</hi> taken avvay from <hi>us, to them,</hi> &amp; vvhat vvants this of Schisme in the heart, <hi>And that: pa. 9.

All vvhich being justly blamed, it neither hurts the cause against vvhich he vvrites, nor helps that vvhich he defends, since the most glorious Gospell of Christ hath such blotts cast upon it, by reason of the sinfull vveaknesses of some, vvho take up the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion therof; Leaving (I say) all these, as not vvorthy the consideration, vve shall intreat the Rej. at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to giue some satisfaction to these quaeres.</p>

That this is the disposition of many, I can speake by proof, I vvould haue the Rej. speake to the reason of it.</p>
   <p n="3">3. VVhen it is notorious to all the English vvorld, that the most of the people (vvho liue in the bosome of the Church, &amp; professe the fayth) be vvholly taken up vvith conformity, both approving &amp; practising of it, countenancing those that do it: VVhy is the Doctor so troubled, that a fevv silly despicable people, voyd of vvisdome (nay if his former charges be true) voyd of grace, should distast the Ceremonyes; vvhen I knovv no Iudicious Non-conformer, is disquieted that the crovvde of the formall Gospellers should imbrace them? vvhyle the Rej. is searching the reason of these things, it may chance, he may either search or see his ovvne heart somvvhat more clearely. Leaving then these to his consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
<pb facs="38"/>
Proceed vve a little to survay the praeface, &amp; the substance of it may be referred to three heads. 1. He char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Non-conformity to be cause of many mischeifes.
2. He debates the cure, &amp; administreth that, vvhich he conceaved most meet for redresse. 3. He makes a defense for himself, &amp; vvriting: Agaynst all vvhich vve eycept thus.</p>
   <list>
      <item>1. That his charge is not just.</item>
      <item>2. His dealing in the cure not playne &amp; through.</item>
      <item>3. His defense in that vvhere the stresse lyes, either not equall, or not sufficient.</item>
   </list>
   <p>Come vve to skanne the particulars: The mischeifs, vvhich he conceaues to issue from Non-conformity are no lesse then <hi>Seperation &amp; prophanesse.</hi> A heavy charge, I confesse, but the best is, his reasons haue not the vvayt of a rush.</p>
   <p n="1">1. That of seperation, p. 5. is supported upon so slender a grounde, that he bevvrayes only his desire to haue sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed his povver: therfore Rhetoricates in stead of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning. <hi>If these (sayth he) be Idolatrous vvill vvorshipps; hovv can you? hovv dare you ioyne vvith us, in those acts of Religion vvherein these are used?</hi>

   <p>That Other charge of <hi>prophanenesse</hi> p. 6. pretended to come from praecisenes, is so strange a consequence, that it can hardly vvith deliberation, be fathered upon <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> vvithout <hi>Non-conscience.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For strictnesse in matters of Cerem. hath no more force, to bring forth loosenes in matters of substance; then zeale in matters of faith, &amp; charity hath to bring forth carelessnes of both, nay then pure Religion hath, to breed Atheisme.</p>
   <p>Goe vve to <hi>experience:</hi> vievv the places vvhere Non-conformists liue; the people vvhom they teach▪ the vvayes of those vvith vvhom they vvalk; vvho they be that haue reference to, &amp; dependence upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> their persons, or ministeryes; &amp; I suppose the vvalls of the Churches, &amp; the stones of the streets, vvill giue testimony agaynst this accusation. Nay I suppose, I may speake it truly, as I professe, I think it, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one Non-conformable minister, hath beene a meanes under God, to bring more soules to grace &amp; heauen; then all the Cloysters, or Cathedralls in all England in the same time, vvhere all Conformity hath beene the dayly diet, &amp; liuelehood, of the people.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="39"/>Goe vve to <hi>reason</hi>: the best that either the Rej. or any beside, can make of our Cerem: is, that they are things indifferent. Novv that vveake ones may doubt &amp; stagger about such, That doubting, they ought not to practise them 14. Rom: last vers: is made a duty. That mens vvalking according to conscience, should be the cause of others disobedience; That keeping the lavv, should be an occasion in it self of prophaning the lavv; that stopping the very appearance of the least evill, should sett open a gappe to the greatest; I appeale to any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable man vvhether it be not a consequence voyd of common sense, unlesse men haue a miraculous skill to soder quicksilver, or tysande together, or make heauen &amp; earth meet!</p>
   <p>Last of all, it is remarkable that Doctor Burgesse himself pa. 8. doth impute these mischeifes unto <hi>civill vvarr about Ceremonies:</hi> vvhich if it be vvell vveighed, it vvill manifest too much prejudice, in his former discourse. For in Civill vvarrs, the mischeifs ensuing on them, are not vvont to be charged upon one part alone, &amp; that poore, passive, overpovvred, obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to the suffering of vvhat-soever pressures their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites please to lay upon them, vvhich is the Case of the Non-conformists in these Commotions: Tell us I pray
<pb facs="40"/>
yovv, if in your conscience, <hi>the Praelats Canons, courses, Courts, &amp; proceedings,</hi> haue had no hand in vvorking mischeife? nay diverse of these mischeifes, vvhich you haue affectedly placed on the other syde?</p>
   <p>If <hi>non-residents, double treble beneficed men, unable, perverse, scandalous, half-Popish Ministers,</hi> haue not had a finger in them? If those <hi>trumpetours, &amp; drummers,</hi> vvho proclayme the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, &amp; justnesse of our Prelats proceedings, haue not brought something to the furtherance of these mischeifes? If you speake your conscience, it must needs say, yes; &amp;, so confesse, it vvas your passion, not your judgement, that obtruded all upon Non-conformity.</p>
   <p>The state of this vvarr is this: vvee (as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Christians) stand upon the sufficiency of Christs institutions, for all kynde of vvorship: and that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusively, the vvord,</hi> (say vve,) &amp; <hi>nothing but the vvord, in matters of Religious vvorship.</hi> The Praelats rise up on the other side, &amp; vvill needs haue us allovve, &amp; use certayne humane Ceremonyes of Religion in our Christian vvorship. VVe desire to be excused, as houlding them unlavvfull. Christ vve knovv: &amp; all that cometh from him, vve are ready to imbrace. But these human Cerem: in divine vvorship vve knovv
<pb facs="40"/>
not, nor can haue any thing to doe vvith them; upon this they make feirce vvarr upon us, &amp; yet by the penne of D. B. lay all the fault of this vvarr, &amp; the mischiefes of it, upon our backs. Novv all yee that passe by, consider, &amp; judge, vvhat aequity is used, in such dealing? They vvill say, all things are to be done <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently &amp; in order.</hi> To vvhich vve vvillingly consent, but alledge agayne, that vve cannot apprehend these Cerem: to be necessary for order, &amp; decency. They (as our Lords) tell us, it is enough for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, that <hi>They</hi> esteeme them so. Our Consciences tell us, this is to usurp the place of God, vvhat can vve say lesse, then that vve vvill follovve our Consciences, rather then their vvills?</p>
   <p>To conclude, the Rej. p. 285. maketh <hi>Circumcision</hi> lavvfull to be imposed, upon the same grounds, that our English Cerem: stand on. Novv if it should please our Prelats in a Convocation to apoynt, that all English men should consent to the cutting of their fore-skins, &amp; denounce vvarr upon those that should refuse this goodly Canon; vvas it not a graue Accusation, to lay all the mischiefes of such a vvarr, upon those vvhich vvould not conforme to such a Ceremony? But the vveakest must alvvayes goe to the vvall, &amp; the Lamb
<pb facs="41"/>
must dye for troubling the vvater, if it please the Lyon so to determine it.</p>
   <p>VVe haue done vvith the disease, &amp; mischeife to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vvith the cause of it. Vve are novv come to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Remedy the D<seg rend="sup">r.</seg> administers: &amp; vve except agaynst his dealing herein as not playne; nay not profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, even by his ovvne rules.</p>

vvhich if he durst not declare, he durst not doe his duty. And that I may fasten this nayle yet more fully, I thus force the conclusion.</p>

      <p>VVhat ever duty of any calling, the vvord teacheth; that the Minister by the vvord ought to judge, determine, &amp; deliver. Else hovv can he teach the vvholl counsell of God? hovv can he giue every one his portion?</p>
      <p>But the dutyes, and doings (if good) of all Magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates the vvord teacheth.</p>
      <p>Ergo the Minister ought to judge, &amp; determyne of those, by the vvord, &amp; so deliver them. Ergo it doth not belonge to those <hi>onely,</hi> vvho haue povver, &amp; are in place, to judge &amp; determine; vvhich vvas the Doctors assertion.</p>
      <p>Agayne: vvhat ever God commands, that, and all that, the Minister should teach: &amp; so judge, &amp; determine, else the trumpet should give an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayne sound.</p>
      <p>But vvhat ever men, or Magistrates ought to doe, that Christ hath commanded. Both the parts of the argument are in 28. Math: last v. therfore the conclusion follovves: vvhat ever men, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates ought to doe, Ministers should teach,
<pb facs="42"/>
and consequently judge, and determine.</p>

And its marvellous to see, hovv conviction vvrests truth from a man, even agaynst his ovvne passion, &amp; purpose. vveigh these tvvo passages, &amp; see if they vvill accord?</p>
   <p>
      <hi>The Doctor must vvrite, that he may not be vvrought out of the hearts of his people. pag. 11. And yet he confesseth by vvriting, he hath vvrought himselfe out of the hearts of the godly.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>His defense to the 2. obj: is yet more feeble, though more ingenious: For his ansvvere is nothing but yeilding the cause, in some compasse and circumlocution of vvords.</p>
   <p>For (1) vvhen he graunts: that he forbore some yeares this course of vvriting, that he might not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate authority: he privily, yea playnly yeilds, the objection had such rationall face in it, that it did not only presse him, but prevayle vvith him also: vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re as 2.<seg rend="sup">ly.</seg> he adds: that by this meanes he hath some hope <hi>to persvvade some to conforme, &amp; so to avoyd the lash of authority.</hi> By this he doth not only yeild the objection, but confirme &amp; establish it. For if only those, vvho are persvvaded by his ansvvere, shall avoyd the lash, therfore they vvho vvill not be persvvaded, must expect the blovv, and shall be sure to feele it.</p>
   <p n="3">
      <pb facs="44"/>3. He <hi>adds for his ovvne intention: Sure I am that I desire not the vexation of any sober man:</hi> But his ovvne bond vvill not be taken, because he hath so often broke his vvord; he must seek for other sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes: <hi>(Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam?</hi>) Little povver have vvords to persvvade any of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon understanding, vvhen the practise goes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vvay. Nor yet can I discerne, hovv to judge of any mans desire, but only by his indeavour. Those heavy accusations, uncharitable censures, vvherby he chargeth &amp; that vvith much bitternes, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Non-conformists, from vvhat root they come, &amp; vvhat desire they imply, let any rational man determine: For it cannot be to ingratiate them, or procure favor for them, in the affections of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, vvhen he makes them appeare such as deserve none; nay such as ought to receyve none, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary at their hands.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Lastly vvhen it is objected: That this course hinders the removeall of these things, vvhich authority othervvise might possibly remove;</hi> His defense is; <hi>That he vvill never beleive, that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority vvill remove them, vvith dishonor of it
<pb facs="44"/>
self, as yeilding the things to be unlavvfull, vvhich it hath so long mayntayned.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In vvhich ansvver: these tvvo particulars offer themselves to consideration.</p>
   <list>
      <item>1. To remove Cerem: as unlavvfull, being long mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned is a dishoner to Authority.</item>
      <item>2. D.B. beleives, authority vvill not thus dishonor it self.</item>
   </list>
   <p>Ansvv: The first of vvhich is a most dangerous assertion; &amp; is made a cheife barr to stay Papists, &amp; others from reforming of any thing, that others haue op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, &amp; they defended: And its usuall in the mouth of false flatterers, &amp; back freinds to all reformation: &amp; I vvould hope that D.B. did utter more in this, by his penne, then he meant in his heart. Beside the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are not so dangerous, but the ground is as vveake For the long continuance, or mayntenance of a thing, if evill &amp; unlavvfull, is so farr from bringing dishonor upon any, for the removeall of it, that retayning therof, encreaseth both his sinne, &amp; shame: &amp; it argues a greater measure of humility &amp; povver of grace to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it.</p>
   <p>Nay, vvere the thing lavvfull, if yet by circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it did appeare, that Gods Honor, the common good,
<pb facs="45"/>
the aedification of our brethren, might more be promoted by the remoueall of it, though it vvere hoary headed vvith antiquity &amp; continuance, it argued greatest love to God &amp; man to alter it, rather then to keepe it in use: &amp; that vvould bring greatest honor to him that should so doe; since by the verdict of Gods Spirit, he is most honorable, that most honoreth God.</p>
   <p n="2">2. From these grounds, hovv rotten &amp; unsavory the second particular of the Rej. his defense is, vvill easily be graunted. For if in such a remoueall, the duty of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority doth consist, the povver of grace doth appeare, the glory of God, &amp; good of the Church &amp; common vvealth, vvill be advanced; To be of that beleife vvith D. B. that Magistrates vvill never be brought to doe vvhat they ought, hovv uncharitable is it thus to lay their honor in the dust? And not to presse them hereunto, vvhen vve may, &amp; by our calling, ought, hovv unconscionable is it? And hovv contrary to that loue vve ovve to the Almighty, &amp; our Governours?</p>
   <p>The crovvd of objections, vvhich he makes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himself, I conceyve, as so many Strugglings of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, vvhich stood in the vvay, to vvithstand him in his course. His conscience, as it should seeme, gaue the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nsett, &amp; let in some such intimations as these to him.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="45"/>VVhy is not Popery coming in fast enough; but you must make a preparation thereunto: yea become a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer, &amp; harbenger to make Roome, &amp; lay in provision for it? Is it not sufficient, that the vvicket is sett open, that the Popish pack may be dravvne in; but you must sett open the great gate, that a Sumpter horse may amble in vvith a load of reliques &amp; Cerem? For if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Church be so enlarged, to appoynt Cerem: at their pleasure, to admonish and teach, and it is in their povver to appoynt vvhat, &amp; hovv many, as seemes good to them; vvhy then let images be erected, let cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses &amp; Crucifixes be sett up in every corner. These are lavvfull admonitors, &amp; instructers, &amp; vve cannot haue too many good Companions, to putt us in mynd of our duties.</p>
   <p>Consider beside, hovv many poore Ministers are under pressure, some fled, some imprisoned, many suspended, themselues &amp; families undone. VVhy vvill you not suffer them to lye in the dust, but vvill you trample upon them, even unto death? Is it not enough, they make brick, but must they be beaten also? Oh consider, as before the Lord, to vvhom you must giue an account. Doe you vvell to blovv the fire in the Chymny, vvhyle the flame is in the thach? Is not the fury of the BB.
<pb facs="46"/>
yet feirce enough, their rage sharpe enough, but you must sett them on, and strenghthen their hands, to strike har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der? lastly, is not <hi>Cringing at Altars, bovving at the name of Iesus,</hi> like to be brought in, &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised vvith great forvvardnes, &amp; vvill you, dare you encorage, in such courses, yea giue an approbation and commendation to them? For they vvill say, they are but significant Cerem: they place no merit, putt no effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in them, only they are admonitors of our dutyes. Thus is the foundation of superstition layd, the Gospell Stopped, and an open vvay made for Popery, and you are the persvvader, the encorager, yea defender of all these: hovv vill you ansvver this at the great day?</p>
   <p>Yet do I not speake this, as though I vvere troubled, vvith the vveight of any thing he hath vvritt. For I professe unfaynedly the vvay of his traverse fynds vvelcome vvith me; vvherin the nakednes, &amp; inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiblenes of his cause I hope vvill be discovered. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one thing I vvould most earnestly intreat, that he vvould shovv us but fayre play in these proceedings: to vvitt, that he vvould not breake our heads, vvhyle others haue bound our hands: Lett him but graunt us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different termes, euen the common curtesy of the court, an impertiall pleading: vve desire no more favour then the cause by its ovvne credit vvill procure: Lett the larv
<pb facs="46"/>
be open, as the rigour of Iustice allovves: To vvhich pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose shall he so far prevayle vvith his Lord BB. that vve may enjoy, the use of our books, the liberty of the presse, &amp; if not the benefit of our charges, yet freedome of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our native soyle, &amp; vvith our poore desolate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; And I dare promise him he shall not vvant those, that vvill joyne issue vvith him, in this traverse, either by vvriting, or printing, &amp; that vvithout any gaudy expressions, (vvherof he accuseth M<seg rend="sup">r.</seg> Parker) but by playe dynt of Syllogisme: &amp; vve vvill take our oaths, as he in desireth, that each man of us shall vvrite his conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. vvhich I vvonder vvhy the D<seg rend="sup">r.</seg> putt in, since its openly knovvne to all that vvill not shutt their eyes, that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science doeth not liue &amp; dye alone vvith conformable men. But if vve neither haue, nor he vvill procure us leaue, or liberty, either to preach, or vvrite, or print, yea scarce to liue; then he must knovve, vve are denied the benefitt of the lavv, &amp; the Curtesy of the Court &amp; in vayne he braggs of his traverse.</p>
   <p>To pursue all the particulars objected, &amp; ansvvered in his ovvne beshalf, is not vvorth the vvhyle, since no vveight of the cause lyes ther upon: Only one <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> here vented by the Rej. is not to be borne: vvhich is observably sett dovvne in the <hi>14. ob: D. Burges. hath parted vvith more profitt, by taking up
<pb facs="47"/>
conformity, and a benefice, then any novv in England hath done by his unconformity, and losse of a benefice.</hi> Surely he myndeth not so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately as he should, the affliction of his brethren. VVhat did D. B. part vvith? Nothing but future, contingent, uncertayne profitt: vvhich made him liable to be envied, and opposed by the colledge of phisitions; Profitt, vvhich vvas not necessary to his life &amp; being, depending upon extraordinary paynes: such as in all probability, he could not haue long indured, or at least vvith contentement of mynd. His Pshisick prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise made that change, vvhich Tully commendeth in Merchandize: <hi>Satiata quaestu, vel contenta po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, ut saepe ex alto, in portum, sic ex ipso portu, se in agros possessionesque contulit. After suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient gettings, it forsooke both sea &amp; sea-hauen, and betooke it self to quietnesse and plentie in the countrie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>On the other side, vvhat haue not? vvhat do not men loose by unconformity? Even all their meanes of living; all their liberty, not only of providing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, &amp; their families; but even of breathing in any ayre, saving onely that, vvhich may be dravven out of stinking prisons. Nay somtyme all the Commodity of
<pb facs="47"/>
their Country, or Nationall habitation; being forced to flye euen unto the indians for safety, to say nothing of their losse of life it selfe, by cruell imprisonments Novv let our Saviour judge betvvixt us, &amp; D.B. The poore vvidovv (sayth he) that parted but vvith tvvo mites, parted vvith more then they did, vvho out of their plenty, parted vvith many sheckells, because those tvvo mites vvere all that she had.</p>
   <p>If this be true, then many &amp; many a one hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vvith more profitt for Non-conformity, then D. B. did for Conformity, for soe much as they haue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vvith, <hi>all they had,</hi> &amp; he only vvith part of that vvhich he had, or might haue hoped to gett, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous in comparison of that, vvhich others haue lost. To conclude all, I suppose if vve vvere vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to suffer, vve should be more vvilling, both to search, &amp; see the truth, &amp; I doubt not, but the Lord vvould settle the hearts of such, &amp; blesse their indeauors in that behalfe. All that I vvould craue at thy hands (Christian reader) is this, that thou vvouldest read vvithout prejudice, and judge vvithout partiality; judge not the person, or cause of the distressed the vvorse, because of their pressure or paucity.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="48"/>VVelcome Christ vvith his crosse, any truth though vvith trouble. Be vvilling the truth should fall on any side as vvorthy to be prised &amp; loued for it selfe. That is all I desire for my money: &amp; Religion, conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, reason vvill not denie this.</p>
