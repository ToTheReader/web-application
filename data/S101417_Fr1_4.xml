   <head>To the deuoute Readers, which <hi>desire to keepe Faith and a good</hi> Conscience to the end, Grace, and Peace, and strength, against Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations by IESVS CHRIST.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ARVAILE</hi> not (deere Christians and courteous Readers) that so many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diuines and holy minded men, bestow so much paines, and spend so long time, in so sad and vnpleasant a subiect as this is; searching and desirous to define what the impardonable sinne against the holy Ghost should be: For euen as the best and most approued Phisitians doe more busie themselues in studying those mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which are most incurable, rather then those, for which euery emperick hath a medecine in readinesse, and cach one amongst them proueth himselfe in his skill, if hee haue sound out eyther some especiall Antidote to preuent, or some singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar remedy (if not perfectly to cure, yet) to ease and aswage the tormenting paines of such desperat disseases as aflict men most, as well with the feare of imminent death, as with the sence of present dolours: Euen so, for as much as all heede is to be giuen, and all diligence carefully vsed, that no man (if it be possible) dash vpon this Rocke, nor fall into so deuouring a deepe; many students in diuinitie, enflamed with zeale, care, and loue vnto mens saluation, refuse no paines, nor think any labour grieuous, by night or day, if they may be so happie,
<pb facs="8"/>
as to giue warning betimes, and so preuent any mans relapse, or falling away: And for as much as many true hearted Christians, vpon a tendernesse of Conscience, through Satans illusions, are often troubled with a feare of hauing offended in this kinde: And others againe, in a continuall securitie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking their first loue, reuolt and fall off, by little and little, from the practise of sincere Piety, taking the high way to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurisme, and denyall of their profession, and so come neere and into great daunger of finall relapse at lest, if not of an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred also, and despight of that holy truth which they once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed: therefore good men willing to comfort the one, with solid euidence of Gods word, and to reclaime and saue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the perill of so irrecouerable a fall, doe labour in this sad subiect, that by an exact deciphering of that mortall sinne, both might finde fit instruction, whilest the one may see how farre they are from it, and the other perceiue how daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously they hasten towards it.</p>
   <p>Now as men are diuersly affected, some with feare, and some with presumption (as I haue shewed) so likewise we may finde very great, (yea too much) variety of opinion amongst writers concerning this sinne, some supposing it to be so rarely and seldome admitted, as scarce three examples or foure can be produced since the beginning of the World, others make it so frequent and vsuall, as almost all that finally fall from their Faith and holy profession, are supposed, by them, to sinne in this kinde.</p>
   <p>Againe, some are of opinion, that only God can discerne, who they be, that sinke and are drowned in this gulfe; as if he had not reuealed any certainty concerning this matter, and thereupon shunne and reiect all meditation vpon this point, and Argument, as vaine and vncertaine. I am not worthy neyther will I take vpon me to censure great and learned men, but let it be seriously considered, how much and how often mention is made in Gods word, of this fearefull fall and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plight, that men are brought into thereby, and we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily guesse that the Lord would not haue vs vtterly ignorant of it: And let vs weigh and obserue the fruit, and great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb facs="8"/>
which Gods people, by a sober and wise meditation hereof may reape, and it may be iudged, that their labour is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, who warily and with iudgement, write and preach to that purpose For, as Mariners cannot easily shunne the gulfe nor rock, except they know (or at lest can guesse) whereabouts the daunger is; No more is it likely that a Christian professor should liue absolutely without the perill or feare of this, so fearefull a sinne, in some probable sort, vnlesse he be warned thereof by such as doe study the point of purpose.</p>
   <p>It is more then manifest, that the danger of such a relapse is very great, and that our vigilancy and care of auoiding it ought to be no lesse, and lastly considering the drowsie securitie of this age, the present decay of zeale, the vtter neglect of the meanes to quicken it, that no argument is of more necessary and profitable vse to be preached or published, then this at this time, wherein many hanging, as it were, in suspence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, are ready, whatsoeuer shall ensue, with <hi>Demas</hi> to embrace the present world, and so politickly, in the meane while, doe carry themselues, that which way soeuer they shall hereafter thinke good to incline, yet they shall not be deemed Apostataes: But let them for all that (as it were vpon this publique warning) examine themselues, whether their hearts and Consciences bee not plainely and euidently euinced of the truth of the Gospell, against Atheisme, Papisme, Turcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, Iudaisme, or whatsoeuer Gentilisme, or other sect, and if so, then consider, whether the reuolt from the knowne truth, will not prooue as haynous a fault in Gods sight, for all their couert carriage, as heauy a clogge to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, as deepe a downefall from Grace, and as wilfull a losse of the tast of the power of the world to come, as if they had professed it in the forwardest manner, or rather let them feare lest, whilst they (in worldly wisedome) vsing cautelous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection to prouide for a change, doe not palpably bewray, that they receiue not the loue of the truth, together with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, and so declare plainly, that they are of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those, vpon whom God, in his iust iudgement, will send strong delusion to beleeue lies. The Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
<pb facs="9"/>
neuer vndertooke the profession of Christ, as of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Messias; yet because they were euidently conuinced by his word and workes, that he it was, that was to come, Christ spareth not to call their wilfull reluctation and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against him, blasphemie against the Spirit; And I could wish, that such wary walkers in neutralitie, would vouchsafe to peruse this short treatise, which tendeth to admonish them at least, that they outstand not the time of Grace, but rather feare, least being forsaken, and lest in a Reprobate sence (when they would) they shall not bee able to embrace and apply to themselues, what they once knew and had learned and so fall to despight both God and good men. This let all men know and take notice of that no time nor age since the dayes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, hath beene more likely to bring forth plentie of pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants in this kinde, then this we liue in. First, knowledge did neuer so abound, not onlie amongst the learned, but euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the lay-vulgar, by the cleere light and plentifull prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell▪ Secondly, this knowledge hath begotten an vniuersall profession and forme of outward Godlines, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men giue consent to the Truth, preached and manifested vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Thirdly, this generall consent hath bred a forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in many, shewing in probabilitie their hearts affected with that which they professe, and to haue attained a taste of the heauenly gift, as the Apostle speaketh: From such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and measure of knowledge and Grace, if any should fall as (if greater heede be not taken) it may be feared s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>me will, especially, if that should come to passe, which those Politicians before spoken of doe prepare for, and want of zeale in others doth deserue. How deepe should they sinke into this Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and how neere might we iudge them vnto this sinne? Cast your eyes back a little, and looke vnto the Histories of former times, and for want of other bookes concerning more ancient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the primitiue Church, take notice only of the defection after King <hi>Edwards</hi> daies: How many seeming forward professors, during the liberty of the Gospell (in a moment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most) not only forsooke their sinceritie, but also became vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent persecutors of that themselues professed, whose desperate
<pb facs="9"/>
ends in that their wilfull Apostasie, without any remorse at all pronouncing damnation vpon themselues, with horrible blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, and he<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lish despight against God, declare manifestly, that their fall was scarefull, and their sinne vnpa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>donable. Now, although we haue none other cause (blessed bee God) giuen to vs, to feare or suspect any such defection or change, but only our owne sinnes, deseruing such a plague, yet are not their labours vaine and to no purpose, which giue warning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that men looke to their standing, and take heede that they fall not. Sathan is subtle, and mens hearts are deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full out of measure, and some without any such cause giuen, may be taken with a sudden spirituall Apoplexie, and fall headlong at once, not only into the loue and practise of sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie, but also into the hatred of that grace of God, which teacheth them to deny all vngodlinesse, and worldly lusts, and to liue Godly, righteously and soberly in this present world.</p>
   <p>And some others, though they fall not at once, like a man that flingeth himselfe downe headlong from the top of a Rocke or steeple, may be so carelesse of their estate, as by insensible back sliding, through the deceiptfulnesse of sinne, they may depart away from the liuing God, and being once gone, fall into <hi>Saul</hi> his case the sonne of <hi>Cis,</hi> who quite berest of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace, had an euill spirit sent to terment him. Or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like the Apothecaries Gl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sse or Gally▪pet, which being emptied by now and then a little, of some precious or speciall Cordiall is sitted to receiue venome or poyson: And if any doe stand and be preserued out of such temptations; these and such like ende<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uours that exhort, admonish, and rebuke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, may truely be said to be the Antidotes, and blessed meanes of preuention, and they that desire to stand and not to fall, ought to vse them reuerently, and with thankes to God, who, of his infinite mercies, vseth mens ministeries vnto the preseruation of mens soules.</p>
   <p>And to the end that all true holy-minded Christians may better keepe watch and ward against Satans sleights and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties, this one secret is worthy obseruing: To take great heede continually by all meanes, to nourish and increase the
<pb facs="10"/>
peace of Conscience, and ioy in the holy Ghost. For as these are the last and principall graces men attaine vnto by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell, so are they the first, which such as fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way doe commonly loose, whereupon the blessed Apostle, with very great reason encouraging the <hi>Philippians</hi> against imminent troubles assureth them, that the peace of God which passeth all vnderstanding <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> shall be a guard or Garison to their hearts, and to their minds, implying, that peace with God, and ioy in the holy Ghost, are present rewards of holinesse, effects of true Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, earnest pennies of the rewarde to come, and therefore principall encouragements vnto Constancie and Perseuerance in all well d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eing, wherefore in a word, this is it I would say, that our aduersary the Deuill will especially labour, and vse his whole cunning, to bereaue men eyther, of these, very Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themselues, or of the sence of them, which is easily done by drawing them into wilfull sinnes, which defile the Conscience, and disturbe the peace therof. Vpon the losse of the reward (as labourers and souldiers doe more negligently applie themselues when they are doubtfull of their pay▪ so) men grow lesse care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of holy duties, and doe not so much delight in them; why? But euen because, by the defiling of their Consciences, they doe not finde their wonted comfort in such exercises: So the meanes of renewing their Repentance dis-vsed, or lesse fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, by neglect of the meanes the heart growes into hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, sinne into custome, and disquietnesse of Conscience into a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>umbdnesse or <hi>non-sense,</hi> then must needes both Faith and Hope faile, the losse whereof, that it might be lesse felt▪ Satan offereth carnall delights in sensualitie and pleasures, then God and the world to come beginne to be forgotten; sinceritie and strictnesse of Life beginne to be intollerable; Loosenesse and liberty plausible, admonitions odious, all manner of lewdenesse iustifiable, Gods word hated, and messengers persecuted, and how little differeth this fearefull reuolt, from the sinne against the holy Ghost? The effect whereof, and iust punishment can be none other but finall despayre in the man, and horrible blasphemies against God and his Christ, with a despighting of
<pb facs="10"/>
his spirit of Grace, and so at last euerlasting torments in hell fire. Behold then both the ladder (as I may say) whereby menascend, and the rope, whereby they fall or descend into this Dungeon; men climbe, and attaine to some taste and smack of the powers of the world to come, which I call peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and ioy in the holy Ghost, by these steppes. First, their mind and vnderstanding, by the preaching of the word, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened with the knowledge of the Mysterie of Christ. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the will and reason consenteth. Thirdly, the heart imbraceth and applieth vnto a measure of Faith, and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Fourthly, the affections beginne to frame into obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Fiftly, the life and conuersation is fashioned to the outward forme of Godlinesse. Sixtly, the Conscience is at peace and the inward man ioyeth: Now the manner of relapse, or descent, is downe the same way. Ioy and peace of Conscience are lost through some wilfull sinne. Secondly, the life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation growes worse and worse. Thirdly, the affections are altered from delight in holinesse, and loosed from obedience. Fourthly, Faith fayleth, and Repentance giuen euer. Fiftly, the benefit by Christ, despised. Sixtly, a great decay of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg followeth, through the contempt of the meanes, and so the man is giuen vp vnto a Reprobate sense, whereby God and goodnesse and all their worshippers despighted and persecuted: As euery one therefore loueth his soule, and longeth for salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Christ, and delighteth in the assurance thereof; so let him beware and take heed of defiling and disquieting his cosc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with wilfull sins, or if he be fallen by Satan circūuented, let him giue way and diligent heed to the word, for his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery by repentance; let him in no case suffer himself to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from the company and fellowship of faithfull admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers; let him vse the helpe of their prayers vnto God for him; let him abandon carnall companions, and worldly vanities and delights, to the end that he may more humble his soule before God; let him euen force himselfe vnto spirituall and heauenly meditation, and other godly exercises of Religion, and if not withstanding all this, his heart should still incline to despaire, let him not be ashamed to bewray and confesse vnto some one or
<pb facs="11"/>
two (whom he dares trust, and thinketh able, by his or their counsell and godlinesse, to helpe) into what temptation hee is fallen, that he may not beare the brunt of the assault alone: And whatsoeuer befaileth, let him not flie to carnall delights, or worldly myrth and vanitie for remedy, which brings a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnesse of this guiltinesse, and so a secure benummednesse of Conscience, to his vtter vndoeing, rather then a true cure and helpe for his dangerous disease, vse only those meanes which may recouer true peace of Conscience with God, and the battaile is sought, and the field wonne: For very often times, as by euil Chyrurgerie, acurable wound groweth to a gangren, euen so the wound of Conscience, which might haue beene to the increase of Grace, and better certaintie of saluation, by forsaking the true and right cure, becommeth desperat carnae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>itie, incurable security: But now for as much as many are in feare of hauing committed this sinne, which indeede haue not, but through Satans policies to disquiet their Consciences, are illuded and afrighted; It shall bee good to consider for their comforts these short positions and Maxim<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s, found certaine and most true by the Scripture, by the iudgement of learned writers, by <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>ly experience of those that haue to deale with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Consciences. First, that such as feare least they haue thus sinned, are vndoubtedly as yet, free from this sin, or from falling <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>o it, so long as that feare remayneth in them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that such as are sorry for their offences towards God, are farre off from this sou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e offence. Thirdly, that who so hath a desire to be reconciled to God, and could wish himselfe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, shall surely obtaine pardon, if he seeke it at Gods hand, according to his word. Fourthly, that whosoeuer would not that another should fall into his wretched plight and condition, hath <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ome portion of loue, both to God and man left in him, and therefore is not vtterly fallen from Grace; nay more. Fiftly, whosoeuer hateth not all other, whom he thinketh not to be in his owne damnable case, is not come to the height and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this sinne, and therefore. Sixtly, whosoeuer taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and delight in the company of any of Gods men and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, may through their endeauour, by Gods grace be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb facs="11"/>
and recouered. Seuenthly, If any place of Scripture or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Gods word, doth minister more consolation or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or on the other side, more affright or terrifie then another, there is still place for the working vpon the Conscience, by the word, which is quite taken away in the case of the sin against the holy Ghost. Lastly, if all, or most of the speeches of the party affected, concerning God, and Christ, and his Church, be not blasphemous, or if the offender could not wish them blasphemies (it may be a fearefull and a damnable case) but it is not fully this desperat and impardonable sinne: But let no man trust in himselfe, or in his owne strength of recouering, to giue way willingly, no not vnto the least sinne, for Satan (as is said) is subtle, and we are weake and foolish, and God is not bound to attend vs, but we him.
