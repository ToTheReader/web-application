      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD is the best Schoole-master, his laws the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest studie: and what lessons (of Him) are taught, (truely) how plaine soeuer the Method be, the wisest need not be ashamed to read them. So that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, you will fauour these yong blossomes, because your selfe are but in grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They are dewed with the drops of a <hi>Pellicā</hi> whose property is to suffer her own bosome to bleed, that others may be fed. It is the
<pb facs="49"/>
bird of Charity, &amp; the true Embleme of Christ on the Crosse, (who was al Loue.) His sids are here pierced, &amp; his blood here runs forth, making a riuer, in which only (&amp; by no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) the leprosie of sin is for euer to be clensed. You shal find only 7. heads of sinne (here) cut off by prayer: not because it hath no more heads but 7. or that these ar the greatest: but being not able to fight (in so narrow a roome) with the multitude of thē al, I was contented to set vpō a certain nūber. The Armour to encounter with them is here prepared: it is made fit for any Christian to weare. If you vouchsafe to put it on, others by your
<pb facs="49"/>
example wil vndertake the same quarrell. To fight for Christ is an honorable com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bat. Sins are his vtter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp; here you may learn how to cōfound them. The war is godly: the victorie glorious: your triumph will be in heauen. To wrastle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such foes shall well become your yeres, and to giue thē the ouerthrow wil be a crowne to you in olde age. To the honor of which I do as heartily wish you may come, as you are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ingrafted into religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; vnblemished Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which (to your cōfort) you may reckon the first of those good blessings which God hath multiplied vpon you,</p>
