      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader:</hi> As it is small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the husbandman, to behold the blasting of his wished wheat, while the cockle and darnell grow vp in his field: So it is no great comfort to the Christian world to see the brambles of iniquity ouer-grow the whole Land, whilst the Cedars of Lebanon are cut down: To see <hi>Cain</hi> liue, <hi>Abel</hi> die; <hi>Esau</hi> hunt in the mountaines, <hi>Isaac</hi> offered on the mountaine: <hi>Saul</hi> pursuing, <hi>Dauid</hi> pursued: and <hi>Diues</hi> to fare delicately euery day, whilest <hi>Lazarus</hi> must lie at his doore full of sores, this hath beene some trouble to the Seruants of God. If we knew the good the godly bring to the world, we would desire they might long liue in it: for they bring a blessing wheresoeuer they come. <hi>Abraham</hi> by praier is profitable to <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck: Ioseph</hi> by prouidence is beneficiall to <hi>Pharaoh: Dauid</hi> by valour is good to <hi>Israel:</hi> and <hi>Abigail</hi> that beautifull and blessed woman, withdrawes the ruine of <hi>Nabals</hi> family.</p>
   <p>Among many mirrors of modesty in this world, this elect Lady was a true mirror. Had any cause to boast in the flesh? she more: Shee was descended of a Princely family, espoused to one of the greatest Peeres
<pb facs="3"/>
in the Land, blessed with an hopefull seed, graced with all outward lineaments of beauty, and endowed with all inward ornaments of vertue: yet it pleased the Lord so to exercise her here, that albeit in her Sauiour she found peace, yet in this world she had many afflictions. By these was she weaned from the loue of this world, and by these she is now entred into the Kingdome of heauen. To the end she might liue in some memory hereafter, the Author of this Sermon, her sorrowfull seruant, did first preach, after pen, and of late sent to me this ensuing discourse, which being allowed by authority to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed to thy view, I cannot but commend it to thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: and whatsoeuer else thou shall learne by reading, I hope it will teach thee to contemne this world.</p>
