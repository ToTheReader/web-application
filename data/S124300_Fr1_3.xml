                 <title>The Popes Parliament : containing a pleasant and delightful historie, wherin are throughly deliuered and brightly blazed out, the paltry trash and trumperies of him and his pelting prelats, their mutinies, discord, and dissentions, their stomacke and malice at Pope Ioane, their shifting and foisting of matters for defence of her, and their antichristian practises, for maintenance of their pompe and auarice. Whereunto is annexed an Anatomie of Pope Ioane, more apparantly opening her whole life and storie. Written by Iohn Mayo</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Oubtlesse, thou maist maruell, and much mislike (good cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader) that I, who am but a tender suckling, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in good letters, should presume so far, as to take in hand and publish that, which I haue rawly and rashly contriued, being a matter meete and requisite for a graue and perfect diuine. Certes I cannot altogither excuse my selfe in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: for I am not so blinde, as not to see, nor so impudent, as not to confesse my knowledge to be such, as is fitter to be concealed then reuealed, and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth rather silence and reiection, then any affection or cōmendation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I am of the mind of learned <hi>Seneca: Malè mihi esse malo, quàm molliter.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Seneca. <hi>33.</hi> Epist.</note> I had rather be counted foolish and impudent, by offering such simple stuffe as mine insufficiency can affoord, then slouthfully to sit still in the market place, and to be neither idle nor well occupied: especially in that matter that might shew the dastardly cowardnes, &amp; bastardly causes of our aduersaries, who are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered (by reason of a few currish &amp; cursed schismatikes of our owne breeding that haue disturbed our quiet state and gouernment, and troubled not a little many godly and learned men) too much to wallow &amp; welter in their owne loathsome securitie, and to sleepe (as they say) <hi>in vtramuis aurem,</hi> soundly and roundly with little or no contradiction. What? <hi>Credimus auectos hostes,</hi> do we thinke that they are gone? Do we beleeue that they are cleane extinct, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate? and that all their treacheries, treasons, &amp; massacres, are dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried? No, no, this our silence towards them doth breed the more violence in them, and will (I feare) heape greater firebrands of troubles vpon vs. Our owne dangerous and gnawing Vipers (God be thanked) are wel tamed &amp; suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently curbed, so that they dare not once so much as to peep vp their heads. Now let vs haue a vigilant eye, and diligent care to these arch-enimies, least they being better armed with fire and sword, then with the scriptures and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, do worke our wo, and make vs buy repentance at too hie a rate. The times were neuer so daungerous, as they be now.<note place="margin">Sine pace, Criminatores, Proterui.</note> Men were neuer such <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, as they be now: and neuer greater perils were han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ouer our heads. The Pope neuer bestirred himselfe more then he doth: the Cardinals, priests, monkes, friers, and all the rabblement of them, did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer intend more mischiefe against vs, then they do now. For the same Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is practised now in Rome among them, that was somtime in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel house of Ephesus: <hi>Nemo nostrum frugi esto.</hi> Let no good man be among vs. Therefore let vs look vnto them in time, and beware of their leauen and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciousnes, and let me not be too hardly censured, because I haue aduentured to offer vnto thee this simple Treatise called, <hi>The Popes Parliamēt,</hi> wherin thou maiest see a whole packe of Romish trumperies, and Antichristian illusions. Construe well my meaning, and accept my good will: willing by the one, to do thee the best good I could, and declaring by the other, my heartie zeale &amp; affection, for the aduancement of Gods true religion, and for the suppression of impious superstitiō: howsoeuer thou deeme of it, I am comforted with this. <hi>Tantum emit vidua duobus minutis, quantum emit Petrus, relinquens retia, &amp; quantum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">
