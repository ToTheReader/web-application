   <head>To the Courteous Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere haue you (Gentle Reader) that which at first was not made
for you, though now willingly (for your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite if you embrace it) offered to
your kind acceptance. Commend it my selfe I will not, lest I should giue
occasion to some quick heads, to come vpon me with the verse, <hi>Autor
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus land at &amp;c.</hi> Yet this I will say (and say truely) that in my
yonger yeares it hath cost mee some obseruation, reading, study, and
charge; which you may easily beleeue, considering the great store of
strange words, our speech doth borrow, not only from the Latine, and
Greeke, (and som from the ancient Hebrew) but also from forraine vulgar
Languages round about vs: beside sundry olde words now growne out of vse,
and diuers termes of art, proper to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Logicke, Philos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>phy, Law, Physicke.
Astronomie, &amp;c. yea, and Diuinitie it selfe, best knowen to the
seuerall profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors thereof. And herein I hope such learned will deeme
no wrong offered to themselues or dishonour to Learning, in that I open the
signification of such words, to the capacitie of the ignorant, whereby they
may conceiue and vse them as well as those which haue bestowed lon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> study in the languages, for
considering it is familiar among best writers to vsurpe strange words,
(and sometime necessary by reason our speech is not sufficiently
furnished with apt termes to expresse all <pb facs="4"/>meanings) I
suppose withall their desire is that they should also be vnderstood;
which I (knowing that <hi>bonum quò communius eo melius</hi>) haue
endeauoured by this Booke, though not exquisitely, yet (I trust) in some
reasonable measure to performe. It is easier (all know) to find faults,
then to mende them, and easier to mend faults in anothers worke already
written, then to write any new worke free from all fault. If therefore any
fault finder, or ouer curious Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke (for from the best learned I expect
best vsage) shall to shew his skill grow captious, and quarrell at my
interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I will desire him to forbeare bitternesse, and temper a
while his choler, till hauing laide this worke aside, hee trauell himselfe
in the same or some other new argument; and then I doubt not but he will
either become more indifferent, or giue others occasion to bid him English
the olde Prouerbe, <hi>Medice cura teipsum.</hi> But as for you (iudiciall or
courteous Reader) whose fauour I desire, and whose counsell or friendly
correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I will not refuse, if to you (I say) any thing herein shall
occurre, which seemeth by me omitted, mistaken, or not fully satisfactory
to your expectation, (for indeed there are almost slipt away seuen yeeres
since I had any leasure as much as to looke on it) I promise that vpon
warning hereof giuen to me or the Printer, at a second Impression it
shall be amended or supplyed. Meanewhile vse this as you finde it, and I
perswade my selfe your honesty will say it is worth the money you paide
for it. So committing my selfe and Booke to your fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable good liking, I
commit you to God.</p>
