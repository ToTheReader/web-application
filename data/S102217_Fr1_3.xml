   <head>¶ THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Oving Brethren, for as much as these times doe rather menace VVarre then Peace, men of our calling should be readie <hi>ad omne quare,</hi> for our King and Country. Wee and our Country haue beene long happy in peace, and now it seemes the times presage the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Wherefore from the wise heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, let vs all learne as followeth, <hi>Iam tua res agitur pare cum proximus ardet.</hi> I desire in briefe, to let you know, that our Company were commanded by Authoritie, to provide six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene of the best Surgions at this time to be had for his Majesties speciall service, such as are men most expert in the healing of wounds made with Gun-shott. And generally, for the most part, I know many of vs that would be esteemed good Surgions, being put to it, at the
<pb facs="3"/> first will be somewhat to seeke therein, how much more then our young men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the matter of providing, preparing, and fitting his Majesties service, being by his Highnes referred to our Corporation. And our Company having for the time deputed my selfe to the worke. I am tyed in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to doe somewhat, though I confesse, it be little to the better inabling and incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our younger men vnto their duties in that point. But before my entrance thereunto, I could in my dutie doe no lesse then to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with those especiall favours which it hath pleased our gracious King to bestow vpon our Corporation in particular, aboue and beyond his ever-blessed Ancestors, for our incouragement, to enable vs the more chearefully to serue him First, his Highnes hath beene pleased to augment the monethly wages of each Surgion and Surgions-mate in his Sea-service, almost to a third penny. He hath also beene graciously pleased to giue as free a benevolence to the Surgions in all his Sea-services, which never was given them before, as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> to all Surgions that serue in his Highnes owne Ships, I meane to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="3"/> the furnishing of the Surgions Chests, for each of them x<seg rend="sup">l</seg>. Vnto each Marchants Ship, imployed in his service v<seg rend="sup">l</seg>. And to each New-castle Ship iij<seg rend="sup">l</seg>. And neverthelesse, his Highnes is well pleased that the Surgions may demand and take by the head of all men that are in pay in any of his Shipps ij<seg rend="sup">d</seg>. of each man by the moneth, as they did before. And for the Surgions in his Land-service at present, he alloweth each Surgeon ij<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. vj<seg rend="sup">d</seg>. the day, which is iij<seg rend="sup">l</seg>. xv<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. the moneth, and to each mate iij<seg rend="sup">l</seg>. a moneth: And moreover, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and giveth to each Surgion appointed to 250. men a Surgeons Chest of xvij<seg rend="sup">l</seg>. vallew, and over and aboue a Magazin or store-chest of xlviij<seg rend="sup">l</seg>. vallew, for to supply and furnish vpon all wants. His Highnes hath further beene well pleased to giue authoritie vnto the Masters and Governors of our Societie, for to haue the making, compounding, fitting, and ordering of all the Medicines, as well Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals Chirurgicall; together with all other provisions belonging to the Surgions Chest, he hath referred to the Masters and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of our Societie. These favours and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges our Corporation haue received from
<pb facs="4"/> his Highnes, together with his gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and graunt vnto vs of a new Charter, wherein he hath likewise gratiously beene pleased to promise to confirme all our privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges formerly graunted vnto vs, and to giue vs divers new priviledges for the better sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of our Corporation in future times.</p>
   <p>And now having acquainted you with his Maiesties favours vnto our Corporation, it followeth in my dutie that I should acquaint the younger sort of Surgions with the vse of the Surgions Chest, I meane the particular medicines therein contained, and that in some methodicall manner, were it not that time hastens me to an end before I begin, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse I haue strained of time to lend the younger sort a word or two for a <hi>Viaticum,</hi> not to all as a teacher, but as a loving Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer to the elder, which I pray you to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use, and vse as you haue occasion. And so in Gods name without painting of phrases, or collecting of great Authors, my methode you may know by the plainenesse of the stile, and my methode is no other then the old beaten path-way of all Surgions, wherin each Artist ought to be vnderstanding: And if any Artist
<pb facs="4"/> by forgetfulnesse erre, I desire but to informe his memory, and craue his charitable accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And for the younger sort, I know it is charitie to shew them, for they haue neede, and ought to desire and seeke knowledge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to an old doctrine of that sweet <hi>Lillie</hi> in his Grammer rules, <hi>viz.</hi>
   </p>
   <q>
      <l>
         <hi>Qui dubitat, qui sepe rogat mea dicta tenebit.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Is qui nil dubitat, nil capit inde boni.</hi>
      </l>
   </q>
   <p>I knowing you could not haue the learned advise of the graue Doctors at hand to advise you, made me presume I confesse somewhat beyond my scope: Wherefore in want of the aforesaid helpes, consult with good Authors in their wants, with the Surgions mate, and this poore <hi>Extempore.</hi>
