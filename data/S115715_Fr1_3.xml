   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O auoyd) gentle Reader) the yearely care, trauailes, and paines of other, with the confusions, repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and manifold errors, partly by negligence, and oft through ignorance committed: I haue againe briefly set foorth a Prognostication generall, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to take effect: adioyning thereto diuers profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble collections, and many pleasant conclusions, easie of all willing ingenious to be perceiued. Here note (Reader) whereas the eleuate Pole and Meridian should be considered, in this worke it is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for London, because I wish this Meridian, situation or clime the exact truth of things. If any yearely practises in like matters agree not with my calculations, bee assured they are false, or at the least for other Eleuations or Meridians supputated, and therefore little seruing thy purpose. And that the late rude inuentions, and grosse deuises of some this yeare, and two yeares past published might be of them perceiued, then filed, and to serue to some profit: I haue purposed euen now to put forth a booke named <hi>Panauges,</hi> wel seruing their turne, and so generally &amp; most exactly al Europe, pleasant and profitable to the learned, and no small delight to all manner of men. Another booke is also already come to thy hands, entituled <hi>Tectonicon,</hi> a treasure vnto the Masons, Carpenters, Land-meaters, correcting their olde errors, wrongfully reckoned of them as infallible grounds, teaching faithfully, sufficiently, and very brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the true mensuration of all manner land, timber, stone, boord, glasse, &amp;c. And at the end contayning an Instrument Geometricall appointed to their vse. Take in good worth these labours (louing Reader) and looke shortly for the plesant fruites Mathematicall, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen such as haue been promised by my friends, and partly by me. Neither shall my desire to profite, here stay: but intendeth further to procede, if these seeme accepted. As the good will of Printers not had, kept the foresayd from you: so I trust the willing minde and excellencie of <hi>Thomas Gemini</hi> shall bring them shortly vnto you. Certes my hope is, while life remaineth, not to bee vnfruitfull to this common wealth, with studie and practise.</p>
