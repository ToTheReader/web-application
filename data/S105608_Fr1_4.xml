      <salute>SIR:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S you take-notice of this happiness and blessing of God upon you to bee the Heir of this great &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Family; so take-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice also (I beseech you) of the true cause of that worth and greatness of your <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,</hi> and imitate them ther-in: and then, inheriting their worth, together with their wealth, you shall also most undoubtedly enrich your selfe with the obsequious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and hearty affection of your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrimen; and so grow in Grace and Favour with God and Man.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>Your Noble <hi>Progenitours</hi> have bin fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their Pietie to God; for they were alwaies noted to be zealous in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> They have bin renowned for their Loialtie to their <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> for they were alwaies of great and high Commission, many of them being <hi>ex intimis Regum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siliis.</hi> They have alwaies bin much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured of their <hi>Country,</hi> for their great care of the Publique Good and Welfare ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: which, as occasions required, they did manifest, sometimes by their <hi>Valour,</hi> thogh it were to hazard the loss of Life or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: sometimes by their <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity</hi>; in so much that weighty causes in difference have bin by the Parties consent referred to their sole Arbitration: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by their <hi>Lenity,</hi> for this was their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciēt Motto, &amp; revived by the last of your name, <hi>Posse, &amp; nolle, Nobile</hi>: and alwayes by their great <hi>Hospitalitie,</hi> upon which
<pb facs="4"/>
to their great Renowne and Glory, they yearly spent the greatest part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues.</p>
   <p>All these, with many such, lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with your <hi>Predecessors,</hi> &amp; whiles they lived, were the Life of their <hi>fame</hi> &amp; <hi>worth.</hi> And, let me tell you Sir, there is an expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (the tedious Monthes of your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noritie being worn-out) of their reviving, and, together with your Person, of their keeping residence in some or other of your Mansions. God enable you with such a competency of Gifts and Graces as you may satisfie expectation.</p>
   <p>I speake not thus out of doubtfull fear, but in officious love: for since it pleased the <hi>Divine Providence</hi> when you were baptized to use the hand of my Ministery for the receiving of you into the <hi>Church:</hi> (I living then in your worthy Fathers house, who never entertained any other
<pb facs="5"/>
Chaplain, but mine unworthy selfe) and sith I live still <hi>in statu quo,</hi> as your Father placed me; me thinks the same <hi>Providence</hi> leads me by the hand to doe some service for you, now when his <hi>Majesty the King</hi> sends you so timely into the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, by gracing you <hi>Honoris onere,</hi> with the dignity of <hi>Knight-Baronet,</hi> and by tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting you <hi>Onoris honore,</hi> with the command of some of his <hi>Forces</hi> for the Countries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
   <p>My prayer is that you may walk worthy of the severall <hi>Callings</hi> wher-unto you are called: and my desire is to doe something for you to further you therein. For which purpose I have presumed to present you with this <hi>History,</hi> though weakly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet strongly warranted: for it hath the undoubted truth of God for its autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Wher-in I endevour to let you see your selfe in your triple estate: for it doth
<pb facs="5"/>
not <hi>praedicare de uno Homine in specie indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduo,</hi> but <hi>de singulis Hominibus in toto ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere Humano</hi>: and is verified particularly in everie One, being <hi>cursed</hi> or <hi>blessed</hi> in their imitation of it.</p>
   <p>It will advertise you to take-heed, that you give no way to <hi>Naturall Inclinations,</hi> but as you finde them renued by <hi>Grace:</hi> and to stop your ears against the buzzings of fawning <hi>Sycophants,</hi> which (life flesh-flies that corrupt sweet ointments) alwaies breathe infection: and serpent-like never insinuate but for secret mischievous ends. <hi>God</hi> give you the Spirit of <hi>Wisdome</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and the Grace of <hi>Zeale</hi> to detest, <hi>illud pessimum hominum genus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In a word, it will (I hope) helpe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you, how to recover the perfection of pure <hi>Nature</hi>; how to get-out of the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of corrupt Nature; and how to attaine to the fruition of that super-naturall Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
<pb facs="6"/>
that the world cannot apprehend.</p>
   <p>Many Tractates, I confess, you may finde tending to these ends; but all that I have seene, are meerly indicative; teaching onlie by instruction; wher-as this is exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarie, and teacheth by demonstration: and therefore though they may be more pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall and pithie, yet I am sure this is more plaine, I trust not unpleasant. God give grace to make them all profitable.</p>
   <p>If this shall further you but one step to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any of those ends, either for your <hi>mortification</hi> or <hi>vivification,</hi> (a double work, but must be singlie performed by you, and by all that intend to save their soules) I shall rejoice in my paines; and you, I trust, be encouraged <hi>to press-on towards the mark set-before you, for the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This is the maine thing that you have to doe in this world: without which you
<pb facs="6"/>
shall neuer here deserue the <hi>Happiness</hi> you have, nor ever hereafter attaine to the <hi>Happinesse</hi> you desire. Your <hi>Riches, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> the <hi>Favour</hi> of this VVorld, these were the desert of your <hi>Ancestours,</hi> which out-lived their Persons, and are now cast upon you their undoubted <hi>Heir</hi> to make you worldly happy. But it is <hi>Religion,</hi> and the love and practise of <hi>Religion</hi> onely in the exercise of vertuous, and pious actions that can bring you to deserve this temporall Happiness, and assure you to enherite that which is immortall.</p>
   <p>Thus commending these broken lines to your acceptance, and your selfe to the Grace in Christ Iesus; I humbly take my leave, and rest</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your Worships truly devoted, <hi>IOSEPH FLETCHER.</hi>
