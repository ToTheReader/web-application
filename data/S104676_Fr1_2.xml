   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou, that imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan,</hi>
hast ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a hand, but
what is ever ready to helpe
thy grieved Neighbour.
Take thou this little La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
to make thy Charitic
<pb facs="3"/>
greater. And know, that
the maine motiue which
made my Pen for this work,
was my observatiō of <hi>Man;</hi>
who is called <hi>A little World,</hi>
or (if you will) <hi>A Globe in
plano;</hi> delineated with all
those faire &amp; fruitfull King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of vertues, and sweet
proportions which beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
both Minde, and Body.
Yet withall, those bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Oceans of fatall Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
(whose mercilesse and
suddain billowes threaten
still to confound him) make
him but <hi>A World of Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
Times Footmen runne
<pb facs="3"/>
not so fast on their sandy
arrands, as mischances in
full careers rush upon us.
All the Ioyes we possesse by
day (if they hold it out) va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
with the day. All our
Gloryes are Sunne-beames
but of a waterish shining.
Our Clocks of Health sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
goe true; those of
Death, more certaine than
beleeved. Wee are owners
of no content but sleepe;
and yet even that blessing is
subject to distraction: for
our very Dreames doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
proue Diseases, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
us. Nor doe these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
<pb facs="4"/>
winds blow down
Signe-posts onely, blast the
Common sort alone: But
from head to foote, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
even of PRINCES are
sometimes riven with these
thunders. To bring a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of all those Great
Ones Histories testifie to
haue died by Poysō, Drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and other <hi>Accidents</hi>
in this Treatise specified;
would make this Praeface
(like the Cates of <hi>Mindus)</hi>
too bigge for this Booke.
Let it suffice, that not onely
the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone</hi> oft
suffer Eclipses; but all the
<pb facs="4"/>
lesser Starres in their brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
glories are often clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with Mischances. We
see then on what a ticklish
needles poynt our Pleasures
dance; and when they fall
off, with what a nimble
foote Calamities leape into
their places. Let it not then
be held a worthlesse Worke
to bring defensiue furniture
against such Suddain Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
And if the Cedars
for all their wealthy tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
be sometimes over-tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Tempests: haue
not the lower Trees that fill
the Land with fruit (the
<pb facs="5"/>
Husbandmen I meane)
much more neede of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
in such stormes? It
is their way chiefly that I
strew with these flowers of
Recovery. If others gather
some, and finde their sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
I hope their vertues
will teach such vertuously
to loath Ingratitude. For
the Poore (whose wants
double their Paines, and yet
their Paines-taking makes
their natural strength easily
repayrable) I haue brought
easie and common Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.
But before the Rich
(whose pampered liues
<pb facs="5"/>
make mischances more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
both to be endured
and cured) I haue layd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Remedies of richer va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</p>
   <p>In all which I haue here
and there stucke some Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
of mine owne.
The Worke is but little; but
my Labour was the greater
so to compile it; that as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one may need it, so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man may be able to
buy it. I haue likewise writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it in a plaine stile, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one also may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it. Hoping therefore
that these my Labours shall
<pb facs="6"/>
(by GODS blessing) be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall
to thee, of what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
or degree soever thou
art; I rest</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Ready with my best skill
to doe thee all healthfull
Service,
