   <p>AT last, the zeale of my affection conuerts my pen to you (my beloued brethren) ar whose perfection this Treatise leuelleth especially, as them whome feruent preparation to the sacred tucharist concerneth principally. For God hath appoynted you his connaturall instruments, and supernaturall workers of these admirable wonders, you consecrate these heauenly hoastes, you offer this immaculate sacrifice, you seperate the soule of Christ from his body after a diuine maner, you draw in crueotly Christs blood out of his veines, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume this sole christian holocaust, you diuide it, you distribute it, you communicate the people. To you belongeth to admit or reiect all those who present themlelues before this sacred Altar: you procure that others ascend prepared, you shut these cōduits of Gods grace to all thē that bring not golden ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of charitie, to carry away this diuine liquor. O what preparation requires the maiestie of God, the principall agent of this sacrifice of you his selected instruments? <hi>

God hath ordained you as mediators betwixt the people and him, that your prayers ascend like incense to please <note place="margin">Ad Heb. c. 5</note> his maiestie, not onely for your owne sinnes, but also for the sins of the people: therefore you must border on both extreames, participating flesh and <note place="margin">Ad Heb. 2</note> bloud with the people, but spirite and vertue with God: and well remember that the twelue tribes of I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

For what can be more preuous, then that which Christ thought prizable of his own bloud? at what rate ought you estimate those soules whom God hath endued with his grace, Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in his bloud, ransomed with his death. I he dea rest Iewelles that our Sauiour possesseth vnder the cope of heauen, be hath committed to your custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. for this cause he gaue you grace in your orderu for this cause the holy ghost annoynted your harts with his gifts, when the Bishoppe annoynted your hands: for this cause at your discretion, he hath left the disposition of his bodie and bloud, that you as good pastors might feede his flocke in conuenient time and season. Ah but you must consider that the hie Priest carried, not onely the names of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel vpon his breast, but also vppon both his shoulders, to signifie that they were a burden to <note place="margin">Luc. 15.</note> him: You know the pastor of al pastors, after he had wandred long to reclame the straying sheepe vnto her fold, he would not lead her in his hand, but cast her vppon his shoulders, to teach all pastors what paine &amp; diligence they ought to vse for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation &amp; conseruation of their flocke. But by what meanes shal this burden, euen heauie for the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Angels, be supported by a fragill and weake man, who at euery let fainteth, and daily falleth?

<pb facs="179"/> the heate thereof, almost in a moment disperseth it selfe thorow the whole bodie. O what inflamed prayers, what cordiall sighes, what effectuall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications shoulde euerye Priest present before the maiesty of God, when he offereth vppe this sacred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

No man can deny but that the precept of praier and deuotion toucheth al sorts of persons.
<pb facs="180"/> yet more particularly the Cleargie, for their state and vocation, as the bond of iustice and equitie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to all men, yet especially to Magistrates, in regard of their office and publike authoritie. For which cause deuout Priests stint their houres daily for their prayers, meditations, and spirituall exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, spending their time in deuotion, that others ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consume friuolously in transitorie pleasures, or anxiously in heaping vppe worldly trashe, or idlely in impertinent affayres. O what comfort is it to the labouring husbandman, while he soweth his seede with toyle, and sweat, to see his Curate praying with teares for a plentifull Haruest? How reioyceth the Marchant while his shippe raungeth in the wilde Ocean, to behold the pastor of his soule by prayer, pacifying the wrath of God, and calming the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous seas? How boldly marcheth the souldiour to the field, grounded vppon a iust cause of watre, knowing that while hee fighteth against his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in body, his ghostly father oppugneth them with his soule finally, all the lay people putte great trust and confidence in al their negotiations, in the deuout prayers of godly Priests.</p>
   <p>Your second function not much inferiour to the precedent, yet most necessary for your flocke, and greatly furthered by your diligent preparation to the Eucharist, is to teach the people and instruct them: <hi>Labia sace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>.</note> is the Angell of our Lord of Hosts. Your mouth must bee the treasury of the seculars knowledge, they must haue recourse to you in all their difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, you must expounde the scriptures vnto them, you must resolue their doubts, either belonging to
<pb facs="180"/> faith or good life. This cannot bee well performed without true doctrine, and vertuous examples, by teaching by woord and deede: good it is to teach well, laudable to preach well, but if good life bee not annexed, the preacher destroyeth with one hand, that hee built with the other: and as our eies certifie vs better of that they see, then the cares of that they heare, and printeth a deeper impression in the minde, so an ill example disswadeth more, then a good sermon perswadeth, such corruptnesse carrieth our vitious nature. Wherefore God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that <hi>Moyses</hi> should cause to be grauen in a plate of gold tied to <hi>Aarons</hi> brest, <hi>Doctrina</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Exod. 28.</note> Doctrine and Trueth, or as the Hebrew text hath, light &amp; perfection: because the priest ought to teach the people, illuminating their mindes with the light of doctrine, and perswade it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by vertue and perfection. I remember that in the life of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> is registred, that once hee called one of his brethren to go with him a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, the good and obedient religious man went with him: <hi>S Francis</hi> passed from one side of the Citie to another, and almost compassed the whole, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer obseruing to go through those streetes, where the multitude was most frequent, yet alwaies incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his eyes to the ground, neuer speaking to his brother who did toe like: when they came home, O father quoth the good simple brother, when wil you preach? Saint <hi>Francis</hi> answered, brother, dost thou thinke wee haue not preached all this while, our modest behauiour, silent tongues, mortified counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances austere attire, retired eyes from worldlie vanities, this day hauo made a good and reall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; &amp; so in verie deed they did: for I doubt not but many of his bretheren preached and proficed not so much by their sermons, as he did by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
<pb facs="181"/> Therefore Christ called his Disciples <hi>Lux mundi,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> the light of the world, the which illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, not onely our eyes, but also heateth our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. I know deare brethren, that the state of priests in England, incurreth daily manie daungers, and in hazarding theyr liues for Gods true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, theyr merite cannot bee but great: yet you must thinke, that hauing opposed your selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Diuell, he will not permit you to be quiet, and if hee find you disarmed in soule with prayer and meditation, and vncloathed with the garments of grauitie and ecclesiasticall modestie, and as secular in soule as in apparrell, doubt not but his dartes will wounde deepely, therefore vie this externall libertie, which necessitie ofter ensor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth you, to disguise your selues withal, rather as a thing counterfeited for a stage, then to take any pleasure or delight therein. And when you come to the holy Alter, there excuse your selues with teares, aske of the Father of light, that he powre downe from heauen, the beams of his fauors: light your lamps at his link, expell all cloudes, that this sunne may communicate his raies to you so many earthly plannets, demand of him who teacheth all men, that hee teach you, to whome hee hath committed the charge to teach others. He illu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth <note place="margin">Io. 1.</note> all men that come into this world: he is <hi>lux mundi,</hi> the vniuersal light, he imparteth wisedome to <note place="margin">Io. 9.</note> all without expostulation: he makes the tongues of <note place="margin">Sap. 10.</note> infants eloquent: hee indueth yongmen that keepe his lawe, with profounder piudence than hoarie <note place="margin">Psal. 118.</note> haires. Ah deere soules, be not obscured with mysty thoughts, hauing before you the fountaine of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall light, let not worldly fancies inuegle your wits, whom Gods veriue feedes, let not sensuall delight dazel those eies which haue beheld so often the life
<pb facs="181"/> of al purity.</p>
   <p>The administration of fiue sacraments, Baptism, Penance, matrimony, extreme v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ction, and the Eucharist, is the third flower that adorneth your gatland: this function comprehendeth fiue facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues or abilities, like so many diamonds, pearles &amp; rubies, that decke your spirituall crowne. All these you are bound for twoo causes to administer in grace without blot or stain of mortall sin, otherwise you commit a most hainous crime &amp; horrible sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege. The first reason is, because the instruments of god must haue due proportion &amp; conformitie in holines &amp; sanctity with their principall agent: <hi>E.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Leu. 11. &amp; 19. &amp; 20. &amp; 1. Pet. 1.</note>
      <hi>stote sancti, quia ego sanctus sum:</hi> be you holy, for I am holy, that is an vniuersall precept giuen to al those that as instruments attende vppon the maiestie of God The second reason, natural reason it self yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, for why did he endue you with grace in your order, but that you should keepe it, and administer his sacraments woorthily? therefore vniuersally he that abuseth Gods sacraments for these two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, in curreth a most hainous offence. But hee that celebrateth in a mortall sinne, committeth diuers and most intollerable sacrileges. I trust in God that none of the zealous priests in England, so well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, so nigh their death, so fortified with gods grace in this tempestuousdea of persecution, will forget their dutie so farre, that they dare but once thinke deliberately to presume to ascende to his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Altar contaminated with a deadly crime.

   <p>The circumstance of the sacrifice offered en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth the offence, for the principall function of Priesthoode, and most essentially thereunto annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the act of sacrificing, al other whatsouer giue place therunto: Yet herein this caitife in the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest funtion most vildely transgresseth: and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in offering so pretious a treasure for the sins of al the faithful, hee himselfe sinneth therein most vnfaithfully al his touching, crossing, diuiding, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; amplifie the defor mitie of his delict. The consecration was sufficient to damn him to hel, but
<pb facs="183"/> the consumption wil drowne him deeper, there he was an vnworthie agent, here an vnwoorthie pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, there hee offended in producing God irreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, here he sinneth in not being deified for his demerite: for if the Apple <hi>Adam</hi> ate poysoned him <note place="margin">Oen. 3.</note> and all his posteritie, if that poore Prophet sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by another Prophet for taking a small repast <note place="margin">3.

O what indignitie is this, that God for loue shoulde lay his sonne, his onely sonne, his wisedom, his life, al his treasure in thy hand, to ofter, to eate, to distribute, and thou to cast it into a body, a den more sit for diuels thē a temple for Christ? Art thou not afraide, that while he entreth into thy mouth he put not forth one of his hands and roote out that accursed tong that was so presumptuous to breathe vpō his bodie, to vtter the words of consecration, to touch so vnspotted an host? the plague of the Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samites <note place="margin">1.

   <p>The third sacrilege, or rather deilege this ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miser incurreth, consisteth in the irreuerent administration of this sacrament, for if hee onely come but to the altar, to communicate others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out celebrating, yet by touching and dispensing the Eucharist in a mortal sinne, hee sinneth mortally, and committeth a sacrilege: this we learn by <hi>Oza,</hi>
      <note place="margin">a Reg. 6.</note> who vnworthily touching the Arke against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of God, was punished by death of the bodie, a
<pb facs="183"/> figure, to declare how he that handleth this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt irreuerently, incurreth the death of his soul: for the same reason those that touched any dead body, <note place="margin">Leu. 11.</note> were vncleane among the lewes, and could not be admitted among the faithful, til by washing and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceremonies their vncleannes was taken away, and what could this type more liuely represent then a stained body made vncleane, by touching a soule dead in mortall sinne, the which ought not to touch the body of Christ, or any holy sacrament, without expiation and sacramentall washing? For he that handleth the Eucharist with hands bedaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in dust and mire, sinneth mortally for his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to so soueraigne a maiestie, without doubt he sinneth more hainously, that handleth it with hands polluted and defiled with sinne. Besides, the dispensation of the Eucharist, <hi>ex officio,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely belongeth to holy orders, and therefore hee that dispenseth it, in deadly sinne offendeth mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because to that effect among the rest god impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his grace vnto his ministers. Let vs nowe after Masse, cōsider with the internal eies of our soules, the lamentable state of this miserable &amp; detestable wretch, he that was elected of God, chosen his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar &amp; deare seruāt, admitted to the cheefest fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in earth, indued with grace, made a mediator betwixt god &amp; man, now is become a reprobate, a seruant of sathan, a slaue of sin, stained with sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, made abhominable to god, &amp; almost vnprosita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his people. <hi>Oquomodo obscuratum est aurum, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus</hi>
