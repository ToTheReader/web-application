   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Oble, worthy, courteous, and loving <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> if I could perswade thee to beleeve what profit the diligent and serious Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier doth reape by reading, and what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he gaineth above him, who think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to become a perfect Souldier by a few yeares practise, without reading: Truely, thou wouldest use thy earnest diligence as well in the one as in the other; for I dare be bold to affirme, that reading and discourse doth as much or rather more, to the furtherance of a perfect Souldier, than a few yeares practise without reading.</p>
   <p>For out of my owne experience, in my profession, having seene as many rare occurrences, and accidents of warre by practise (as hath not been seene the like in many yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) which shall appeare evidently by the subsequent Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of one Regiments service: Neverthelesse, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that reading and discourse of warres, inable the minde more with perfect knowledge, than the bare practise of a few yeares. Therefore, what these yeares past I have collected, by the one and the other, following the laudable profession of Armes, under the mightie and potent King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> the space of three yeares, and since under his Majestie of worthy memory the Invincible King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> his Crowne,
<pb facs="5"/>
and Confederats, in foure yeares; gathered together for the good, profit, and furtherance of thee and my Country: whereby I hope the noble and worthy minded <hi>Reader,</hi> shall be allured and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to follow the Traces of those worthy <hi>Cavaliers</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in my Observations, of most worthy memories: Whereof some, from meane condition, have risen to supreme honour, wealth, and dignitie; though others perished in the way of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for whose sakes, my Sword shall be ever ready against the common Enemy, that ruined the old and worthy Regiment; the memory whereof shall never be forgotten, but shall live in spite of time; and its vertues and fame be made knowne to all those interessed in the quarrell. The example of those brave spirits (noble and worthy <hi>Reader</hi>) I hope, will allure you to follow their vertues, that you may be partaker of their honour, for the further credit of our Nation. Therefore, worthy <hi>Reader,</hi> what you find here, if you please, like; but howsoever, remember alwayes to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure sparingly the writings of the shallow-brained <hi>Souldier,</hi> not adorned with eloquent phrase; but with truth and simplicitie. <hi>Plinius</hi> saith, there was no book so little worth, but might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in some things. <hi>Caesar</hi> from his youth had his Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and the <hi>Bee</hi> out of the most poysonable herbs suckes the honey. Please to reade, and thou shalt finde something to delight thee; at least thou shalt see my thankfulnesse to my <hi>Camerades</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> and examples of frequent mortality, to make thy use of. And as the starres take light from the Sunne; even so from <hi>Histories,</hi> men draw knowledge and wisdome. Let me intreate thee therefore, when thou wouldest avoide care, to looke on those observations, and by our examples amend thy life, and I shall be glad of thy profit, and not envy thy estate. If you ask; why I wrote these Observations? It was because I loved my <hi>Camerades.</hi> If why I published them, know it was for my friends, and not for the world, for which I care not, nor for any that is ungrate; but those which accept well of this, will encourage me betime, to take grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paines for their sakes, if they view them. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
