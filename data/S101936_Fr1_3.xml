So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fearfull signes in heauen and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as it were, by the breach of nature weeping ouer vs; nor the horrible howling and quaking of the earth, trembling and fearing vnder vs, hath as yet brought forth anye further sorrowe of our sinnes, then, that being amazed and astonished at the suddaines, woondring at the straungenes, and for a time, while our heartes did beat, lightly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing at the fearfulnes thereof, we made a shew
<pb facs="4"/>
as though we would haue turned to the Lord; but alas, we soone became like the children of Israell; vvho beeing put in feare with the greate terrour which God shevved in pronouncing the Lawe in mount Syna, did promise to heare &amp; obey Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, vvho being but fortie daies and fortie nights absent from them, and for them vvith the Lord: they fel avvay to their owne imaginations. Since this, hath the Lorde vvith straunge sicknesses, at diuers times, diuersly visited vs in our bodies; yea, our very hearts haue bene smitten vvith the fear of foraine practises, yet vvho is it that hath right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ackovvledged the hand of the Lorde? Aboue all other thinges, this is to be soberly vvaied with the equall ballaunce of an vpright conscience: that euen novv, on the one side, the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the state and Church of God among vs, hath very villanously and traiterously, vovved himselfe, to put out the happy light of this most peaceable kingdome, euen by desperate and slauishe bloud-suckers, (allured and besotted, vvith the fayre and favvning face of a man hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red like a VVoman, of these Locustes the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, who haue stinges in their tailes, beeing like vnto Scorpions,) to take away the precious life of our moste gratious Queene ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, our most dear soueraigne, the ioy and peace of all this Land: (the Lord for his Sonnes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

he that seeth any thing, must needes behold and tremble. But O that I vvere able to povvre oute my very heart: and that riuers of vvaters mighte flovv out of mine eyes, that I might sufficiently bevvaile the desolation of Sion among vs: yea, I coulde vvishe that my life though it vvere by a thousand deaths, might redeeme the breaches of the Church of God among vs. VVhose hart doth not bleede to thinke that in so peaceable daies &amp; so blessed a time, vnder so Godly and religious a Princesse, euen when the fire of our neighboures most rufull miseries, doth flame about our eares: yea, and that the Lorde hath almoste drawne out his vvrathfull svvord against vs: euery man fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovveth the pride, couetousnesse, vvhoredome, drunkennesse and lustes of his own heart, and no man remembreth Ioseph? The barres are filled vvith pleadinges, and the streetes are full of the cries of the poore: fulnes of meat and contempt is among vs, and vvho considereth? Yet, if this our sin vvere only against men, and not against God, there migh be some hope; But vvhen the mouth of the blasphemous svvearer, is not tied vp, &amp; the handes of the idolatrous generation of Atheiestes, &amp; prophane persons be not chained: VVhen the moste holye and precious vvorde of God is manifestlye contemned, the ioyfull and heauenly tydings of saluation, so negligently and vngratefully troden vnder foote: the true and faithfull messengers pursued, atained, and diuers wayes afflicted: then if the olde worlde for mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious imaginations, Sodom and Gomorrha for pride, fulnesse of meate and vnmercifulnesse: If
<pb facs="5"/>
Ierusalē for abusing Gods prophets, &amp; wilfulnes were wofully distroyed, vvhat may wee poore careles people look for, if we do not repent (but as it is almost vniuersally feared) speedy ruine &amp; vtter desolation? O ye shepherds of Israel be wise and vnderstand, kisse the sonne least he be angry,<note place="margin">Psalme. 2.</note> seeke the Lorde whilste he may be founde, make attonement with him, rest yee on God, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his wayes [<q>For the eyes of the Lord behold<note place="margin">2. Chro, 16. 9</note> all the earth, to shew him selfe strong with them that are of perfect hart toward him.</q>] And you ye reuerend fathers, which take vpon you to rule the sterne of God his ship, to your consciences be it appealed, whether you thrust not out of your bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren, faithful &amp; skilful marriners, nourishing the idle &amp; vnfit: wherby it is come to passe, that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of soules are like to be drowned. Let be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peled vnto your cōsciēces, whether this your dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, be not the only cause that this church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland hath suffred such disquietnes? and whether you ar not folowers of such as haue bin disturbers of the churches in other countries? cōpare I pray you, your cause with their cause, and your proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with their proceeding: as namely, let the practises of the diuines of PERGA in Germany, (for the maintaining of the errour of consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, and vbiquity of Christe his bodie) be<note place="margin">See admon. ad lib. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord de mod agend.</note> compared with your striuing against the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some disciplin of Christ [they were few] (as name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly about six) &amp; one bare the cheefest svvay: &amp; you are not so many, as that for your willes, all the Churches should be troubled in England, [<q>they helde the foundation</q>] and so doe you; [<q>they had
<pb facs="5"/>
to doe with their godly brethren</q>] and so haue you; [<q>they shrowded themselues vnder the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovve of moste famons men; as of Luther and Melancthon</q>] and so do you, euen of moste bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed martyrs, and very learned fathers: [<q>they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing tried diuers wayes to establish their errors: at length deuised a subscription to a book called (Liber concordiae,) thereby to drawe a secrete allovvance of that which openly they could not so vvel set one foote</q>]: You after many molestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and vexations of your brethren, euen to the turning avvay of many good schollers, godly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, from the study of diuinity, haue at the lēgth contrary to allavv of God and man, offered vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to the consciences of your brethren▪ by a forced subscription; [<q>they first won the magistrat, and made him their pretence, vvhere their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty vvas espied</q>]: and I pray God it be not layd to your charge, for your like dealing &amp; pretences: [<q>the Magistrates vvere hardly dravvne to like of their purpose &amp; maner of proceding</q>]: so am I per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swaded that yours cannot long bee couered [<q>they pretended vnity and intituled their subscription, a Booke of Concord, and by that meanes made great discord and dissention</q>] you cry out for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and good order, and nothing lesse is the issue of your proceedings: you cry the peace of the Churche, and vvho knovveth not, that if you vvoulde be humble to God, and louing to your brethren, and discharge your duetye to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, but that these stumbling blocks and meanes of dissention, might long ago haue bene remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For vve are assured, [<q>that as the Magistrates
<pb facs="6"/>
vvith them, did somevvhat staye their fury</q>], so if her Highnesse, of her Godly disposition and accustomed clemencye, vvith her honourable Counsellers, had not bene some Bridle to your vnvvise indeuors, there vvould hardly haue bin, ere this time, any peace for a faithfull minister. [<q>But how proceeded they? &amp; vvhat did they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine? Euen by feare and authority, they forced some to subscribe; some they woone by faire vvords: to some they granted in secreat limitatiō, which after they in open denied: some hauing subsci bed, aftervvarde vvith great sorrovve and anguishe relented: some they remooued from their charges, and some they continued vvith long and variable molestation: and finallye, this vvas the good they brought to passe, that the people were distracted, many churches vntaught, &amp; great broiles &amp; confusion in many places.</q>] So I wold to God that euery of those (that I may not say vvorse) vvere not too too true in you: onely let it be appealed vnto your conscience, that you suspended and depriued them, whom by lavv you ought to haue first resolued, or endeuored your selues to haue so don; and that by articles interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory you vvēt about, &amp; indeed intangled some of your brethrē: vvith that pretence of law, which othervvise seemed to be vvanting. And vvas this either charitable to your brethren, or agreeable to iustice to your aduersary, meete in a Bishop to those of his charge, that one should be punished before his cause be equally heard? And that hee may not haue a copye of the thinges layde to his charge, but be driuen vpon an oth to ansvvere so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly,
<pb facs="6"/>
&amp; being depriued in a chamber, to be sent avvay vvithout anye certayne knovvledge of the causes of his depriuation. Let all men iudge hovv this may beseme Christian Bishops, and graue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But hovv haue you made vnity &amp; confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity? euen as one vvould open a doore to al hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rible cōfusion &amp; vprore, if by the merciful proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God it had not beene staid and preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It is high time therefore for you to repent and to shewe your selues as true Elders, casting downe your crovvnes before the Lambe. It is hard for you to kicke against the prick. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 48</note> vvhat is written, [<q>If the euill seruant shall say in his hart, my Master doth deferre his comming, and begin to smite his fellowes, and to eate and drinke with the drunken, that seruants master will come in a day, vvhen he looketh not for him, &amp; giue him his portion vvith hypocrites, there shal be vveeping and gnashing of teeth.</q>] And all ye the inhabitantes of this lande turne yee to the Lord before it bee too late: humble your selues before the throne of his mercye: let euerye one chaunge his heart and amend his ovvne vvaies, that the Lorde may haue pittye vppon vs, and our enimies preuaile not againste vs. Pray yee for the peace of this Lande, they that loue the Lorde, cease not crying till he haue mercy vppon vs: And let the remembraunce of our blessed so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne be in all your supplications, that by the continuaunce of her happy &amp; prosperous reigne, his glorious Gospell may shine more and more, (as in the dayes of king Iosias) in brightnesse &amp; beauty among vs. And let this little treatise bee
<pb facs="7"/>
vnto thee (gentle and Christian reader) as a light and profitable glasse from day to day to looke in, that it may be a meanes to teach thee and stirre thee vp to praye for, and to seeke by all lawfull, quiet and Godlye meanes, the refourmation of some things in our Church. For it is not the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose thereof, (as God knoweth) to minister mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ciuill contention, or that any man shoulde reioyce in the strife of brethren, but with as much care as could be, tendring the peace of the church, to make apparant, simply and briefly the truth of godlinesse, in the thinges mentioned in this book, according to the worde of God. And here vve desire all men, and you the reuerende Fathers of this land, &amp; all godly brethren, to whom this may come, to iudge charitably of this woorke, vvhich tendeth to no other end, but that the truth being found, we might al ioin togeather in godly peace, &amp; an holy vnion, to serue him ioifully together, frō generation to generation. The reasons which specially did cause this mater to be taken in hand, are either in respect of the substaunce of seuerall points in question, or of the time wherin they are brought in question. For first, considering that the question is not (as the aunswerer would beare the world in hād, &amp; as in publike sermons, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day vncharitably vpbraided) about trifles, &amp; things of no vvaight, as of variable ceremonies &amp; matters of circumstances, which yet are to be squared by the sacred Canons of holy Scripture; but about matters of no small importance, euen of the great and waighty cause of Christes king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by vvhat lavves and offices, his heritage is
<pb facs="7"/>
to be gouerned &amp; protected: that is, of the whole Discipline of the Church of Christ, whether it be to be ordered by the vncertayne and deceiueable waights of humane constitutions, or by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Oracles of Gods most holy testimonies. And that the aunswerer doth very confidentlye challenge (as thogh not only by vs, but byal chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches reformed in manye writinges verye well knowne, he vvere not already aunsvvered): that by the worde of God, vve vvoulde prooue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine gouernement of the Church vnder the time of the Gospell: and that this he doth very closlye and colourablie at his pleasure, adding to, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting from the question (as in the treatise shall appeare,) and vvith smooth vvordes and artificial euasions, (though sometimes vvith more gaule then comelynes, and more scoffing then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce,) labouring to cast a myst before the eyes of the Reader, and to beare dovvn the cause with svvelling vvordes of vain ostentation. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time, seeing that novv by the meanes of the vnaduised stirre, vvhich by the reuerende Fathers is made in this Church of England, al the faythfull seruauntes of Christe Iesus, are in some sort called to beare vvitnesse vnto the truth: and that vvithout verye good grounde it vvere not meet, that any reasonable thing shoulde be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of such men as vve be, not onely to satisfie the expectation of all men, desirous to knovve the truth, but also to discharge our dutie, to our Lord and Master Iesus Christ, and to her gracious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, and all her good subiectes: vve coulde not keep the pen from paper, but vvere, as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
<pb facs="8"/>
to beare this necessary vvitnes to a truth, not so much by the reason of man impugned and resisted, as by manifest and plaine places of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be approoued and confirmed; and for the dayly profite of the Church, most behoosefull of euery man to be rightly vnderstood, and in euery Congregation vvith all reuerence and diligence, to be practised and religiously obserued. For, what man indovved vvith the feare of God, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent loue of his Prince, continually beholding the diligent hand of the seditious papists to waxe stronger and stronger, through the stopping of the mouths of the sincere ministers, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (I might say innumerable) soules, for whome Christe Iesus shed his moste precious bloude, to remaine in miserable captiuity and bondage of blindnesse and ignoraunce, the very chaine of darknesse and iniquity, for lacke of teaching and instruction, and these non-residents and blinde guides, which in some sort make a pray of God his heritage, to bee so cunningly vnder-propped and maintained: and so many thinges, of so euil nature in themselues, so pernicious to the church of God, so dangerous to the state of this commō wealth, so offensiue and burdenous to all people of any conscience and knowledge, to be so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily backed and defended: what man I say, hearing and seeing the daily and pitiful complaints of the poore people for lack of good pastors, and of the reioycings of vvicked &amp; euill men, in the trouble of the faithfull Ministers, to the great dishonour of almighty God, and contempt of many most wholsome Lawes, by her most excellent Maiesty

set foorth and established▪ can be so carelesse and vndutifull, as not to applye him-selfe in some sort or other, that these great enormities may be detected and remooued. Accept therfore (gentle reader) the godly labours which were employed in setting foorth this little Treatise, &amp; thinke it not straunge, that it commeth foorth so soone or so sodenly, but take it as a stay &amp; an help vnto thee, till some more larger discourse shalbe aduē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, wherin the holy scripture is made the onely iudge of this cōtrouersy, &amp; so much as cōcerneth the reasons of the lavves of this land is nothing at al touched, as wel because the purpose of this reply, vvas to instruct the cōscience by the proper means thervnto ordayned of God; as because the shortnes of time could not suffer any more, &amp; the pen vvhich vvrote this, is of an other profession. vveigh vvell and examine the reasons here inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vvith the iust and euen ballaunce of God his holy sanctuary, and let thine eye be single in iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and no doubt but (thorovv God his grace) though peraduenture the stile may be somevvhat harsh, and euery point not so finely adorned with the flovvers of mans eloquence; yet the plaine &amp; simple euidence of the truth, euen in her naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and proper beauty, shal so shine and cast her bright beames into thy conscience, that if thou reape not so much profite as vvere to be vvished, at the least vvyse, this cause may receiue more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable interpretation, and be esteemed as a thing vvorthy of due consideration. Thus hoping of the blessing of God tovvardes thee, and of thy charitable receiuing of the labours vvhich were
<pb facs="9"/>
enterprised to do thee good; I cease anye further to hold thine eyes from the vvorke it selfe: moste humbly beseeching God, euen the father of our Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
