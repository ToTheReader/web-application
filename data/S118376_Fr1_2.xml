   <head>TO MY VERY LO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
and deare friend Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Thomas White,</hi> a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
of Bristow.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile I was at Norwich, in
the yeere 1597. I writ
this Treatise vpon such
occasiō as appears there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and deliuered it vnto
that Heretike, that by himselfe, if
God would, he might consider and be
perswaded Since which time I haue
kept it by me: and though some of my
priuate friends desired copies; yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
that wisdome of <hi>Solon,</hi> who
would make no law against Patricide,
least the mention of the fact might
<pb facs="3"/>
giue occasion to commit it: and withall
considering that it is too s<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>mple and
poore for the publike view; I haue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
refused to make it common.
Yet now perceiuing a present necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
because that s <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>me of late haue
wandered in this labyrinth: &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
remembring, that of any weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
shall hereafter entertaine this
opinion, he may, before he be wholy
possessed therewith, find the absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of it and be reformed▪ that many
a nouice in Christianitie, who
therefore doubts of the truenesse of
his Religion, because he findes no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
reason to perswade, but onely
the racke of authorities to <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
him to acknowledge it; may perhaps
be hereby satisfied and find comfort:
and that they who are already strong,
may by this ouerplus, triumph in the
goodnesse of <hi>God,</hi> who requires them
to beleeue no more, then they may by
that vnderstanding, which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb facs="3"/>
them, be perswaded of: I haue for
their sakes, who may reape benefite
thereby, set at nought all other Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers,
not guilty vnto my selfe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
offence which I can commit in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it publike. Such as it is, accept
(good master <hi>White)</hi> as a parcell of
that assertion, which may hereafter
follow, of euery article of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
faith; if God shall vouchsafe
me vnderstanding, leasure, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
thereto. I therefore offer it
vnto you, both because I know you
are diligent in reading bookes of good
argument; and because I haue none
other meanes, whereby to shew my
selfe thankefull for your manifold
kindnesses and your loue. At Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
this 20. of April. 1601.</p>

      <signed>Your louing and assured
friend,
