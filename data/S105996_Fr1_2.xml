   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Take not vpon mee to write either in the praise, or discommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Booke; it belongs not vnto me; but now it is abroad, must wholly bee submitted to your iudgement and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. And I know, it must bee the worth of a Booke, and not the flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of an Epistle, that causeth your approbation. So that this must stand, or fall in your opinion, by the weight,
<pb facs="3"/> or lightnesse that you shall finde therein.</p>
   <p>The Author of this Booke I know not; but by chance hearing that a friend of mine had some such papers in his hand, and hauing heard them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, I was curious to see and reade them ouer; and in my opinion (which was also confirmed by others, iudicious and learned) supposed if I could get the Copie, they would be welcome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. My friends courtesie bestowed it freely vpon me, and my endeuour to giue you contentment, caused mee to put it in print. And therfore to keepe Decorum, and follow custome, in default of the Authors appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, I present it to you with this short Epistle.</p>
   <p>The Booke, you see, is of mixt matter, by the way of obseruations, or Essayes, and Discourses. There
<pb facs="3"/> haue beene so many precedents of this kinde, and (when they haue come out of the hands of good Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) alwayes so approued, that there needs no Apologie for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in one Booke, so different Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
   <p>If the Obseruations, or Essayes seeme long to you, because most that haue written in that way, haue put them in lesse roome; for that, if the fault grow by multiplicity of words, repetition; or affected variation of Phrases, then your dislike is well grounded. But when you haue read, and finde the length to haue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the matter and variety, of it, I know, your opinion will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily alter.</p>
   <p>I will hold you no longer from that, to which this but introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth: But if the Booke please you, come
<pb facs="4"/> home to my Shop, you shall haue it bound ready to your hand, where in the meane time I expect you, and remaine</p>
