   <p>BEfore I had altogither finished the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing of this Narratiō, I received from a faithfull Brother (whose being is where be may have present &amp; certaine intelligence) a letter: Wherein he crediblie reporteth these insuing workes of God. Which, because they be right worthie to be noted, I thought good to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish in the same wordes, as they came to my handes. Admonishing our Papall Bishoppes of the newe erection, to consider these iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God: and withall to remember the death of the late titular Bishop Maister <hi>Iames Nicholson,</hi> who was then troubled in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for accepting that title: So that hee would not be called Bishopp in his will, and by his Will reiected whatsoever was due to him out of his Bishopricke. The Lord give vs vnderstanding in all things.</p>
   <p>Th' Arbishop of S. <hi>Androis,</hi> reposing in his bedd in time of the afternoones sermon, the Sabbath after his Diocesan Synode in S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drois,</hi> was wakened and all the Kirk &amp; Towne with him, with a crie of bloud and murder. For
<pb facs="12"/>his sisters sonne (maister of his housholde) wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> a throw of his dagger killed his Cooke, while as he was busie in dressing of the Lord Bishoppes Supper, the dagger light iust vnder the lest pappe of the Cooke, who fell downe dead imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlie.</p>
   <p>Item, the said Bishopp, at the Towne of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi> in <hi>Lawdien,</hi> where hee keepit an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diocesan Synode: after he had bene in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine much vpon the contradiction of <hi>Core,</hi> out of the Epistle of <hi>Iude,</hi> comminge furth of the Kirk dore, in the porch thereof, the earth vnder him, burst, and rent, and he sunke down: So that, if he had not bene pulled out quicklie by his Colateralles, hee had gone the way of <hi>Core,</hi> and his companions.</p>
