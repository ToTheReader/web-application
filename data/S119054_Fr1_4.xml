   <head>TO THE RIGHT Honourable S<seg rend="sup">r</seg> THOMAS IERMYN Knight, Vice-Chamberlaine of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties houshold, Governor of the Ile of <hi>Iarsey,</hi> and one of his Majesties most Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Privie Councell.</head>

      <salute>SIR,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the last (and the same the first) work of this kinde, that I ever tooke in hand, I did not
<pb facs="3"/>
beleeve there had beene any power, besides that transcendent authoritie, which imposed that task upō me, of force to make me a second time expose my selfe to the view of the world, and under-lye the censure of this Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call age: For I did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that your selfe, who as wel by the rights of nature, as also (but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beyond them) by your so many merits, may with justice claime in me
<pb facs="3"/>
what interest you please, would ever have requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at my hāds, any thing of that nature, which your owne abilities stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in no need of, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in your particular be usefull to you. But you were pleased, which w<seg rend="sup">th</seg> mee shall ever have the force of a law, to cōmand it: In obedience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I here present you with your grave and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious <hi>Velleius Patercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> drest after my fashion
<pb facs="4"/>
in English robes. The benefit that such, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their acquaintance with him, now that after so many ages he is taught to speak our Ilanders lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, they shall reape by the familiarity with him, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> before they wanted; they must (if friends to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity) wholly and freely acknowledge themselves to have received from you. Since without your injunction, I had never adventured upon a piece
<pb facs="4"/>
of such difficulty, as I, now it is done, do make a question, whether my desire to observe you in all, did not more enable mee to goe through with it, then any faculty of mine owne. nor, when I had brought it to an end, had suffered it to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished: but that I would not permit you to want the honour of a good work, wherof you were the immediate author, I dare with cōfidence give
<pb facs="5"/>
it that Epithete, for that among so many histories as I have read, I have met with none (and in this I beleeve every judicious Reader will be of my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) that doth in so few, and yet those so ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant words, involve so much strength of wit and understanding. By that which remaines of him so full of excellencie, I am taught to deplore the losse, which all lovers of knowledge do suffer in
<pb facs="5"/>
the mutilation of so dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a piece in many places: but especially by that vast <hi>Hiatus</hi> in the first booke, in which all the glorious actions of the Romans from the foundation of the city till the ruine of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> kingdome by <hi>Emilius,</hi> during the space of five hundred yeares, or more, are swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up: what is now extant of him, though much short of his native beautie, and the lustre of
<pb facs="6"/>
his originall language: I humbly, desire you will accept as an eternall testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the respect and devotion of him, who is only sory that he hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion nor meanes in sort more suteable to your worth, to expresse how much he is</p>
