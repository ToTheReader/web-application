   <head>¶To the Reader, Grace and Peace from God. &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou hast here (good Christian Reader) a true narration, of that horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble facte, committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that godlye and great person, my Lorde the Prince of Orange, together with the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, depositions, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations and letters of sundrie heinous offēders in this wicked &amp; cruel deede: some of which are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die executed, thankes be to God for such Iustice; the other, howsoeuer they are escaped, as yet free from the punishment of men, haue, without vnfeigned repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, greater iudgements laide vp in store for them, with the Lord, who will plentifullie punishe such trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous and traiterous dealing. Concerning the credit and truth of this discourse, it is so plaine and sufficient, that neither all the Spaniardes in the worlde, nor all their fauourites whatsoeuer or wheresoeuer, shal be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iustlie any maner of way, to impugne or disgrace the same. The blow was giuen the greater is the sinne,
<pb facs="3"/>
and the good Prince grieuouslie wounded, the more is the pitie, if the Lord had otherwise seene it good. A Spaniarde was the first broacher of it, by publishing that horrible proscription which by the Princes Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie is fullie aunswered, both to the great shame and discredite of some, &amp; also to the wonderfull glorie and commendation of that good Prince. And as a Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde deuised it,<note place="margin">I meane the death of the partie, whiche also I praye GOD they maye long want, &amp; the church enioie his life, for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods glory in the same.</note> and a Spaniarde performed it, sundrie of that proude and cruell nation, being combined and comperted in it, as some of their own confessions, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before Gods Magistrates, doe plainlie witnesse it, whereby they haue bewraied their mischieuous mindes, though (thankes be to God for it) they haue hitherto missed of their purpose: so I must needes saie, that if anie should bee so shamelesse as to denie it, or so beastlie as to blanche it, or iustifie it (as I feare me some, and that no small some are) I would no more cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with suche, than with those, that would denie the Sunne to shine at noone daies. If there be none suche amongste vs, then there is no hurt done. But if they be here, or else where in the world (as Fraunce, Scotlande, and Flaunders, now at the last, haue yeelded vs some feareful examples) and it is to be thought, that we haue too too manie, of that same Iesuiticall sect, who blush not, both to reason too and fro, concerning such que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, and to labour the attempting thereof (as wee haue had of late proofe sufficient) and that not to the maiming of meane men, but to the hurting of the highest (whome I beseeche God in mercie long to preserue) then I would haue such to know and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that to them it is that I speake, not in heate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their persons, or to aggrauate their offences which are so grieuous, as no weight of wordes, cann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">

         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> God in the dutifull reuerence of hir Maiestie, in sound affection to the common wealth and countrie, and in loue vnfeigned towards them, wishing from my heart their heartie conuersion, if they appertaine to God, or else their vtter and speedie confusion (speciallie if they be such as the Lord hath sealed vp againste the daye of his wrath) for their stubbornnesse in heresies, touching matters of faith, and their practises againste the best in matters of estate: but inough of this matter at this time. The principall point, that I would haue the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reader (of what state or condition soeuer he be) to regard in this narration is, to labour to make it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to himselfe, that as generally it may instruct all, not to beleeue euery flying tale, but to let go running rumours and reportes, and withall earnestly to pray to God for all his children (my meaning is while they are aliue) that be so ouertaken, and namely for this good Prince his faithfull seruaunt, that according to Gods good pleasure, he and they all whatsoeuer in the like daungers, may recouer their wounds, and learne more Christian care and godlie wisedome in time hereafter to come: so particularlie, it may teach euery one, euen the hihhest fitst, and namely this, whome it doth moste chiefly concerne, that seeing that for their well doing, the enemies meane such mischiefes against them, they may carefully looke vnto themselues, that they be not surprised with such popish practises, being alwayes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie circumspect whome they admit to their presence and speeche, and so preuent such feareful daungers: and the lowest next, to pray to the Lord, as for themselues, that they be not intrapped, so chiefly for these that be their superiors (because if the head or principall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb facs="4"/>
be stroken, the whole bodie is in danger of death and destruction) that they may liue long and gouerne also, in truth, peace and godlinesse, without any suche wicked attempt, to be either deuised or performed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste them or any of them: which God graunt, as to all nations professing his word and truth, so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the nation and countrie of Englande, euen for his crucified Christes sake: that so the lande may flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe, by the long life and prosperous raigne, of these that bee in authoritie, and the Church increase, by the pure doctrine of the Gospell alreadie esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, and by the planting of Gods holye Discipline. So be it.</p>
