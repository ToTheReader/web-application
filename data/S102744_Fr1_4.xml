   <p>Gentle Reader, because the <hi>French</hi> (quoted in this <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi>) is somewhat mis-printed, and the <hi>Latine</hi> (though it be not much) may yet notwithstanding stumble the simple and such as be unlearned: I haue thought it not amisse to english both the one and the other; refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thee every where to the page, and line, where either of them is.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Pag. 5. line 9.</hi> Because the Kings power ought not to be wanting to holy Church.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ibid. line. 19.</hi> but by the lawful iudgment of his Peeres, or the law of the land.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Pag. 7. line 7.</hi> as before, pag <hi>5.</hi> line <hi>9.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>ibidem line 27. &amp;c.</hi> Supplication is made to the most excellent and gratious Prince, our Lord the King, on the behalfe of your humble Orators, the Prelats and Clergie of your kingdome of England, that whereas the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith founded upon Christ, and by his Apostles, and Church &amp;c.</p>
   <p>Which petitions of the Prelates &amp; Clergie before expressed, our Lord the King, with the consent of his Nobles and other Peeres of his Realme assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in present Parliament, hath graunted: and in every of them according to the forme &amp;c.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Pag. 8. line 8.</hi> Also the Commons pray, that sith it is conteyned in the great Charter, that none should be arrested, or imprisoned, without answer, or due processe of law, which Charter is confirmed in every Parliament, &amp;c. And besides they intreat, that if any be arrested or imprisoned contrary to the forme of the Charter aforesayd, that he may come and appeare to his answer, and take his iudgment, even as the law requireth: also that no such Arrest or Imprisonment may be drawne into custome, to the destruction of the law of the King.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ibidem, line 16.</hi> Let the Statutes, and the common law be kept.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ibid. line 20. &amp;c.</hi> Also the commons beseech, that whereas a statute was made in the last Parliament, in these words, It is ordeined in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that the Kings Commissions be directed to the Sheriffes, and other officers of the King, or to other sufficient persons, after and according as the certificates of the Prelates were wont to be in the Chauncery, from time to time and that such preachers, their favourers, abettours &amp;c.</p>
   <p>Which was never assented unto, nor graunted by the commons, but that which was done therein was done without their assent, and so the statute is of no force. For it was never their meaning to iustifie it, nor to binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, nor their successors, to the Prelates any more then their Auncestors had done in times past.</p>
   <p>It pleaseth the King.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Pag. 10. line 31.</hi> Because no man is bound to betray himselfe.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Pag. 11. line 9.</hi> An Oath in a mans owne cause is the devise of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, to throw the soules of poore men into Hell.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Pag. 12. line. 19.</hi> Nature is a preserver of it selfe.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ibidem line. 27.</hi> Without a certaine Author of the Bill exhibited no accusations ought to haue place, for it is both a thing of very evill example, and not the manner of these times.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Pag. 14. line. 26. &amp;c.</hi> The King can doe nothing upon earth (seeing he is the servant and lieuetenant of God) but that which he may lawfully doe: because that power belongeth onely to God, but the power of doing wrong belongeth to the Devill, and not to God, and the workes of which so ever of these the King shall doe, his servant he is.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Pag. 15. line. 12.</hi> condemned for what cause so ever.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Pag. 18. line. 2.</hi> We will not haue the lawes of England to be changed.</p>
   <p>Gentle Reader, in pag. 29. line 21. there is gone purused, for pursued, the which I pray thee to amend.</p>
