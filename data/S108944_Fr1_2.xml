   <opener>Wiliam Cicill hauing taken muche profit by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> reading of this treatyse folowing, wisheth vnto euery christian by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> reading therof like profit with increase from god.</opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oste gentle &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian reader, yf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers shoulde be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed by their reporters, than the reportes, warraunted by the maters, I might iustely bewayle our tyme wherin euil deades be well woorded, and good actes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill cleped. But synce truthe is, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> thinges be not good for their prayses, but be praysed for their goodnes, I doe not moue the to lyke this christian treatise, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I haue mynde to prayse it, but I exhorte the to mynde it, &amp; for the goodnes, thou shalt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe

it, for whose likinge I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not to obteyne, only moued by my example, their iudgement I regarde chieflye confirmed by by the matier. Truely our tyme is so disposed, to graunte good names to euill fruites, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lente termes to meane workes, that neyther can good dedes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye their due names being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded by the euill, neyther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellente workes can possesse their worthy termes beinge forstalled by the meane. In so muche that men seeke rather, howe muche they can, then howe muche they ought to saye: inclininge more to their pleasure, thē to theyr iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to shewe them selues rather elo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>uent, then the matier good: so that neyther the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the cause can moue them
<pb facs="3"/>
to saye more, neyther the euilnes lesse. For if the excellencye of this christian contemplacion eyther for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> goodnes herin to maruaill, appering eyther for the proffyt herupon to the reader ensewinge shoulde be with due commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion folowed, I of necessitie shoulde eyther trauayle to fynde oute newe wordes, the olde being anticipated by euill matiers, or wishe that the commen speache of praysing were spared vntill conuenient maters were founde to spende it: suche is the plentye of praysing, and scarcenes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing. Wherfore lackinge the manner in woordes, and not the matier in deade of high commē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion, I am compelled, to kepe in my iudgemente with sylence, trusting whō my reaport coulde
<pb facs="4"/>
not haue moued to lyke thys present treatise, the worthines of the matier shal compell to geue it honour. Any earthely manne woulde sone be stirred to see some mistery of magike, or practise of alchumye, or perchaunce some enchauntemente of Elementes: But thou whiche art christened, hast here a wonderful mistery of the mercy of god, a heuenly prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of regeneracion, a spirituall Enchauntement of the grace of god. Yf Ioye and tryumphes be shewed when a kinges childe is borne to the worlde, what Ioye is sufficient, when goddes childe is regenerated from heauen.</p>
   <p>Thone is fleshe whiche is borne of fleshe: The other is spirite, whiche is borne of Spirit. The one also shall wither like y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> grasse
<pb facs="4"/>
of the yearth in shorte tyme, the other shal lyue in heauen beyond al time. Yf the finding of one lost shepe, be more ioyfull, then the hauing of ninetie and nyne, what Ioye is it to consyder the returne of a straye childe of almightye god, whose returne teacheth the nyentie and nine to come to their folde? Euen suche cause of Ioye is this, that the Aungells in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen take comforte herin: be thou therfore ioyfull where a noble childe is newlie borne: shewe thy selfe gladde where the lost shepe hathe wunne the hole flocke: be thou not sad, wherin Aungelles reioyce. Here mayst thou see one, if the kinde maye moue the a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, if degre may prouoke the a woman of highe estate, by birthe made noble, by mariage most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb facs="5"/>
by wisdome godly, by a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty king, an excellent Quene, by a famous Henry, a renoumed Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theryne, a wife to hym that was a kinge to realmes: refusinge the worlde wherin she was loste, to obteyne heauen wherin she maye be saued: abhorringe synne, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che made her bounde, to receyue grace, wherby she may be fre: dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pising fleshe the cause of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, to put on the spirite, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cause of sanctificacion: forsaking ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce wherin she was blind, to come to knowledge, wherby she may se: remouing superstici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherwith she was smothered, to enbrace trew Religion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she may reuiue. The fruit of thys treatise (good Reader) is thye amendment: this only had, the writer is satisfied. This good
<pb facs="5"/>
lady thought no shame to detect her sinne, to obteyne remissiō: no vilenes, to become nothing, to be a mēbre of hī, which is al thinges is all: no folye to forget the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the worlde, to lerne the Simplicitie of the gospel: at the last, no displeasauntnes to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myt her selfe to the scole of the Crosse, the learning of the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixe, the booke of our redēpciō, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> very obsolute library of goddes mercye and wisdome. Thys way thought she her honour encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and her state permanente, to make her yearthlye honour heauenly, and neglect the transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye for the euerlastynge. Of this I woulde the warned that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> profit may ensewe. These greate misteries, and graces be not well perceyued, except they be suerly
<pb facs="6"/>
studied, neyther be they perfectly studied, except they be diligently practised: neither profitablye practysed, without amendement. Se &amp; lerne hereby what she hath doone, then mayst thou practise, and amend that thou canst do: so shalt thou practise with ease ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a guyde, &amp; amende w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, hauing a zeale. It is easyer to see these, then to learne: begynne at the easyest to come to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: see thou her confession, that thou maist lerne her repētaunce: practyse her perseueraunce, that thou mayst haue lyke amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente: displease thy selfe, in es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewing vice, that thou mayste please god in askynge grace: let not shame hinder thy confessiō, whiche hindred not the offence: be
<pb facs="6"/>
thou sure yf we knowledge our sinnes, god is faythful to forgiue vs, and to clense vs from all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryghteousnes: obey y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> prophetes saying: declare thy wayes to the lord. Thus far thou maist learne to knowe thy selfe: next this be thou as diligent to releiue thye selfe in goddes mercy, as thou hast bē to reuele thy selfe in thine owne repentaunce. For god hath cōcluded al thinges vnder sinne, because he woulde haue mercy vpon al, who hath also borne our sinnes in his body, vpon the tre, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we shoulde be delyuered from sinne, &amp; shoulde lyue vnto right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wisnes, by whose stripe we be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: here is oure anker, here is our shepeherd, here we be made hole, here is our life, our redempcion,
<pb facs="7"/>
our saluacion, and our blisse: let vs therfore nowe fede by thys gracious quenes example, and be not ashamed to become in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession publicanes, since thys no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lady wil be no Pharesie. And to all ladies of estate I wishe as ernest minde to folow our quene in vertue, as in honour: that they might once appere to prefer god before the worlde: and be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in religion, whiche nowe be honorable in vanyties: so shall they (as in some vertuouse ladies of right high estate it is with greate comforte seene) taste of this fredome of remission of this euerlastyng blisse, whiche exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all thoughtes and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinges, and is prepared for the holie in spirite, for the which let vs with our intercessiō in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes
<pb facs="7"/>
and purenes of lyfe, offer our selfes to the heauenly father an vndefiled host: to whom be eternall prayse and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye through all the yearth, without ende. Amen.</p>
