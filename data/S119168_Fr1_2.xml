And hauing also sufficiently answered and put to silence such iniurious and slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Bookes, writings, and libels, as our said aduersaries had put in light, whereby they thought &amp; sought to make vs odious vnto al kinds of people: our hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidēce was that thei wold haue once abstai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from their slaunderous writings, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it so smally serued their purpose: which for a long time they séemed to doe. But at the last, perceyuing y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> since their ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rānous regimēt began, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> longer, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> more it became lothsome vnto all people: and that there was small hope to obteyne to their

former aucthoritie, force, and regiment, by force of armes, do now returne to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed prancks, and would faine vnder pretence of pardons, and letters of fauour (through false accusations) bring vs in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with all men, and by vntrue persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons séeme to purge their owne factes, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alluring the people vnto them, and so by littel and littell reduce the townes &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries reuolted from them, to their vile yoke of seruitude.</p>
   <p>And to that intent haue they of late put forth a certaine letter vnder the name of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Duke of Alba, offering therby pardon and forgiuenes vnto the said townes of al their trāsgressions (as they term it) cōditionally, that they shoulde willingly submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to their obeysance and subiection. Which letters were by meanes of them of Amsterdam dispersed into diuers townes in Holland.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding, we are assured suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently that no person of vnderstanding &amp; discretion, much lesse townes &amp; countries, wilbe moued by these their cautelous and most false and slaunderous Bookes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from the frée and loyall obedience &amp;
