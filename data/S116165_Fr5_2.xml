   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RABLE (AND TRVLY NOBLE) FRANCIS, Lord RVSSELL, Baron of <hi>Thornehaugh,</hi> and Earle of <hi>Bedford.</hi>

   <opener>
      <salute>RIGHT HONOVRABLE,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I had the honour to referre, to that Valiant, Wise, and Honest Nobleman, <hi>Arthur,</hi> Lord <hi>Chichester,</hi> Baron of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast</hi> (whose sublime merits doe here justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and challenge this Testimonie from my Duety, That hee was too good for Earth, and therefore is now so soone crowned a Saint in Heaven) I then had first the happinesse to know, and to be knowne of your Honour at your <hi>Cheswicke;</hi> In whom (because I ever hold it a farre lesse crime to speake the truth, then either to silence or dissemble it) I then found so many prints and stamps of true honour, and Characters of ancient Goodnesse and Nobilitie, that (with a pleasing content and delectation) I was enforced to be againe and againe enamoured of Vertue and Honour for your sake, and reciprocally, to love and respect your Lordship for both their sakes. Since when (out of your generositie, not my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or deserts) your Honour was pleased to conferre a favour on me, the which though you forget, yet the remembrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="232"/>
I will (with equall Zeale, and Ambition) strive to make as eternall, as I know my selfe to be mortall and transitorie. You are a Religious <hi>Christian,</hi> and a true hearted <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> and therefore as it is your glory, so it is our happinesse, that you are both a constant Lover of God and his Church, and a firme and faithfull honourer of your Prince and Countrey; and you are now Lord Lieutenant (under our Royall and Gracious Soveraigne) of that famous County of <hi>Devon,</hi> and faire, and honourable Citie of <hi>Excester,</hi> to which I owe my nativitie; and in both which the <hi>Russels</hi> (Earles of <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford)</hi> your Noble Ancestors have condignely left behind them many honourable Trophees of their <hi>Valour,</hi> and sweet and precious perfumes of their <hi>Vertue.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>These premises being so powerfull in truth, and so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and prevalent in Reason, I therefore flatter my selfe with this hope, that your <hi>Honour</hi> will attribute it rather to Dutie, then Presumption in me, If I now publikely attempt to profer and sacrifice up something to the Honour of your Illustrious <hi>Name,</hi> and to the Dignity of your resplendent <hi>Vertues:</hi> Missing therefore of that desired happinesse (by some rare, or elaborate peece) sufficiently to testifie to your Lordship and to the whole world, what you are to mee in the height of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and what I am, and desire to bee found of you in the lownesse of <hi>Observance</hi> and <hi>Humilitie,</hi> It will therefore bee no lesse my Felicitie, then your Goodnesse, If you vouchsafe to accept and patronize this my Fift Booke of foraigne <hi>Tragicall Histories,</hi> and also please to permit them to travell and seeke their Fortunes abroad in the world, under the auspitious Planet, and authenticall Passeport of your Noble Protection, wherein you may behold and see, how soundly, how sacredly the Iustice of God meets with this crying and scarlet Sinne of <hi>Murther,</hi> which (in these our depraved, and sinfull times) in contempt of the Lawes of
<pb facs="232"/>
      <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> make so lamentable and so prodigious a progression; and how sharpely and severely it (deservedly) punisheth (those Butchers, and Monsters of Nature) the perpetrators thereof; And if I may borrow (for I desire not to usurpe) any part of your Lordships houres of leisure to give first to the Knowledge, and then to the Contemplation of these Histories, and the severall Accidents which they report and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, I shall then triumph in my good fortune, as having obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Favour,</hi> which I ingenuously acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I am farre more capable to desire then deserve.</p>
   <p>I come now to implore pardon of your <hi>Honour</hi> for this my Presumption, in inscribing and adventuring so meane a worke to your noble acceptance. And I have ended this my Epistle, as soone as began, to assure you, That I will ever (religiously) pray unto God to accumulate all prosperities and blessings on your <hi>Honour;</hi> as also on your most Vertuous <hi>Countesse,</hi> and successively on your Honourable and Flourishing Posteritie, who now promise no lesse then a happy and famous perpetuitie to your thrice Noble Name, and Family.</p>
