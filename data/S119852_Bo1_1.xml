   <head>❧The preface to the
Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>IT may seem strange vnto thee (Christian
Reader) that any of the Englysh nation
should for the truth of the Gospell be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to forsake their native country, &amp; live
in exile, especially in these dayes when the
Gospel seemeth to have free passage &amp; flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in that land. And for this cause have our
exile ben hardly thought of by many, and
evil spoken of by some, who know not (as
it seemeth) eyther the trew estate of the
Church of England, or causes of our forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and separation from the same, but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>this sect</hi> (as they call it) <hi>to be every
where spoken against,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 28 2</note> have (without all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
search) accounted and divulged vs
as heretickes, or Schismatickes at the least.
Yea some (and such as worst might) have
sought the increase of our afflictions, even
here also if they could: which thing they
have both secretly and openly attempted.
This hath Sathan added vnto all our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sorrowes, envying that we should have
rest in any part of the inhabited world, and
therfore ceaseth not to <hi>make warre with the
remnant of the womans seed,</hi>

his former <hi>Israel</hi> out of Egypt &amp; when <hi>they
walked about from nation to nation, from one
Kingdome to an other people, suffered no man to
do them wrong, but reproved Kinges for their
sakes:</hi> the same Lord yet liveth to mainteyn

hyde vs vnder his winges, and vnder his

   <p>And though we could for our partes wel
have borne this rebuke of Christ in silence,
aud left our cause to him who iudgeth iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
al the children of men: yet for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
&amp; clearing of the truth of God
from reproches of men, and for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others together with our selves to the

we have thought it needfull &amp; our duty
to make knowen vnto the world, our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyned

   </p>
   <p>But first we desire thee, good Reader,
to vnderstand, and mynd that we have not
in any dislyke of the Civill estate and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
government in that <hi>Common wealth,</hi>
which we much like and love, separated
our selves from that <hi>Church:</hi> Neyther have
we shaken of our alleageance and dutifull
obedyence to our Soveraigne PRINCE,
the honorable Counsellers, and other
Magistrates set over vs, but have alwayes
and still do reverēce love and obey them
every one in the Lord, opposing our selves
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>
against all enemyes forreigne or domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal:
against all invasions, insurrections, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
or conspiracies by whomsoever inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
against the Prince and the State, and
are ready to adventure our lives in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
if need require. Neither have our
greatest adversaryes ever ben able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint
vs of the least disloyalty in this regard.
And though now we be exiled, yet do we
dayly pray &amp; wil for the preservation peace
&amp; prosperity of our Soveraigne Prince &amp; al
the dominions of that kingdome.</p>
   <p>And whereas we have been accused of
<hi>intrusion into the Magistrates office,</hi> as going
about our selves to reforme the abuses in
that land, it is a mere malicious calumnie,
which our adversaries have forged out of
their own hart.<note place="margin">Neh. 6. 6. 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</note> We have alwayes both by

ever attempted or purposed any such

our selves and our lives according
to the rule of Gods word, by absteyning
from al evill &amp; keeping the cōmandements
of Iesus: leaving the suppressing and cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of those remnants of Idolatry, vnto
the Magistrates, to whom it belongeth.</p>
   <p>And further we testify by these presents
vnto all men, &amp; desyre them to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
heerof, that we have not forsaken any
poynt of the true Ancient Catholicke and
Apostolike fayth professed in our land: but

hold the same groundes of Christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

relate, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o briefly as in so large and
confuse a subject we can.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>First,</hi> in the planting and constituting of
their Church (at the beginning of
Queen Elizabets reigne) they receyved at
once into <hi>the body of that Church,</hi> as mēbers,
the whole land, which generally then stood
for the most part professed Papists, who
had revolted from the profession, which
they made in the dayes of King Edward of
happy memory, and shed much blood of
many Christian Martyrs in Queen Maryes
dayes. This people yet standing in this
<pb n="10" facs="6"/>
fearful sinful state, in Idolatry, blyndnes, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
and all manner wickednes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any professed repentance, and without
the meanes thereof, namely the preaching
of the word going before, were by force &amp;
authority of Law only compelled, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
received into the bosome and body
of the Church, their seed baptised, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
receved and compelled to the Lords
supper, had this ministery and service
(which now they vse) inioyned &amp; set over
thē, and ever synce they and their seed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
in this estate, being all but one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
commonly called <hi>the Church of England.</hi>
Here are none exempted or excluded, be
they never so prophane or wretched, no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist,
adulterer, thief, or murderer, no ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
perjurer, Witch or conjurer, <hi>&amp;c▪</hi> al are
one fellowship, one body, one Church.
Now let the law of God be looked into, and
there wilbe found, that such persons<note n="‡" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5. Ier. 51. 26.</note> are
not fit stones for the Lords spiritual howse,
no meet members for Christs glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
None of yeares<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 2. 38. 40. 41. and 8. 36. 37. &amp; 15 9. Ioh 10. 3. 4 5. Esa. 35. 8. 9.</note> may be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church without fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

repentance and submission vnto the Gospel

   <p>

      </gap>rout of the popish multitude without
any distinctiō, for mēbers of their Church▪
so have they set over them (as reason was)
the same popish Clergie &amp; Prelacy, which
they receved from the Romish Apostasie,
and this day is to be found in the popish
Churches:<note place="margin">About forty ecclesiasticall popish offices are at this day in the Church of England, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Christ in his Testament.</note> to witt, <hi>Archbs, Primates, Bbs.
Metropolitanes, Suffraganes, Archdeacōs, Deanes,

that rable, which rule and govern these as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblyes
according to <hi>the Popish Canons,
Rites, and Customes.</hi> These have the power
and aucthoritie in their hands to set forth
Injunctions, to make and depose Ministers,
to excommunicate both Priests and people,
which they do very exquisitly, if they yeeld
not vnto them their due homage and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
These have both Ecclesiastical and
Civil aucthoritie, to reigne as Princes in the
Church and live as Lords in the Common
wealth, to punish, imprison, and persecute
even to death al that dare but once mutter
against their vnlawfull proceedings. Of
these Prelates tyranny cruelty &amp; vnlawful

they are called) amount to a certeine sūme
of money in the Princes booke, then
must they preach, or get some other to
preach for them fower sermons in a yeare
in their parish. Where also must be noted
that the most part of these Priests are vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
vnlearned, and cannot preach at all:
whereby it commeth to passe that most of
the people are as blynd as they were in the
<pb n="13" facs="7"/>
dark dayes of popery. These Ministers
generally, aswel preachers as other, live in
feare &amp; servitude vnder their foresaid Lords

now of late being wearyed with these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,

end our lives by violent death or most
miserable imprisonment, as many of our
brethren before vs have done. For so great
is the malice and power of those Romysh
Priests, that they persecute vnto death such
as speak against them: and such poor
Christians as they cast into their noysome
prysons, can seldome or never get out
(except with shipwrack of conscience) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
they be caryed forth vpon the Bere.
Neyther is there any care taken for their
relief in this case: but being cast into pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
there they are deteyned without any
alloweance of meat or money for their
mayntenance, be their want and poverty
never so great. If they have any thing of
their own, there they are driven to spend
it vp: if they have nothing, there they
are left by the Prelates to feed on the
ayre. And that they may more readily
be sterved, or weakened in the truth, they
are cōmonly shut vp in close pryson, their
frends &amp; acquayntance being not suffred
to come at them: Nay even their wives
&amp; children being kept and debarred from
them by the tyranny of these bloody Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats
<pb n="19" facs="10"/>
and their Instruments: whose hard
harts and vnnaturall cruelty, if thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
vnderstand (gentle Reader) as many of
vs haue felt and to this day yet feel, it
would make thy hart to bleed, considering
their vnmercyfull and barbarous dealing.
And how many soules haue perished in
their prisons through miserable vsage, how
many have ben put to death, and how many
banished, though we could to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
infamy relate to all the world, yet wil
we not blaze abroad their acts (for we
take no delight in laying opē their shame)
but mourne for them in secret, cōmitting
our cause to God that judgeth justly, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
that <hi>he that maketh inquisition for blood
remembreth it,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 9. 12.</note>
      <hi>and will not forget the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of the poore.</hi> And thou (Christian
Reader) vouch safe to remember vnto God
in thy prayers such as yet remayne in
bandes and pryson amongest them for the
testimony of Iesus,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 3.</note> enduring a hard sight
of afflictions, and having the sentence of
death in them selves, are like (if the Lord
send not vnexspected deliverance) there
to end their dayes.</p>
   <p>Concerning our selves, who through
the mercy of God have found a place of
rest in this land, for which benefyt we
are alwayes and every where humbly
thankfull: we desyre (Christian Reader)
thy charitable and Christian opinion of
<pb n="20" facs="11"/>
and holy prayers vnto God for vs, whose
kingdome we seek, whose ordinances we
desire to establish and obey: protesting
with good consciences, that it is the truth
of his Gospel only for which we strive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those cursed reliques of <hi>Antichristian
apostasie:</hi> vnto which we dare in no wise
submit our selves, no not for a moment.
For if it be not lawfull for Christians at
this day to reteyn the ceremonyes of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Law together with the Gospel, as the
<hi>Passeover, Circumcision, the Priesthood, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
&amp;c.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4. 5. 6. &amp;. 5. 1. 2. Heb. 8. &amp; 9. &amp; 10. chap.</note> which yet were once cōmanded
by God himself: how can we think it
tollerable to observe the odious ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Antichrist, or submit our selves to
his <hi>lawes, Priesthood, Hierarchie, &amp; traditions,</hi>
which the Lord never allowed, &amp; which
never entred into his heart: yea which he
hath so severely forbidden, with fearfull
judgments threatned vnto all that shal so
do.</p>
   <p>But because we have ben very grievously
slaundred in our owne nation, and the
bruit thereoff hath followed vs vnto this
land, whereby we have ben hardly deemed
of by many without cause, we have ben
forced at length to publysh this brief but
true <hi>Confession of our fayth,</hi> for the clearing
of our selves from sclaunder, and satisfying
of many who desired to knowe the thinges
we hold. Wherein if in any thing we erre
<pb n="21" facs="11"/>
(as who is so perfit that he erreth not) we
crave (good Reader) thy Christian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
censure and information, promising
alwayes (through the grace of God) to
yeild vnto the truth when it shall be further
shewed vs, and leave our errors when by
the light of his word they shalbe reproved.
In lyke manner it shall be thy par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> and
duty to acknowledge and submytt vnto
the truth, by whomsoever it is professed,
looking alwayes rather to the preciousnes
of the treasure it self then to the base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the vessels which conteyne it,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

the infirmities of those that witnes the

summe of our Christian saith: try al thinges
by the true light of Gods word: and if
