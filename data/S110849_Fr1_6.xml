   <head>THE ARGVMENT OF THE WHOLE HISTORIE OF IVDITH.</head>
   <p>AFter that the Children of IZREL were deliuered from captiuitie &amp; returned to their lād, the cittie of IERVSALEM ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified, the Temple builded, and prepared to the scruice of the Lorde, the multitude of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being scattred in sundry townes &amp; places of the land, where they liued in peaceable rest: the Lorde knowing man to bee negligent of God &amp; his saluation, chiefly when hee liues at ease, and all things frames vnto his frail desire, to th'end that his people should nōt fall in such an inconuenient, would exercise them with a fearefull affliction and temptation, sending vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their countrey an armie so great in nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and puislance, that made the whole earth to tremble. This expeditiō was vnder the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Monark,</hi> named in the history <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi> (which neuerthelesse is not his right name.) His chief Lieutenant generall &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor of the whole Armie, was <hi>Holophernes,</hi> who (whersoeuer he came) ouerthrewe all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiō, permitting none to inuocate or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any other God, but NABVCHADNE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZAR,
<pb facs="8"/>his Maister, whome hee enforced to constitute and establish for the onely God. So entred hee <hi>Iudea</hi> with entent to distroye it all, which the people perceiuing his power to be so great that no nation could resist him, and also knowing his cruell hatred, were sore affraide, and almost driuen to extreame despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration seing none other thing present before them, but ruine and distruction. And this the Lord suffred, to show (in time) his work to be more wonderfull. For the people being hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and hauing called to the lorde for mercy &amp; succour at his hand, hee both hard and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured them at neede. The meane was not through strength or stoutnes of some worthie Captain, but by the hand of IVDITH, a tēder feeble womā, to the shame of this most proud &amp; cruell tyrant, and all his heathen hoste. For she cut off his head, put all his camp to flight, distroyd his men of Armes, in such wise that they fled here and there, &amp; seeking to saue their liues. left all their tents and baggage. Thus the Lord by the weake, and those that are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, makes his works admirable. By one selfe meane he saued his owne, &amp; executed his iustice against his enemies. In which we haue
<pb facs="8"/>to consider his singuler prouidence and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the care which he hath in especiall for his faithfull, and all his whole church. This History is entituled by the name of IVDITH, because it conteines the narration of her great vertues, and for that the Lord vsed her as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument for the deliuerance of his people. It is not certaine who was the first Author hereof, neuerthelesse the reading of it hath bene receiued in the Church for the doctrine &amp; vtilitie of the same.</p>
