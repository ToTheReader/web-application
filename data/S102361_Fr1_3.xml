      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>LORVS (saith
IVSTVS LIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIVS,
who in
M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. CAMDENS
opinion carryed the Sunne
of antiquity before him)
<hi>wrote a briefe, not so much
of</hi> Liuie <hi>(from whom he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
dissenteth) as of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>affaires, in my poore
conceite, aptly, elegantly,
neatly. There is in him a
sharpnesse of wit, and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of speech, oftentimes
admirable; and certaine
gemmes as it were, and
<pb facs="6"/>
iewels of wise sentences, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
by him with good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisement,
and veritie.</hi> Thus
farre that excellent master,
and with him let thy
iudgement goe, if thou
wilt herein doe iustice,
howsoeuer, with <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
Stadius,</hi> FLORVS
is but <hi>a tumultuarie author:</hi>
for so it pleaseth that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Critike to style him,
ouer-loading him with
the comparison of incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<hi>Liuie.</hi> Bee it free,
with reuerence and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie,
to note ouer-sights
(as none doe want them)
and for me also, a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour
of sober freedome, to
taxe that as an ouer-sight
in manners, to vse such au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb facs="6"/>
sowrely, without
whom the Criticks fame
had often-times beene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
or none at all. In
mine <hi>Hypercriticks,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our countreys
Historie, I haue dealt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as a man desirous to
stirre vp a <hi>Liuie,</hi> or a <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
to our selues. There is
little left testifide touching
him, or rather nothing at
all, but what himselfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth,
which is, that
hee liued in <hi>Traians</hi> time.
Coniecture propounds vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, that hee was of the
<hi>Seneca's</hi> (that also is my
opinion) and so an <hi>Annaean</hi>
by line (that is, of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish-house,
or family of
the <hi>Annaeans)</hi> and they
<pb facs="7"/>
who entitle him to bee of
the <hi>Iulij,</hi> haue also their
diuinatorie reasons. His
generous, bright, and
flowrie writings (the best
memoriall) are aliue, and
now translated into our
vulgar, with as much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie
as one Englishmans
English could attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
for the present; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
where with a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ayme to his meaning,
howsoeuer it may bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times mist, the diuersity
of Copies, like a change of
the marke, and the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
manner of his stile like
a sudden blast comming
betweene. For this is true,
that there are in FLORVS
sundrie knots, not easie to
<pb facs="7"/>
vntie, while he, desirous to
speake quick, and close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
our vnderstanding
in him, wanteth roome as
it were, and that scope
which is, hath somewhat
thicke in it, amounting to
a clowdinesse:
<q>—breuis esse laboro,
obscurus fio—</q>
more perhaps, in this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
through corruption
of manuscripts, and Prints,
or of our duller-pointed
wits, then through his
fault, whose writings are
altogether as luminous,
as acuminons.</p>
   <p>First, the names of men,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
nations, places, offices, and
things, peculiar to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
need a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter,
<pb facs="8"/>
which this pocket-volume
will not handsomely
permit, at least-wise not in
present.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the words which
are here and there inserted
in a different letter through
the text of <hi>Florus,</hi> are for
the most part explanatorie
of the authors meaning, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
marginall notes.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, one elegancie,
which is almost perpetuall in
him, and answers to the first
similitude, in which hee fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
the whole people of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in the person of a
<hi>MAN</hi> (as the frontispice
sheweth) it lost for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part, throughout the
translation, where the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
number sorts not so well,
<pb facs="8"/>
but breedes perplexitie, or
obscurenesse.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, The doctrines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
which hee followes both in
<hi>Theologie,</hi> and moralitie,
and vpon which the fabricke
of his narrations standeth,
are such as thou art to expect
from an heathen, with whom
<hi>Polytheism,</hi> or pluralitie of
Gods, was an article of faith,
and among whom, <hi>selfe-kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
to auoid disgrace, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
an high point of true
magnanimitie, and the like,
which haue small danger in
them now, &amp; their <hi>examen</hi>
will else-where fall out fitly.</p>
   <p>Fifthly, The numbers in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
the margine, signifie the
yeeres from <hi>Rome</hi> built,
which these letters, <hi>A. V. C.</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/>
doe denotate, that is, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
Vrbis Conditae; in the
yeere of Rome Built,</hi> such,
or such. A discouerie not
worthy of any one, but onely
of them, who are nothing
else in a manner, but meere
English. Necessarie is it here
notwithstanding, for expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the author, who (as
the frontispice, which (with
the helpe of the authors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face)
interprets it-selfe,
vnfoldeth) by a most exact,
and studied method of brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
hath summ'd the whole
time of <hi>Rome</hi> in grosse, and
distributed it into ages, as
<hi>Lactatius Firmianus</hi> (vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
I know not what <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
for it) and <hi>Ammianus
Marcellinus</hi> in his eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb facs="9"/>
booke, and <hi>lornan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
an vsurper, and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of <hi>Florus</hi> his wit) vnder
the I'mperour <hi>Iustinian.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>What the translatour
thinkes worthy of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
time, to knew further,
requires a large booke, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then an Epistle, and
that also wil be but a briefe
vpon a briefe) of all the
old <hi>Roman</hi> wisedome ciuill,
and martiall, as here thou
hast of their facts. Enioy
this translation in the mean
time, and let not vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
strangle any intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for thy more satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
nor shew thee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of such a treasure, as
which, after aboue one
thousand foure hundred
<pb facs="10"/>
yeers cōtinuance (twice the
time of this storie) grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stronger in <hi>the</hi> world
by one language more then
his owne (when the <hi>Roman</hi>
empire it selfe (the subiect
of the booke) hath long
since in a manner come
to nothing) doth
giue great hope
that it is to be
immortall.</p>
