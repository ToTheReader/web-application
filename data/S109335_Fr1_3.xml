So that where oftentimes feeling and effectuall words, though neuer so sensible, do passe the Reader without due consideratiō, pictures that especially are discerned by the sense, are such helps to the weaknes of cōmon vnderstandings, that they make words as it were

deedes, and set the whole substance of that which is offered, before the sight and conceipt of the Reader. Therefore for instruction sake is his labour worthilie bestowed, that vndertooke and accomplished the Translation of this booke: contayning precepts and rebukes to our behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</p>
   <p>Wherein if the verse be any thing obscure, the Impreses or pictures make it more liuely, and in a manner actuall. For the credite and acceptation of it, let the estimation which it had in the French suffise to grace and commend it Englished: being dedicated vnto the Queene of Nauarre, whose dignity should not haue bene presented with a worke of any small value. Which suppositions and authorities though they make it nothing the better, yet serue they verie worthily to moue thy desire to the triall of the Contents, both by seeing and reading them. Wherein let not the common conceipts of the world withdrawe thy minde, which hateth anything that is bitter, to their flattering de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes: but mooued with thine owne profite,
<pb facs="5"/>
and helpe of thy better part, requite the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours paines in reading and obseruing, and thou shalt double his deserts in thine owne profite.</p>
