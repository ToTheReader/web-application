      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I call to remē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> as well the face of the corrupted Religion in England at what tyme Paules churcheyarde in the Citie was occupied by makers of alabaster ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be set vp in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and they of Pater noster rowe earned their lyuing hy makyng of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noster bedes only, they of Aue lane by sellyng A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue bedes, of Crede lane by makyng of Crede bedes: as also the vaine Rites crepte into our countrey of Wales, whan in steade of the lyuyng God men worshipped dead images of wood and stones, belles and bones, with other such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain reliques I wot what, and with all consider our late general reuolt from Goddes most holy worde once recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and dayly heare of the lyke inforced vppon our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern in forain countryes, hauing most piteousely sustei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned great calamities, bitter afflictions, and merciles perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions: vnder which verye many doe yet styll remaine: I can not, most Christian Prince, and gracious Soueraine, but euen as dyd the poore blynde Bartimeus, or Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane lepre to our Sauiour, so com I before your maiesties

feete, and there lying prostrate not onely for my self, but also for the deliuery of many thousandes of my countrey folkes from the spirituall blyndnes of ignoraunce, and fowl infection of olde Idolatrie and false superstition, most humbly, and dutifully to acknowlege your incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable benefite bestowed vpon vs in graunting the sacred Scriptures the verye remedie &amp; salue of our gostly blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and leprosie, to be had in our best knowen tongue: which as far as euer I can gather (thoughe Christs trewe Religion sometyme floorished emong our Auncesters the old Britons) yet were neuer so entierlye and vniuersallye had, as we now (God be thanked) haue them. Our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men in tymes passed were in dede most loth (and that not wythout good cause) to receaue the Romish religion, and yet haue they nowe synce (such is the domage of euyll custome) bene loth to forsake the same, and to receue the gospell of Iesus Christ. But after that thys nation, as it is thought, for their apostasie had ben sore plagued wyth long warres, and finally vanquished and by rigorouse la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes kept vnder, yet at the last it pleased God of his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed clemencie to looke down agayne vpon them, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a most godly and noble Dauid and a wyse Salomon, I meane Henry the seuenth and his sonne Henry the eight, both Kynges of most famous memorie, and your Graces father and grandfather: who graciously released their paynes and mitigated their intolerable burthens, the one wyth Charters of liberties, the other wyth Actes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyament by abandoning from them al bondage and thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and incorporating them wyth his other louing Subiectes of England. Thys, no doubt, was no small be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit touchyng bodily welth: but thys benefit of your Maiesties prouidence and goodnesse excedeth that other so far as the Soule doeth the bodye. Certaine noble wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, wherof some were chiefe rulers of thys nowe your Isle of Britain, are by Antiquitie vnto vs for their singuler

learning and heroical vertues hyghely commended, as Cambra the Fayre, Martia the Good, Bunduica the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riar, Claudia Rufina mencioned in S. Paules Epistle, and Helena mother of the great &amp; fyrst Christian Emperour Constantinus Magnus, and S. Vrsula of Cornwal with such other, who are also at thys day styl renowmed: but of your Maiestie, I may, as I thynk, right well vse the wordes of that Kinge who surnamed himselfe Lemuel, <hi>Many doughters haue don vertuously: but thou surmountest them all. Fauour is deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and beautie is vanitie: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shal be praysed.</hi> For if M. Magdalen for the bestowyng of a boxe of material oynctment, to annoynct Christes carnal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, be so famouse thorowe out all the world where the Gospell is preached, howe muche more shall your munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence by conferring the vnction of the holy Ghost, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynct his spiritual body the Churche, be euer had in memory? But to conclude and to drawe neare to offer vp my vowe: wher as I, by our most vigilant Pastours the Bishopes of Wales, am called and substituted, though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, somwhat to deale in the perusing and setting fourth of thys so worthy a matter, I thynk it my most bounden duetie here in their name, to present to your Maiestie (as the chiefest fyrst fruict) a booke of the Newe Testament of our Lorde Iesus Christ, translated into the British language, which is our vulgare tongue, wyshyng and most humbly praying, if it shall so seme good to your wysedome, that it myght remayne in your M. Librarie for a perpetuall monument of your graciouse bountie shewed herein to our countrey and the Church of Christ there. And would to God that your Graces subiectes of Wales might also haue the whole booke of Gods woord brought to like passe: then might their felow subiectes of England reioycingly pronounce of them in these wordes, <hi>The people that sate in darknes, haue seene a great lyght: they that dwelled in the land of the shadowe of death, vpon them hath the lyght shyned. Blessed

are the people, that be so, yea blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord.</hi> Yea the wold they both together thus brotherly say, <hi>Come, and let vs go vp to the mountaine of the Lord, to the house of Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and he wyll teache vs hys wayes, and we wyll walke in his pathes. &amp;c</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And thus to ende, I beseeche almyghtye God, that as your Graces circumspect prouidence doth perfectlye accomplish and discharge your princely vocation &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernaunce towardes all your humble subiectes, that we also on our part may toward God and your highnes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane our selfes in such wyse that his iustice abrydge not these Halcyons and quiet dayes (which hetherto since the begynning of your happie Reigne haue most calmely and peaceably continued) but that we may long enioy your gracious presence, and most prosperous Reigne ouer vs: which we beseche God, for our Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christes sake moste mercifullye to graunt vs, Amen.</p>
