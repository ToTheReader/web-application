      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, so censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is this our age, as that nothing almost can passe without a nip. This I haue considered, and yet am thus bold (thou seest) to aduenture my selfe, as now I doe. I take it to be a want of Christian courage to refuse to attempt matters of publike good vpon a meere feare of being misiudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for what thing so wisely done but some will taxe? Is it not the follie of most to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure things done by a false and crooked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>wand? what through ignorance, curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, enuie, and sinister affection, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon misleading guides of mans iudgement, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> comes to passe that few things well done are well iudged, good oft times goeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of euill, and folly gets away wisdomes praise. Wherefore setting at nought the vaine censorious humour of these our times, I haue yeelded at length to the earnest entreaty, and importunate suite of some godly wise friends, for the setting out of these few Sermons, breaking through
<pb facs="12"/>such discouragements as were cast in my way, hoping to bee iustified in what I haue done at least by wisedomes children.</p>
   <p>The maine motiue that drew mee on to this businesse, was not (God is my record) any outward by respect to my priuate selfe, but partly a desire to continue the memory of a blessed man, but most of all the hope of winning some glory to God in his churches good, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> I professe my selfe to reioyce, as in a thing most deere and precious vnto me, and therefore if I see that in thus doing I any whit aduance it, I haue this my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and also encouragement to future im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in this kinde, and in the meane while shall blesse my God, that hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to put my weake hand to these begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>
   <p>Now for the matter set forth in this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle volume, it needs not my word of com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendation, reade and thou shalt perceiue it speaking sufficiently for it self. The points of doctrine which heere thou shalt meete with, are very needefull for thee both to know and practise, I wish thee a gainer in each respect, so shalt thou bee an happie man,</p>
   <p>Some things there bee (I acknowledge) especially in the Sermon of Predestination (as <hi>Peter</hi> saith of a few things in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles) hard to be vnderstood;
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Pet.</hi> 23.16.</note> whereat when thou readest take heede thou doest not stumble and fall: take not occasion to fall out with the doctrine of Gods decree, as many haue done, and split the ships of their poore soules vpon that rocke which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> others.</p>
   <p>If ought then thou meetest with of an
<pb facs="12"/>higher straine then thy shallow reach can attaine vnto, wrangle not, strike not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, for he intended thy good, blame not the matter, for that is Gods, nor manner of conueiance, for that is most perspicuous for so deepe a mysterie: but if thou canst not wade on with the Authour, stand still and admire Gods wisedome as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, saying,
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33.</note>
      <hi>O depth!</hi> or smite thy selfe, and blame that blind head of thine as being vnfit to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with such high and heauenly stuffe, and to conceiue such diuine truthes as thou art bound to know.</p>
   <p>Now furthermore, whereas (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that arch enemie of Gods truth, Satan, hath offered much wrong to this doctrine of Gods decree, in those manifold cauils which he hath hatched and broached from time to time by men of sinne. Vouchsafe I pray you the patient perusing of these few lines ensuing; wherein I haue a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured to answere the absurd sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call obiections which oft times wee heare breathed forth by black mouthed Atheists, for euen such kinde of fooles (I hold) should sometimes be answered, lest other happily should bee entangled and perish in their follie.
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Prou.</hi> 26.5.</note>
   </p>
   <p>First, for that most vsual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> common forme of reasoning. se. If I bee predestinate to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, I am sure to be saued let me do what I will; If I bee appointed to damnation, I am sure to bee damned though I liue neuer so godly; for Gods decree changeth not, and therefore I will liue as I list.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> Howbeit most desperate and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phane wretches (for such they bee for the most part) doe take occasion from Gods
<pb facs="13"/>decree to reason in this sort, yet wee must know that the occasion is taken before it be giuen, for the doctrine of the vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble decree of God affords no such conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as beere is inferred. I am appointed to life or death vnchangeably, this is Gods truth: therefore it matters not how I liue. This is the diuels conclusion, not inferred by force of good reason (for in a Syllogisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call forme of reasoning I am sure no such conclusion can be drawne) but framed and forged by the diuels art, and entertained for the most part in the braines of most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and diuellish men. But see we the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie of this consequence, I am necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordained to life or death: therefore I may liue as I list. This is a reasoning from the putting too of the surpeme cause to a remouing of the instrumental, which are not opposite but subordinate one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<note place="margin">Arist. <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> as Logicians doe speake.</p>
   <p>Againe, this kinde of reasoning, sc. I am appointed to eternall life, therefore I may liue as I list, vsing no meanes to attaine it, is as if a man should reason thus, sc. God hath ordained me to liue many yeeres, therefore what need I eate, or drinke, or sleepe, or vse any meanes, the reason is the same.</p>
   <p>This one point must needs bee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that in Gods decree, the end, and the meanes tending to that end must goe hand in hand, in so much as, looke what God hath appointed to come to passe by meanes, those meanes hee hath as necessarily ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be vsed, as the end to bee archieued: yea, so inseparably are the meanes and the euent knit together, as that if wee may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a demad of the meanes, a deniall of
<pb facs="13"/>the euent will necessarily be inferred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
   <p>As for example. Act. 27. the Apostle saith, vers. 24. that God had giuen him the liues of all those that were in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ship; there was Gods decree: yet in the 31. vers. the Apostle saith, that vnlesse the ship-men did stay in the ship, they could not bee safe; heere is a deniall of the decreed meanes, inferring a deniall of the decreed euent. So then, I am ordained to eternall life; there is Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: if I should not repent not beleeue, (which is impossible, God hauing decreed them likewise) surely I should not be saued. The immutability therefore of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>creee, doth no whit fauour the neglect of meanes tending to eternall life. Wherefore as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> after hee knew Gods decree for fifteene yeeres to bee added to his daies, neglected not all meanes of life (for if hee had, he should haue died) but applied phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke to his wound, are, dranke, and vsed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes of life; so hee that is ordained to eternall life, if hee would obtaine, must vse the meanes, in repentance, faith, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, or else hee cannot looke to bee saued.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Quest.</hi> Yea but now suppose a man bee appointed to damnation, may not that man so appointed resolue with himselfe to liue as he lift?</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> Though this be granted to bee a true position, sc. that a man appointed of God to wrath shall surely bee damned, yet no such conclusion as this will ensue, sc that that man may resolue to liue as hee list. For first, there is no man liuing so acquainted with Gods decree (vnlesse hee hath sinned
<pb facs="14"/>against the holy Ghost) as to know his own reiection: for how be it I finding by a liuely sense a feeling of the spirit of sanctification, my selfe in the estate of sauing grace, may hereupon assure my selfe that I am elected, yet I may not, finding my selfe <hi>è contra,</hi> to bee in the estate of vnregeneracie, thereup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on conclude that I am a reprobate; for euen the elect are in the estate of sinne before they be called. Againe, the Lord doth not seale vp to men their reprobation, as hee doth their election. What mad and hideous follie thē is this for a man to resolue to liue as a reprobate, before hee knowes whether he be so or no? As if a man should condemne himselfe, &amp; run post hast to the place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and put the rope about his owne necke, or vse all meanes to make away him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, before hee know whether the sentence of life or death bee past vpon in the Iudges breast. One dramme of good reason, much more of grace, would teach a man rather to argue thus: I know not whether the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of wrath be past in heauen against me or no; I will therefore resolue to employ my selfe in all well doing, repenting of sin, beleeuing in Christ, and yeelding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods Commandements, which is the only way to eternall life: by this meanes I shall make mine owne election sure to my selfe, and so at length come to eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse. Thus wee vse to reason in the like case. I know not whether it bee my lot to liue till the next yeere or no, I will eate, drinke, sleepe, and vse other meanes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God as the way to life, that so I may liue if it be possible. Suppose we thus, that a Iudge giue out to a companie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors
<pb facs="14"/>before him in this sort. I haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly with my selfe past a decree vpon you all, and that vnchangeably, wherein some of you are appointed to life, some to death; now they that bee mon of life shall surely come to me, and kneele downe before me, and sue for pardon, the men of death shall not doe so; and this is the marke of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: now looke to your selues. In this case shall not that man bewray his follie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all the rest, that shall resolue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with himselfe neuer to come &amp; kneele before the Iudge, because the decree is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablie past vpon him, either for life or death, which he knoweth not? should bee not rather in all reason runne to the Iudge, and kneele before him, and sue for pardon, that so he might assure himselfe that hee is a man of life? Yes surely, euen thus it fareth in the case in hand; for God in his most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> councell hath made a decree <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> all men: wherein some are appointed to life, some to death vnchangeably: God hath further said in his word, that the men ordained to life shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue which is the marke of their election, but the men of death shall not doe so: are not they then most seely and senselesse fooles that shall vpon hearesay of an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table decree past, whether for, or against them they know not, resolue with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, neuer to turne to God, and beleeue, whereby as by most certaine signes they might proue to themselues their owne ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? Nay is not this a wilfull secluding of a mans selfe from the fauour of God, and a voluntarie branding of a mans selfe with the blacke marke of a reprobate before it
<pb facs="15"/>be knowne whether God hath done so or no? Yes surely, for as the sonnes of <hi>Eli</hi> did bewray their owne reiection by their obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate rebellion, for the text saith they did not hearken to the voyce of God,
<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2.25.</note> because the Lord would slay them (where their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate course in sin is made a secret marke of their reprobation) euen so that man that resolues with himselfe to neglect God, and to runne on in sinne, vpon this that God hath writ his destinie in heauen, doth as much as possibly he can seale vp to himselfe his owne reprobation; and if hee thus both liue and dye, must needs be damned.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Obiect.</hi> What then? If I going on in sin bee damned, is not herein the vnresistable will and pleasure of God, which needs must stand, brought to passe?</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea it is, and that most iustly, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through thine owne default, for thy sinne brings by damnation as the due deserued wages thereof: so iust is God as that he will inflict damnation vpon none that be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and free from sinne; God neuer did, neither will damne any man but for sinne. And therefore, lay thine hand vpon thy mouth, and blame thy selfe for thine owne ruine;
<note place="margin">Hosea. 13.</note> thy destruction is of thy selfe O Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Hos. 13.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Obiect.</hi> Yea, but had not God ordained me before to this end, I should neuer by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning brought damnation on my selfe.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou most saucie and molipert man, how darest thou take the dirt and mire of thine owne sinne, and cast it thus vpon the face of the most holy God? Thou sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and by thy sinne bringest vpon thy self most iust damnation, and must God be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="15"/>for appointing thee to that thy deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued end? must this thy base and misbegot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ofspring of sin bee fathered vpon Gods most righteous decrees?</p>
   <p>The conclusion then is this: A reprobate sinneth, for his sin hee perisheth, according to the necessarie and vnchangeble decree of God; yet man sinneth of himself willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is therefore condemned of God most iustly, and Gods most wise and iust decree no wit to be blamed.</p>
   <p>I doubt not (good Reader) but that the reason of man is able to obiect yet much more, (for I see how our proud and thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nature is impatient of satisfaction in this point) but know, that as more might be obiected, so more might bee answered, and withal remember that mans reason (through the fall) is a corrupt thing, and hereupon will grow sometimes very wilde and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and therefore she should now and then receiue a checke for passing so beyond her bounds. I wish thee therfore when thou ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guest in these and such like diuine points, to cast as it were a bridle vpon thy reason, and keepe her in from passing the lists and limits of sobrietie.</p>
   <p>And because I finde by experience how restlesse and lasciuious a thing mans reason is, especially in this point of Gods decree, as also now armed and furnished with the di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uelish art of wrangling. I thinke meete ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here to stint my speech, then to admit of any further discourse. As for such as will not admit of that reasonable satisfaction, which I hope I haue giuen, but will aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture through the pride of their wits to chop Logick with their Maker, and to call him to
<pb facs="16"/>his reasons, who is bound to render his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to none,
<note n="*" place="margin">God is <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> I pray God to make them more sober-minded, and doe wish them to consider with all humilitie that saying of the Apostle, Rom. 9.19. <hi>O man who art thou that disputest with God? shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? hath not the potter power ouer the clay of the same lumpe to make one vessell vnto honour, and another vnto dishonour?</hi> This place well pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the spirit of humilitie, would suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently serue to stop our mouthes that wee should not haue one word to speake, and to set our haughtie reason at a <hi>non plus,</hi> so as it should not haue a thought to thinke against that disposall which God hath made of the soules of men in his decree, seeing hee is an absolute and a soueraigne Lord of the spirits of all flesh, and therfore may deale with men according to his will, imparting or withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his mercie euen as he pleaseth, and that without check or controle from any: for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, what are wee but the creatures of God, the meere workmanship of his hands? farre more in his power then the clay in the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for the clay is Gods creature, not the potters, and will haue a being in spight of the potter: whereas wee are continually in Gods power and at his meere curtesie for our very being.</p>
   <p>Thus gentle Reader, for the preuention of scandall, I thought meete to endeuour the remouall of such stumbling blockes, as the doctrine of Gods decree, or this treatise in particular through Satans malice, might seeme to cast in thy way; If I haue giuen thee satisfaction (which is hard to doe in such knottie doubts) I haue my wish; if not,
<pb facs="16"/>yet let our poore endeuour bee taken in good worth. I haue been (I acknowledge) ouer longsome and tedious, passing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the limits of an Epistle: but the weight of the matter, and difficultie of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which can hardly bee handled both briefly and plainly, will be, I hope, my suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient apologie with men of vnderstanding, and therefore I spare to craue pardon herein.</p>
   <p>As for those other Sermons about the vnchangeable estate of Gods childe, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,</hi> and <hi>the feare of God,</hi> I aduise thee to cast thine eye most what on them, as being more easie to conceiue, &amp;, as I take it, more fit for thine vse, and most behooffull for thy learning: yet lest I should seeme too busie in giuing aduice I leaue thee to thine owne discretion. Thou knowest how the Bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her choice in a garden of flowers, there tarieth longest where shee findeth most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; so thou in reading this booke make thy choice, and there stay most where thou sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest that which is most sit for thine vse.</p>
   <p>Thus (curteous Reader) as one mindfull and desirous of thy good, I haue been bold, according to my poore skill, to counsel thee for the best: I intend, God knoweth, thy soules welfare in Christ Iesus, and would much reioyce in a blessed inlargement of his grace in thine heart: yea surely, if any thing in this booke shall further the same, thrice happie shall I iudge my selfe to be in hauing an hand to procure thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
   <p>And now I leaue thee to the further view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what I haue here laid before thine eye, be not (I pray thee) left handed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
<pb facs="17"/>what I giue thee with the right. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use what here thou findest to thy best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage: If ought thou gainest, giue God the glorie, and me thy good word for my good will.</p>
   <p>That God that wet the fleece of <hi>Ged<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="3 letters">
