      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of the sons of men (Right Worshipfull Patronesse) that all riuers goe into the <note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 7</note> Sea. Some think they doe it to doe their homage,
<pb facs="3"/> and pay tribute to that place, from whence they receiued their beginning. So hath it been my long nine yeeres longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, euer since I haue had a doore opened (by your friendly meanes) to enioy and imploy my poore Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall talent, in testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of my grateful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of your vndeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, though by me of you then desired fauours in those daies of my trials (al which trials the trier of hearts knowes came not on me for any singularity,
<pb facs="3"/> but of meere simplicitie and sinceritie of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science) that there might passe backe frō me to you some small slender drops of those fuller streames of your then more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie beneuolence and beneficence, &amp; euer since most gratious coūtenance towards me. So that I may say to you as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> did to a friend of his, <hi>tibi quod possum debeo &amp; quod non possum.</hi> I am indebted to you in the highest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of my abilitie, and in a higher straine then I am
<pb facs="4"/> able to reach vnto. In ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement whereof (seeing other hoped-for meanes faile me) I be seech you to accept of these three Sermous, treating of the properties of a sincere Preacher, being the first diuulged fruits of mine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue twenty yeeres labors in the Ministerie. Which I present not vnto you with the best thought of requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of your fauours, but as a bill of mine hand what I owe, and how deeply I am ingaged. All which if vpō perusall you finde (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
<pb facs="4"/> they are) but rude and rough hewed, yet I hope the worth of their subiect (compared with the rockinesse and barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the soile and seate where they were bred) will winne some fauour from your friendly &amp; fauour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aspect. Howsoeuer it be, this wil breed me some contentmēt, that by these I haue indeuoured what in me lieth, to make knowne mine vnfayned sensible thankfulnes, for your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiue and vnrequitable kindnesses. And whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="5"/> is wāting in me, I pray the God of all fulnesse to fulfill in you, making you the plant of his owne right hand, being planted in the house of the Lord to <note place="margin">Psal. 92. 14.</note> bring forth more fruite in your age, and to be fat and florishing. And whē death shall approch to shut vp the full period of your age-worne daies, for your fauours shewed to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, well may you bee able then to consolate your decaied spirits, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with good <hi>Nehemiah: Remember me O my God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
