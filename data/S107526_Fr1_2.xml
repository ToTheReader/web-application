   <head>THE PVBLISHER TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>ABout Three Yeeres since, Maister Iacob hauing some speach with certen of the separation before mentioned, concerning their peremptory &amp; vtter separation frō the Churches of England, was requested by them, briefly to sétt down in wryting, his Reason for defence of the said Churches, And they would either yeild vnto his proofes, or procure an answer vnto the same. Wherevpon, the Argument following this Preface, was set downe in wryting by Maister Iacob: which the said parties did send to Maister Fr. Iohnson, being then prisoner in the Clinke in Southwark, who made an answer vnto the same, conteyning 3. Exceptions and 9. Reasons in denyall of the Assumption: Wherevnto Maister Iacob Replyed. Afterward Maister Iohnson defended his said Exceptions and Reasons: And finally, Maister Iacob Replyed againe. As by the particulars themselues appeareth.</p>
   <p>Now hauing weighed and considered with my selfe, the great ignorance and errors, wherewith those of the separation aforesaid, are and haue bene lately carried awaye: namely, to affirme, <hi>That all that stande members of the Churches of Englande, are no true Christians, nor in state of saluation,</hi> And such like most vngodly sentences, which would grieue any Christian soule once to thinke on, much more to publish to the view of the world: And weighing likewise withall, the greate weakenes of manie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians among vs, who (through want of experience, or due consideration of things as they are) may ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by their delusions be drawne away into those errors with them: I haue therefore: (Aswell in hope of reclaiming of the said parties from their said extremities, (which now I iudge the most of them, for want of meanes see not:) As also for the staying of others from running into the same grieuous excesse with them) now published this discourse to the view of the world, which hath line buryed in the hands of some few. Many being desirous of it, who by reason of the largnes in wryting out of the same could not obteyne it: Wherevnto I am so much the rather induced, For that the Reasons herein by Maister Iacob alleadged, haue (by Gods blessing) reclaymed many from their former errors, and satisfied others, who haue bene doubtfull, and subiect to fall into the same.</p>
   <p>In the examining of which Discourse, I shall desire the Reader to obserue a few notes for his better proffiting in the same.</p>
   <p n="1">1. And First, (among the rest) to note this, as a token of the strange and obstinate dealing of Maister Iohnson and others of them, viz. That heretofore, (vntill such time as the Argument hereafter mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was framed aganst them,) they neuer denyed, That the doctrine and profession of the Churches of England, was sufficient to make those that beleeued and obeyed them, to be true Christians, and in state of saluation: But alwayes held, professed and acknowledged the contrarie: As by the publike confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of themselues, namely Maister Barrow, Maister Penry, and Maister Iohnson himselfe, in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course mentioned in Pag. 81. appeareth: But nowe, they seing; That if they should acknowledge the said Doctrines and profession, to be sufficient to saluation: That then this conclusion would of necessitie follow, <hi>that those that hold and practize thē, are a true</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">Which yet Maister Penry confessed, see Pag. 82.</note>
      <hi>Church,</hi> And so their own former iudgements should be crossed. Rather I say then they would be drawne to that, They nowe stick not to deny their owne confessions (which they thinke to be the saifest way for them,) and like vnnaturall children, so vehemently hate, contemne, and dispise their mother who bare them, nourished, and brought them vp: from whose brests they sucked that sweete milke of the meanes of euerlasting life and saluation, (if euer they had any tast of it at all.) Beeing notwithstanding, not abashed nowe in a desperate manner, in the hardnes of their heart, to affirne:<note n="*" place="margin">Which appea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth, generally by denying the Assumption of Ma. Iacobs, &amp; particularly in these pages 13. 62. 63. 64.</note>
      <hi>That none by the doctrine of the Churches of England, can be a true Christian, or saued: But that they all worship God in vaine, Are abolished from Christ, Are Babiloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Idolaters, departers from the faith, worse then Infidels;</hi> And such like most vnchristian sentences, making them all one with the Church of Rome, &amp;c. Which impious affirmations, would cause any Christian heart to lament and bleed for grief; Whose vnchristian sentences, and false and deceiptfull Reasons, (the very naming whereof were sufficient to refute them,) are most plainly taken awaye, and cleane ouerthrowne, by these brief Replies of Maister Iacob vnto euery of them, vnto which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre yow. Onely this I adde with all, which I would desire might be noted: That if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new in their former confessions, That the doctrines and profession of the Churches of England are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to saluation; (As they ought, it being the very truth) Then are they all in a most grieuous schisme, in so peremptorily condempning, and separating, from such true Christians and Churches. And if they deny it: (as they haue begonne to doe:) Then doe they runne headlong, into an intollerable sinne and extremitie, without all warrant of Gods word: And besides giue iust occasion to be called fearfull<note n="*" place="margin">Which name they vniustly giue to those, that iustly for this their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity forsake their fellowship</note> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, in so wholy falling (and that aduisedly, for aduantage sake, as it seemeth plainely to appeare) from so notable a truth which before they imbraced, and acknowledged.</p>
   <pb n="4" facs="3"/>
   <p n="2">2 Secondly, I would desier the Reader not to be carried away with the multitude of corruptions, from the Question or matter in hand, (viz. Whether the good doctrines of the Churches of England are sufficient to saluation in them that in simplicitie of heart beleeue and imbrace them, notwithstanding the multitude of errors and corruptions which Maister Iohnson repeateth to the contrarie:) But to haue an especiall regard vnto the same. Which is the maine poinct that hath and doeth altogeather deceiue them, viz. To haue an eye to the corruptions in the Ministerie, worship, and gouernement of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of England: But neuer to looke vnto the nature and force of them, whether <hi>simply</hi> of their owne nature, they ouerthrow faith and Christianitie, or whether they be held of obstinacy and a conuicted conscience, or not. Therefore I pray you marke and examine the errors which they reckon vp, (and I desire the same also of them, for whose good especially I published this Treatise.) And after due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, see if those errors are simplie of that nature which before we haue noted. If they be not, (as Maister Iohnson nor all the men in the world, shall euer be able to proue they are:) Then doe they gett no aduantage by those errors, to this purpose which they vrge them for, although they were Thrice as many<note n="*" place="margin">Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are too many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</note> more as they are. Thus they may see how they haue all this while ben deceiued, and are now to seeke a new for defence of their separation. For I hope they will not say, That euery error, held in sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie by Christians, doth cut them off from saluation in Christ; Then should they condempne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, vnlesse they hold Anabaptisticall perfection, which surely though I thinke they hold it not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in their consciences; Yet in their practize (by condempning others so peremtorily; that iump not euen with them in euery poinct) they come very neare it: But let this passe; wee see then, That of necessitie, the nature of the errors must be regarded, Euery sinne is not a like. Me thinkes then, that they should affoard that fauour to others, which they would haue others to offoard vnto them: namely, That as they would be accompted true Christians, through their faith in Christ, notwithstanding their errours (which they must acknowledge<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 19.12 1. Cor. 13.9.12</note> are infinite manie in this life.) So they should accompt of others in the like case: which euen common sence and humanitie would require them to graunt.</p>
   <p>To impresse this thing a little better in their mindes, I will a little turne my speech vnto them. And I would pray them, to call to minde the manie errors and corruptions which they beare with amonge themselues, and lay them and the errors with vs togeather, and they shall see their equalitie.</p>
   <p>Some of you, hold it vtterly and simply vnlawfull, to sweare by a booke, to proue a will, take an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration or sue in the Ecclesiasticall Courts: To shut vp your shops vpon Holly dayes and Festiuall dayes, &amp;c. And that these are the inuentions of Antichrist, &amp;c. And others of you, hold these thinges altogeather lawfull, and haue and doe put them in practise, with manie other such like thinges which I could name. But these shall suffice.</p>
   <p>Now the thing which I would from hence note is this. Can you among your selues beare with such weighty poinctes as these, which you say are the inuentions &amp; traditions of Antichrist that man of sinne, which (in your accompt) are the<note n="†" place="margin">I would you knew the marks of the Beast a little better.</note> marks of the Beast,<note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Reu.</hi> 14.</note> which who soeuer receiueth, shall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, and shalbe tormented in Hell fier for euer? And will not your stumackes serue you, to beare with the Churches of England, in the like, or rather in farr lesser matters? What equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is there in this? Surely you are (for the most parte) so wholly giuen, and bend your wits and mindes so much, to looke into the estate of other men &amp; other Churches, &amp; to apply the scriptures to thē: As you sildome or neuer look into your own estate, or apply the scripturs to your selues: But looke vnto it, it will be your decay in th'end. You may see thē by your own practize all errors are not alike: But yet, will some say,<label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
      </label>
      <hi>are not all the scriptures and commaundements of God fundamentall, and to be obeyed alike? &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answer. </seg>
      </label> Let such consider of this scripture 1. Cor. 3.12.15. amongst many other: which plainly proueth, that many errors (so they be not of obstinacie) may be built by a Christian vpon the <hi>fundation</hi> Christ Iesus, and yet be a true Christian still: For which see further Maister Iacobs answer in Pag. 88. Againe there are errors <hi>simply fundamentall,</hi> which of their owne nature cleane abolish from Christ; such are the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the <hi>Arians</hi> concerning the Deitie of Christ: of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> concerning his humanitie: of the <hi>Papists</hi> concerning Iustification by workes, praying to, and trusting in Saincts, and such like, which directly raze the very foūdation. But that any one, or all, of the errors in the Churches of England are of this force (as you would seeme to hold by all your 9. Reasons) is most impious and vngodly to affirme: And as Maister Iacob very well noteth in his answer to euery one of them: You thereby ouerthrow the Martirs in Queene Maries dayes, from being Christians, who held the very same corruptions in their ministerie, worship, &amp;c. which is now held in England: But say you, <hi>the Martirs saw no further.</hi> Then you confesse against your selues, that our errors doe not simply abolish from Christ (as you euery where affirme most vngodly, especially in defence of your 7. Reason.) But that if men in these things see no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are in the same estate with the Martirs. Now if you would haue your Reasons hould, you must proue the Churches of England all conuicted in cōscience, which I hope you will not goe about to doe.</p>
   <p>Thus much concerning the nature of our errors, whether they be of obstinacie, or against the fundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on directly: Which is the Second note I desire to be obserued.</p>
   <p n="3">3 Thirdly, I would desire the Reader to obserue, the wresting and misaplying of certen places of
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>scripture, which (partly in this Treatise, and also in other their wrytings) they alleadge for their absolute and peremptory separation from the Churches of England: which I haue thought not a misse here to sett downe, that thereby the Reader (and them selues, vpon better consideration of the ende and scope of the holy Ghost in these places) may see, how they wrest and misapply them, cleane contrary from the true and naturall sence thereof.</p>
   <p>The scriptures which they alleadge for their separation, are these.</p>
   <q>Then the sonnes of God saw the daughters of men. <bibl>Gen. 6.2.</bibl>
   </q>
   <q>Yee shall keepe therefore all mine ordinances and all my iudgments and doe them, that the land whether I bring you to dwell therein spew you not out, therefore shall ye bee holy vnto mee, for I the Lord am holy, and I haue <hi>separated</hi> you from other people, that you should be mine. <bibl>Leu. 20.22.26.</bibl>
   </q>
   <q>So the children of Israell which were come againe out of captiuitie, and all such as had <hi>separated</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto them from the filthines of the Heathen of the land, to seeke the Lord God of Israell, did eate, &amp;c. <bibl>Ezra. 6.21.</bibl>
   </q>
   <q>
      <hi>Departe, departe</hi> yee, goe out from thence, and touch no vncleane thinge, goe out of the middest of her, be ye cleane that beare the vessels of the Lord <bibl>Esa. 52.11.</bibl>
   </q>
   <q>
      <hi>Fly</hi> from the middest of Babell, and <hi>departe</hi> out of the land of the Caldeans. <bibl>Ier. 50.8.</bibl> And <hi> Fly</hi> out of the middest of Babell and deliuer euery man his soule from the fierce wrath of the Lorde. <bibl>Ier. 51.6.45</bibl>
   </q>
   <q>
      <hi>Come</hi> not yee to Gilgall, neither <hi>goe</hi> ye vp to Bethauen. <bibl>Hos. 4.15.</bibl>
   </q>
   <q>Come to Bethell and transgresse, and to Gilgall and multiply transgression, &amp;c. Seeke not Bethellner enter into Gilgall, and goe not to Beersheba. <bibl>Amos. 4.4.5.</bibl>
   </q>
   <q>Saue your selues from this froward generation. <bibl>Act. 2.40.</bibl>
   </q>
   <q>And when certen were hardned and disobeyed speaking euell of the way of god before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the discipels, &amp;c. <bibl>Act. 19.9.</bibl>
   </q>
   <q>Therefore come out from among them, and <hi>separate</hi> your selues saith the the Lorde, and touch no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane thing, and I will receiue you. <bibl>2. Cor. 6.17.</bibl>
   </q>
   <q>And I heard another voice from heauen, saying, <hi>goe out</hi> of her my people, &amp;c. <bibl>Reu. 18.4.</bibl>
   </q>
   <p>These are the very mayne grounds, on which their separation is builded, which being duly weighed with the scope of the text, you shall very easely finde, that not one amongest them all, will hold in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with this time, nor beare the separation they gather frō them. First because either they concerne such times and states as the people that liued in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>; were professors of, or subiect vnto, open grosse Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie, &amp; either Heathen or Antichristiā Idolatry, not in some particuler customes &amp; outward ordināces, but in the whole body and power of Heathen &amp; Antichristian religion, such as could not possibly stand with true faith and religion at all: Which can not be said of these times &amp; present standings, without open vntruth. 2 Or els because if they be not of that sort, they affoard no such absolute separation at all, but only frō <hi>wilful, rebellious,</hi> &amp; <hi>obstinate</hi> disobeyers, &amp; euill speakers, and from apparant grosse corruptions, but not from the whole publike body of those Assemblies, nor from the lawfull and good things vsed in such times and standings, as haue not wholy swarued from the faith, though there were diuers grieuous faults, both in doctrine and practize, suffered among them. As by the example of the Iewish Churches in the times of the Prophets, especially of Christ him selfe, may plainly appeare. The Euangelistes make mention in diuers places, <hi>That they worshipped God in vaine, teaching for doctrine mens preceptes. They made their proselites the Children of Hell Two fold more then they were before. They made the commaundements of God of none effect by their traditions. Such as beleeued in Christ they excommunicated, &amp;c.</hi> Yet were they a true Church, notwithstanding these, and many other grieuous enormities: with whom Christ himself and his Apostles, had communion and fellowship, sometime in those good things that were among them. And so might they with the Churches of England, without iustifying or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these things, which they see to be euill. All which things doe more fully appeare in the conference it selfe, as it followeth hereafter.</p>
   <p>But vnto the examples of these Churches, me thinkes I heare already that common answer and last refuge of theirs: which is this. <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection▪ </seg>
      </label>
      <hi>Those Churches</hi> (say they) <hi>were in a true outward constitution, And therfore were the true Churches of Christ, notwithstanding those grosse errors which they held in other poincts of doctrine and practize: But contrariwise</hi> (say they) <hi>the Churches of England haue a false outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and therefore they are no true Churches of Christ, notwithstanding their truthes of doctrine, &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answer. </seg>
      </label> So the outward constitution is the maine poinct on which they wholy depend, and for which, they wholy condempne the Churches of England from being true Christians &amp; in state of saluation: Which I doubt not plainly to take away. 1 And first concerning the constitution of the Iewish Churches. If we should examine the same, we should finde that it was as greatly altered and corrupted, as is the constitution of the Churches of England. Two high Priests hauing by simony crept in at once, which was vnlawfull, and contrarie to Gods ordinance, (notwithstanding their gloses in their other<note n="“" place="margin">9 Reasons.</note> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, to allow them to be lawfull by<note n="*" place="margin">2. Chron. 24.2.3.</note>
      <hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Ahimelech,</hi> and by<note n="“" place="margin">2. King 25.18.</note>
      <hi>Seruiah</hi> the chief Prieste, &amp; <hi>Zephaniah</hi> the Second: which make against themselues:) For there was neuer but one high Priest, as
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>they confesse<note n="*" place="margin">Answere to Maister Hild. Pag. 50.</note> (Ergo not two as here were) the rest were indeed inferior to him: And yet amongst those, there was a chiefty also, who were called, sometimes Second Priestes, or Priestes of the Second order▪ 2. King. 23.4. and sometimes chief Priests, Mat. 27.1. These scriptures being compared with those in the margin by them cited, doe make it more plaine. Now, if the chief offices, were so corrupted and altered through couetousnes, as the Histories make mention: It is not likely, that the inferior offices did remaine sound, but were asmuch or more altered: The Priests (generally) being such couetous wicked persons, their offices beeing very gainefull: and besides they liuing vnder the authoritie of the Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Romans, who ruled ouer them. All these things considered, it is very likely that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> offices &amp; outward constitution (on which they so much depend) were wholy altered from the right institution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would make nothing for thē. As for their allegation of Mat. 23.1. Where they say, Christ testifieth that they had true offices, by saying they satt in Moses chaire: It will not help them, any whit at all. For Moses was no Priest, as they were, but a Magistrate: and therefore Moses chaire must be vnderstood of some what else: &amp; themselues<note n="*" place="margin">Maist. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Mai. Greenwood, in diuers Letters and Treatises.</note> haue vnderstood it heretofore, of Moses doctrine. 2. Secondly (to let their constitution passe, which yet as I haue said, would be found as badde or worse then ours) wee will examine their corruptions in doctrine: Wherein I would know of thē, which are the greater sinnes, of these two sorts, viz.
<list>
         <item>1. A false and corrupt outward constitution:</item>
         <item>2. Or false and corrupt doctrines.</item>
      </list>
I thinke they will say, the corrupt and false doctrines are the greater, as they are indeed: For that they, doe wound, fester and corrupt the very conscience, and doe deceiue the hearers thereof, Whereas the errors in the constitution of a Church, (especially in some circumstances (as the errors with vs are) and those of no small controuersie, in matters also not fundamentall) are nothing nere so hurtfull: by howe much the Tithing of Mint, Annis, and Commin, are of lesser force then the other weightier matters of the law. Now from hence, I Reason thus.</p>
   <p>If the greater sinnes (namely in doctrine) doe not simply ouerthrow a companie of Christians, from being a true Church: Then much lesse will the lesser sinnes (namely in the outward constitution, &amp;c.)</p>
   <p>But the false doctrines (which are the greater sinnes) themselues confesse by the example of the said, Churches doe not. Therefore neither will the lesser.</p>
   <p>For the better explayning of this poinct, I would pray them resolue me of this question. What if a company of <hi>Arians, Anabaptistes.</hi> or <hi>Papistes,</hi> shoud bee gathered and established in a true outward constitution, and still reteyne their fundamentall errors before<note n="“" place="margin">pag. 4.</note> named: Whether should their outward constitution make them a true Church, yea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">

      </gap> no? I thinke they will say no. Thus I hope then it appeareth, That the outward constitution whether falty or true, availeth nothing to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing or making of a true Church, vnlesse other doctrines of the foundation, either false or true, doe concurre therewith. And thus their Obiection of the Iewish constitution, is (I trust) fully answered: So that still their peremptory separation and condempning of the Churches of England, for some outward corruptions, temayneth still a grieuous sinne vpon their heades: for which (without harty repentance) they shall one day answer before God, which will be too heauie a burthen for them to beare.</p>
   <p>Lastly, concerning our corruptions: As we cannot iustifie them to be no corruptions, (but must needes acknowledge, that there are many yet remaining in our land, which were left by that man of sinne &amp; are as thornes vnto our sides,<note place="margin">Iudg. 2.3.</note> which we hope God will in time abolish): So dare we not runne into your extremities, to condempne our Churches for such corruptions, but waight the appoincted time of God for the redresse thereof. Yet in the meane time, so longe as those most excellent truthes and doctrines of saluation, (for which God make vs thankfull) are still reteyned and held, as soundly as by any Church vpon the face of the earth (the other errors not simply ouerthrowing the same, beeing not held of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy, and being also for the most parte, of great controuersie and disputation amonge the learned:) So long I say, communion in things lawfull, is to be kept with them, as before is noted in the example of other Churches: Otherwise, it will come to passe, (by reason of the<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 25.13. to 23.</note> diuersitie in opinions and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes which by the corruption of our nature we remaine in, in this tabernacle, as hath<note n="“" place="margin">Leu. 4. Psal. 19.12.</note> bene in all ages, and<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.9, 12.</note> shalbe, so long as this life of imperfection indureth,) that no communion can euer bee had with any Church liuing, no nor any one Christian with another: Which to affirme, were most absurd and vngodly.</p>
   <p>These obseruations beeing considered, I doubt not but the Lorde will adde a blessing to this worke, That such as are simple hearted, and haue exceeded in eagernesse of zeale: may see their extremitie, in so rashly and vnaduisedly separating from, and condempning the Churches of England, sometimes their Nurses and Mothers, as before is noted: Whereby God may haue the glory, and themselues the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, euen the saluation of their soules through Christ.</p>
