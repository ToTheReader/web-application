   <head>TO THE
HONORABLE
AND RIGHT
vertuous Gentlewomā,
M<seg rend="sup">rs</seg>. Anne Vaux.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ONORABLE,
AND RIGHT
VVORTHY,
The constant
report of your vertuous
<pb facs="3"/>
life, in the State where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this little Booke entre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth,
hath inuited me to
entitle the same vnto
your Name in particuler,
which was written for
the profit of all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
who haue a true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to imbrace the State
of vowed Chastity, and
yet remaine in the world
among secular persons.</p>
   <p>If the subiect seeme
new, or strange to any,
I doubt not, but hauing
<pb facs="3"/>
attentiuely read, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
the seuerall passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
therein, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
abundantly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed.
For it was no part
of the Authors intention
(who is knowne to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
both for learning
and piety) thereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
frō other Stats of
life; but rather, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the good, &amp; commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
which may proceed
by imbracing of this;
those that be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb facs="4"/>
in themselues, might
heerby, be the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
and reuerenced
of all.</p>
   <p>Neither, indeed, is
there any thing at al pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in this ensewing
Discourse, which hath
not been practised in the
Primitiue Church, by
persons of both sexes; &amp;
for that cause so much
admired, and extolled by
the auncient Fathers of
those dayes: Howsoeuer
<pb facs="4"/>
the same may seeme not
to haue beene in some la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ages, so much in vse,
and therefore thought
now behoofefull to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
renewed to our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
in these tymes of
so great necessity, for the
spirituall good of soules,
and increase of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
now halfe extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in the Christian
world.</p>
   <p>The profit that may,
&amp; doth redound to such
<pb facs="5"/>
as desire to practise this
state of vowed Chastity,
remaining in the world,
will neither be small, or
vncertaine, if the same
be imbraced with that
sincerity of hart and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
manner of life as it
ought: wherein I know
your selfe to haue made
good proofe, these many
years, by reaping a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
haruest of the fruits,
and heaping vp a masse
of Treasure, against the
<pb facs="5"/>
comming of your heauē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spouse, to present him
withall, to the vnspea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keable
comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
of your soules e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Happynes.</p>
   <p>To this little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
I haue adioyned the
WIDDOVVES GLASSE,
the which I humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
you, to present, in
my Name, to your two
most worthy Sisters, who
for the long, constant, &amp;
most exemplar professiō
<pb facs="6"/>
of that noble, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
state of chast Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood,
may seeme to
clayme a iust Title ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
But I deemed not
my labour in translating
it, worthy to be presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to so honourable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
in a Dedicatory a
part: not doubting but
the same wilbe more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teful,
comming through
your handes, who are so
neere a kin vnto them,
both by Nature &amp; Grace;
<pb facs="6"/>
seeing Virginity, and
Widdowhood, haue euer
been accounted Sisters,
and betroathed to the
same Eternall Spouse
Christ Iesus.</p>
   <p>Accept then (Right
worthy Gentlewoman)
these few sheets of paper,
by me translated out of
Latin, as a future earnest
of som better gift, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I intend to present
you ere it be long. And
in the meane tyme, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb facs="7"/>
the many of your
pious and deuout exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
forget him not, who
will euer remaine</p>
