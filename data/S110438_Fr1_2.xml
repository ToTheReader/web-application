      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our late fauourable intertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(Right Honorable) vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to this my hard fauoured
Childe, is now my incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againe to present her to
you, clad in this new habite. She
hath cause to shroude her selfe vnder Honours
wing: for so rude is her habite, and so meane her
parentage; that were not such patronage a safe
refuge to her, when the malicious shall persecute
her: I feare she would be accounted a roague; and
for wandring abroad in so vnfauourable a time,
be scourged with the whip of disgrace, and lashed
<pb facs="3"/>
with the sharpe rod of euery Criticks censure.</p>
   <p>Those many fauours, which you honourably
extended to my father, whilst he liued, and still
continue to his name and children; claime a farre
greater testimony of gratefulnes, then the greatest
of my small indeuours can affoord: notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
accept a dutifull minde, witnessed in a rude
sort; and when <hi>Time</hi> shall with some of his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
better cloath my scarce-feathered <hi>Muse:</hi>
she will better testifie how highly she honours and
admires your worth. In meane time pardon her
present vnworthines, and once againe take in
good worth this mine vnworthy present: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
hauing reason to rest perswaded, I leaue further
to interrupt your serious affayres, and so humbly
take my leaue.</p>
