                 <title>A straunge and terrible wunder wrought very late in the the parish church of Bongay, a tovvn of no great distance from the citie of Norwich, namely the fourth of this August, in ye yeere of our Lord 1577 : in a great tempest of violent raine, lightning, and thunder, the like wherof hath been seldome seene. With the appeerance of an horrible shaped thing, sensibly perceiued of the the people then and there assembled. Drawen into a plain method according to the written copye. by Abraham Fleming</title>

   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong men it is growen in custome, to haue forwarnīgs of afterclaps, as beacons built vpon hilles, which then are set on fier when daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is imminent and at hand: Alarum belles seruing to the same purpose, and other inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men proceedīg &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uided of policie, to preuent or else to prepare agaynst that which is perilous. Euery man canne arme himself, when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard is at hand to saue him and his as hee is able: for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
<pb facs="3"/>
of temporall thinges, Iesus how painefull and vente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wee bee: and no sooner shall a premonishment bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but wee are furnished I warrant you to the proofe. God warneth vs by signes frō heauen, by fierie apparaunces in the aire moste terrible, by wonders wrought on earthe, straūge &amp; vnusiall, by exinun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of waters beyond their appointed limits, by the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uīg of senselesse trees from the naturall place where they were planted, by the great power which the Prince of darknesse through Gods permission and sufferaunce bath recouered, by
<pb facs="3"/>
many late moste misserable murthers not to be named, much lesse to be committed among Christians, by insurrections full of daunger and detestable treason on this side the seas, by tumults and vprores between Princes of forreigne nations, and what should I say more? by the trump of his sweet and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Gospell, sounded vnto vs out of the mouth of his messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. But wee will not be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, wee will tumble still vpon the bedde of wantonnesse, and drincke our selues drunck with the wine of sensualitie, that whiles wee lye wallowing in the sinck of our Sodomiticall sīne,
<pb facs="4"/>
wee may bee consumed with a Sodomiticall or a Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call destruction.</p>
   <p>God open the eyes of our har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, that wee may see in what VVildernesses, among what wilde Beastes and deuouring Serpents wee doo wander: and giue vs mindes mollified and made soft, that at his woorkes we may feare and bee astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
   <p>The occasion that I haue wrote this warning (which I would to God I had the grace to followe) was a wonder late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought in Norfolke, and so lately wrought, that the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the same is at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb facs="4"/>
freshe in memorie. A Spectacle no doubt of Gods iudgement, which as the fire of our iniquities hath kindled, so by none other meanes then by the teares of repentance it may bee quenched. The order of the thing as I receiued the sāe I haue committed to paper, for the present viewe and perusing of those that are disposed. It is grounded vppon trueth, and therfore not only worthie the writing and publishing, but also the hearing and considering.</p>
