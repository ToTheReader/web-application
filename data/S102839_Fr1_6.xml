   <head>A PREFACE.</head>
   <head type="sub">Nec adulatori,
Ne{que} detractori,</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O speake of the commendation of history is
not my meaning; nor of the necessity my
purpose: For besides the definition, and
explanation of <hi>Tully</hi> himselfe, you haue
at least forty seuerall bookes, which begin
(as I do) with a preface, as a preparatiue to
the Reader, to take their books within their gentle embraces,
meerely vpon the commendation of history. I leaue all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named,
except S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Henry Sauill</hi> for <hi>Tacitus,</hi> S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Walter
Raleigh</hi> for his history of the world, D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Haward</hi> for the
three Norman Kings, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. In whose
writings, let vs write, what we can, as much is written, as
either delight, profit, or priuate respect can extend vnto:
so that I say I desist from that generall insinuation concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the credit, or particular satisfaction of history, and
come to more familiar opening the carpet of the businesse
proposed. Onely this I will adde, that I had rather read
one true story handsomly set vpon the frame of <hi>Precept</hi>
and <hi>Caution,</hi>
      <note place="margin">True Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all prophane and deuised rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>tions.</note> then a thousand fictions diuerting my imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
conceits to thinke vpon, and (as wee say) spend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
on impossibilities, and corrupt my meditation with
vaine, foolish, beastly, and triuiall deuises, which are the
<pb facs="5"/>
more ridiculous, because there is substance, and matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in verity, to set on worke any humour and inuention
whatsoeuer, &amp; satisfie apprehensions euen in their wanton,
and exoticke wandrings.</p>
   <p>For in this house of repast, which my Iuy-bush inuites
you to, wouldst thou be made partaker of the attributes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
to the Diuine Maiesty? Heere are manifested his
prouidence, wisdome, mightinesse, power, iustice, mercy,
preuention, loue, goodnesse, maiesty, &amp;c, Wouldst thou be
made acquainted with the secrets of Religion? heere are
demonstrated the vanities of ceremonies, the necessity of
adoration, the encumbrances of superstition, the simplicity
of times, the darknesse of Popery, the feare of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
the reuerence of Priest-hood, and the folly of deuises?
Wouldst thou know the policies of gouernment, and dignity
of a King? heere you shall see, what the desire of soueraignty
can doe, the iealousie of a Princes estate, the reuenge of
wrongs, the feare of troubles and innouation, the inconstancy
of the people; the danger of factions, und the senerall passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of a prosperous, or declining estate? Wouldst thou bee
quickned with the remembrance of pleasure, heere are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of delight, courtings of Ladies, amorous encounters,
triumphant shewes, deceitfull vanities, and some idle rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
Wouldst thou see vertue mounted on a pinnacle of
her palace? heere are wisdome, grauity, constancy, magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,
endurances of misfortune, and moderation of power
and greatnesse. Wouldst thou behold vice in her deformity?
heere are enuy, hatred, malice, pride, ambition, desire of
reuenge, rebellion, contumacy, stubbornnesse, and such like.
Wouldst thou be acquainted with passions? heere are ioy,
feare, sorrow, gladnes, iealousie, mistrust, &amp; all of that sort.
Wouldst thou see other varieties? Heere are Princes decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb facs="5"/>
hopers abused, liers execrated, traytours punished, and
the Diuell himselfe confounded. In a word, wouldst thou
heare of strange aduentures? painefull endeauours? heroik
actions? dangerous attempts? military proceedings? heere
is Fortune, as we prophanely run away with the Embleme,
set vpon a wheele, and turned round about by the hand of
an inuisible, and inuincible Deity. Heere is the stage of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
and table of wonders? So that I am sure, from the
conquest to this houre, there is no story so remarkable, and
so full of obseruation, either for the ridiculous beginning,
dangerous continuance, or lamentable effects?</p>
   <p>For although the first contentions betweene the houses of
<hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> began questionlesse from the wrong
intrusiou of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth,<note place="margin">The house of <hi>Lancaster</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the first wrong.</note> when the right of the
crowne was in <hi>Mortimer,</hi> and his line by the daughter of
<hi>Clarence,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds third sonne, and elder
brother to <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt:</hi> yet there was some probability
and inducement to the reuengers, either mighty armies,
strong factions, many confederates, the next of bloud power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in his owne possession and friends, with such like. But
heere; besides the fanaticall inuention, men were transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against their owne conscience and knowledge, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
armes to doe they knew not what, onely because they
would be counted factious, stirring, and resembling the fish
<hi>Saepia,</hi> which cast into any water befroths the same, and in
the conclusion, the end as the beginning, and both like a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
castle quickly set on fire, or if you will, a confection of
spicery, which after it is carried round about the house, is
placed vpon the table with great wonder, amazement and
delight both at the st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ffe, and contriuing: but what is the
issue? the lookers on at last fall to, and pull euen the guns
and houses a peeces, and eat them.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>In <hi>Ireland,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> I remember, they lay an imputation of base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and cowardice on any man, that hath not beene in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as they tearme it, or hath not had his pardon and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
so that custome makes them Traytours, and the vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory
of reputation many times brings their necks to the
halter: yet it is somewhat tolerable for the generality of
the fault, and enforcement of the motiue, being <hi>Bards, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
Harpers, Preists,</hi> whom the very women <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ug in
their bosomes, for seducing their Noble-men, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and enciting them to reuenge. Vpon this ground, they
must prosecute, first some things worthy the honor of their
ancestors, and next remember the deploration of Religion,
Liberty, and the vsurpation of their Countrey, all which
the <hi>English</hi> haue from time to time intruded vpon, and are
not to be endured in their tyranny, as they make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.
But in this our story, there is nothing sauouring true
heroiknesse, nor worthy the name of commiseration and
assistance. For the best excuse ariseth from shadowes,
smoake, vapours, foolish enterprizes, and vniustifiable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wherein onely the power of God is manifested and
made apparant, that from so small beginnings, and slender a
fountaine, such turbulent streames and raging riuers should
arise, euen to endanger one of the flourishingst Kingdomes
in the world: yea, my heart trembles to imagine, that so
great a Prince, in the vnity of a right, by an vnpreuentable
marriage, should be heaued at in so formidable a manner by
an vpstart, and (as I may say) puppet stuft with straw, to
scare away crowes.</p>
   <p>I haue read of one <hi>Spartago</hi>
      <note place="margin">Spar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ago.</note> a Fencer, that taking vpon
him the person of <hi>Scribonianus,</hi> drew a great party toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
which as <hi>Nero</hi> laughed to scorne, so indeed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth quickly put to flight. Likewise, the other day
<pb facs="6"/>
in <hi>Venice, Florence,</hi> and many principalities of <hi>Italy,</hi> a
strange Impostor after 30. yeares or thereabouts, made them
belieue he was <hi>Sebastian</hi> King of <hi>Portugall,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Sebastian.</note> slaine in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barie</hi>
at the battaile of <hi>Alcazar,</hi> as was supposed, but in
truth recouered, &amp; obscured for a time &amp;c. I might also add
the cunning of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> who being in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
animated the Kentish rebell <hi>Iack Cade</hi> to personate
the name of <hi>Mortimer,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mortimer.</note> for a trial how the people would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that Title: But these florishes were only the rash bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of a bauin, as soone extinguished as on a flame, and
quickly ouerthrowne, vpon the first discouery: Only this
story for the varietie, the continuance, the manner, and all
other circumstances, hath made me (as I said before) ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and may in the reading produce the same effects in
others: Yet againe, when I consider the estate of mans
frailty, mutable, troublesome, and full of encumbrances,
and ouerlooke the condition of mortality, which in Princes
themselues is subiect to inconueniences, and many times
fearefull conuulsions, I wonder the lesse, because God will
be knowne vnto them, and they haue for the most part pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
in their rights, and iustifiable endeauours. For
which I also pray, that they may still hold vp the heads of
triumphant &amp; vnchangeable greatnesse, wherein (no doubt)
the same diuine arme of potencie which hath protected
others, will also support them from all dangerous enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
and fearefull treasons, either of Forraine or Domestique
aduersaries.</p>
   <p>But amongst other remarkeable accidents, this is not the
least, that so many examples, so many heads cut off, so many
Armies ouerthrowne,<note place="margin">Treason did neuer long prosper.</note> so many honourable families consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
so much blood spilt, so great reuenges taken (as if all
such enterprises were cursed in the wombe, and brought
<pb facs="7"/>
forth like an vntimely <hi>Embrion</hi>) could neuer affright o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
nor be a sufficient warning to succeeding times, but
euery occasion of innouation, were it neuer so foolish or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant,
still excited one or other to parts taking, and
brought them to vntimely ouerthrowes, either by their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and confederates discomfited, or by their enditements,
and accusations enlarged in iudiciall triall against them: but
this is the cunning of the Deuill, who to fill vp the vast
dungeon of Hell, make men so prodigall of their liues and
honours, or so couetous of reuenge, and vain-glory, that so
they may haue a name with <hi>Herostratus,</hi> who burned the
the Temple of <hi>Diana;</hi> they care not for the reproach, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that as many will extoll them for braue stirring spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
as condemne them for Traitors and disobedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
O ridiculous and abhominable conceits! O hatefull
and filthie imaginations! O deceiueable and imposturing
impietie: Nay, in a word, O horrible and flagitious mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse!
without reason, likelyhood or inference of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
or perswasiue circumstance.</p>
   <p>But least my Preface extend beyond the boundes of my
hearts commission, I will attend the particulars of my Story,
with this expostulation to all noble and generous spirits;
yea, I will kneele on my knees and hold vp my hands vnto
them, that they giue no way to any deceiueable seduction of
Pope, Iesuite, Priest, Faction, Innouation, Repining at the
State, Priuate ambition, Corrupted malice, and such like,
against the current of gouernment, or the ebbings and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the world and times. For the Maiestie of Kings will
not be tied vp with the slender bindings of rebellion, nor
taught any lesson against their wils either of fauouring, or
disfauouring, whom they please. As for personall faults;
Alas, Princes, Prelates, Officers, Maiestrates, and all sorts
<pb facs="7"/>
of men will runne the race of mortality; and if it were
possible to remoue offenders at pleasure, the persons may be
changed, but the imperfections continue. Let them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alone a Gods name; for they must stand or fall to the
estate of their liues, which he hath appointed: only this I
will be bold to say, I would haue no man for any priuate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
runne in the outragious races of sinnes himselfe, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
any wickednesse in others, beare with great men in
their vices, flatter or temporize for profit or preferment,
yeeld vnto base or degenerating actions either for feare or
fauour; or in a word, doe any thing contrary to Gods word,
wherein as in a glasse men may perspicuously behold the
way of life and death, and the infallible positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which in the affirmatiue and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
conclude all things either by
precept, or interdiction.</p>
