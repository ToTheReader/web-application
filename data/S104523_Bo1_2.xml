For we may in no wyse do euyl,<note place="margin">Roma. iij</note> how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
soeuer it be (as witnesseth S. Paule) to the

God any nede of our lyes, and dissimulaciōs.
It semeth that the Apostles haue sometyme
dissembled, but in very dede they dyd not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,
but vnfaynedly for a time thei did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
that which was conteyned in the law, to
the ende that by that meanes they might alure
and winne the Iewes vnto the knowledge of
Christ: wherin they dyd nothing against their
consciences, for asmuch as the ceremonies thē
vsed were first established by the word of god.

selfes wyth the wicked in vngodlines. O how
miserable are we, yf we acknowledge not these
thinges: and more miserable yf we know them
and do dissemble them: and most miserable yf
we do allowe them, and openly defend them.
Yf the brethren do consydre these thinges, and
dyligentely examyne the same, they shal easely
knowe, to what ende all thinges oughte to be
refarred, and in what maner it behoueth them
to lyue. For yf they do not set before thē selfes

then of force they muste nedes straye
from the right way. Wherfore as we sayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
there are two endes set forth vnto euerye
Christian man. The fyrst: the sekinge of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement
of the glorye of God. The second:
the wealth and saluacion of our brethren, as a
