      <q>
         <l>—tenet insanabile multos</l>

   </p>
   <p>Wherein, as I cannot but taxe our obscene Pamphleters, who, <hi>ad prelum tanquam praelium,</hi> runne to the Presse as the horse rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into battel, where they are wounded with their owne quils, when they publish their imperfections, and subscribe to their owne folly: so gladly them I would excite, to bring their graine to the market, <hi>who</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Prou. 10. 14.</note>
      <hi>lay vp knowledge</hi> in their heart, as that <note n="e" place="margin">Prou. 11. 26.</note> hoorder did his corne in the arke: or wrappe vp their gifts in paper, as did the slouthfull seruant his talent in a napkin, and make their common-place bookes bigger, as he did his barnes, where they may lay vp in store their fruites for many yeares: for this night may they fetch away thy soule from thee, and then whose shall those things be that so long thou hast prouided? Whosoeuer art called to labour in the vineyard, resolue with the maister of the vine, <hi>Ioh. 9. 4. I must worke the workes of him that sent me, while it is day: the night commeth when no man can worke.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And seeing there is a voice by <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 1. 63. Gal 4. 20.</note>

   </p>
   <p>In which respect, as it stands them vpon, whose tongue like <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charies</hi> is not vnloosed, to aske with him for writing bookes, <hi>and write, saying:</hi> (for though their tongue cleaue to the roofe of their mouth, yet should not their right hand also forget her cunning:) So may they thinke it an <note n="k" place="margin">Pulchrum esse &amp; honestū existimo, ijs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam quiposteà faturi sunt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uos silios relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere: ac filij qoidem corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum: animae autem sunt foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, orationes▪ Clem. Alex. ibi.</note> honest and comely thing, to leaue good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their mind to posteritie, seeing sonnes are but of the bodie frō mortall seed, and good bookes from the soule by the immortall seede of Gods word. Are they too simple? why he who by the mouth of an Asse forbad the foolishnesse of a Prophet, hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. Are they too weake in themselues? His power is made perfect through weakenesse: and he, who with fiue stones in <hi>Dauids</hi> sling ouerthrew strong <hi>Goliah,</hi> hath chosen the weake things of the world to confound the mightie things. Are they vile or despised among men? Why he who by the sound of Rammes hornes ouerturned the wals of Iericho, hath chosen the vise and despised things of the world to bring to nought things that are; so mightie through God, though weake in themselues, are the weapons of their warfare, to cast downe holds, and euery thing that is exalted against Christ. Wherin, though the liuing spirit of speech quickeneth most, more then the dead letter of writing, whence <hi>Paule</hi> himselfe wished for writing, to speake vnto the Galathians, that he might change his voice of the pen into a tongue, <hi>Gal. 4. 20.</hi> Yet when their bodily presence is weake, and their speech of no value, their writings may be forcible and strong. Neither let all thinke, that such as they are in word by letters when they are absent, such can they be, with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when they are present with the people, 2. <hi>Corint. 10.</hi> All which considerations, as they may stirre vp spirituall Fathers to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their young <hi>Samuels</hi> to the temple of the Lord, by the mouth of which babes and sucklings, his praise may be made more perfect among men: so, sith the tabernacle is not quite finished, free offerers need not feare their oblation (though of goates haire) shall be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, when <hi>infirmissima,</hi> the weakest things are as necessarie for the spirituall, as that was for the materiall tabernacle of the Lord. It were ridiculous, saith <note n="l" place="margin">Ridiculum certe fuerit, corum qui sunt boni ac studiosi scriptis repudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atis, eos, qui tales non sunt, componentes admittere. Sed Theopompo quidem &amp; Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeo, qui fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las &amp; maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta componunt, praetereà etiā Epicuro quo{que} qui estprinceps &amp; author impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etatis, quin e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Hippona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti &amp; Archilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho tam turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter scribere cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedendum est: ei autem qui veritatem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum est po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steris vtilitatē relinquere. lib. 1.

      <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> to refuse the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of good men &amp; studious, &amp; admit or licēce thē that are neither. Neither need any feare that of ours, which he addeth of his dayes.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>For my part, when I saw many rich men, cast of their superfluity so much into the Lords treasurie, I thought the widowes farthing would be needlesse, and once resolued with <note n="m" place="margin">Lib. 3. adu. Pelag.</note>
      <hi>Ierome</hi> in like case, to <hi>surcease</hi> from this worke, lest I should poure water into the sea, or carie wood into the forrest, as he speaketh, <hi>aut enim eadem dicerē ex superfluo:</hi> for that that is, hath bene, and there is now no new thing vnder the Sunne, <hi>aut si noua voluerim dicere, à clarissimo ingenio occupata sunt meliora.</hi> And indeed, to speake truth, this diseased Sermon, like the poore creeple at Bethesda, had kept its couch to the death, had not an <hi>Angell</hi> at a <hi>certaine season,</hi> that tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the water, put it downe into the poole, and made it walke abroad. Whose first conception as it was sudden and too present: so, like the vntimely fruite of a woman that perisheth before it seeth the Sunne, might the wombe haue bene its tombe, or at most like the <hi>Epheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
      <note place="margin">Seg niùs irritāt animos demis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa per aures: Quàm quae sunr oculis sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecta sidelibus. Horat.</note> haue liued but one day, but that thinking it would profite more by the eye, then it did by the eare, many reasons forced me to publish it to the eye of the world, that was priuatly spoken in the eare of a Colledge. Some it may be will aske me,
<q>
         <l>—Amphora cepit</l>
         <l>Institui, currente rota cur vrceus exit?<note place="margin">Horat.</note>
         </l>
      </q> Why I extend it to a booke that was intended but a Sermon, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a pitcher what I purposed but a kanne. Indeed, like the woman of Samaria, I brought a pitcher at first to the well of liuing water, but because of short meditation I had nothing to draw with, I haue now drawne deeper of <hi>Iaakobs</hi> well, filled my water pot to the brim, and this abortiue issue hath reentred (as it were) into the wombe, and bene borne againe. In whose second birth, I haue, as <hi>Galen</hi> speakes of nurces, or mid-wiues framed the vnfashioned feature and lims of this infant, before I durst presume to bring it to the church, and christen it in the Presse with the name of a booke. An argument (deare Christian) most needfull for these iarring and vncharitable times: wherein I beseech my ecclesiasticall brethren, in the bowels of<note place="margin">Motiues to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, that they preach faith that worketh through loue, and ioyne necessity of works with their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith.</note> Christ Iesus, that they would preach faith that worketh through loue, and adioyne to their doctrine of faith the necessitie of good workes: more then some do, who by beating solely on sole faith, haue made her solitarie. O ye Priests and Ministers of my God, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the high Priest caried pomegranates as well as bels, and a pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate
<pb facs="5"/> for euery bell, when he went into the sanctuary of the Lord, <hi>Exod. 28.</hi> And so the high priest of our profession, his doctrine still was, Euery tree that bringeth not forth good fruite, shall be hewne downe and cast into the fire, Mat. 7. Those beasts in Ezekiels vision, whereby the foure Euangelists are prefigured, as not onely auncient<note place="margin">1. The practise of Christ and his Apostlas.</note> Fathers, but modernes obserue, had hands as well as wings, and an hand for euery wing, Ezek. 1. It was the Apostles, and euen S. <hi>Pauls</hi> practise, who, and where, and to whom he stood most on iustification by faith onely, as in his Epistles to the Romanes and the people of Galatia, when in the former part he had layed that good foundation of faith, omitted not in the latter end to build thereon gold, siluer, and precious stones of good workes.</p>
   <p>It was his straite charge to Titus, and in him to al Preachers: this<note place="margin">2. Pauls precept.</note> is a true saying, and these things I would thou shouldst affirme, That they which haue beleeued in God, might be carefull to shew forth good workes; these are good and profitable vnto men. I may adioyne what he addeth, And let ours also learne to shew forth good workes for necessary vses, that they be not vnfruitfull. Tit. 3. 8. 14.</p>
   <p>A doctrine, as necessary in all ages, so most needfull in our times,<note place="margin">3. These loose and vncharitable t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> of many. Wherein the disease of our forefathers heads is so dangerously fallen vpon our hearts, that whereas they hauing good hearts and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d heads, being but children in vnderstanding, might truly crie with the Shunamites boy, Mine head, mine head, and their mother could not helpe them. We hauing good heads and bad hearts, may cry out with <hi>Ieremy</hi> in another meaning, My belly, my belly, I am pained at the heart: and euery where barren faith like <hi>Rachel</hi> crying, Giue me children, or else I die, giue me workes, or I am but a dead faith; yea she weepeth for her children, and will not be comforted because they are not.</p>
   <p>How much the rather should spiritual fathers open by these meanes<note place="margin">4▪ The sland<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="5"/> her slander of barrennesse and her rebuke among women: and hauing her quiuer full of these arrowes, she may be blessed before God, and not be ashamed when she speaketh with her enemies in the gate.</p>
   <p>A precept Apostolicall, not duly enough practised of some, who<note place="margin">A reproofe of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifidiā Preachers that teach faith alone to be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to saluation</note> thinke to make faith fruitfull, as Gardeners do their Walnut tree, by still beating on the bole▪ Whose <hi>tantum crede,</hi> only beleeue and thou shalt be saued, hath taught many to turne the grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes, &amp; resolue with <hi>Eunomius,</hi> that faith without works wil serue the turne. Of whose blind zeale and indiscreet <hi>speaking,</hi> good works like those workers may complaine, Exod. 5. The Lord looke vpon you and iudge, for ye haue made our sauour to stinke among the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the land, in that ye haue put a sword in their hand for to slay vs. O then <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> why cause ye the people to cease from their workes? Get ye to your burdens. Lay vpon the people the number of works which they did in time past, diminish nothing therof, for they be idle, therfore they cry, saying, Only beleeue and we shall be saued, for all things are possible to him that beleeueth. Which 4. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, as still they forced me in my speech to bid our Rebecca meet her spouse with bracelets as wel as with eare-rings, seeing not the hearers of the law, but the doers thereof are iustified before him, Rom. 2. 13. so▪ moued they me now to pen a tract (most needfull for our times) of Brotherly Reconcilement, whereof none auncient or recent hath particularly (that I know) written or diuulged, that <hi>Iames</hi> workes might be ioyned with <hi>Pauls</hi> faith, and faith worke through loue in all Christian professors.</p>
