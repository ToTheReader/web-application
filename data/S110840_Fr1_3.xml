   <head>Th' Argument of the two first dayes of the second weeke of Guil. de SALVSTE Seigneur Du Bartas.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oses saith, that in sixe daies God created the heauen and the earth, the sea, and all in them contained, then rested the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day, &amp;c. Which the Poet hath at large expounded in his first wéeke.<note n="*" place="margin">The whole se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond weeke.</note> And hauing with so luckie hand begun, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth (by the grace of God) to follow foorth so excellent a worke, and in a second wéeke to set out the state of the world from Adam to the latter day, adioyning thereunto euen a liuely descriptiō of th' euerlasting Saboth: so now he giueth vs the two first daies, to each of them allotting foure bookes. The first day may be called Adam, and representeth the state of the first man, before and after the fall, euen to his death, and of his posteritie to the flood. The second day may be called Noe, and containeth the state of the world after the flood to the time of Abraham: so that here we haue a learned and holy paraphrase vpon a part of the first booke of Moses: to wit, from the middle of the second chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> vnto th' end of th' eleuenth: his stile is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with all maner of beauties and graces méete for a poeme, perfect and worthie to be honored of all men of good iudgement: so much of the worke in generall.<note place="margin">Foure books of the first day.</note> Now let vs sée what the bookes of these two first daies containe in particular. After his méete prefaces and entrance proper to his matter, he placeth the first man in the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> painteth out the garden,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Eden.</hi>
      </note> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth diuers questions commonly thereabout arising, as of the trée of life and th'excellencie therof, likewise of the trée of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and euill; and here he sheweth what was the knowledge of man before sinne, wherefore he was placed in Paradise, what was his exercise there, what was his happines before the fall: as namely, that he had familiar communication with God: whereunto is properly adioyned the discourse of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<pb n="2" facs="6"/>
traunces, and Reuelations: this done he toucheth the commandement of GOD to Adam concerning the forbidden fruit, the promise of our first father, the great pleasures he enioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so long as he continued obedient: &amp; vpon this occasion he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth poynt deuise the beauties of this garden: yet with such a stay of himselfe, that he cutteth off many curious demaunds, and hauing answered certaine obiections, endeth his first booke. In the beginning of the second he setteth downe th' enuie and drift of the diuel against man,<note place="margin">2. <hi>L'imposture.</hi>
      </note> why he tempted outwardly, what moued him to take a body rather than present himselfe: the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of a serpent, rather than to change himselfe into an Angell of light. Hereout are handled opinions diuers, the conclusion of all is this: that the serpent was the diuels instrument to misleade our first mother. This draweth the Poet to speake of the power of Satan. So he returning to his former intent, discouereth all the wiles and assaults of th' enimie: how he brought Eue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and Adam by meanes of hir: whence haue ensued effects most gréeuous to behold. These miserable sinners exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, charged with sinne, and condemned therefore, as well by remorse of their owne conscience, as by the fearful voice of their creator, who pronounceth doome against the serpent and them. Wherunto is added a sound and full answere to all such wicked and profane spirits as murmur against the fall of Man, as it is set downe in holy scripture: to shut vp the booke, Adam and Eue are chased out of Paradise, and an Angell with a firie sword there placed to kéepe them out. Now the better to set forth the miserie of man,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Furies.</hi>
      </note> and the confusions which sinne hath brought in among vs, the Poet hauing in the beginning of his third booke mentioned againe, and set before our eies the blessed estate of the whole world, and the perfect vnion that was among all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures before the backsliding of Adam, the cause (as he sheweth by diuers examples) of all their disunion, he mustereth and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth forth an armie of all other creatures to war against man: then comming to the euils that afflict this poore guiltie creature both within and without, he bringeth in the furies called out of hell to come and torment mankind. These then are the plagues wherewith they chastise the bodie: to wit, famine, war, infinite
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
sort of diseases, whereof the chiefe are named and ranged into foure squadrons: The first laieth siege to the head: the second en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countreth the chiefe instruments of life: the third assaulteth the naturall powers: the fourth setteth on the outward parts of Man. They are distinguished againe into maladies particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonging vnto certaine peoples and climats, proper to the seuerall ages of man, speciall to diuers seasons of the yéere, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, hereditarie, new, obstinate, and vncurable. To increase the more this heape of miserie, he proueth that beasts are in this regard in better case than man. Then entreth into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the most dangerous diseases of all, which are those of the mind: and namely foure principall kindes, which vnder them containe all other, sadnes, ioy, feare, and fond desire: these with their traine and effects, are without comparison more to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red than all the most cruell diseases of the body, as by fit exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is proued: and so the Poet concludeth with an holy wish and profitable exhortation to the Frenchmen.<note place="margin">4. <hi>Artifices.</hi>
      </note> Hereupon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the entrie of the fourth booke saluted peace, and shewed the commodities thereof, he falleth fitly to his purpose, and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth vnto vs the miserable estate of Adam and Eue, being now foorth of the garden, what hard shift they made to liue, whereon they fed, how they were clothed, and what paines Eue tooke to weaue a garment for hir husband: their furniture against the cold, their place of abode and first buildings, the inuention of fire, the beginning of housholds, and how the land was peopled: the exercise of Caine and Abel, their sacrifices, the wicked mind of Caine, who slue his brother, and after thinking somewhat to ease his soule of the gnawing torments of conscience, built a towne, and began to ride horses; which the Poet handleth in kinde, and from thence falleth into discourse of th' inuention and vse of Iron and instruments of Musick. But as Caine and his followers busie themselues with affaires of the worlde, meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while Adam and his true children take after godlines and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and search out the sacrets of nature. Among other Seth is supposed to aske his father concerning th' estate of the worlde from the beginning vnto th' end, which Adam, excusing himself, at first refuseth to do, but suddenly mooued with the holie spirit
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>
(héere distinguished from the furies of men possessed of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell) he speaketh of all the worlds ages, and sheweth what shall befall euen to the flood: the discourse and consideration whereof ouercommeth his hart with griefe, depriueth him of spéech, and endeth the fourth booke, and so by consequent the first daies historie.<note place="margin">Foure bookes of the second day. 1. <hi>L' Arche.</hi>
      </note> Beginning the first booke of the second day with a new inuocation, he entreth into th' Arch, recounteth the holie exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Noe, which <hi>Cham</hi> gainsaieth, and diuers waies striueth against the prouidence of God: but Noe with many liuely and forcible arguments withstandeth him: meanewhile the flood is abated, the Arch staied, the Rauen and the Doue are sent foorth, Noe commeth out of the Arch, the measure and burden whereof is in a few words plainly prooued. Then this good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch hauing sacrificed, receiueth diuers lawes and promises of God, especially that there shall be neuer more any vniuersall flood, for token whereof the Rainbow is ordained: then Noe betaketh himselfe to till the earth, planteth a vine, is droonke with the wine thereof, and sléepeth on the ground in a shamefull maner, <hi>Cham</hi> maketh a iest of it, but Sem and Iaphet couer modestly the shame of their father, who now awakened out of his dronkennes, and much grieued thereat, curseth <hi>Cham</hi> &amp; his posteritie:<note place="margin">2. BABILON</note> so the Poet endeth his first booke. <hi>And to make way to the life of Nimrod he beginneth the second, with conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the peoples happines that are gouerned by good &amp; wise princes, and the bad estate of such as are slaues to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, beseeching God to withhold from vs such confusions as he liuely painteth out, in the discouering of Nimrods poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, who from his childhood setteth himselfe a worke to get the soueraigntie ouer men, sheweth his naturall bent among his play-fellowes, and for that behoofe spareth not his owne bodie: he beginneth to deale with wilde beastes, and mastereth some particulars, by reason whereof he win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the peoples harts and is made gouernour: then he laieth himselfe open; and to maintaine his tyrannie, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into the peoples heads to build a towne and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie tower, to withstand the force of another Deluge: This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth so good liking with the people, that they presently set
<pb n="5" facs="7"/>
themselues on worke. But the Lord, prouoked to anger with their bold attempt, confoundeth the language of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, so as they are constrained to let all alone, not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing one another by reason of their different speech, the roote of many inconueniences, whose contrarie commodities are declared: and so the Poet falleth into discourse of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of toongs, and of th'aduantage that herein mankind hath aboue all other creatures: and proueth by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that the Hebrue toong is the most ancient, that it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by descent from Adam vnto Nimrod, and remained last in the familie of Heber. Concerning other toongs, parted as they are sundrie waies, mention is made of their alterations, as also of their force and vigour, much relying vpon vse, which hath brought the Hebrue, Greeke, and Latine into request. Here the Poet breathing awhile, casteth into a new treatise, where he faineth a vision, and in the same the dwelling place and image of Eloquence represented vnto him, and about this image, the toongs: Hebrue, Greeke, Latine, Italian, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian, Dutch, Spanish, English, and French, togither with the names of certaine personages, that in some one of them haue excelled: and after due reuerence done vnto them, he closeth vp his vision and booke withall.</hi> Then in his third booke,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Colonies.</hi>
      </note> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king againe in hand the astonished builders of Babel, after he hath giuen a reason why God would not haue them stay in the plaine of Sennaar, he leadeth the children of Sem towards the east, of Cham to the south, of Iaphet to the north and west: but he chooseth rather to stay himselfe, than enter into the dark cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Antiquitie, shewing how much they deceiue themselues and others, who venter too far that way: then describeth he the diuers remooues of sundrie nations, as of the Bretons, Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, Alans and Vandals: reckoneth the causes why they shifted their abode: and baulking the vnknowen iourneyes of some nations, treateth of the voyages of certaine warlike peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, chiefly of the Gothes, Lumbards and Gaules. There againe staying, he saith, to be short, that the posteritie of Noes thrée children peopled the world, not all at once, but by little and little, and as it were yéere after yéere with increase of
<pb n="6" facs="8"/>
children: which also was th'occasion why the first Monarchie was planted in <hi>Assyria,</hi> néere to the plaine of Sennaar, rather than elsewhere in any countrey not so soone inhabited: so the Hebrues and other neighbour peoples haue had the Arts, riches and ornaments of delight, before those of the north and west knew what the world meant. Herupon is noted, first how Sem in the east, then how Iaphet in the west, and lastly how <hi>Cham</hi> in the south, replenished the world with people: it rested that he should speake of the new world discouered in our time: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the same he sheweth how so huge a countrey was first inhabited, why not so soone as other parts of the world, and whereby it appéereth to haue bin yet a long time possessed: he propoundeth here certaine of his owne coniectures touching the processe of this new worlds inhabitants, nameth diuers parts, and reckoneth vp certaine wonders thereof: then answereth fitly to this obiection; How it could be that Noe and his children should haue so much increased: and there taketh occasion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of the wonderfull works of God in the diuers temper and complexion of nations, shewing how the northren differ from the southren people, and euen those of Europe among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, especially the French, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he sheweth why God would haue the children of Noe be so disparkled ouer the face of the earth: which is compared vnto a great citie, where men haue much to do one with another: then refuteth he the godlesse crew, prouing (to their confusion) that whatsoeuer they suppose created in vaine, and to serue to no vse, standeth vs oftentimes in greatest stead, as witnes the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the mountaines, and the sea. But now being wéerie (as it were) with so long sailing, he landeth in France, &amp; singeth swéet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the praise therof, cōcluding that it wanteth nothing saue only a sound peace, which he craueth at the hands of him that is able to giue it.<note place="margin">4. <hi>Colonnies.</hi>
      </note> In the beginning of the fourth and last booke, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth on God againe, being to enter into discourse of a new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hautie, and very hard to handle, to wit, the Mathematikes; and the better to performe his drift, he supposeth <hi>Phaleg</hi> to haue found two ancient pillers, and to aske of his father Heber what they meane: whereunto Heber answereth, and openeth the
<pb n="7" facs="8"/>
doore of one of them, and sheweth his sonne foure images there inclosed: the first of them is Arithmetike, set out in hir proper attire with numbers: the second is Geometrie, with hir tooles, works, and excellent crafts, particularly set downe: the third is Astronomie, holding in hir right hand the Earth-globe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the land, the sea, and the ten circles of heauen are painted: and in hir left hand the sphere of heauen, bedecked with figures and images, noting forth all the principall stars that are séene betwixt the two Poles. In this place is yéelded a reason of the names that are giuen to the twelue signes of the <hi>Zodiacke,</hi> and Heber himselfe is made to hold opinion that the chiefe stars of the globe, which he numbreth, containe many mysteries of the church: but, as he endeuoreth to proue the same, the Poet appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a notable correction; and so goeth on to discouer the secrets of Astronomie: an art sprung from the Hebrues to the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, from them conueied to th' Egyptians, and so to the Gréeks, Arabians, Italians, and Almaines: to end that discourse he praiseth the learned Astronomers, and hauing declared the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of their skil, cōmeth to view the fourth image, which is Musick: hir he liuely pourtraieth in all hir brauerie, declareth hir perfection, and what power she hath ouer beasts, foules, men of vnderstanding, and God himselfe: this done, as <hi>Heber</hi> was about to go forward, <hi>Canan</hi> breaketh of their talke, by occasion whereof the Poet resteth himselfe, and so makes an end of the second day of his second wéeke.</p>
