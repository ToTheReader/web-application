   <p>
      <hi>GEntlemen</hi> and <hi>Yeomen,</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
not that I writ this Pamphlet
in Prose now, hauing before times
set forth so many Bookes in verse;
The First Reason that mooued me to write
thus, was because I was Lame, and durst
not write Verses for feare they should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with my Griefe, &amp; be lame too. The
Second Reason is, because that I finde no
good rime for a <hi>Coach</hi> but <hi>Broach, Roach
Encroach,</hi> or such like: And you knowe
that the <hi>Coach</hi> hath ouer-throwne the good
<pb facs="3"/>
vse of the <hi>Broach</hi> &amp; Broch-turner, turning
the one to <hi>Rackes</hi> and the other to <hi>Iackes,</hi>
quite through the Kingdome: The <hi>Roach</hi>
is a drie Fish, much like the vnprofitable
profit of a <hi>Coach:</hi> It will cost more the dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and Appurtnances then 'tis worth: For
the word <hi>Encroach</hi> I thinke that best befits
it, for I think neuer such an impudent, prowd
sawcie Intruder or Encroacher came into
the world as a <hi>Coach</hi> is: for it hath driuen
many honest Families out of their Houses,
many Knights to Beggers, Corporations to
pouerty, Almes deedes to all misdeedes, Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality
to extortion, Plenty to famine, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
to pride, Compassion to oppression, and
all Earthly goodnes almost to an vtter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
   <p>These haue beene the causes why I writ
this Booke in Prose, and Dedicated it to all
your good Companies, knowing that you
haue borne a heauy share in the Calamitie
which these hyred Hackney hell-Carts haue
<pb facs="3"/>
put this Common-wealth vnto: For in all
my whole Discourse, I doe not enueigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any <hi>Coaches</hi> that belong to Persons
of worth or qualitie, but onely against the
Catterpiller swarme of hyrelings; they haue
vndone my poore Trade, whereof I am a
Member, and though I looke for no reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet I expect the benefit of an old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe
(<hi>Giue the loosers leaue to speake:</hi>)
I haue Imbroadered it with mirth, Quilted
it with materiall stuffe, Lac'd it with simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes;
Sowed it with comparisons, and in
a word, so playd the Taylor with it, that I
thinke it will fitte the wearing of any honest
mans Reading, Attention, and Liking: But
howsoeuer, I leaue both it and my selfe to
remayne</p>
