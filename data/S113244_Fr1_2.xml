And furthermore, hauing many goodly plants in my vineyard (as other men haue in theirs) both fresh &amp; greene, and yet the fruite both bad and small (though they haue bene pruned and trimmed a long time by other labourers, as by my selfe): I much maruelled what might be the cause thereof. And digging for a fountaine to water my garden, I found a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt vaine in the earth, that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned my trees, and made the fruit naught. A handfull wherof I haue bound vp in paper (because it is
