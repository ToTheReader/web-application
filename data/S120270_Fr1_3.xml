   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Adame, among other bookes of holy scripture, that of the Psalmes wel deserueth to bee singularly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to vs. It is nowe some time, since hauing bestowed some payne in translating and expounding the same, I gaue my selfe also to take some more libertie of dealing with them by way of meditating vpon that subiect, choosing (as it were for an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saye) the seuen Psalmes called some time <hi>Penitential,</hi> because they were appointed to such as after hauing sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied open and canonical penaunce, were reunited to the body of the Church: wholy doing it for my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb facs="5"/>instruction and consolation. After this, beeing required by a great &amp; vertuous princesse, to frame for her some forme of prayers: I tooke them afresh into my hands, polishing them ouer, and that with hope of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing them: which being letted by the sodayne decease of that Lady, I reserued them among my papers as things of no great price: where they had lyen still, had not bene the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of master Anthony Bacon your sonne, into these partes: whom when I sawe to take pleasure in this litle piece of woorke, and againe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the latin letters wherewith it hath liked you to honour me, the great and singular, yea extraordinarie gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherwith God hath indewed you, and whereof I acknowledge a very paterne in your said sonne: I perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my selfe that it should not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
<pb facs="5"/>to you, if this small vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume carying your name vpon the browe, were offered to you, in testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the honour and reuerence I beare to the vertue of you and yours: hoping withall that this estate of widowehode whereunto it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to call you by decease of that right vertuous and of right renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Lord, my Lord Nicolas Bacon your husband, &amp; most worthy Keeper of the seale of England, you might perhaps therein finde some consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after the reading of those great and holy doctors Greeke and Latine so familiar to you, for your better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming in the meditation of spiritual things, and in this constancie and Christian patience wherewith God hath so beautified you, that in you is verily acknowledged that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly high minded courage which I
<pb facs="6"/>sawe in these partes shining in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, of very happy memorie, Syr Anthony Cooke Knight, during those great calamities publique to the realme, and particular to him &amp; his whole familie. See the ground of my purpose, which if it may please you to take in good part, which I very humbly craue, it may be perhaps an occasion of proceeding in this busines, our Lord ayding, whom I beseeche, Madame, that increasing in you his greatest graces, he will preserue you and all your verie noble familie, long in all holy and perfect prosperitie. From Geneua this first of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Anno. 1581.</p>
