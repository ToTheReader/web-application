For this cause, I that am Heauens winged Messenger, seeing thee ready to depart, present my selfe thus before thée, and vttering onely so much, as in the letters of thy name lyes mystically hidden, and that is this,</p>

Let <hi>Bellona</hi> (the goddesse of battailes) breath courage into the breasts of souldiers; and let no Country bee dishonoured by bearing men, that haue no hearts to come into the fielde. O let not that couetous Dragon, which once watched the golden firmament, sleepe in the bosomes of Kings, and with his poison, infect them with that couetous disease of hoording vp gold. Cast off (O you Princes) your sensuall pleasures, and let it bee your Ambition to weare Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of Oake, which are the Crownes of Conquerors. Prefer immortall Fame before all those Dangers, ouer which you must of necessity passe, be they neuer so inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the shew of vndertaking, and aspire onely to that life which shall remaine, when your bodyes lye dead.
