   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as certain persons
rather of too much eagernesse
then of good vvill, haue hasted
to snatch vp this little peece of
vvorke that I was in hande
withall, and haue pulished it,
beeing yet vnpullished, before
the matter that I had begunne,
could be fullie finished: &amp; now
also do blaze abroad in corrupted copies, the things that are
disalowed, as though they had beene well allowed: slightlie
ouerpassing such things as by further aduise haue beene ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the increase of knowledge: Least peraduenture such
a rude and vnperfect hochpotch should be brought vnto your
handes as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ooke by mee well ouerlooked: I haue sent you
this worke in such sort, as you may knowe it to bee by myne
owne aduise set in order. First, for that the processe of the
whole discourse was to be referred to your discretion, and
secondlie to the intent that the ilfauorednesse of that rustie
publication might by the true edition bee abolished. The ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
of this vvorke therfore shall be <hi>Polyhistor.</hi> For it is my
mind that the title which I had purposed vppon at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
(that is to say, <hi>A collection of things woorthy
remembrance)</hi> should be abolished vvith the rest of those
thinges that I haue disallowed. Wherefore when you shall
compare this Epistle with the Epistle which is in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the other coppie, you shall vnderstande that I have
made the same account of you, as of him to vvhō I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
the whole substaunce of my trauell.</p>
