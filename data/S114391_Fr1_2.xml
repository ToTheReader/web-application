                 <title>English protestants plea, and petition, for English preists [sic] and papists : to the present court of Parlament, and all persecutors of them: diuided into two parts. In the first is proued by the learned protestants of England, that these preists and Catholicks, haue hitherto been vniustly persecuted, though they haue often and publickly offered soe much, as any Christians in conscience might doe. In the second part, is proued by the same protestants, that the same preistly sacrificinge function, acknowledgeing and practize of the same supreame spirituall iurisdiction of the apostolick see of Rome, and other Catholick doctrines, in the same sence wee now defend them, and for which wee ar at this present persecuted, continued and were practized in this Iland without interruption in al ages, from S. Peter the Apostle, to these our tymes</title>

   <head>THE PREFACE TO AL INDIFFERENT AND EQVALL READERS.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight honorable and the rest, my dearest and moste beloued contrymen, kinred, and frends: I haue by the greate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, protection and mercy of God liued now amongst you, a preist in persecution, little lesse then halfe the life of an aged man: That which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth, is cheife my debt by nature to dye, and make accompt to my highest Kinge, and Iudge, as of late our moste reuerend Arch-preist within these few weekes hath done: whoe (as I interprete his letters) bequeathed as a legacie to mee vnworthie, this chardge: To write, and publish to the world this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueing treatise, which I name. <hi>The protestants Plea, and petition to the parlament for preists, and papists:</hi> (soe many protestants please to stile Catholicks. If this chardge had not beene committed vnto mee by my soe honored and reuerend frend, yett hauinge beene soe longe a partaker of the miseries which english catholicks haue in these tymes endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and beeing well acquainted with the proceedings of bothe sides, and knowing by certaine experience, that besides their sufferings to their immortall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, their published bookes by diuers our learned preists haue soe conuinced the vnderstandings of our
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
greatest aduersaries in all cheife questioned things. That noe protestant Bishop or other writer hath now after diuers yeares made any answeare at all vnto them: and of many former moste humble petitions of our learned preists and catholicks, both to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant princes, and parlaments, to haue audience in disputation with their best learned protestant Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops &amp; doctors, whether to thy could conuince vs as guiltie and worthie to bee persecuted, as we haue beene, which hither they would neuer graunt, but haue soe longe and greuously without any triall or condemnation, executed and persecuted vs in soe straunge a maner: and the present protestant rather puritane parlament, stormeth now more against vs, then the wisest of vs can see reasons to warrāt them: I therefore for the honor of God, and reputation of his holy church and Religion, the loue of my country, and to performe my frends request, doe puplish this remembred worke to bee diuided into two parts, and eyther of them to bee inuincibly proued by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned protestants of this kingdome. In the first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the holy scripture soe describeth the dutie of well lyuing men: <hi>Declina à malo, &amp; fac bonum, declyne from euill and to good:</hi> I am to proue by these remembred protestants, that the catholicks of England doe moste religiously decline from your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and all participating therein, and their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers considered, the protestant state doth moste vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly persecute them. In the second, to iustifie, that <hi>fac bonum,</hi> wee doe well, and therein performe the holy commande of God, in professing the catholicke
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
Religion, the same with the church of Rome, shall bee demonstratiuely proued by these protestants, and the best Antiquities and monuments they haue of our first true Apostolick Religion, in these kingdomes of our present most honored soueraigne kinge Iames, that not onely those cheifest questions, for which wee ar soe persecuted, as namely holy preisthood, now treason, the sacrifice of the masse so punished and the spirituall power, and iurisdiction of the see Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, here nowe soe penall and contemptible, but if need require, all other controuersies betweene vs of substance, haue euer from the tyme of S. Peter the Apostle, in euery age, and hundred yeares, vntill these dayes beene practised and continued here, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, in such sence, maner, &amp; meaneinge, as wee catholicks of this kingdome with the church of Rome now doe professe. And here I entreate noe Religious order to take my Title, <hi>plea and petition for preists and papists,</hi> as any excluding of their holy labours, and deserts, which I embrace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence: for although I will maintaine for them, that monasticall life in England is soe auntient, as the dayes of S. Ioseph of Aramathia, whoe brought it hither, and dyed here, with his holy company in that profession: yett I finde wee had both preists, and Bishops here, in, and of this nation, longe before that tyme, and many Catholick Christians of the same Religion wee now professe, and soe continued vntill this tyme without the least discontinuance or totall interruption; which I dare not to affirme of our Religious men, ceasing for an hundred yeares
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
after S. Iosephs death: and in the beginninge of Queene Elizabeths tyme for twenty yeares allmost together, fayled here, when many holy preists were laboureing here in this holy worke: and after some Religious men of the societie had come hither, they went and left vs alone for diuers yeares. Therfore to speake consequently (which I must performe) I must giue this happie prerogatiue to our reuerend preists, whoe neuer fayled or fainted in this cause and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They were the first conuerted this kingdome, and did neuer cease. They first tooke this quarrell in hand in the tyme of Q. Elizabeth, and onely were they, that neuer gaue it ouer. They are principally they, whoe in the catalogues of our holy writers of this tyme, ar stiled with that honor. They ar the spirituall fathers, and in Christ Iesus haue begotten, both the present Religious and other catholicks of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. They, whoe with their holy doctrine, and effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their sacred blood, for this moste glorious cause, haue aboue all others (eight or more to one) beene the continuall preachers and propugners of this true faith with vs. They (whoe both in the presence and absence of all religious) haue often offered and humbly sought, publick defence thereof by disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the best learned and selected protestant Bishops and Doctors of this nation. Therefore leauinge these peculiar honors vnto the Reuerend preists of England, I will with such inequallitie as I haue before proposed, maintaine for all preists, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and all catholicks, that our holy preist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, sacrifice of Masse, spirituall Romane iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
