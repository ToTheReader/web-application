   <head>The Answer to R.G. his Epistle prefixed before Mr. Iunius letters.</head>

      </gap> now they live exiles: have ben constreyned to publish to the world / the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their Christian faith / and causes of their departure from the foresayd English synagogues for clearing of the truth of God and witnesses of the same / both which were much and many wayes calumniated. More specially they dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated that litle book to al Christian vniversities neer about to be discussed / appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or reproved by the godly learned in them And sending one in particular to the hands of <hi>M.H. Iunius,</hi> a man of great learning and godlines / dwelling neer vnto them to be by him and the rest of his brethrē of the vniversitie at Leyden judged of they received from him a letter lately by one <hi>R.G.</hi> trāslated and printed in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish whether with the authors consent or not is yet vnknowne: but the copy (as the publisher sayth) was given out by the author himself / who might had done wel to have given a copy of the answer likewise▪ or if he did / the translator hath not dealt indifferently to publish one and not an other. How ever it were / al men may see how just and necessary occasion those eriled Christians now have / to print their answer also which vpō the receipt of his Letter they sent vnto him / but hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have spared to give out any one copy either of his or theirs: whether for doubt of their owne cause or reverend regard rather of that mā / let the sequel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare / and let the discrete reader by it judge / whether party hath most advantage.</p>
   <p>As for the translators censure <hi>that they sought to shrowd themselves vnder the shadow of humane authoritie.</hi> this brief narratiō of the cariage of the matter / and the plaine apologie which they make vnto Mr. Iunius of their proceedings / wil shew it (vnto al godly wyse) to be but the surmise of a malicious hart. And were it not that the weaknes and badnes of their cause compelleth them thus to doe it might seem strange that any of the church of England would publish such a writing as this in their owne defence / as if it approved their estate / and condē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned those foresayd Christian exiles: when any whose eyes ar in his head / may see by Mr Iunius his writing vnto them / as Christian brethren / and refusing at al to vndertake the maintenance of those English parishes or conviction of such as separate from them how far it is frō justifying those synagogues estate. Yea al wiseharted may and will we doubt not easily discerne how naked and helplesse they be which neither by their friends at home / nor the most learned abroad can otherwise be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>elieved then by such things as hitherto they have printed Or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever this present generation shall judge of these things / yet the ages to come / (which wil be lesse partial) wil easily give sentence.</p>
   <p>The better to certify thee▪ good reader of the whole cause / and cariage therof / here is with these Lecters set forth also their Confession of faith / with the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>le and preface as it is in Latine. And wheras ther is since that time published also a second epistle of Mr. Iunius ther is now the answer to it set forth likewise: which answer was presently written vpon the receipt of his Letter / but not then sent for causes partly before noted and now more fully signified and sent to Mr. Iunius himself. The things which here are mentioned of corruptions in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther churches and dealings that have passed about thē ar yet spared from being published in print at large til further occasion and provocation be. Onely the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and brief h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

occasion given by things which passed in the Letters / as al mē may see. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reover it is not to be omitted / how in the printed copy of Mr. Iunius Letter / <note n="*" place="margin">For proof herof see Mr. Iunius owne words no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the margine of his letter herafter fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and compare also this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it, with the translators before pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</note> some things were corrupted / by alteration omission / and c. Otherwise then in the original by himself first sent / they do stand and ar yet to be seen. This it is not likely Mr. Iunius himself would doe but was (perhaps) the printers fault / or rather indeed the translators evil mind for his mother churches advantage / whō falshood seeketh to vphold / when syncerity and truth hath forsaken her. It shal therfore rest vpon him / as <hi>the first fruits of his evil labours in this kind,</hi> til he clear himself.</p>
   <p>The Apostles and Prophets / and Martyrs by him mentioned / dealt not so. Neither yet did they alwayes insist vpon a plaine and simple <hi>asseveration of the truth,</hi> but mainteyned it also with proofes and arguments from scripture / and sound reason / against such as oppugned the same. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.2.3. and 18.28. and 28.23. <hi>Rom,</hi> 1.17. and 3.4.10. and 4.3.7.17. and 9.7.9.12.13.17.20.25.27.29.33. and 10.5.11.15.19.21. and 11.2.9.26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3.4.25.27.45.54.55. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6 8.10.11.13.22. and 4.21.22.27.30. <hi>Esa.</hi> 40.12. and 41.21.22.23.24. and 44.6. and c. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Acts</hi> &amp; <hi>monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the historie of Mr. Brute, Thorp, Lambert, Ridly, Philpot, Bradford, and many others.</hi> And though the Apostles and Prophets had / yet no mās asseveratiō now / may be compared with theirs / but must be tried by their writings. And so these Christian exiles / published to that end their faith vnto the world / against which to this day / neither Mr. Iunius nor any els of that or the other vniversities / have to our knowledge vsed any one <hi>weighty and sound reason grounded vpon the holy scripture of God,</hi> as this translator would bear men in hand he doth / and as the Prophets did in al their asseverations / taking their ground from the law before given. <hi>Mat. 22.40.</hi> The Lord rebuke Satan / and make bright the glorie of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and Gospel / and turne to the profit of every faithful soule / these things now published by his vnworthy and contemned servants / to his owne eternal prayse in Christ. Amen.</p>
