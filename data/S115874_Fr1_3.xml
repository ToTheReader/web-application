   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Ontanus</hi> in his 19.
chapiter <hi>de magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficentia,</hi>
among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinges ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
mention of one <hi>Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitanus,</hi>
that presented vnto
<pb facs="16"/>
      <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of <hi>Calabria,</hi>
a Box of Amber, very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
&amp; artificialy wrought,
which being opened by the
King: had nothing else but
a little sflye enclosed within.
Surely (sayd <hi>Alphonsus</hi>) the
reward is but smal, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
a Prince that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth
it not so much by the
price, as by the rarenes ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of,
accountes it for a moste
precious present. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
so sayde, hee stoode a
great while amazed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
<pb facs="16"/>
himselfe, with
what kinde of rewarde hee
mighte worthily recōpence
him that gaue a gifte so gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
Madam I offer not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your honoure an Amber
Box with a Fly, as <hi>Aconitanus</hi>
did, nor my cap ful of water
as <hi>Synctes</hi> did, nor mine hād<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful
of leaues, as another
<hi>Persian</hi> did, and yet the
thinge that I offer agreeth
in one respect to all these
three, &amp; againe in one point
differeth from one of them
<pb facs="17"/>
onelye. It agreeth with all
three in basenes: and it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
onely from the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Box, which preferred a
glosing and bewtifull showe
to the outward vewe, and yet
had nothing with in it
but a thinge of noughte:
much lyke vnto an house,
which outwardlye is verie
sumpteously adorned, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a port of great maiestie
and magnificence to the eie,
but when a man is entred in
to it, there is nothing to be
<pb facs="17"/>
seene but onely the bare
wales. VVherevnto the
thinge that I offer is cleane
contrary: For it yeldeth no
glorious nor glistringe glose
nor any coloure of delighte
vnto the eye: notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
I haue so prouided
that the matter therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
shall suffice to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it without the helpe
of any externall ornamēts.
And hauing at last brought
the same to perfection, I
could not call to remēber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce
<pb facs="18"/>
any person of estate,
on whome I had greater
cause to bestowe it, then vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your honoure. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidring,
your courteous &amp;
amiable acceptatiō of those
fewe ragged verses, whiche,
aboute two yeares paste I
presumed to tender vnto
your discreete iudgement, I
must needes confesse that,
from that time to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
day, I haue bene depe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indebted vnto your good
Ladyship. And nowe, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb facs="18"/>
what to discharge my selfe
of that continuall burthen,
and to make satisfaction in
part, of the debte which I
haue so longe owed: I haue
compiled this little booke
of Prayers grounded vpon
the deuine promises contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the sacred Scriptures,
which I haue aduentured to
publish vnder the patronag
of your Ladyships name,
crauing that as ofte soeuer,
as God shall put it in your
mynde to withdrawe your
<pb facs="19"/>
selfe into your closet, there
to meditate vpon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
promises, of our most
mercifull Father, (as your
vexteous mynde is very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or neuer at all, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
enclined,) that then you
woulde vouchsafe to take
this booke in hand, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to any title whatsoeuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
may serue your tourne, to
apply the prayer folowing
vnto your present purpose.
But perchaunce you will say
that there are alredy extant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="19"/>
diuers &amp; sundry bookes of
prayers, which haue bene set fourth
by men of greater
vnderstāding &amp; riper iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
then I, and therfore
it was a needeles and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
trauaile to wade any
furthar in that matter. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dede Madame
I graunt that
ther are many praier bokes
published, but yet I am of
this opinion that if there
were ten tymes as many, yet
there were not to many. For
the common prouerbe is,
<pb facs="20"/>
      <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>num, quo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>ōmunius, eo melius:</hi>
The more common a good
thinge is, the better it is
And therefore will I hardly
be perswaded, that my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure
could anye way haue
bene better employed, then
in suche causes as concerne
the aduauncement of Gods
glory, and the propagation
of vertue. VVell such as it
is I haue presumed to offer
vnto your honoures i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>dge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
with assured hope,
that you will deeme of it, as
<pb facs="20"/>
your noble nature hath ben
alwaies enclined to iudge of
them that attempt the like
enterprises: &amp; that you will
accept it as a sure tokē and
testimonie of his loyall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and readie dutie,
that would thinke himselfe
happie to bee accoumpted
but as the least in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those that woulde be
allwayes at your Ladiships
commaundement.</p>
