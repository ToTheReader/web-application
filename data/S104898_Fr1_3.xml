   <p>Neuer thelesse good mother,
oute of the loue that I do beare

and consyderynge howe muche I

of youre consente, that I

of oure sonne, in our absence, and
for manyfolde other benefytes,
and pleasure donne vnto vs, by
oure good father your husbande,
and you, at diuers, times besydes:
I haue caused a good frende of
myne here, mayster Iohn Hoper,
<pb facs="9"/>
for to traunslate and wryte out
in to Englyshe, a lytle treatyse
compiled in lattin by that very
chrysten and godly doctor, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulian
(a Martyr also of Iesus
Christe, as some do wryte) now
aboute .xiii. hundred and lxxxx.
yeares agonne. And so muche
the soner, haue I sente you the
saide treatyse, rather then annye
other thynge, gathered after
myne owne mynde, oute of the
holy scriptures: because that no
man should dryue you, from the
folowing of the same, as from
a new found doctryne, deuysed
but yesterday, out of some fonde
fellowes brayne. For y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is one,
of the cauylacyons, where with
the dyuell goeth aboute, for to
let the goynge forwarde, of the
verytie manye tymes: euen for
to mou emen to beleue, that the
olde truth, is the new learning,
<pb facs="10"/>
yea newe fangled heresy, and I
wote neare what.</p>
   <p>The occasyon why I haue
nowe sente you, this aforesaide
treatyse, called the seconde boke
of Tertulian, vnto hys wyfe:
And not rather translated hys
fyrste boke, in whiche he instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
hys wyfe, howe she shoulde
behaue herselfe, and order her
lyuing after hys death: Is that
in his sayde firste boke or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyse,
he exhorteth her, for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynewe,
styll a widdowe in any
wise: yea and that requireth he,
of her so earnestely, &amp; so straigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely,
that he (but in y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> no doubte
he erryed greatly) semeth plainly
to affirme, and to go aboute, to
make her beleue, that yf she ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
againe with any man, she
shoulde commyt synne. But here
in thys other treatyse, he semeth
after my mynde, rather by decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rynge
<pb facs="10"/>
vnto her, what maner of
husbande, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> she shoulde chose to
her (to say none other,<note place="margin">Husban<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des, chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens or widdow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es might ī no wise take, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
         <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute the great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fēce and cōtempte of all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie god: tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che and ī<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>struct her what maner of &amp;c.</note> but a ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
Christen and godly person) if
that after she were once free, frō
the yoke of matrymony, she had
not the gyfte of god, to folowe
S. Paules counsell, whiche is:
to abyde styl vnmaried, and not
to seke another husbande, yf she
wer once losyde from one, and
not in daunger of fornicacion,
thorow the burning incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye
of the corruptyble fleshe.</p>
   <p>But now I doubte not, but
that if some mā, should heare this
saide treatise reade vnto you: he
woulde saye by and by: what
madde fole sente this boke vnto
you, as a thynge that ye shoulde
folow? &amp;c. This exhortacion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
for the christen wemen of
Tertulyans tyme, when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habyted
the whole world ouer,
<pb facs="11"/>
here aud there, amongest the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideles
and heathen, and for
suche as do dwell amongest the
Turckes and Iewes, nowe in
our dayes: And not for any Uir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
or widdowes, in oure kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
grace hys realme, where as
be none other to take, but onely
christen, if a woman wyl mary,
any man at all. That is truth in
dede, yf all men were trew chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten,
that beare the holy name of
Chryste. But oure sauioure hym
selfe saythe Math .vii. Entre in
at the strayte gate for wyde is
the gate, and brode is the waye
that leadeth to distruccyon, and
many therbe which go in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at.
But strayght is the gate, and
narrow is the waye whych lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vnto lyfe: and fewe therebe
that fynde it. Itē: not euery one
that saith vnto me, Lord, Lord,
shall entre into the kyngdome of
<pb facs="11"/>
heauē: but he that doth the wil
of my father, whiche is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
And saynt Paule, speaking
of the false chrysten, I meane
such, as be but chrysten in name
only. Unto Titus .i. Saith: they
professe that they knowe God
(wyth theyr mouthe, &amp; by theyr
outwarde vse, of the sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and ceremonies, the Apostle
meaneth no doubte) but wyth
theyr dedes they denye him: In
as muche as they bee abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
lyuers, and not obediēt vnto
goddes worde, but reprobate
persones, as touching any good
woorkes. It is good to thincke
then, that the man of God, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuliā,
toke such for no better, thē
the heathen: Specyally seyuge
that hys mayster, and Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, sayth further, that at
the laste daye, he wyll saye vnto
such, christen disciples of hys: de
<pb facs="12"/>
parte from me, an ye that worke
Iniquitie: I knowe you not. &amp;c.
Mat .vii. And who I pray you,
shoulde better knowe, who bee
the trewe chrysten, and chrystes
disciples in dede, then our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Iesus himselfe? which saith
Ioh .viii. If ye shal abyde in my
worde, then shall ye be my disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in dede. Item. Ioh .xv. He
that abideth in me, and I ī him,
bryngeth fourthe muche frute.
&amp;c. Then they that bryng forth,
no frutes of rightuousnes at al:
but lie still lyke swyne, wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in theyr voluptuousnes, or
els lyke cruell dogges, do barke
at, and persecute the trewe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne
of Chryste, whyche they
knowe not, bee none of chrystes
discyples, and therfore, no trew
christē: but heathē, &amp; worse then
infidels, in the syght of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
god. Yea, and so bee all suche
<pb facs="12"/>
to, as do contynuallye sryll from
day to day, walke or lye, in their
foruicacion, adulterie, dronke n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
glotonye, extorcion, intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
vserie, inordinat coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
blynde superstici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and wiked Idolatrye, wyth
suche lyke vyces, as S. Paule
sayth .i. Cor. vi. and Ephe .v. For
why shulde they els, be cast oute
of the company, or communion,
of al christen men. In token that
they haue no parte ī the gospel,
nor of the kingdome of Christe,
except they amende? Saynet
Paule, when he went so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aboute, to dryue the christen
people amongest the Corynthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus,
from the vsyng of the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,
&amp; other vices of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles
there: what ment he when
he sayde .i. Cor. x. I woulde not
haue you ygnoraunte brethren
that our fathers wer al of them
<pb facs="13"/>
vnder the cloude, &amp; as passed tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>row
the sea, &amp; al of thē wer bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisid
into Moses, in the cloud, &amp;
in the sea, &amp; al did eate one, &amp; the
same spiritual meate, and al did
drynke one spirituall drinke. &amp;c.
What shuld the Apostle meane,
by all these wordes I say? but
that suche of those fathers, as
were afterwardes noughty fell
from God, vnto lust, and synne,
and tempted and prouoked god,
vnto wrathe and vengeaunce in
the wyldernesse, were neuer the
better in the sighte of him, for y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
they had before sene and felt, so
many of his greate miracles, or
wonderfull dedes, nor for that
they had ben partakers, of so
many, of his holy signes and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes.
Now that this was
S. Paules meanynge, aperyth
playnly, by that he sayth by and
by after the afore aleaged wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:
<pb facs="13"/>
out in manye of them, God
had no pleasure. And that same
the Apostle proueth, by that the
Lorde did after ward, punishe &amp;
plage thē so greuously &amp; oftē, in
the wildernesse. For they were
ouerthrowē in the wildernesse,
saythe S. Paule .i. Cor. x. And
then he goeth fourthe there, to
his purpose and sayth: but these
are examples vnto vs: that we
should not luste after euel thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as they lusted: nor be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
of Images, as some of
thē (he meaneth the forefathers
of the Iewes, that prouoked
God in the wyldernesse) were:
And so fourth, as ye may reade
there, at your leasure. And at the
the laste, Sainct Paule conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
thus: al these thinges hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
vnto them, for figures (or
examples, as he mighte saye) &amp;
were wrytten for our warning,
<pb facs="14"/>
vpon whome the endes of the
worlde are come vpon. Euen as
thoughe he would saye. It shall
nothyng auayle you, O ye chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
amongest the Corinthians,
that ye once receaued the spirite
of God, at your baptysme, that
ye come ofte to praye togyther,
and synge psalmes in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
assēbles, nor that ye do oftē
receaue the sacrament of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
bodye and bloude &amp;c. As o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good christen do: Excepte
that ye do followe youre profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in dede, continew in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryt
and feare of the lorde, auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
all deadly synne, and the
wicked wourshypping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that is vsed, amongest your
neighbours and familiers the
gentyles there, at Corrinth. &amp;c.
And by thys good mother is it
easy, to applye this aforesayde
saying of sainet Paule: vnto our
<pb facs="14"/>
corrupte ryme (of whyche no
doubte, the holy goste shewed
before hande .ii. Timo. iii.) And
to esteme those persons, no trew
chrystians, whiche do perseuer
wythoute all repentaunce and a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendement,
in all maner of vice,
and abominacions, of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world.
For Saynt Iames saythe that
the pure and vndefiled religion,
before god, and the father, is, to
vysit the fatherlesse and wyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
in theyr afflyccion (by
these two good workes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
he vnderstandeth the walkīg,
in all other good dedes, ye may
bee sure) and to kepe hym selfe,
vnspotted of the world. That is:
to beware, that he defile not hys
soule, nor body nother, with the
couetousnes, extorsiō, adultery,
fornicacion, Idolatrye, or suche
lyke abomynacions, whyche the
worlde commonlye vsyth or cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytteth.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="15"/>
But to returne somwhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,
vnto my purpose: please
it you to vnderstande good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that whereas ye shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
fynde, certaine annotaciōs
in the mergent, of this treatyse,
the same I made my selfe, with
out master Hopers knowledge:
(but y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> faithful, may sone iudge,
whyther they be trewe or no) if
they wyl confer the same, wyth
the righte touche stone, the holy
scryptures. This I wright for
none other intent, but that, if the
same annotacions do not lyke
you, ye should not put y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> blame in
mayster Hoper, who knoweth
not yet of them. And as for the
notes that I haue made here &amp;
there concernynge the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I amsure that ye woulde
nor be offended wyth them, yf
ye had rede the same doctors
<pb facs="15"/>
mynde, in other places of hys
woorkes: Because y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same,
he dothe manyfestlye declare,
that he was of the ryghte opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon
in the sayde Sacramente.
For in hys fyrste boke agaynste
the herityke Marcion, who
dyd saye that all the thinges of
thys world wer vncleaue (but
other more dampnable heresies
then that dyd he stiffely defend)
he sayth these wordes folowīg:<note place="margin">Tertuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus mīde of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy sacramēt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body &amp; bludde</note>
Chryst dyd not reproue breade,
by whyche he dyd represent his
bodye. And in hys fourthe boke
where he confuteth the sayde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
herityke, for saying
y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> our sauioure Iesus, had but a
phātastical body: he is yet more
playne, and sayth thus: Chrsyte
toke breade, distributed y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same
vnto hys discyples, and made
it his bodye, sayinge: this is my
bodye. That is to say, a figure
<pb facs="16"/>
of my bodye. But that had ben
no figure thereof, except that he
had had a verye bodye. For a
vaine thing, which is but a phā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasy,
can receaue no figure. Or
els yf he dyd therefore make
breade hys bodye, because that
he lacked a trewe bodye: Then
should he haue deliuered bread,
for vs. And that had made for
the vanytye of Marcyon, that
breade had bē crucyfied. Hether
to are Tertulians wordes: by
the whych ye may playnely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue,
that he beleued not (as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
Papystes do) that the breade of
the Sacrament, was the verye
body of Chryste Really, no, but
figuratiuely, or ī a mistery. And
for the better vnderstanding of
the whole treatyse folowynge
(because that mayster Iohn Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
did it not) I haue translated
the prologe into the same, here
<pb facs="16"/>
my selfe symplye, and as wel as
I can. But now I make an end,
to trouble you good mother, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
thys my rude wrytyng: because
ye shoulde the soner reade
here now, wholy Tertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
owne mynde, of
the foresayd mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
&amp;c. The grace
of oure Lorde
Iesus
Chryste, be euer more
wyth you. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN.</p>
