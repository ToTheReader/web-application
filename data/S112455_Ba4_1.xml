   <p>IF, by looking on what is past, thou hast deseru'd that name, I am willing thou should'st yet know more, by that which followes; an <hi>apologeticall Dialogue:</hi> which was only once spoken vpon the stage, and all the answere I euer gaue, to sundry impotent libells then cast out (and some yet remayning) against me, and this Play. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I take no pleasure to reuiue the times, but that Posteritie may make a difference, betweene their manners that prouok'd me then, and mine that neglected them euer. For, in these strifes, and on such persons, were as wretched to affect a victorie, as it is vnhappy to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them. <hi>Non annorum canicies est laudanda, sed morum.</hi>

         <l>It is not so.</l>
         <l>I vs'd no name. My Bookes haue still beene taught</l>
         <l>To spare the persons, and to speake the vices.</l>
         <l>These are meere slanders, and enforc'd by such</l>
         <l>As haue no safer wayes to mens disgraces,</l>
         <l>But their owne lyes, and losse of honesty.</l>
         <l>Fellowes of practis'd, and most laxatiue tongues,</l>

         <l>Compell their braynes to many desp'rate shifts,</l>
         <l>(I spare to name 'hem: for, their wretchednesse,</l>
         <l>Fury it selfe would pardon.) These, or such</l>

         <l>Or itch, t'haue me their aduersary (I know not)</l>
         <l>Or all these mixt; but sure I am, three yeeres,</l>
         <l>They did prouoke me with their petulant stiles</l>
         <l>On euery stage: And I at last, vnwilling,</l>
         <l>But weary, I confesse, of so much trouble,</l>
         <l>Thought, I would try, if shame could winne vpon 'hem.</l>
         <l>And therefore chose AVGVSTVS CAESARS times,</l>
         <l>When wit, and artes were at their height in <hi>Rome</hi>,</l>
         <l>To shew that VIRGIL, HORACE, and the rest</l>
         <l>Of those great master-spirits did not want</l>
         <l>Detractors, then, or practisers against them:</l>
         <l>And by this line (although no <hi>paralel</hi>)</l>
         <l>I hop'd at last they would sit downe, and blush.</l>
         <l>But nothing could I sinde more contrary.</l>
         <l>And though the impudence of flyes be great,</l>
         <l>Yet this hath so prouok'd the angry waspes,</l>
         <pb n="351" facs="189"/>
         <l>Or as you sayd, of the next nest, the hornets;</l>
         <l>That they fly buzzing, mad, about my nostrills:</l>
         <l>And like so many screaming grasse-hoppers,</l>
         <l>Held by the wings, fill euery eare with noyse.</l>
         <l>And what? those former calumnies you mention'd.</l>
         <l>First, of the Law. Indeed, I brought in OVID,</l>
         <l>Chid by his angry father, for neglecting</l>
         <l>The study of their lawes, for poetry:</l>
         <l>And I am warranted by his owne words.</l>
         <l>Sape pater dixit,
<note place="margin">Trist. lib. <hi>4.</hi> Eleg. <hi>10.</hi>
            </note> studium quid invtile tentas?</l>
         <l>Maeonides nullas ipse reliquit opes.</l>
         <l>And in farre harsher termes elsewhere, as these:</l>
         <l>Non me verbosas leges ediscere,
<note place="margin">Amo. lib. <hi>1.</hi> Eleg. <hi>15.</hi>
            </note> non me</l>

         <l>But how this should relate, vnto our lawes,</l>
         <l>Or their iust ministers, with least abuse,</l>
         <l>I reuerence both too much, to vnderstand!</l>
         <l>Then, for the Captaine; I will onely speake</l>
         <l>An <hi>Epigramme</hi> I here haue made: It is</l>
         <l>
            <hi>Vnto true Souldiers.</hi> That's the <hi>lemma.</hi> Marke it.</l>
         <l>Strength of my Countrey, whilst I bring to view</l>
         <l>Such as are misse-call'd Captaines, and wrong you,</l>
         <l>And your high names; I doe desire, that thence,</l>
         <l>Be nor put on you, nor you take offence:</l>
         <l>I sweare by your true friend, my <hi>Muse</hi>, I loue</l>
         <l>Your great profession, which I once did proue;</l>
         <l>And did not shame it with my actions, then,</l>
         <l>No more then I dare, now, doe with my pen.</l>
         <l>He that not trusts me, hauing vow'd thus much,</l>
         <l>But's angry for the Captaine, still▪ is such.</l>
         <l>Now, for the Players, it is true, I tax'd 'hem,</l>
         <l>And yet, but some; and those so sparingly,</l>
         <l>As all the rest might haue sate still, vnquestion'd,</l>
         <l>Had they but had the wit, or conscience,</l>
         <l>To thinke well of themselues. But, impotent they</l>
         <l>Thought each mans vice belong'd to their whole tribe:</l>
         <l>And much good doo't 'hem. What th' haue done 'gainst me,</l>
         <l>I am not mou'd with. If it gaue 'hem meat,</l>
         <l>Or got 'hem clothes. 'Tis well. That was their end.</l>
         <l>Onely amongst them, I am sorry for</l>

         <l>'Tis true.</l>

         <l>If a free minde had but the patience,</l>
         <l>To thinke so much, together, and so vile.</l>
         <l>But, that these base, and beggerly conceipts</l>
         <l>Should carry it, by the multitude of voices,</l>
         <l>Against the most abstracted worke, oppos'd</l>
         <l>To the stuff'd nostrills of the drunken rout!</l>
         <l>O, this would make a learn'd, and liberall soule,</l>
         <l>To riue his stayned quill, vp to the back,</l>
         <l>And damne his long-watch'd labours to the fire;</l>
         <l>Things, that were borne, when none but the still night,</l>
         <l>And his dumbe candle saw his pinching throes:</l>
         <l>Were not his owne free merit a more crowne</l>
         <l>Vnto his trauailes, then their reeling claps.</l>
         <l>This 'tis, that strikes me silent, seales my lips,</l>
         <l>And apts me, rather to sleepe out my time,</l>
         <l>Then I would waste it in contemned strifes,</l>
         <l>With these vile <hi>Ibides</hi>, these vncleane birds,</l>
         <l>That make their mouthes their clysters, and still purge</l>
         <l>From their hot entrailes. But, I leaue the monsters</l>
         <l>To their owne fate. And, since the <hi>Comick</hi> MVSE</l>
         <l>Hath prou'd so ominous to me, I will trie</l>
         <l>If <hi>Tragoedie</hi> haue a more kind aspect.</l>
         <l>Her fauours in my next I will pursue,</l>
         <l>Where, if I proue the pleasure but of one,</l>
         <l>So he iudicious be; He shall b' alone</l>
         <l>A Theatre vnto me: Once, I'le say,</l>
         <l>To strike the eare of time, in those fresh straines,</l>
         <l>As shall, beside the cunning of their ground,</l>
         <l>Giue cause to some of wonder, some despight,</l>
         <l>And vnto more, despaire, to imitate their sound.</l>
         <l>I, that spend halfe my nights, and all my dayes,</l>
         <l>Here in a cell, to get a darke, pale face,</l>
         <l>To come forth worth the iuy, or the bayes,</l>
         <l>And in this age can hope no other grace—</l>
         <l>Leaue me. There's something come into my thought,</l>
         <l>That must, and shall be sung, high, and aloofe,</l>
         <l>Safe from the wolues black iaw, and the dull asses hoofe.</l>
