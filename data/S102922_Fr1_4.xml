   <head>TO THE IVDICIOVS and ingenuous Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow backward I haue euer heretofore bin (best knowing mine owne weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) to publish ought by the Presse, they best know, who hauing oft pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me thereunto, haue neuer hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to therein preuailed. Now a twofold necessitie is imposed vpon me of doing somewhat in this kind, partly by the importunity of diuers Christian frends, religious and judicious, who hauing either heard, being partakers of my publike Ministery, or heard of by report of others, or vpon request seene some part of this weake worke, haue not ceased to sollicite the further publishing of it: As also partly, (and more specially) by the iniquitie of some others, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of contrary iudgment in some particulars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in disputed, haue bin more forward than was fit by vn-christian slanders and vncharitable censures to taxe and traduce both me and it. From whose vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust and vndeserued aspersions no way seemed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and readier to cleare either, than by offring to open view of all, what I had before deliuered in an obscure auditorie (to speake of) among but a few. And this thou hast here (good Reader) for effect and substance the same that was then and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered,
<pb facs="6"/>
inlarged onely with such matter of History and Humanitie as was not so fit to pester the Pulpit or incomber that Auditorie withall. For the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of entring first into this discourse, and motiues of wading so far in it, I referre thee to <note n="a" place="margin">
         <hi>Chap</hi> 9. §. 10.</note> that part of it where I render an account thereof, vnwilling to stay thee longer, than needs must be, in the entry. If any shall surmise that writings in this kind may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion too much liberty, a thing that litle needeth in this ouer-licentious age: I answer breifely; first that <note n="b" place="margin">
         <hi>See Gerson in regul. m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>

For no sinister end (I protest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods face and in his feare) vndertooke I this taske; neither haue I auerred or defended ought therein, but what I am verily perswaded to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Gods word. If any man can better informe me in ought, I shall be right ready to hearken vnto him: neither haue I neglected any meanes in this kind, (by writing &amp; conference with others, besides mine owne priuate labors) that might further me therein. Defects in it (I know) there can not but be many: what, or whose worke is free from them? mine of many, much more: too many my selfe see; and many more (I well wot) a curious eye may soon espie. Let them in frendly and louing manner be shewed me by any; (as forme haue already bin by
<pb facs="6"/>
by some; whom I rest beholden to for it) and I shall count it a speciall kindnes. Where defects shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, let it yet be considered, whether they be vitall and fundamentall or no, such as touch the very heart and life of the maine matter, or such as not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding them the frame (or foundation at least) may stand firme: And withall let it be remembred that I deale in an Argument that hath hitherto bin handled very confusedly by the most, and not very soundly by the best; as to any indifferent eye vpon due view of this present discourse may very euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare. Of thee (whosoeuer thou art) I desire but to finde an vnpartiall Reader, a judicious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusser, and a charitable censurer; that <note n="d" place="margin">

      </note> what I profer with the right hand be not taken with the leaft, but that Charity may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with diuersitie of iudgment, if thou shalt in ought remaine yet vnsatisfied; a course too too much wanting in this vncharitable age. And this fauourable acceptance if these my sory first-fruits shall finde, it may encourage a weake beginner to attempt somewhat further hereafter, that may be of better vse. Them and thee I commend both to him, who is the Author of all Truth, the clearing whereof hath bin in this worke my maine ayme: He vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe a blessing; and through his blessing the labor (I hope) shall proue not vnfruitfull.</p>
