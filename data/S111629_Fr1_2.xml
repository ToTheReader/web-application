   <head>To the right vvorship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, learned, and most gentle Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>my verie good Master, Ma.</hi> Edward Suliard, Esquire. VV. VV. wysheth his harts desire.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ay it please you Syr,</hi> thys once more to beare with my rudenes, in presenting vnto your viewe, an other slender conceite, of my simple capacity: wherin although I am not able to bring you anie thing, which is meete to detaine you from your more serious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: yet vppon my knowledge of your former courtesy &amp; your fauourable countenaunce towardes all enterprises of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I dare make bold to craue your accustomed patience, in turning ouer some of these fewe leaues, which I shall account a greater recompence, then the wryting thereof may deserue. The firme hope of your wonted gentlenes, not any good ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of myne owne labour, made me thus presumptuously to craue your worships patronage for my poore booke. A pretty
<pb facs="3"/>
aunswere is reported by some to be made by <hi>Apelles</hi> to King <hi>Alexander,</hi> who (in disport) taking vp one of his pensilles to drawe a line, &amp; asking the Paynters iudgment of his draught, <hi>It is doone</hi> (quoth Apelles) <hi>like a King:</hi> meaning indeede it was drawen as he pleased, but was nothing lesse then good workmanshippe. My selfe in like sort, taking vppon me, to make a draught of <hi>English Poetry,</hi> and requesting your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyps censure of the same, you wyll perhaps gyue me thys ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, <hi>It was doone like a Scholler,</hi> meaning, as I could, but indeede more like to a learner, then one through grounded in Poeticall workmanship.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Alexander</hi> in drawing his lyne, leaned sometime too hard, otherwhyle too soft, as neuer hauing beene apprentice to the Arte: I in drawing this Poeticall discourse, make it some where to straight (leauing out the cheefe colloures and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Poetry) in an other place to wyde (stuffing in peeces little pertinent to true Poetry) as one neuer acquainted wyth the learned Muses. VVhat then? as he being a king, myght meddle in what Scyence him listed, though therein hee had no skyll: so I beeing a learner, wyll trye my cunning in some parts of Learning, though neuer so simple.</p>
   <p>Nowe, as for my saucie pressing vppon your expected fauor in crauing your iudgment, I beseech you let me make thys ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse: that whereas true Gentilitie did neuer withdrawe her louing affection from louely Lady Learning, so I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that your worshyppe cannot chuse, but continue your wonted fauourable benignitie towardes all the indeuourers to learning, of which corporation I doo indeede professe my selfe one sillie member.</p>
   <p>For sith the wryters of all ages, haue sought as an vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bulwarke and stedfast sauegarde the patronage of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, (a shielde as sure as can be to learning) wherin to shrowde
<pb facs="3"/>
and safelye place their seuerall inuentions: why should not I seeke some harbour for my poore trauell to reste and staye vppon, beeing of it selfe vnable to shyft the carping cauilles and byting scornes of lewde controllers?</p>
   <p>And in trueth, where myght I rather choose a sure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and readye refuge for the same, then where I see per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte Gentilitye, and noblenesse of minde, to be faste lyncked with excellencie of learning and affable courtesye? Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, adde thys to the ende of myne excuse: that I sende it into your sight, not as anie wyttie peece of worke that may delight you: but being a sleight somewhat compyled for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, in the intermyssions of my daylie businesse, euen thys Summer Eueninges) as a token of that earnest and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable desyre I haue to shewe my selfe duetifull and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wylling towardes you. VVherevnto I am continually enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more and more, when I consider eyther your fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble freendshyppe vsed towardes my selfe, or your gentle coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce shewed to my simple trauelles. The one I haue tryed in that homely translation I presented vnto you: the other I finde true in your curteous putting to my trust, and dooing me so great honesty and credite, with the charge of these toward young Gentlemen your sonnes.</p>
   <p>To which pregnant ympes of right excellent hope, I would I were able, or you myght haue occasion to make triall of my louing minde: who shoulde well perceyue my selfe to remayne vnto them a faythfull and trusty <hi>Achates,</hi> euen so farre as my wealth my woe, my power or perrill, my penne or witte, my health or lyfe may serue to serche myne ability.</p>
   <p>Huge heapes of wordes I myght pyle together to trouble you wythall: eyther of my selfe or of my dooinges, (as some doo) or of your worshyppes commendable vertues (as the moste doo) But I purposely chuse rather to let passe the sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="4"/>
of that worthy fame which you haue euer deserued, then to runne in suspicion of fawning flattery which I euer abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
   <p>Therefore once againe crauing your gentle pardon, and patience in your ouerlooking thys rude E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle: and wyshing more happinesse then my penne can expresse to you and your whole retinewe, I rest.</p>
