vnder whose wings this second part

securely, as vnder your name, being
<pb n="146" facs="81"/>
so neare in nature, but much more in
grace to that religious Ladie. Yea,
these my simple meditations hauing
longed and called in a manner these
monethes by-past, for your patroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
who is fitter for them then they
can possibly be for you? you being
the scholler of that blessed Maister,
the Spirit of grace and truth, who
hath learned what sinne and nature
is, what Christ and grace is, not to be
the naked hearing of the eare, but by
the inward feeling of a true religious
soule, and well informed and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
conscience. Sure I am that these,
who had occasion to see and conferre
<hi>Abraham</hi> after his triall, with <hi>Ioseph</hi>
after his imprisonment, and with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
after he was brought from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised

acceptable to you, who hauing lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
out of Scripture, from your
youth with <hi>Timothie,</hi> and since your
youth out of rarest remarkable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences,
what sound, what colour,

things heauenly haue? So that now
you being presented before all crosses
and tentations, yea, before diuels and
death, can from a chearfull heart and
with a smiling countenance, sing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodiously
with that sweetest singer,
that 71. Psalme. I recommend these
my simple weake meditations to
your fauourable acceptance, and
carefull protection, and your selfe
from my very soule, to the sauing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,

that blessed God, with whom there
is no shadow of turning, who hath
