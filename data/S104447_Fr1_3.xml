   <p>So likewise thy most excellent creature man was created to thy Image, in pure vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng, perfect memorie, sincere will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any care, or without all feare of death or perrilles. But (O most iust God) after his fall, death crept in as it were a leaprosie, and the Image of God was darkened, blemished, and almost blotted out: Yet by thy mercifull good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse O God, this Image is repaired by thy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, because wee be renewed by faieth into the hope of euerlastyng life, that wee maie liue in God, and with GOD, and maie bee one with hym. And whereas man after the eatyng of the Apple forbidden, had the knowledge of good and euill, yet the euil men doe detaine thy trueth O God, in vnrightuousnesse, and doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse thy vocation and callyng, which by thy trueth doest continually call vs vnto thee, yet this thy trueth naturally grafed in vs continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doeth indeuour as much as it may to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere in action, but it is let and hindered by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, which some say is in the nether part of the soule▪ others say it is in <hi>brutali spiritu</hi> or <hi>Anima,</hi> therfore thou hast giuē vs, O God, that what we knowe, we study to make manifest &amp; shewe forth, which if we doe not wee be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by our owne iudgement: for the better part of the Soule or <hi>Spiritus,</hi> which some call <hi>sinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resis,</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
doeth perswade to that is good. Hereby appeareth the wonderfull power and strength of conscience: which in great offenses cannot be perfectly quieted. Wherefore, it is written, the Gentiles which haue not the lawe, by nature, doe the workes of the lawe, and doe shewe the worke of the law written in their hearts: their conscience bearing thē witnesse: their thoughts either accusing or defending them. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie to perswade to doe good, some call sinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resis, which thy word calleth conscience, which is a liuing lawe, which cryeth, stirreth, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to doe good: for thou O God, art so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and good to vs, that thou hast giuen this knowledge to our minde: which like a Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master doth instruct and teach vs: so that cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, is as it were a certaine lawe in thinges subiect to sence and reason. But (O good God) omnipotent, <hi>Aristotle</hi> his heathnish Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, very absurdly teacheth, that all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, be bodies subiect to no corruptiō, and that they and their motions be eternall: and he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signeth to certaine myndes, Intelligentis, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der straunge natures and essenties, and sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their seuerall and singuler motions of the sayd Orbes: And he assigneth one Orbe to the high God, which is moued by him. Whereby he maketh all those essenties seperated, among whō
<pb facs="6"/>
those Orbes are distributed to bee equall and like substaunce: but he alloweth that mynde or essence which is the elder: that is, God to bee onely so much the more excellent then the rest, by how much the orbe assigned to him, is more excellent then the other Orbes. That Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie also teacheth, that it is an absurde thing and against reason, to say that any thing eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall had any beginning: therefore because those Orbes be eternal they had no beginning. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it teacheth that God medleth not vnder the Moone, and that he is not the maker nor the creatour of any thing, but onely the mouer of the heauen: and it maketh God to be the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cause onely of motions, and not of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ech seueral thing: neither doth his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie teach any agent cause of those thinges which it affirmeth to be eternall. And by this doctrine it must needes follow, that because the world is eternall without beginning &amp; ending, and incorruptible, therefore it needeth not thy prouidence, either that it should be, or continue, nor that it needeth thy helpe. And because it hath no other efficient cause of any other but of it selfe, therefore it needeth none other to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for his being or well being. It also teacheth that thou O GOD medlest not vnder the Moone, but that thou rulest vnder the Moone
<pb facs="6"/>
onely with a cōmon influence and vsuall course of second causes, though some doe vntruely goe about to excuse this doctrine: in saying, that it accompteth Nature to be God, or at least Gods Ʋicar or deputie: which neither needest any such, nor yet hast any deputie. O most mightie God, creator of all thinges, strengthen thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple against these and all such doctrines, tending to the derogation of thine honour, goodnesse, mercie and wisedome: and by reason it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that no body of it selfe is immortall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause each body consisteth of his partes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be dissolued: but the soule of man is immortall, and the body is made immortall at the last resurrection, by reason of the presence of the soule: But <hi>Aristotle</hi> maketh no mention of the immortalitie of the soule, neither doth he attribute any felicitie to it after the death of man: whereby <hi>Alexander Aptrodisienses</hi> concludeth, that he denyeth the immortalitie of the soule: Also reason teacheth, that many diuers and contrary thinges can not bee ioyned together by themselues, without the helpe of an other, and be not brought to one certaine forme, vnlesse they bee vnited together by the helpe of some other. The worlde therefore, consisting of so many diuers and contrary partes: in which, colde, heate, drinesse, and moysture, are ioyned
<pb facs="7"/>
together, and other thinges of contrary nature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and vertues, doe agree together in one forme. And the Orbes and celestiall bodies of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motions from the East to the West, and from the West to the East, and in retrogradation and direction, and stationarij, their motions in the Epicycle, in the <hi>Aust. &amp; oposito angis,</hi> doe make no discorde, but keepe a regular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in all those contrarieties. Therfore, we must bee compelled to confesse, that there was and is one that hath coupled, vnited, and ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, such and so diuers contrary things: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, such diuers and contrary things and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by their owne swing, course and mouing, would bee dissolued one from an other, vnlesse they were preserued by some others. Can there be a table painted with diuers colours and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or pots of diuers sorts and fashions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a workmaster? Can any thing that lacketh a gouernour or ruler, be moued by it selfe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in a regular or certaine order? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by reason it appeareth, that the worlde is gouerned and ruled (O God) by thy diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence: And thou (O God) that rulest all the vniuersall worlde, doest also gouerne, rule, and prouide for each parte thereof: for he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well, that neglecteth the least parte of that thing.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>Likewise, O almightie God, that heathnish Philosopher doth teach, that <hi>homo &amp; Sol ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerāt hominē,</hi> whereby (O good God) it must needes followe, that man and the Sunne must be eternall and infinite. Though heate nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth and cherisheth our bodies, yet for all that it is not the cause of generation and begetting, but thy worde, O mercifull God, so commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the blood of this or that man shalbe made male or female. Reason can not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende this worde, therefore it must needes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishly trifle off the causes of such things. So the Phisitions following the Philosophers, doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the cause of generation (O God) to a cōue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient mixture of qualities, which doe worke in the matter ordeyned before, what colour soeuer reason doth beare herein: yet for all that, they doe not attaine to the first cause thereof. For, the holy Ghost (O God) doth leade vs into a higher cause then to nature, then to qualities, and their temperature, when it setteth before vs thy worde, O omnipotent God, in which all things are created and conserued. Also, O most high God, this heathnish Philosophie doth not admit any Metaphisicall principle in naturall thinges, in which ascending by the doubtfull care of naturall thinges, being remoued from diuine, mans minde is turned from them. And
<pb facs="8"/>
surely such naturall Philosophie is the next way to make men forget thee, O God, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Atheists: for it teacheth men to cleane and sticke fast vnto the nature of thinges, not ascending nor considering the Creator: And so it tyeth thee (O God) to the seconde causes, and doth not attribute to thee any actions, but according to that nature of thinges: whereby it doth bewitch men in such sorte, and make their mindes so mad, that they neither do aske neither looke for any good thing at thy hande: for the euent and successe of each thing must of necessitie bee answerable to the naturall cause. And by that doctrine thou (O God) doest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the nature of thinges created: whereas contrariwise all thinges created must followe thee: so that it placeth the effected cause in the steede of efficient, and the instrumentall cause for the agent. And further it teacheth, that matter and forme is the first principle of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thinges: which doctrine draweth thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (O God) from true honoring of thee, for the creation and prouidence of thy creatures. It is not enough to confesse that thou didst create all thinges, if it bee sayd also that thou hast forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken those thinges as soone as thou hast created them: as the Carpenter leaueth the house when he hath once made it: for so should the worlde
<pb facs="8"/>
sone perish and come to ruine: but thou, O most mercifull God, doest direct all thinges that bee or shalbe by thy vnderstanding and knowledge to meete and conuenient endes, such as pleaseth thee to thy honour and glory. For, in thee wee liue, moue, and haue our being: and all thinges be of thee, and in thee, and by thee. For, we can not moue our tongue, which is the lytist part of our body, without thy prouidence: Man may prepare the heart, but thou (O God) rulest the tongue: neither doth a Sparrowe light vpon the ground, without thy good will O almightie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And all the heires of our head be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, thou c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>st all things by the word of thy power: thou art the Lorde of all flesh: thou art the Lord of all spirites: thou workest all things according to the decree of thy will. Therefore, O God, graunt we may cast our care vpon thee, that thou may nourish vs: take thou care ouer vs: touch the apple of our eye: be thou our shield and brasen wall: Bee thou our helper and wee care not what man may doe to vs. Giue vs a newe heart and a newe spirite: as thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs thy Commaundements, so make vs to walke in them. By these and such like testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of thy most sacred and holy worde, O good God, we learne thy diuine prouidence ouer man and all other thy creatures, and that thou doest
<pb facs="9"/>
not leaue nor forsake them when thou haddest made them, but doest of thy most tender good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse gouerne not only man, but also whatsoeuer thou hast created: whose infinite power wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euery thing in euery thing. And thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts doe acknowledge (O God) that a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar force and vertue was giuen to euery thing at the beginning by thy worde, voyce, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemēt: which yet are in continuall force: but yet the same bee but onely seconde and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall causes, not working of themselues, not principally, but depend vpon thy power and commaundement, without which thou workest the same effects when thou pleasest: which thou art wont to do by meanes of the second causes. And all thinges which are in this world, and which are seene, doe not onely take their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from thee to bee thinges, but also to haue such power and vertue, and to be such maner of thinges as they are. Therefore is the worlde a looking glasse, in which thy wisedome is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: If wee ascende into heauen, thou are there: If we descende into hell, thou art present. And though th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> often tymes worke by them, as thou doest▪ by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>e Angels thy ministers which doe thy will: yet are they all but the second causes
<pb facs="9"/>
and instruments of thy diuine prouidence, and can doe nothing vnlesse thou bee present to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the things, and helpe and bring forth the effect: For thou (O God) doest not so giue force to thinges, nor doest so send thy Angels thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, that thou art absent thy selfe: for thou reachest and touchest from end to end mighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and disposest all thinges sweetely and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to thy glory. Therefore art thou (O most mightie God) the first and efficicient cause of all things. For, thou (O God almightie father) art the resting and quiet fountaine of al things that be, perfect of thy selfe, needing none other: Thou art the first action, and workest inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: thou art the true light. Thou art not onely all in each seuerall thing, but all in all, spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in power and essence: so thou art euery where: thou art the being, first, cheefe, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall liuing and parent of life: hauing quiet motion in thy self, and mouing thy self inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being not moued by motion. Thou art the being and beginning of all other things: Thou art silence, thou art quietnesse, or resting, aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in thy selfe: that is, secret mouing, or secret action. Wherefore, thou art sayd (as it were) to sit in the Center of all thinges that bee, from whence with an vniuersall eye: that is, with the light of thy substance, by the which each
<pb facs="10"/>
thing hath his being, life, and knowledge: thou doest beholde them: thy will is the still worde. Thou (O Father) art the beginning of being of all substaunces, which from thee that is the being it selfe, doest giue (being power of life and substaunce) to all thinges according to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and capacitie of the receiuer. All thinges dwell in thee, potencially: thou art the parent of all things in power. Thou art omnipotent: thou art all in all in those thinges: whereof thou art the originall and cause in vertue and power. Thou fillest heauen and earth, and thy spirite hath filled the whole world yet it is in secrete: that is, in power. For, there must bee a certaine might or power, wherwith all things are quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened into liuely Spirits, as it were from a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fountaine, that they may liue of that: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do liue, they obteine their being. For there must be an Actor before there be action, the Agent bringeth f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Thou (O God the Sonne) by whom all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were made, and without whom nothing is made, art the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

word, the wisedome of the father, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power of operation and working. Thou (O God the Sonne) art the apparent and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest motion or mouing, moued by motion, the actiue motion or action, and actiue worde: for the manifesting of the power is action: which action hauing all thinges that bee in power li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and knowledge according to motion, doth bring forth and make manifest all thinges: not by locall motion, neither by transferring into place, but by a better and diuine motion, such as belongeth to the Spirite▪ which by his owne motion doth giue life, and bringeth foorth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 span">

      </gap> in it selfe, and not cut from the first power in the operation. Thou (O Christ) art life hauing life in thy self, appearing outwardly in quickning: And because thou art life, therfore thou art motion quickning al that is quickened▪ for life is cause of motion. And because thou art manifest motion, comming from secrete and inwarde motion, and life ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king life from liuing, and the principall life and beginning: therefore life is begotten of liuing or principall life, and thou art the Sonne of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by thee all thinges are made. Thou art life in al things▪ seing thou art euery where: all fulnesse doth inhabite in thee corporally: that is, in operation substantially. And because

the very life had no beginning, being alwaies of it selfe, to it selfe, of the father: therfore it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>yall, waterie, and earthly thinges, and to all thinges that the earth doth bring forth, and to all other thinges: therefore, euery matter whereof the worlde consisteth is indewed with life, and Christ is in the life, by whose power all things doe come forth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede into generation, and consist according to their matters and substancies, to the which thou giuest such propertie and vertue as they haue. Thou art the vniuersal word remayning impassible and not turning: yet life is before the soule: for the life of the soule is of the power of liuing: Thou art the seede of all thinges that be in operation and made manifest: for nothing can come nor proceede from the Elements of parents nor of any seede, if thou (O Christ) worke not: if thou withdrawe thy working po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer from things, they perish immediatly. Thou (O GOD the holy Ghost) art the springing knowledge and vnderstanding, flowing and proceeding from the Father and the Sonne.

Thou art the spirituall voyce of the manifest voyce or Sonne, as the Sonne is the voyce of the voyce in silence, therefore thou art of the Sonne and of the Father: yet but one voyce, one word: that is, one actiue power agreeing together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it maketh any thing to bee. Thou art the Spirit of God, the power of Christ: and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God is God: therefore, all three of one substaunce: All thinges be in thee, as al things be by the Sonne, and of the Father. Thou (O God the holy Ghost) art (as it were) the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of God, and doest deuide the graces and ministeries in the operation of life: so that by thee the first seedes of things are nourished and sustayned, and now also be continually moued: and first bring foorth rootes and blades: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stalkes, eares▪ flowers, blossomes, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>edes, and fruite, of each thing in his degree, according to thy distribution and diuision of the giftes. As the Father is the cause of the operation▪ and the Sonne the manifest operation: so all three are one action and substaunce. Thou couplest and k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>est the Father and the Sonne in one, and art coupled with them: and all other thinges thou ioynest in vnitie and band of peace. And because in God to knowe, is as much to say, as to vnderstande, and to knowe that one liueth, and to knowe himselfe is to liue: therefore, to
<pb facs="12"/>
knowe or vnderstande, and to liue, is all one: And because they be one, and because to bee, is all one with life and vnderstanding: (for true being can not bee without life and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: neither can life and vnderstanding be without such being) therefore they be three, yet one substaunce and one God. So the soule of man, in that it is a soule hath his being, giuing life and vnderstanding, &amp; is there in one. And as God the Father is a Spirite substancially, and the Sonne is a Spirite and motion moued, and working openly: so thou the holy Ghost art the secrete spirite and motion: Thou implantest and giuest strength to liue and to moue, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sustaynest all things that they may exist and liue, and also continue and be preserued. And because thou art God, thou art a Spirite: and because thou art that Spirite thou doest quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: for it is the Spirite that quickeneth: and because thou quicknest, thou hast power of life: (for the Spirite is life) therfore thou liuest and art life, and substancially quickenest or giuest li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e to all thinges, or makest life in all thinges. But this Spirite and life which is in thee (O God) is not that which is in man, beastes, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, or other thinges created: but all thinges of the worlde created whatsoeuer they bee, and of what sorte souer they bee, doe receiue life and
<pb facs="12"/>
liue of that life, according to their kinde of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and as that life doth breathe power and giue power of liuely vertue and strength to thē, as the thinges be made able to receiue it. For, there must be <hi>Agens</hi> before there be <hi>Actio:</hi> so in all thinges there is proper being, life and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding or feeling, according to their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall capacities, which they doe receiue of being life and vnderstanding: which three be all one: that is, of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, three persons &amp; one God: in euery one of which three, all these three, vz. being life and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing are, by which all thinges are made. For, though certaine thinges be attributed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the seuerall persons, to bee proper to each of them in diuine thinges: yet it is to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed, to be the inseperable and agreeing ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the three or Trinitie together: for there is but one beginning, and one cause of all thinges that be: and parte of diuine thinges al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies is the same that is the whole.</p>
   <p>By these (O mercifull God) it may appeare how iniurious (and contrary to thine honour and glory, in creating of the worlde, and to thy prouidence ouer the creatures that thou hast made) is the heathnish Philosophy of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which admitteth nothing, that cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated: And also how falsely that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
      <pb facs="13"/>
maketh priuation to bee the third be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all naturall thinges: and that it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signeth no Author nor propagator vnto the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences or natures which a saith be eternall: and that, that Philosophie will not allowe any cause of their being besides their motion: and that some thinges that bee done are done without cause: as deliberation, &amp;c. From these and such other blinde and iniurious doctrine taught in that Philosophie (good and mercifull God) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer thy people and seruaunts. And (O most mercifull God) because the heathnish Phisicke of <hi>Galen,</hi> doth depende vppon that heathnish Philosophie of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (for where the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher endeth, there beginneth the Phisition) therfore is that Phisicke as false and iniurious to thine honor and glory, as is the Philosophie. For, that heathnish Phisicke (O God) doth not acknowledge the creation of man, whereby it doth not rightly knowe why he is <hi>Microcos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> or little worlde: which is the cause why they neither knowe his deseases rightly, neither prouide medicine for him aptly, nor prepare it fitly, neither minister it accordingly. This heathnish Philosophie and Phisicke, doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute thy workes (O God) to heate, colde, and such causes, which it calleth falsely naturall: So it teacheth, that natural heate doth chaūge
<pb facs="13"/>
meate receiued into mans stomacke into blood, flesh, bones, braines, sine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>es, vaines, and artires: And that the like meare receiued of a dogge, horse, beast, or birde, &amp;c. by heate of that beast or fowle, is turned into his flesh, blood, bones, &amp;c. Much vnlike vnto that which is in man: which operation and transmutation, in trueth commeth of thee, (O God) and not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nature of heate: and whereby in seeking for like cure in such defects, their Phisicke must needes erre, in not seeking helpe at thy handes, nor praying to thee, nor giue thankes to thee: No more doth that heathnish Philosophie and Phisicke acknowledge, that all seedes did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by thy diuine worde the power of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, of transplantation, the essence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: of which, all Philosophie, Phisicke, and Alchimie doth consist: Therefore they must needes erre, both in the cause &amp; effects of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the great worlde and in the little world.</p>
   <p>Likewise, because the heathnish Philosophie doth not knowe out of thy worde, that thou (O God) hast made all thinges in weight, number, and measure, therefore that Phisicke doth not knowe the cause nor cure of those deseases that bee either originally or inflicted into the inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parte of man <hi>Anima</hi> or <hi>Limbus,</hi> nor to helpe them: which error <hi>Plato</hi> reproued in the
<pb facs="14"/>
Greeke Phisitiōs long ago which <hi>Plato</hi> taught, that <hi>Anima curat corpus.</hi> And because the heathnish Philosophie doth attribute the cause of thinges to dead qualities, of heate, cold, &amp;c. and not to the liuely vertues and powers in thinges, therefore that heathnish Phisicke see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by like dead qualities, to cure liuely and mechanicall spirites: And because they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not, that deseases doe proceede of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall spirites and tinctures of impure see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ioyned to the pure by thy curse, O iust God, therefore they seeke not their medicines in the pure seedes. And because (O mercisull God) the heathnish Phisicke and the heathnish Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie doth not acknowledge, that it is thy power and vertue that bringeth forth all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that growe, and that thy working power doth preserue and maintaine all thinges: and that it is thy curing vertue that helpeth and cureth all deseases, greeses and infirmities, by such meanes as it pleaseth thee, or without meanes: therefore they cleaue fast to their false imagined naturall causes and meanes of helpe, forgetting thee: whereby many of them become Atheists. And because the heathnish Phisick of <hi>Galen,</hi> doth not knowe how thou (O God) hast ordeyned all thinges in vnitie peace and concorde, therefore it seeketh the cure in duali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="14"/>
and contrarietie. To bee short, because (O most merciful God) the heathnish Phisick doth not knowe that the purest, best, and medicina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parte of each thing is in his Center, therfore it neither doth seeke, neither haue his fauorers learned, nor doe knowe, how to finde that pure parte, nor to separate the pure from the impure: they cannot digest, nor make ripe that is rawe: they cannot chaunge sower into sweete: they cannot mittigate the lothsomnesse of heates, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, smelles, coagulations, &amp;c. neither make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny medicine volatile: For which cause, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe they not knowe the power of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall spirites, by meanes of their subtiltie, finesse, pearcing, and moueablenesse: neither do they knowe the finesse and pearcing, by meanes of separation of thinges mixt with them: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the separaetion by meanes of digestion and circulation: wherefore, they doe not knowe how the mechanicall spirites of deseases doe differ among them selues, and one from an other in power, pearcing, moueablenesse, finesse, grosnesse, in easie or vneasie resolution and alteration, and such like tokens: whereby they are ignoraunt of the true causes of the pangs, fits, and passions of deseases: and how and in what maner, bodies and partes of bodies doe differ one from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and among themselues. For, seedes do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb facs="15"/>
in partes of the body: and as the seedes doe differ, so the bodies and partes of the bodies doe differ one from an other, and their natures and properties: of which difference of the seedes cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the difference of the mechanicall spirites conteyned in them, in which the giftes and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the seedes doe florish. Likewise, might they know of the fits, panges, and passions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, the difference of the seedes, and of the fruites of the seedes being knowne, the seedes or rootes of deseases are knowne: euen as the Peare tree is by the Peare: because the fruites, vz. the panges, fits, passions, and maner of the deseases, are brought forth like to the rootes. Neither haue they any skill to reiect the Bynary, and to bring the Ternary, to the simplicitie of vnitie, where by the medicines may bee purged from their carcases and impediments: and the spirit <hi>Anima,</hi> be brought out of darknesse into light: by meanes whereof, the corrupt body of man may bee so purged, and purified, that the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled minde and oppressed memorie may bee quickned and releeued, by thy gift (O God) and be made more able to vse the talent by thee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

   <p>
      <pb facs="15"/>Because (O most mercifull God) I doe finde these faultes and such like in the heathnish Philosophie and heathnish Phisicke, I do know that by the fauorers and followers of that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie and Phisicke, I shalbe mocked, laughed at, had in derision, and my sayinges and words shalbe wrested, racked, writhed, dismembered, pulled from their partes, and turned from their right sence and meaning. And the more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull the aduersaries be in the true Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie and Phisick, and withall wilfull, the more busie (O God) wil they be to replye with taunts, quippes, scoffes, and gibes: but such deserue no place nor time of answere. Wherefore, O most wise God, author of all wisedome, I pray thee instruct thy people and seruaunts in the true Philosophie and Phisick: and open the eyes and mollifie the hearts of the followers of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, that they may see and followe the same for thine honor &amp; glory▪ And from lying lippes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull tongue, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me O God.</p>
