      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hilest J desired to congratulate your happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with some worthy present; I fell vpon this: which I dare not onely offer, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend; the royallest Philosopher and wisest King, giuing you those precepts, which the Spirit of God gaue him. The matter is all his: nothing is mine, but the method, which I doe willingly submit to censure. In that, hee could not erre: in this, J cannot but haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, either in Art, or application, or sense, or disorder, or defect: yet not wilfully. I haue meant it well, and faithfully to the Church of God, and to your Honour, as one of her great hopes. If any man shall cauill, that I haue gone about to correct <hi>Salomons</hi> order, or to controule <hi>Ezekias</hi> seruants: I complaine both of his charity, and wisdome; and appeale to more lawfull iudgement. Let him as well say, that euery Concordance peruerts the Text. J haue onely endeuoured to be the common place-booke of that great King, and to referre his Diuine rules to their heads, for more ease of finding,
<pb n="204" facs="108"/> for better memory, for readier vse. See how that God, whose wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome thought good to bereaue mankinde of <hi>Salomons</hi> profound Commentaries of Nature, hath reserued these his Diuine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, to out-liue the world; as knowing, that those would but feed mans curiositie, these would both direct his life, and iudge it. He hath not done this without expectation of our good, and glory to himselfe: which if we answer, the gaine is ours. J know how little need there is, either to intreat your Lordships acceptation, or to aduise your vse. It is enough to haue humbly presented them to your hands, and through them to the Church: the desire of whose good is my good; yea, my recompence and glory. The same God, whose hand hath led and returned you in safetie, from all forraine euils, guide your waies at home, and graciously increase you in the ground of all true honour, Goodnesse. My praiers shall euer follow you:</p>
