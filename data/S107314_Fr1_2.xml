      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OƲR most excellent Maiestie being graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pleased to reade and approoue the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Copie of that J haue now printed, and withall to declare your princely pleasure (sufficient warrant) for publishing the same, J haue thought meete in all humblenesse of dutie to your Maiestie, and in all truth of zeale to my countrey, by this meanes to endeuour
<pb facs="3"/> to resolue them which doubted, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them which denied, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them which applauded the most happie intended Vnion of your Highnes two most famous kingdomes of England and Scotland. J was not ignorant that the copies of the obiections against it, were this Tearme caried into most parts of those your Maiesties Realmes (and I suppose also beyond the seas) which might in time without answer seeme to preiudice your Maiesties honor vniustly with scandale abroade and murmure at home. Therefore though I be most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to publish to the world my meane vnderstanding in a matter of such graue consideration and great consequence, yet haue I rather chosen to hazard my poore credit subiect to each sensure, then suffer
<pb facs="3"/> a cause in its owne worth so precious, to sustaine wrong by generall silence: for obiections are of force, where no answer doth refute. Onely I humbly craue your Highnesse pardon for my bold presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and will euermore with hands and heart lift vp to heauen, pray to God for the preseruation of your gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, and of your royall issue, in all honor, health and happinesse.</p>
