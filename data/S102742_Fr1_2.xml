   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER: WILLIAM FVLKE WISHETH GRACE AND PEACE from God the father, and from our Lord Iesus Christ.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE great bragges that vvere made by diuers Papistes of this treatise of Purgatory that it vvas vnansvver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, vvere so vntollerable, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine of my godly friendes vvere moued thereby, to sende the booke to me, desiring me to shape an aunsvvere vnto it. But vvhen I had readde it ouer, and founde therein in deed much nevv ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, yet nothing else but the olde fonde kinde of reasoning, I vvas altogether vnvvilling to deale vvith it, both because there hath bene so much already vvritten of that argument, and for that I thought, that our contrymen vvere novv, as vvel by reading of that vvhich hath ben vvrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before, as also by continuall preaching against that absurde doctrine, sufficiently dissvvaded from that blaspemous heresie of Purgatory. But vvhē this excuse, or any other that I could bring, vvoulde not satisfie there ernest desier, vvho im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunatly
<pb facs="4"/>
still vrged me to take the matter in hand, &amp; that I had once againe perused the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, I began to thinke othervvise of the vvhole case, then I did before. I considered that many there vvere, vvhich perhaps had not seene, and many also that vvoulde not reade, such bookes as haue bene vvritten in times past of this question, &amp; that some also vvere so simple, that they could not discerne this nevv disguised defence of the Catholike churches doctrine, from the olde drousie dreame of popish Purgatory. VVherefore if any one of these, or any other that shall voutsalfe to reade this ansvvere, might therby either be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in trueth, or reclaymed from error: I began to thinke it vvere sufficient cause for me to take the paines, and the paines so taken to be vvel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stovved. Againe vvhen I remembred the spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rayling, and the most disdainefull arrogance of <hi>Allen</hi> him selfe, together vvith the presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous boasting, and vaine confidence, that some of his friends haue in his vvriting: I cōfesse it kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that smal zeale of godlines that is in me, both to meinteine the common hope of Christians, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the insolent assaultes of so malicious and proud an aduersary, and also to discouer the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie &amp; feeblenesse of that fortres, vvhich these vvillfully blinde Papistes do vaunt to be inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb facs="4"/>
In vvhich doinge I haue vsed great breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, not onely by a naturall inclination, vvherby I loue to be short, in any thing that I vvright: but also because my friendes vrged me, to dispatch it vvith so great expedition. And yet in this short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, I trust I haue not omitted any thing, that hath any shadovv of reason or shevv of matter in it, but that I haue sufficiently discharged it: as the diligent and attentiue reader, I hope vvill confesse no lesse. Hovv be it neither my hast in finishing, nor my friendes diligence in soliciting, vvas so great, but the slacknesse and vntovvard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of some Printers vvas much more. For vvhere as it vvas ended &amp; authorized almost tvvo yeares a goe, yet it hath stayed hetherto, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a godly and learned brother, vvho vvas once purposed to haue aunsvvered the same him selfe, and colde full vvell and substantially haue acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him selfe there in, if other busines had not hindred him, moued of godly zeale, hath novv at the last vndertaken the printing thereof, and brought it to this passe as you see. I hearde of late also of a third man, vvhich had learnedly begon the aunsvvering of this booke, hovv so euer he vvas letted from accomplishing the same. But hovv so euer Satan hath hether to hindred the setting abroade of this aunsvvere, yet God hath
<pb facs="5"/>
novv at the length brought it forth: I doubte not but to his glorie and the confusion of Satan in his membres the Papistes.</p>
   <p>I haue thought good also to ioygne vnto this vvorke, an other short treatise that hath lyen by me these eight or nine yeares, vvritten at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of a godly and learned friende of mine, in aunsvvere to a proude challenge of the Papist a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Protestāt vvhich though at the first &amp; many yeares after, I determined not to publish, supposing the same challenge to haue ben priuate, or in fevv mens handes, yet novv of late, that I haue seen it in diuerse godly Gentlemens handes, to vvhome it hath bene deliuered by Papistes, be like to peruert them, and of vvhome also I haue bene desired to ansvvere it, &amp; am further credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly informed, that the same is in printe, &amp; estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of many ignorant Papistes to be so vnaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svverable, that although it be protested by Gētle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of great vvorshippe and credit, that they haue seene the aunsvvere thereof in vvriting, yet they vvill not beleue, that any man dare set his penne to the paper, once to attempt the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I haue thought beste to putte it in printe as it vvas vvritten at the first. Nothing doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by Gods helpe, but I shalbe able to stande to that defence if the challenger vvill proceede to
<pb facs="5"/>
meinteine his challenge any longer. That I haue copled it vvith the aunsvvere vnto <hi>M. Allens booke,</hi> is because I doe greatly suspect, that he vvas the authour thereof, for the similitude of the stiles and of the stomakes in both, at the least I trust I doe him no vvronge, to suppose him to be so stout a champion. And thus I committe the Christian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the direction of Gods spirite vvho voutsalfe to lead thee into all truth for Christes sake. Amen.</p>
