   <p>I Haue many tymes complay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned most gentyll reder / that I was agreued with the loue and fauour of my frēdes / the whiche (nat with standyng that I am a lyue, and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande the cōtrarie) do vulgate and put forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode suche trifils as I wrote whā I was yōge to exercise my style, nat thȳkyng that they shuld be spredde abrode and common for euery man to haue: wherin I am so moche more vnhappye / that they be spredde and come forth in this most happy tyme and season, where, if they had come to lyghte whan they were fyrste compyled and made, they shuld nat haue ben so moche subiecte to mennes dispreyses and derisions. Nowe they be redde / as they were made of an aged mā / the whiche I compiled whan I was yonge / nat for that entente: and they be redde in this tyme / whiche hath dyuers men of excellent lernyng &amp; great vnderstandyng. Whilom whan I was scantly .xx. yeres of age / at the desyre &amp; instance of a certayne man called Theodorike / the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che yet lyueth / I wrote a pystill / by the whiche


<pb facs="4"/>
his entent was to call his nephewe Ioyce to the felowshippe of his lyfe. To this pistill often ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes copied and spredde al about / they haue put my name / where as I haue no nephewe that is called Ioyce. I wrote hit for an other mans entent and purpose: And as it selfe doth openly expresse / I wrote hit negligentlye for my passe tyme / vsynge no studie nor exquisite argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: nor also to I was nat than enstructed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of good auctours. And openly they thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to put it in printe / except that I wolde cause it to be printed. So I redde it ouer / and whan I had changed a fewe wordes / I was contente hit shulde be printed. Thus I suppose hit wyll come to passe at lengthe / that I shall forgo the loue that I haue to the folyshnesse and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyls of my youth. Fare well good reder / and if thou rede it / rede it with forgyuenesse / &amp; so rede it / as writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for an other mans entent and purpose.</p>
