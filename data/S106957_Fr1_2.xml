Wherefore your Highnesse (being <hi>Vnctus in regem &amp; sacerdotem cum vnguento laetitiae super omnes terrae reges socios tuos)</hi> fitly resemble this bright Planet in his cleerest Maiestie; euen as that most sacred Psalmist King <hi>Dauid</hi> also, both for your Poeticall faculties, as in respect of your diuine Priest-hood, and chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, hauing by good experience (more then any man liuing euer did) tasted of the wonderfull wisedome and loue of God; who by such strange wayes surpassing humane reason, hath wrought out your Graces fortune in the weale of vs your louing and loyall subiects, farre beyond all the wily machinations, plots, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of men, which haue (as your Royaltie well knoweth) beene manifoldly frustrated; that it might bee performed which God had ordained and promised by the mouthes of diuers sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying Augers, to perfect and establish in your seede the true try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant and vniuersall Christian Monarchie. Howbeit as no man liuing can haue a sweeter taste or cleerer declaration of Gods vnspeakable power (beyond all the soundest counsels &amp; resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our mortal Princes) then your Grace hath had in all actions; considering the strange meanes that hath been wrought by God through the plots of men destined to other purposes, to make your name glorious, and that your royall seede might inherite this Empire: so neede wee not doubt but that like a good Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, your Maiestie (as it hath already graciously begun the cure of some small diseases in this kingdome, which God onely left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your gacious wisedome, that the whole body might be kept cleane and at ease) shall auspiciously continue the same, to be the same vnder the golden rodde of your right royall posteritie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, by strong purgation and correction of the proud, cholle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, and melancholick humors thereof, which is the true methode of a kingly Phisition, and shall doubtlesly bring the head and whole bodie to perfect peace, and health.</p>

Against the Sunne (vpon which no reasonable creature can stedfastly fixe his mortall eyes, least they be dazeled, infeebled, or blinded with the pretious cleeretie thereof (being another type of sacred Maiestie) that imperiall bird soueraigning ouer the swift fethered creatures of the ayre by nature opposeth his sight: as <hi>Orus Apollo</hi> writeth in his hieroglyphiks, how the Sages of Aegypt and Chaldaean Priests (whē they would signifie diuine power, humane Empire, preheminence, blood, or victorie) did pourtraict an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle. What miracles he findeth through his stedfast, sharpe, and penetrating inspection within that sanctified Orbe of bright ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, may be referred to those misticall naturallists, which in the Metaphysicall cardes of their reason haue obscurely shadowed those things, that by mythologies are out of many curious heades from farre shot at, by some neere hit, and by very few truely tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. <hi>Caius Iul. Caesar</hi> (to whom this Land with others contributed) gaue in his ensigne of golde, a blacke Eagle perpendicularly mounting: which <hi>Plinie</hi> noteth in the nature of that bird. For it is written, that ouer <hi>Caesars</hi> Hoasts when he marched to fight, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Rauens and Vultures did houer, and that two Crowes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiously with their wings and tallons eager in combination, strooke at his Beuer; wherupon auspiciously came an Eagle which (combating against their violence) slewe them both; and then immediatly perched vpon his imperiall crest. This ominous prodigie by the Augers was interpreted sinisterly, that <hi>Caesars</hi> insuing gouernment should be tyrannous: since which time the Romane Emperors haue alwayes borne in their ensignes that roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bird, with which fortunately spreading his wings against their enemies, the Romanes did generally tryumph in many victories, and conquests. This Eagle also viuely representeth vnto vs, your Maiesties person, being onely your Highnesses scepter-bearing bird, with siluer fethers; which with his auspicious wings sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doweth the crownes of this Britaine Monarchie with peace of soule and bodie rooted in your blessed posteritie for euer. Vpon earth next to the Sunne and ayre, that aufull Magistrate (if of his Maiestie men may so terme the Lyon, bearing the scheme and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of magnanimitie, which hath dominion ouer foure-footed beasts) is another portly representation of a perfect Prince: for

Vigilancie (being another right royall garbe of a carefull prince) was portended by the picture of alyons head; forsomuch as that beast onely sleepeth with his eyes open: <hi>Qui tanquam sol patenti ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neoquèoculo</hi>

For why not much more fitly might the comparison of Kings with Eagles then with base Foxes haue sorted, if that imperiall birde which in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position with his eye-brightnesse amiably looketh into the sun, can search, and penerate into the perfection of wisedome and knowledge, being figurately shadowed in Phoebus or Apollo, bearing also with him the thunderbolts of Iupiter (who mystical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reueileth soueraigne Maiestie) to grinde, burne, and consume into powder the violence of his enemies? semblably me seemeth, that there should not be found any such difference in the state and condition of Princes, which the subtile Italian Sanazar made of a Pope in his time; that he was <hi>Bonus Princeps &amp; malus vir:</hi> because he knew well how to gouerne, and did rule the people well, hauing
<pb facs="5"/>
no proper facultie (by moderation of his owne appetites) to bee good vnto himselfe; for as <hi>Cicero</hi> citeth it out of <hi>Ennius, Nequicquam sapere sapientem, qui sibiipsiprodesse nequierit:</hi> (being intended there by the minde onely) so certainely cannot any Prince be verely good vnto himselfe, if he doe not gouerne his flocke (which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of himselfe) in the feare of God and exercise of Iustice: whence it was that <hi>Homer</hi> termed <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in one place, <gap reason="foreign">

      </gap>: aswell for the pastorall charge, as for the prudent counsell and assiduitie required in him towards that function. Sanctitie &amp; Iustice therefore (as I first said) by the propagation, corroboration, and aeternization of all crowns and Monarchies, are the two maine pillars of principalitie; being those inseperable adiuncts of your right royall Maiesties lawfull and victorious quadruple crowne of Great Brittaine, France, and Ireland, composed of the 4. cardinall vertues, which in this ensuing myrrour, framed out of the 4. immediate ministers or columnes rather of kingly Maiestie, with all humble dutie subiecting thē im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polished as they be, to your princely eyes, I present to your royall hands, vnder a special pardō for my boldnes in daring as a poore vnlearned Scholler (which offereth his ignorance in some rude exercise vnto his learned Schoole-master) to trouble your sacred Maiestie with these imperfections. Howbeit, as euery man which writeth ought to rest vpon &amp; leane vnto the grace of his Patrone; so can it not choose, but that hauing chosen so gracious a Patrone, farre exceeding all other in goodnes, I shall finde more true grace and beneficence out of your royall nature, for this one Caracter of my bounden dutie respected by such a Soueraigne, then by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolence of any subiect And therefore I presumed to your high Grace, being the Castalian spring head (which the Greek Sages did say to be patronized by that bright Lord of wisdome &amp; Poetrie) thinking there (after my labours) to refresh my troubled sences: where though vnworthy to tast, yet shal I receiue some ingenuous alacritie, by seeing that pure &amp; preciously-purling current. And that I may the more to my consolation contemplate the royall sun-shine and serenitie which enuironeth your sacred temples (though your Grace lay not apart the beames of your Maiestie) yet vouchsafe I beseech, with your diuine annointed hands to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
<pb facs="5"/>
these eyes of your humble subiect with the balmie dew of your gracious beneuolence, that I may bee the better inabled to looke vpon that consecrated Orbe of true maiestie; for had I been so timerous or faint, as in the regard of the vnworthinesse of my Booke protected the same by some priuate friend: then had I somewhat withdrawen from worth of the matter, which (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the methode and disposition thereof deserueth) doth also merite a royall Master, and had miscarried in the manner of my proceeding also: thinking that because these foure insuing estates immediately ministring vnder all crownes in euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, are protected by royall soueranitie, your Grace was fittest also to patronize these my simple studies wholy conuersing in the properties and attributes of those Offices; which shall bee most highly honoured by the maiesticall protection of such a vertuous King, to his poore subiects exceeding comfort. My consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration therefore was, that your Highnesse out of the Princely nature, which God with your Essence hath infused, would deigne so simple present of a poore Scholler, with the beneuolence which your Grace natiuely doth extend to learning: and that being hereafter published vnder that high Title many learned eyes, and curious fingers (not so much for the matter &amp; forme of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, as for the Maiestie patronizing it) would peruse these yong rules in this vnperfect accedence to gouernment, and percase beare them through diuers of your Maiesties Kingdomes.</p>
   <p>I haue also through my whole discourse (as occasiō serued) in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places made a continuall Apostrophe to your Maiestie, which I beseech your Highnes (euē as it is in sinceritie) so to refer it vnto the true meaning of my most dutifull &amp; immaculate hart towards your Grace, and not to any vaine singularitie, nor presumption in my self. The God of al true light cōtinue that illumination, bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and wisedom, which appeareth in your true graces, by that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Sun; confirme that piercing inspection, apprehension, &amp; prenotion of all princely deuises, wisdoms &amp; practises, which may be bent in opposition to your Maiestie by forren kings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyphered in that imperial Eagle; &amp; corroborate that true fortitude to the confusion of Gods &amp; of your Highnesses enemies, which is expressed in the royal Lyon; so that your kingdoms being sustei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, amplefied, &amp; conserued by Iustice, prudence &amp; fortitude frō

posteritie to posteritie through many generations, so long as it shall please God euenly to susteine this earth in her owne place within the firmaments, such serenitie may beame forth from your gracious wisedome; as foreuer may moue the peoples hearts of these your Kingdomes, of all your confederates and contributo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to daunce inwardly with praise and thankefulnesse vnto God, for that blessing which through your Graces speciall goodnesse infinitely succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to Gods people vnder your imperiall Scepter.</p>
