      <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Nvvise much vvere I beeing base and barren, if I thought to escape that which <hi>Homer</hi> that sweete and sugred Mecaenas of Greece might in no wise auoyde. Simple were I to seeke to auoyde that which the wisest and the learnedst <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Architas,</hi> coulde not shunne: therefore euen as the <hi>Rhodians</hi> and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in the games of <hi>Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> were taunted of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> the one for their brauerie, the other for their raggednesse: so these Cinikes sortes finde faulte with the good aswell as the badde. <hi>Lucullus</hi> a noble Romane demaunded of the Philosopher <hi>Seneca,</hi> what best he might doe to please <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour, and not to offende the common people, had in aunswere, to doe much seruice vnto Princes, and to vse little taulke, and to shewe humanitie vnto the commons: Knowing well gentle Reader, how ready the most part are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the learned, and hovv fewe are willing to excuse the ignorant, I am contented rather to be reprehended for my good will in penning this pilgrimage of Princes, than to be commended by that vvhich may prooue my ydle lyfe by silence. Being mindefull of the youth of Egypt how they shoulde make account vnto their magistrates of paine and trauell, most willing to accomplish some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might discharge the same, I tooke this laboure in hande, in that, that I coulde to the vttermost to beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite my countrie, to pleasure my friendes, and to shewe my selfe more willing than able in performing the same: and though I in my rashenesse presume to write of the liues of Princes, yet I trust in gathering the fragments &amp; broken sentences, as a beginning vnto others that are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stored, it vvill be of the vvise and learned considered, though of others defamed and taunted. For there is no

booke sayth <hi>Plini</hi> so simple, but it profiteth some body, for in bookes sayde <hi>Chilo</hi> the Philosopher are the fame of vvorthie men eternized, and the veritie of thinges etere vnknovvne wvritten, vvhich tvvo thinges neyther time can consume, nor fortune destroy, and for this cause were the bones of <hi>Homer</hi> sought and contended for of seuen Cities in Greece to be buried and kept as a monument of so great a vvriter, and for this vvas <hi>Euripides</hi> dying in <hi>Macedonia</hi> sent for by embassadors of <hi>Athens,</hi> to bee hadde in memorie as a prayse vnto <hi>Athens</hi> by his buriall For the Greekes supposed the greatest honour of all to haue educated such men as vvere studious and carefull for their countrie. For greater is the attempt of any simple booke writer to hazarde himselfe to present perill to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with diuers men with a pen in his hande, then that that valiaunt <hi>Perithus</hi> with <hi>Cerberus,</hi> or <hi>Theseus</hi> vvith <hi>Minotaurus,</hi> yea, or <hi>Hercules</hi> with <hi>Antheús,</hi> iollie champions vvith swordes drawne: for that they fought vvith one a peece, and that before their faces, &amp; the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple writer with thousandes, and they behinde his backe slaunder him. <hi>Architas</hi> the Philosopher, whome the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> made a general in their warres sixe seueral times, he I saye vvas in no such daungers in his vvarres, as hee was resisted for his rules and lawes in <hi>Tarentum. Plato</hi> vvas not in such perill at the besieging of <hi>Tanagra,</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi> amongst all his enimies, as he vvas enuied in Greece by <hi>Zenophon</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> his ovvne schollers by his Philosophie. Neyther vvas <hi>Socrates</hi> in such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarde of life being in armes in <hi>Delphos,</hi> as he vvas in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> by vvriting of bookes put to death by the Greekes. <hi>Zeno</hi> the poore Philosopher coulde resist the violence of the great king <hi>Antigonus</hi> &amp; <hi>Demosthenes</hi> could vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the force of <hi>Philip,</hi> and yet neyther of them coulde auoyde the snares of those that defamed their labour, enuied their diligence in vvriting and making of bookes.

Simple men must not therefore be discomfited to vvrite bicause the vvise and learned vvere herein euill spoken: For the <hi>Gimnosophistes</hi> in India, the <hi>Prophetes</hi> in Egypt, the Sages in <hi>Persea,</hi> the <hi>Ephori</hi> in <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> in <hi>Babilon,</hi> and the <hi>Philosophers</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> are novv more famous and renovvmed being deade, then they being a liue vvere enuied and slaundered, their vvritinges and bookes more read novve, than alovved or knovvne then, they rtrauell novve is commended, though their liues then vvere despised.

VVherfore crauing the good vvill of the learned reader as a bovvlster and defence to my simple trauell, I ende, vvishing that both the Printers faultes and mine might lesse mooue occasions of offence.</p>
