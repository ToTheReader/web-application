   <head>To the world.</head>
   <p>IF in the depth of my intyre affection, long borne
to the honored house of the <hi>Cecils,</hi> I take vpon me
plainely to set downe, according to my simple vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
the honorable augmented dignities of
the late deceased Earle of Salisbury, and therin offend
some peremtory censurers, I lay the fault vpon my
presuming loue, and make it my priuiledge of excuse.
The temporizing world (I know) full of enuy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
&amp; vnkindnesse, hath nursed vp fame-killing
falshood (the greatest enemy to naked truth) (not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lewing
true worth) clamerously to wrong this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertfull
statist, by detracting from his honor, times
applauding graces, a cankering deisease (after death)
subiect to greatnesse: but let blacke mouthed enuy be
of a more fauorable carriage, for inocent truth before
the worlds broad eye stands combatant, and will asu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
defend, his honorable deseruings from his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
disparrages, Fame I see stands ready prest to giue
the world notice of his worlds late aduancements,
first, he had a time, a happy time, I may say, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
in his prime of youth, won him a multitude of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
friends, to continew to his age: for beeing
(euen but in the bloome) of a vertuous inclination,
he so tyed his Princes affection to his succeeding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
that hee obtayned by instruction of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Lord <hi>William Burleigh</hi> the perfect rules of a
well gouerned Statist. Now heare to make a short
florish how by degrees hee climbed to the top of all
these his high dignified titles and places of honour,
he thus fortunatly proceeded: first vnto the age of six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeares, he was onely tutord vnder his father and
in his fathers house, without any other education: at
<pb facs="4"/>
which time of his age, by his virtuous mothers will
and free guift, of thirty pounds yearely giuen to a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in Cambridge, he was sent in person to carry it,
and be the presentor of the same him-selfe, where at
that young age he commenced, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of schooles, and was made maister of Art, after
this, in short time, by the fauour of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
hee was in the presence of the state royall, created
Knight at Theobalds, and immediatly to his greater
aduancements, in the yeare of our Lord. 1588.
hee was sent ouer into France to accompany our
then English Ambassador, <hi>Henry</hi> the great Earle of
Darby, a grace fitting so noble a spirit as he was like
to be, Englands buisinesse there ended, hee returned
and in short time after, merited by his wel deseruing
indeuours, many court honours, as vnder Secretary to
Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> then principal Secretary of Estate,
then one of the Queenes Maiesties most honorable
priuy Councell, these dignified places, in the eye of
his honored father, were put vnto his charge, which
hee so wisely caried, that hee obtained euen the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
grace of the multitude, in which authorities he
bore himselfe in the worlds equall balance, till the
death of his father, and then it pleased his gratious
Mistresse Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to bestow vpon him the
office of the Maister of Wards and liueries, which hee
inioyed with the rest, till the death of his said Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne:
but our now royall King, comming to this
his Imperiall kingdome, and looking into the worth
of this man, weakned not any of these his aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but added more strength to the same, by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him, first, a Barron, next a Vicecount, then an
<pb facs="5"/>
Earle, then Knight of the honorable order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
one of the Councell of Estate, and lastly Lord
High treasurer of England, the greatnesse of which
places, planted His renowne in the feelds of succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
times. I must not ouerpasse his Chancellorship
of the Vniuersity of Cambridge, that nurse of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decking
schollors, whose learned pens might let the
world know all his fame worthy actions, but time I
see proues vngratefull, and would haue his memory
buryed in forgetfulnesse. Awake sluggish muses, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake!
In his life might thousands of noble obiects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
wherein your noble spirits might towre high:
It is a task onely fitting rare pens, and not for me, the
worst of many thousands, to giue him that immortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which the basenesse of this worthlesse time will
hardly afford, honour him, kind schollers, with some
sonnets that liuing honored you, and cause him to
liue, in dispight of repining fate, This is the richest
Epithite my loue can bestow vpon him, he was borne
honorable, experience made him wise, educatiō lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and these were his honors, yet his cares were
great to maintaine them. He alwaies tooke nerest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his fauours such as were best aquainted with wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
secrets, I am loath to be long in my induction,
least you grow weary, therefore I heare make my pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
Wishing you to be contented, with my willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to please.</p>
