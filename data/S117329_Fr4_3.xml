   <head>A Post-script to <hi>Papists.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Eace and truth to as many of you as pertaine to God.) I am moued in conscience to deale with you, by this manner of writing, because of the false and slanderous reports which (I heare) some of your faction haue blazed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulged abroade, concerning the death of Mistresse <hi>Katherin Brettergh,</hi> a Christian Gentlewoman, whose life indeed was holy, and death most comfortable.</p>
   <p>It is no noueltie, or new thing, to heare a lye from a <hi>Papist,</hi> but rather a principle of your religion: Therefore if you pleade antiquitie, as a marke infallible to know your Church by, for that point tak't you: you haue it from the Diuell your father by<note place="margin">Iob. 8. 44.</note> tradition diabolicall, holding the same still in these succeeding ages so succinctly, that (for ought I know) you will not leaue it, till you be shut foorth of the heauenly <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and cast into <hi>Tophet,</hi> which is prepared<note place="margin">Reuel. 22. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>5</note> of old for liers and inchanters.</p>
   <p>Yet it pities me to thinke of some of your poore sillie seduced soules, how simple they be in Gods causes (and yet malicious) for


<pb facs="99"/>
the most of my popish neighbors (what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be I know not) flye but a very low pitch, being people altogether void of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wit, and ciuilitie. The furthest drift of their religion, is to say, <hi>the Pope is a good man:</hi> to say, <hi>it is safest to doe in religion as most doe: to thump hard their breasts when they pray: to crosse them when they meete a Protestant: and to spit out when they name the Diuell: to gallop ouer a Pater noster, or Ladies Psalter vpon their beades:</hi> and to say, <hi>it was a good world when Masse was vp, for then all things were cheape:</hi> finallie, some of them will say, <hi>I beleeue as my father beleeued (God baue mercie on his sweete soule) and I hope to go to him when I die).</hi> This is the very length, broadth, and depth of most part of Popery where I dwell: euery one can reach this marke, and few can goe beyond it.</p>
   <p>Another opinion of these sottish people, is to say: <hi>If a man dye like a lambe, and passe out of the world like a bird in a shell, he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely saued,</hi> although neither holines were in his life, nor God in his mouth; grace in heart, nor yet repentāce, faith, or feeling at his death. Such blockish ends, a reuerend man doth count fearefull, saying, <hi>such men</hi>

      <hi>liker beasts, then Christians.</hi> Againe, if the violence of any disease stirre vp impatience in a mū at his death, straight say our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Papists, <hi>there is a iudgement of God, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing either to discouer an hypocrite, or plague a wicked man</hi> (especially, if they proteste the truth of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as this Gentlewoman did) then they cry, and shout; <hi>see the effect of this religion, see the end of these men:</hi> where<note place="margin">Maister Perkin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

   <p>It seemeth you Papists, or who els so euer doe iudge thus, are little acquainted with Scripturos▪ nor yet were euer of <hi>Salomons</hi> minde▪ who speaking of outward things happening to man, doth say, <hi>The same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
      <note place="margin">Eccle. 9. 1.</note>
      <hi>is to the iust, and to the wicked, both one to the pure and polluted. Dauid</hi> saw the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked without <hi>bands in their death, noit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>they troubled like other men,</hi> and yet were they ropnobates, and the children of Satan. But if you <hi>Bapists</hi> had <hi>Dauids</hi> spirit (which the Diuell would not that you had, for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> kingdome) you would iudge more charitably of Christians deaths (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie such whose liues were holy) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any outward accident that might happen: at the least you ought rather to


<pb facs="100"/>
mourne, and conceale it, then to laugh and deride▪ the same: for when <hi>Saul</hi> was dead<note place="margin">1. Sam. 31. 4. 5.</note> in mount <hi>Gilboa,</hi> who was a notorious wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, and his death fearefull indeede, for he killed himselfe, what did <hi>Dauid?</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, or lament? Though <hi>Saul</hi> in his life time was alwaies his deadly enemie, yet mourned hee and wept for <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> saying, <hi>Tell it not in</hi> Gath, <hi>nor publish it</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Sam. 1. 17. 18. 19. 20.</note>
      <hi>in the streetes of</hi> Askelon, <hi>least the daughters of the Philistims reioyce, and the vncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed triumph.</hi> This did <hi>Dauid,</hi> which was a man after Gods owne heart, though you (as it should seeme) rather delight to solace your selues with the falles and infirmities of Gods children, then once to be touched as feeling members of one bodie, with an inward sighing, and sorrow for the same.</p>
   <p>But now touching the death of this Gentlewoman, whereat some of your Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish faction haue bragged, as though an oracle had come from heauen to proue you Catholicks, and vs Hereticks: Blessed be God, and our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the Diuell and you are all deceiued, and God, euen our mightie <hi>Iehouah,</hi> hath you in derision,<note place="margin">Psal. 2. 4.</note> and shall laugh you to skorne, who hath not only frustrate your fond expectations,


<pb facs="100"/>
but made your follie manifest to all men. This Gentlewomans life being more holie, and her death more comfortable, then pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siblie any of yours can be, so long as you continue <hi>Papists.</hi> The trueth whereof, I haue compendiously set foorth in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent treatise following, as will be testified by persons of honester note and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then any of your generation. And thus for this time I end, praying God to forgiue you your sins, because you know not what you doe, and to open your eyes, that you may see your errors, and come out of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</p>
