Her <hi>Conception</hi> is Celestiall, her <hi>Birth,</hi> in Paradise, her <hi>education</hi> in Canaan, her <hi>foode</hi> Mannah, her <hi>habite</hi> righteousnes, her <hi>Armes,</hi> the Lambe, her <hi>children</hi> Saintes, her <hi>kinred</hi> Angels, her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation vpon <hi>Earth,</hi> is the Church militant, and in <hi>Heauen</hi> the Church triumphant. This poore <hi>Ladie</hi> hath euer yet liued by <hi>milke,</hi> which being drawne out of the two dugs of the Olde and Newe Testament, is called the <hi>syncere milke of the word of God:</hi> after which all her true children doe thirst, as after that foode which must nourish their soules.</p>
   <p>This Worde it was <hi>decreed</hi> by God the Father, <hi>preached</hi> by God the Sonne, <hi>inspired</hi> by God the holie Ghost, and by <hi>Angels, Prophets, Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Euangelists</hi> successiuely made knowne to the children of the Church. The Church of the <hi>Iewes</hi> knew it onely for a time, there he <hi>thew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his wayes vnto Iaakob, his statutes and ordinances vnto Israel.</hi> The Church of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> shall know it for euer: he dealeth now graciously with euery Nation, <hi>and the Heathen haue knowledge of his Lawes.</hi> True it is indeede, the <hi>Iewes</hi> haue the Bible, but by reason of that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine drawne before their eyes, they cannot see <hi>him,</hi> who is the ende of the Bible, there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence betweene them and vs.</p>
   <p>They (as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith) haue the <hi>bookes,</hi> wee the worde of <hi>those</hi> bookes: they the <hi>Prophets,</hi> wee the vnderstanding of the <hi>Prophets:</hi> they are <hi>killed</hi> by the Letter, we are <hi>quickened</hi> by the Spirite: They haue <hi>Barrabas</hi> the murtherer deliuered: to vs is deliuered <hi>CHRIST</hi> the Sonne of God. Iudas <hi>solde</hi> him, the Iewe <hi>bought</hi> him, the true Christian is the <hi>possessor</hi> of him, whom he <hi>findeth</hi> in this Word, <hi>feeleth</hi> in the Sacraments, and <hi>feedeth</hi> on in his heart by a liuely Faith. The <hi>antiquitie, necessitie, dignitie,</hi> and <hi>commoditie</hi> of Helie writte, if it were truely thought of as it should, would breede a greater <hi>loue</hi> to the reading of it, <hi>desire</hi> to the knowledge of it, and <hi>care</hi> to the practising of it, then is now a dayes in the most of the worlde. For <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> it is in part as ancient as the <hi>first</hi> Adam, and in whole, as olde as the <hi>second, in whome all the Promises contained in this booke are, Yea, and Amen.</hi> For <hi>necessitie,</hi> as needfull as the true knowledge of God, whome to knowe is eternall life. For <hi>dignitie,</hi> so greas that it alone must be called the Law of God, yea, that law then which no man can shewe a better to serue God by, or by which hee may better knowe his <hi>dutie</hi> to man. Compare wee this our Christian lawe with those of <hi>Lycurgus, Draco, Solon, Zaleucus, Numa Pompilius,</hi> Romane twelue tables themselues, which <hi>Cicero</hi> preferreth aboue all the bookes of Philosophers, and the difference will bee as great as the light

   <p>Againe, would we knowe the commoditie of the Word of God, <hi>Psalme, 19. 7 &amp;c.</hi> Dauid saith, the Law of the Lord is <hi>perfect,</hi> conuerting the soule, the <hi>Testimonie</hi> of the Lord is <hi>sure,</hi> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth wisedome to the simple the <hi>Precept</hi> of the Lord is <hi>pure</hi> and enlighteneth the eyes. The <hi>feare</hi> of the Lord is <hi>cleane,</hi> and endureth for euer: the <hi>iudgements</hi> of the Lorde are <hi>true,</hi> and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous altogether. They are more to bee <hi>desired</hi> then golde, yea, then much fine golde: <hi>Sweeter</hi> are they then the honie &amp; the honie combe. By them also is thy seruant made <hi>circumspect,</hi> &amp; in keeping of them is great reward. 2.

And surely if men now a dayes could lay aside <hi>curiosity</hi> in searching after things not meet, <hi>affection</hi> in louing and hating men too much, <hi>ambition</hi> in seeking their owne glorie, <hi>selfe-loue,</hi> in liking their owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions best, <hi>pertinacie</hi> in maintaining preconceited errors, and in a worde, <hi>preiudicate</hi> opinions of some mens gifts, and a <hi>popular</hi> following of most mens conceipts, and that bitter <hi>calumniation,</hi> which is vsed one against another; if men (I say) could lay aside these, and onely hearken what God doth say in his Worde, there would bee an ende of many Controuersies, which till then will neuer be without controuersie. The Prophet that hath a <hi>dreame,</hi> will tell a <hi>dreame:</hi> he that hath Gods <hi>word,</hi> will speake Gods <hi>word,</hi> Ierem. 23.

   <p>It is well obserued by <hi>Erasmus</hi> in his prefuce before <hi>Ireneus,</hi> that that holy father did onely with the <hi>weapons</hi> of the Scriptures encounter with the whole troupe of heretickes. The sung of <hi>Dauid</hi> against <hi>Goliah▪</hi> the sword of <hi>Goliah</hi> against the <hi>Philistines</hi> are not comparable to these weapons. The word of the Lord it is the <hi>sword</hi> of the spirit, wee must <hi>fight</hi> with it: the <hi>light</hi> of the soule, <hi>see</hi> by it: the <hi>guide</hi> of our life, <hi>walke</hi> by it: the <hi>fire</hi> of the Sanctuary, be <hi>warmed</hi> by it: the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of life be <hi>purged</hi> by it: the <hi>food</hi> of heauen, be nourished by it▪ the <hi>interpreter</hi> of Gods will, we must <hi>know</hi> him by it: the meanes of consolation be comforted by it: and that <hi>mallet</hi> to knocke out the braines of <hi>Antichrist▪</hi> we must euer haue it in our hands: If euer the <hi>sonne of Perdition</hi>

   <p>To the reading of this word, the <hi>Fathers,</hi> especially <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> in many places exhorteth the people; and <hi>Erasmus</hi> in his preface to the new Testament, protesting his dissent from such as would not haue priuate persons to reade the Bible, saith, that <hi>the Sunne in the firmament is not so commō as the Doctrine of Christ.</hi> No man euer hated this <hi>light,</hi> but either he that wanted yes to behold it, or feared the light to discouer his workes of darkenes. O then let vs reade this, and to <hi>reading</hi> adde meditation, to <hi>meditation</hi> prayer, to <hi>prayer</hi> humilitie, to <hi>humilitie</hi> an ayming at Gods glorie and our good, and to all a <hi>desire</hi> to turne Gods word into good workes. This euery word of God is pure▪ and is to be preferred before the golde of Ophir. And to the ende wee might all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it, there is set downe in the Bible all such varietie of learning as may giue content to each se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Reader; <hi>Histories</hi> for the <hi>Temporist, Philosophie</hi> for the <hi>Naturalist, Ethiques</hi> for the <hi>Moralist, Mysteries</hi> for the <hi>Artist,</hi> and <hi>languages</hi> for the <hi>Linguist.</hi> Heere is a <hi>Flood</hi> for the great Elephant to swimme in, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

Augustine the common <hi>Treasurie</hi> of all good things: Ambrose the <hi>Medicine</hi> of Mans salutation: Chrysostome a <hi>Salue</hi> against euery sore: Gregorie that <hi>Stone</hi> which killed Goliah: And Bernard saith, that <hi>whosoeuer faithfully and deuoutly doth sing the Psalmes, in a sort is in associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Angels:</hi> without which deuotion, (what Quirister soeuer) shall sing them in the Church, I may say vnto him as Augustine once saide to the singing men of his time, <hi>Plus placet Deo mugitus Boum, latratus Canum, grunnitus porcorum, hinnitus Equorum▪ quàm can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Clericorum luxuriantium:</hi> The <hi>bellowing</hi> of oxen, the <hi>barking</hi> of dogs▪ the <hi>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Now though euery Psalme be of speciall Obseruation; yet this one is especially remarkeable. It was penned by King <hi>Dauid,</hi> that <hi>sweete</hi> singer of Israel, it hath in euery verse a <hi>commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the word of God, it is <hi>artificially</hi> written, euery eight verses beginning in the Hebrue tongue, with one Letter of the Hebrue Alphabet: and the longest <hi>Meditation</hi> that euer Dauid had, either concerning Gods word or workes, it seemeth hee had it when he penned this Psalme▪ which the Iewes vsed as a Catechisme for their children To the ende this Psalme might bee vnderstood of all▪ it hath beene expounded by many worthie men, especially by that worthie man of God, M. Richard Greenham, memorable in our Church. It is pittie that all his meditations on this Psalme come not yet to light, but that in former editions about fortie verses were left vnexpounded.</p>
   <p>Now that godly man who hath the sale of his workes, was very desirous that there might bee an Exposition vpon euery verse, and to that purpose hath employed mee. And I finding the foure first verses expounded by a worthie <hi>Elisha,</hi> vpon whom the spirite of this <hi>Eliah</hi> doth rest, was bolde to set<note place="margin">M.

   <p>I remember that an ancient Father saith, <hi>Iudicem aditurus▪ patr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
