      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N these oure dayes whan the monimē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of soexcel lente wyttes so plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode, that therebye it maye ryght well be knowen, ther be ryghte manye not onely perfectlye seen in all humayne sciences, but in speciall, in the moste fyrme, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douted Christian religion: no doute there is greate cause vnto all good men, and to al suche as loue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, greatly to reioyse. And yet to followe these principal guides, and chiefe leaders not a fewe are put in dout: either for that y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> iudgementes of men be so various, and the wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
<pb facs="7"/>
of most part so froward, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> to vp hold either this opinion or y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>, I wot not whither it may seme lesse apt to receiue thanke, or more redy to daū ger of euil speach, &amp; extreme ieoper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Which thing of some men is so feared, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it boeth taketh away theyr wittes, &amp; wylles to do good, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore passe their life in silence. But if this mind should be to al that cā do wel, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is, that for feare of such diuer sitie in iudgement of al sorts of mē, they should leaue of to do such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit as they myght do, than myght it fortune to be a greate while, or euer the truth were spread abrod, and or knowledge should haue the vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of ignoraunce. Which thyng certaine persons encouraged by the spirit of God right wel perceiuyng, haue valiantly put forth thē selues, &amp; aduentured y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> daungerous charge of euil tonges, secretly regarding ra ther y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> right iudgemēt of a fewe, thā
<pb facs="7"/>
discōforted by obloquie &amp; euil spech of a great many. Thus dyd y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> noble Poet Horace, whan he was content with the assent of a few wel learned, to whom he recited his worckes, as appereth in his sermons. Thus do also nowe a dayes suche as seke not for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vaine praise of the multitude, but onelye to rest in y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> bosome of the wel learned. But sith talkyng there of is so cōmon, &amp; wittes so manye &amp; diuers, ther semeth to lacke nothig rather than a iudge to giue sentēce of this great diuersitie: which riseth not so much by douts in seculer sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as by sondry opinions in most waightie cōtrouersies of our faieth &amp; religion. Of these is nowe al mēs talke, I say they talke of diuinitye, yea the learned, &amp; the vnlearned, the woman as wel as the man, the rych w<seg rend="sup">e</seg> the pore. Unhappy be we christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an men if in this our religion, we be more vncertaine than were the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
<pb facs="8"/>
in their doctrine. What is more displeasant to man touching the bo dy than darknes, what to the mind more greuous thā ignoraūce? Thā if it be so, what can be on the contra rye side more pleasaūte than know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? which if yet we haue not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained beynge euen in the very last ende of the worlde, what hope is to be had of learnynge it, or by whom shuld it be taughte? God hath done his part, which syth y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> beginning of the world hath not ceassed to teache y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whole world by patriarkes, &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophetes, &amp; at last euen by hys owne son Iesus Christ al y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> that he wold mākind for to know mete for his saluacion: whyche doctrine, and learning is cōtained in the most ho ly bible. And for because y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thys say ing is worthy to be marked as a sa ing, whervpon our saluacion depē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, therfore it must nedes folowe, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the readyng of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> boke not only is
<pb facs="8"/>
profitable, but also moost necessary to al that desiar health euerlasting. The learning y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is contained therin hath his vndouted authour, god &amp; not man, &amp; therfore it must nedes be of great price, &amp; dignitye. And as it is so in dede, so nowe thankes be to God, it is moost plentifully shewed forth both by the preaching, &amp; wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges of moost godly, &amp; wel lerned men: whose iudgement ought to be vnto other lesse expert in scripture, as a certaine guide &amp; rule, to y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> true vnderstanding of it. Wherefore at the request of some of my frindes, &amp; for the profit of such as vnderstāde no latin, I toke in hand to translat the exposiciō of the sixte Chapter of Iohn, writen in the laten by y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> right excellente clarcke Iohn Brencius, and deuided into. x. Homelies or sermons. Thys I haue done more homelye than eligantlye, obseruing as nye as I coulde, the meanynge

If it please the Gentill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fauorablie to accepte thys my poore diligence, and that therby doeth come to the anye profite, I haue that I lo ked for▪ Al glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be to God for euer.
