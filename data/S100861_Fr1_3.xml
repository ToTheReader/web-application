   <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendly Reader; it were but labour in vaine to tell thee, why I made choice of this Epistle rather than another to to treat of. For are not all Preachers sowers? So that if they breake vp any little close, within the large pale that boundeth Gods great demaine, the holy letters, they cannot misse it, but keepe their compasse. Neither is it to any purpose to declare vnto thee, why these lines are now put to publike light. For, is not all the graine in Gods gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, good? fit for the market, and to be set to sale? For, to omit many reasons, this is the very truth; that as Prognosticators vsually write Almanackes, to and for that Climate wherein they be resident; so haue I made election of this portion, and now especially pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, for that place, where and amongst whom the Lord for a few yeares by the hand of his prouidence cast me. Wherefore I will the rather informe thee of my method, in this succeeding treatise, the which, is this and thus.</p>
   <p>In the first place (may it please thee to view it) thou shalt finde the text Logically into its parts resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uod; next the words plainly explicated, then a familiar Metaphrase, as we apprehend the sense, annexed: And
<pb facs="6"/> last of all, the seuerall doctrines arising thence, dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. And because ordinarily a deduct is to be drawne, not from one simple, but two Arguments at the least, as the<note place="margin">Rev. 10. 2,</note> the Angell is said to <hi>set one foote on the sea, another on the shore,</hi> we haue (one being in our text) for the better rise, borrowed a second from farre. But, vsuall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, either from the scope, and the connection; the words generally vnited, not particularly abstracted, the doctrines be collected. And for the heads, we haue set them downe with little or noe amplification at all. For, to me (I am sure) and to the Corrector, Printer, and Reader, (I iudge) it would, (had we done otherwise,) ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e beene more painfull, chargeable, and not much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. But we haue confirmed them at large: First, By Precept: Secondly, Example: Thirdly, Reasons: and last of all, we haue mixed our whole discourse, with fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and delightfull similitudes; for the better alluring out of the drouping affections, and the inclining of the froward will, both to embrace the truth, and put it in speedy execution. By Precept, vnderstand some proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equiualent to the doctrine propounded. By Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that which hath in it the force of a commaund. For, the act is concr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>e with the precept, and cannot except notionally be abstracted. For, euery good action effected, hath its rule by which it is guided. And by Reason, conceiue a third argument, in producing whereof, the point in hand is more strongly confirmed. For, as when two colours are controuerted, we fetch a light, hold that betwixt them, by which the better is the better discerned by the eye of the body: So, When truth is in suspence, in the producing of a third Argument, the which we call a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and disposing it with the doctrine in forme of a
<pb facs="6"/> Syllogisme, its the more conspicuous to the eie of our vnderstanding. And the reason we vse Reasons, is in that we are to deale with men who haue reason, but want faith. And vntill the iudgement be soundly convinced, the <hi>Wil</hi> will not be throughly reformed. For, as the needle guideth and maketh way for the thread; so doth the act of the faculty of the vnderstanding, direct the act of the faculty of the <hi>Will.</hi> And we haue vsed similitudes for diuers reasons. 1. For, they haue great force to convince the iudgement. 2. They allure the affections. 3. They bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the memorie. And 4. They bring many things to speedy remembrance we had long forgot. As the shooemaker with his skinne, draweth on a close shoe; the huswife with corne, calleth the chickens from vnder the wings of their damme; and the Dittie brings to minde the matter and author on't: so will a similitude draw doctrines into mens shallow vnderstanding, call out the dead affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and bring the truth to remembrance, committed to memorie long agone. And this one thing would I wish the man of God to take knowledge of, and to haue respect of, both in writing of bookes, and preaching of Sermons, first throughly to informe the iudgement, and then soundly to seeke to reforme the <hi>Will.</hi> Lay loade on that aboue all. For, with more ease may a man p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ynt out the truth to thousands, than perswade hundreds to practise it. For, the faculty of the <hi>Will,</hi> is the most corrupt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther▪ and the <hi>Will</hi> is an vnwilling agent to goe to worke. Similitudes therefore here be of good vse, and applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must soundly set it on. Furthermore, we haue, as the matter handled would affoord, vsed definitions dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, subdiuisions, trialls, motiues and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: all which be of great vse in their proper order.</p>
   <pb facs="7"/>
   <p>Finally, to our power, we haue endeuoured to comfort the feeble-minded, strengthen the weake, raise vp the declined christian, and pull downe the proud minde of man, breake his flinty heart, and convert him to God, by a close searching and insinuating application.</p>
   <p>And Gentle Reader, if any phrase in this treatise, seeme tart vnto thee, when we come to presse a point; why, I must giue thee to vnderstand, that our people are not like other people. For, it's well knowne, that, in all sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring and hauen townes (of which ours is not the least in our kingdome) there is such a concourse of all kinds of people from other countries, as dayly inhabitants; that we haue men, as of warre and worth, resolution and religion, fearing God, honouring the king, (the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whereof the good Lord increase an hundred times so many as they be, that the eares and eyes of all the world may heare and see them:) so haue we sinne and sinners of all sorts.</p>
   <p>With vs (if any where) thou maist finde old mother Ignorance, cloathed with the robes of the blacknesse of darknesse; hauing two vnnaturall (but, to her, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall) twinnes in her lappe, <hi>Profanesse and Superstition:</hi> and this is her daily Ditty; <hi>I sit as a Queene, I am no</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rev. 18. 7▪</note>
      <hi>widdow, I shall see no mourning,</hi> neither (let Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers prate what they please) will I euer be remoued. And we haue too, aged father <hi>Pride,</hi> cloathed in Purple, and fine linnen; who being drunke with wealth, as <hi>Lot,</hi> with wine, hath lien with his daughter Couetousnesse, committed incest, and she is deliuered of a monster, the which some call foxe-fur'd, Scarlet-robde, but I, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, remedilesse Vsury. This Ostrich can eat and digest any kinde of mettall, especially money. This Canniball,
<pb facs="7"/> like a pickrell in a pond, or sharke in the sea, the lesser fishes, deuoures the poorer sort, with a plausible, invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble consumption. The greatest Clerkes (now fie!) in our Kingdome, may, seuen times more, spit this strumpet in the face, yet she hath a whores forehead, and will not be ashamed.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Meager</hi> and <hi>Pale-face't enuie</hi> hath his <hi>roost</hi> with vs. He lookes like a Ghost wrapped in a winding sheete, or peeping out of a coffin: for, with the hot pursuite of spotlesse purity, innocent pietie, he hath so fret his flesh, and worne his spirits, that he is fallen into a neuer-to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be-cured deadly consumption. This insatiable cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, feedes on the tenderest corps, drinkes the purest blood, and still cryes for more, as <hi>Rachel</hi> did for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or else he will dye. And as <hi>risibilitie</hi> is an insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable adiunct to a reasonable creature: so is <hi>damning drunkennesse</hi> to these Cinque-ports. Therefore, we are sure of this guest. Sometimes, we haue met him staggering in the streetes, with long lockes, red eyes, wounds in his face, and a stinking breath flying from his mouth; and his attire, with spuing, falling, and tumbling in the mire, polluted from his felt to his foot. Many times he lyes speechlesse, yet when he speakes, its the very lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Hell.</p>
   <p>This Chymist, by a virtuall power and dayly habit, can turne bodies into barrels, men into beasts; and then, as the Diuels possessing the swine, carried them headlong into the riuer: so doth this Deuill soule or body wherein he resteth, into the gulfe of that sea, whose streames are fire and brimstone. We haue now and then disorder put in, who lying winde) or rather wine) bound, falles to wooing and wedding. He comes, as Sathan said of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb facs="8"/>
      <hi>from compassing the earth to and fro;</hi> and<note place="margin">Iob. 1. 7.</note> he marryes, not till death (according to the iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God and man) but a faire winde them depart. What shall I more say? We haue <hi>raging malice,</hi> and blind turbulent <hi>zeale,</hi> hanging like a Meteor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt heauen and earth, that, as an ill-couch't fire w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rke, lets fly at all.</p>
   <p>But hitherto we haue spoken in the abstract; we will now a little touch the concrete.</p>
   <p>We haue had with a crosse winde set sometimes on our shores, the vulgar <hi>Atheist,</hi> who saith in his heart, there is no God: and if in speech he professe him, yet in practice hee denies him. The proud trecherous purblind <hi>Papist,</hi> iust of that brotherhood (its to be fear'd) who erring from the true way stumbled on treason, and brake their neckes at <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne.</hi> Yet these spread their good deedes, as the Heauens ouer the North-pole, and hang their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, like the earth, vpon nothing. The Hominisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Godified <hi>Familist,</hi> who holds himselfe, if once full come, to be as perfect as <hi>Adam</hi> his father was in Paradise. And we say so too, but then hee must be considered, as hee was after his fall, not before it. The mutable newfangled <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> who will weare no weapons, haue all things common; yet wrangles with his brethren, whether hee is to be baptized on the head or heeles; for (a worthie reason) Christ, its said, washed his Disciples with water on the feete. The strict precise <hi>Separatist,</hi> censuring his equals, speaking ill of them in authoritie, whose vniust rent from our congregations, like the diuisions of <hi>Ruben, haue</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iudg. 5. 15.</note>
      <hi>made great thoughts of heart.</hi> And, to conclude,
<pb facs="8"/> (for I am too prolixe,) we haue had the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Wee haue seene, (and shall againe) the <hi>Dutch</hi> drinking, and our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish for company take their shares with them, vntill they began to <hi>sle-ecke en-de sny,</hi> that is stabbe and slash, that their blood and bowels runne about their heeles. If this, then was thus, as it was indeed, shall not the men of God draw forth the arrowes of Gods vengeance, set them in the noch, and with an angry countenance, let them rattle amidst the congregation? whet the two edged sword of the word, make it sharpe and keene, to the hewing of the body of sinne, and the shredding of such siewes of corruption asunder? As the Prophet said, <hi>Is this</hi>
