   <head>THE AVTHORS Induction.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen Sommer sweet, with all her pleasures past,</l>
      <l>And leaues began to leaue the shadie tree,</l>
      <l>The winter cold encreased on full fast,</l>
      <l>And time of yeare to sadnes moued me:</l>
      <l>For moistie blasts not halfe so mirthfull be,</l>
      <l>As sweet <hi>Aurora</hi> brings in spring-time faire,</l>
      <l>Our ioyes they dimme, as winter damps the aire.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The nights began to grow to length apace,</l>
      <l>Sir <hi>Phoebus</hi> to th' Antarctique gan to fare:</l>
      <l>From <hi>Libraes</hi> lance to th' Crab he tooke his race</l>
      <l>Beneath the line, to lend of light a share.</l>
      <l>For then with vs the daies more darkish are,</l>
      <l>More short, cold, moist, and stormie cloudie clit,</l>
      <l>For sadnes more then mirths or pleasures fit.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Deuising then what bookes were best to reade,</l>
      <l>Both for that time, and sentence graue also,</l>
      <l>For conference of friend to stand in stead:</l>
      <l>When I my faithfull friend was parted fro,</l>
      <l>I gate me straight the Printers shops vnto,</l>
      <l>To seeke some worke of price I surely ment,</l>
      <l>That might alone my carefull mind content.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Amongst the rest, I found a booke so sad,</l>
      <l>As time of yeare or sadnesse could require:</l>
      <l>The Mirour nam'd for Magistrates he had,</l>
      <l>So finely pen'd, as heare could well desire:</l>
      <l>Which when I read, so set my heart on fire,</l>
      <l>Eftsoones it me constrain'd to take the paine,</l>
      <l>Not left with once, to reade it once againe.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="9"/>
      <l>And as againe I view'd this worke with heed,</l>
      <l>And marked plaine each partie paint his fall:</l>
      <l>Me thought in mind, I saw those men indeed,</l>
      <l>Eke how they came in order Princely all;</l>
      <l>Declaring well, this life is but a thrall,</l>
      <l>Sith those on whom for Fortunes gifts we stare,</l>
      <l>Oft soonest sinke in greatest seas of care.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>For some perdie, were Kings of high estate,</l>
      <l>And some were Dukes, and came of regall race:</l>
      <l>Some Princes, Lords, and Iudges great that sate</l>
      <l>In counsell still, decreeing euery case:</l>
      <l>Some other Knights that vices did embrace,</l>
      <l>Some Gentlemen, some poore exalted hie:</l>
      <l>Yet euery one had plai'd his tragedie.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>A Mirrour well it might be call'd, a glasse</l>
      <l>As cleare as any crystall vnder Sun:</l>
      <l>In each respect the Tragedies so passe,</l>
      <l>Their names shall liue that such a worke begun.</l>
      <l>For why, with such <hi>Decorum</hi> is it done,</l>
      <l>That <hi>Momus</hi> spight with more then <hi>Argus</hi> eies,</l>
      <l>Can neuer watch, to keepe it from the wise.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Examples there for all estates you find,</l>
      <l>For Iudge (I say) what iustice he should vse:</l>
      <l>The noble man to beare a noble mind,</l>
      <l>And not himselfe ambitiously abuse;</l>
      <l>The Gentleman vngentlenesse refuse:</l>
      <l>The rich and poore, and eu'ry one may see,</l>
      <l>Which way to loue, and liue in due degree.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>I wish them often well to reade it than,</l>
      <l>And marke the causes why those Princes fell:</l>
      <l>But let me end my tale that I began.</l>
      <l>When I had read these Tragedies full well,</l>
      <l>And past the winter euenings long to tell,</l>
      <l>One night at last I thought to leaue this vse,</l>
      <l>To take some ease before I chang'd my Muse.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="10"/>
      <l>Wherefore away from reading I me gate,</l>
      <l>My heauie head waxt dull for want of rest:</l>
      <l>I laid me downe, the night was waxed late,</l>
      <l>For lacke of sleepe mine eyes were sore opprest:</l>
      <l>Yet fancie still of all their deaths encreast,</l>
      <l>Me thought my mind from them I could not take,</l>
      <l>So worthie wights, as caused me to wake.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>At last appeared clad in purple blacke</l>
      <l>Sweet <hi>Somnus,</hi> rest which comforts each aliue;</l>
      <l>By ease of mind, that weares away all wracke,</l>
      <l>That noysome night from wearie wits doth driue,</l>
      <l>Of labours long the pleasures we atchieue.</l>
      <l>Whereat I ioy'd, sith after labours past,</l>
      <l>I might enioy sweet <hi>Somnus</hi> sleepe at last.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But he by whom I thought my selfe at rest,</l>
      <l>Reuiued all my fancies fond before:</l>
      <l>I more desirous, humblie did request</l>
      <l>Him shew th' vnhappie Albion Princes yore:</l>
      <l>For well I wist, that he could tell me more,</l>
      <l>Sith vnto diuers, <hi>Somnus</hi> erst had told</l>
      <l>What things were done in elder times of old.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Then straight he forth his seruant <hi>Morpheus</hi> call'd,</l>
      <l>On <hi>Higins</hi> heere thou must (quoth he) attend;</l>
      <l>The Britaine Peeres to bring (whom Fortune thral'd)</l>
      <l>From Lethean lake, and th' ancient shapes them lend;</l>
      <l>That they may shew why, how, they tooke their end.</l>
      <l>I wil (quoth <hi>Morpheus)</hi> shew him what they were;</l>
      <l>And so me thought I saw them straight appeare.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>One after one, they came in strange attire,</l>
      <l>But some with wounds and blood were so disguis'd,</l>
      <l>You scarcely could by reasons aid aspire,</l>
      <l>To know what warre such sundrie deaths deuis'd;</l>
      <l>And seuerally those Princes were surpris'd.</l>
      <l>Of former state, these States gaue ample show,</l>
      <l>Which did relate their liues and ouerthrow.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="10"/>
      <l>Of some the faces bold and bodies were</l>
      <l>Distain'd with woad, and Turkish beards they had:</l>
      <l>On th' ouer lips mutchatoes long of haire,</l>
      <l>And wilde they seem'd, as men despairing mad;</l>
      <l>Their lookes might make a constant heart full sad:</l>
      <l>And yet I could not so forsake the view,</l>
      <l>Nor presence, ere their minds I likewise knew.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>For <hi>Morpheus</hi> bad them each in order tell</l>
      <l>Their names and liues, their haps and haplesse daies,</l>
      <l>And by what meanes from Fortunes wheele they fell,</l>
      <l>Which did them erst vnto such honors raise.</l>
      <l>Wherewith the first not making moe delaies,</l>
      <l>A noble Prince broad wounded brest that bare</l>
      <l>Drew neere, to tell the cause of all his care.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Which when me thought to speak he might be bold,</l>
      <l>Deepe from his brest he threw an vnquoth sound:</l>
      <l>I was amaz'd his gestures to behold:</l>
      <l>And blood that freshly trickled from his wound,</l>
      <l>With echo so did halfe his words confound,</l>
      <l>That scarce a while the sense might plaine appeare:</l>
      <l>At last, me thought, he spake as you shall heare.</l>
