   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE CATHOLIKE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OWER causes there were (right courteous Reader) which first moued me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate vnto thee (according to my smale capacity) the mysteries and Ceremonies of the holy Masse. The firste was, the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dignitie, and most excellent sublimitie, of this diuine and dreadfull sacrifice: which althoughe it be such, that neither the toung of man nor Angell, can worthylie magnifie as it deserueth, yet the verie excellencie of the thing it self inuiteth euerie one, with what praises he can, to set forth, extoll, and celebrate the same. The second was, the most singular ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, respect, and reuerēce, which the deuout &amp; Catholike people, of all places, of all ages, and
<pb facs="3"/> of all callinges, the greatest Doctors themselues, and most learned deuines of all the worlde, Emperours, Kinges, Princes, and Commons, haue euer borne and caried to this Sacrifice: whose example it behoueth euerie good &amp; godlie man to follow The third was, the deep, mortall, and canckred mallice of w<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>cked here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, their most execrable blasphemyes, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with manie most fearefull, vilde, and damnable facts, done &amp; committed by them, in hatred and contempt of this diuine sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: and what good Christian is there aliue, that will not, to the vttermost of his power, defende a treasure so inestimable, from the sauage assaults of such wicked miscreants? The fourth was, the great and long want of a full and perfect exposition, of this so diuine a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie in our English toung, by reason that none of our nation haue purposelie written of the same (for ought that euer I sawe) these fortie yeares: which fower motyues, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto me, matter more then sufficient, to explicate vnto thee, this vnexplicated secrett, and to vnfold vnto thee, a mysterie of such
<pb facs="3"/> maiestie.</p>
   <p n="2">
      <hi>2.</hi> Of the supereminent dignitie, as also of the great and singular respect, which Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks doe beare to this ineffable misterie, I haue amplie treated, and discoursed vnto thee, in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters of this ensuing Treatise. I beseech the infinite mercie and goodnesse of God, that thou mayest receaue, aboundant consolation, and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for thy paynes in perusing them. But tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the deadlie hatred and mallice of our aduersaryes, or of their blasphemyes, and other abuses of this blessed sacramēt, I haue no whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, as hetherto, made anie mention of them: and would to God there were no cause at all, euer to defile our paper, with their execrable, enormous, and fylthie facts. For against this most singular Sacrament, pearle of inestimable price, adamant of Angells, rose of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, onlie life, onlie laurell, onlie tryumphe, onlie treasure, onlie glorie, onlie beautie, and onlie crowne of all Christianitie, the heretiks of our age, doe beare so rabide a rage, so mische<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous a mynde, &amp; so spitefull a spleane, ioyned
<pb facs="4"/> with such audacious attempts, barbarous abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and insolent outrages, as neuer the like, were heard of before our dayes, yea, and in a manner is incredible, could euer enter into the hart of a Christian. For some rushing violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie into the church, where the Priest was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating this vnbloodlie Sacrifice, stamping vnder their filthie feete the sacred host, and spilling vpon the ground the blessed bloud, vsed the consecrated challice insteed of a pisse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot: and hauing compelled the Priest to drinck off the pisse, next presentlie hung him vp on high, fastened and bound with cordes, vnto an image of Christ crucified, and then with manie shotts of their gunns and pistolls, peirced quite through, both the Priest and the picture wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed by <hi>Lawnay</hi> in his <hi>Replique Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stien. lib. 2. cap. 16.</hi> Another seeing the Priest at Masse, to hold vp the sacred host to be adored of the people, tooke vp a dogg by the leggs, and held him ouer his head, shewing him vnto the people, in mockage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, of the Priest and his sacrifice. <hi>Fox Act. and Mon. page. 1033.</hi> Another (as
<pb facs="4"/> witnesseth the same Fox) finding a Priest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring the blessed Sacrament to the people with great deuotion, offended to see them so deuoutlie and reuerentlie vpon their knees, presentlie pulled out a whyniard or wood knife which he wore about him, and verie greuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie wounded the Priest in diuers places, both of his head, arme, and hand, where with he held the challice, full of consecrated hosts, which were besprinckled with the bloud of the Priest: nor would haue lest him till he had killed him out right, if he had not bin preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the people present.</p>
   <p n="3">
      <hi>3.</hi> But least thou (gentle Reader) mayest think, that God who is the iust reuenger of all such villanyes, hath permitted these men to escape vnpunished, let this example next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing satisfie thee, and serue for a warning to all the aduersaryes and mallitious enemyes of the Masse. After that the holie Masse, was by publike proclamation of the late Queene, commanded to surcease in all places of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, by Midsomer day immediatlie follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, fower men of Douer in the countie of Kēt
<pb facs="5"/> (besides others which asisted at the same actiō) went into the church of the same towne, and tooke forth the Copes, Vestments, and other Priestlie Ornaments belonging therto, geuing forth and boastinge abroad, that they would goe fetch the Pope from Canterburie. And the verie next day after Midsomer day; these companyons came to Canterburie; put on the said Copes and other Ornaments vpon their backs, and in a Pix (made to reserue the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament of the bodie of our Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus) they put a doggs turd; and then beginning at S. Georges gate, roade in forme of procession quite thorough the City, till they came to west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate: which done, the verie same night they posted back againe to Douer. One of these fower, was Captaine Roberts, who presentlie after, carryed all the Copes, Vestments, and other ornaments, ouer the seas to Dunkirk where he sold them. His miserable and wretched end was, that there leaping out of one smale boate into another, to get to his Shipp, the boate he was in slipping away, he stepped short of the other, and soe falling into the water, pitched
<pb facs="5"/> his vnhappie head vpon an An<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap>here he beat out his braines. The secon<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ortlie after running mad, cast him self off from Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Peere into the sea, and so was drowned. The third, dyed of Iohn Caluins disease, that is to say, he was eaten vp with lice, being yet aliue. The fourth (who afterwards became Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Maidstone) falling greuouslie sick indured Gods terrible iudgments: for he stunck soe abhominablie, that none (no not his owne wife) could endure to come neare him, so that when they gaue him meat to eate, they were forced to put it vppon the ende of a pole, and so to reach it vnto him thorough a windowe. For confirmation wherof, there are right credible and worshipfull persons yet aliue, who can testifie the same.</p>
   <p n="4">
      <hi>4.</hi> These are some few though not the thousand part, of the mallitious dealings of heretiks against the Masse, and of the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable iudgments of Almightie God against them, for their horrible abuses of the same. O immortall God, what is there in all this diuine and dreadfull misterie, which may
<pb facs="6"/> moue any reasonable man to such height of mallice furie, mischeif and manifest mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; Doth the sacred Psalmes of thy seruant Dauid, (for from them the Masse doth take his beginninge) the humble acknowledgment of humane frayltie, the asking of mercie for our daylie offences, the song of Angells pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced at thy Natiuitie, petitions vnto thee for obtayninge of graces, the lecture of thy Prophets, the Ghospells of thy Euangelists, the Creed of thy Apostles, the Sanctus of thy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphins, supplications for all sorts of persons the Commemoration of thy Passion, the prayer of all prayers, both made by thy self, and tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght by thy self to thy Disciples, and which is more to be lamented then all the rest, doth thy precious bodie and bloud reallie present in this holie sacrifice, deserue to be dealt withall in so sauadge a sort? Surelie no, for such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors as these, are rather sathannicall then sayntlie, rather Mahometan then modest, nor so much as beseeming anie Christians in the world, saue onlie Caluinists. Thou therefore ô Lord, who art the sole protector of that which
<pb facs="6"/> thou thy self hast instituted, pro<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> thy self in this blessed sacrifice against thy persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Thou Lord of hosts, defend thy self in this holie Host, against thyne enemyes. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not, I beseech thee, thy precious bodie and bloud, anie longer to be soe barbarouslie abused. Reestablish the same in our Iland, mauger the mallice of all thyne enemyes. And grant that after fortie yeres, wherein thou hast byn greiued with this wicked gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, at the last this noble sacrifice may be publiklie cellebrated by vs, to thine euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and perpetuall praise.</p>
   <p n="5">
      <hi>5.</hi> And you (religious Fathers and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Priests) to whome is committed the care of this our deuasted vyniarde, and who are vnto vs in this our distresse, the sole dispensers of this diuine sacrament, venture still I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeche you, as hetherto you haue done, the losse of your liues, to distribute vnto vs this diuine foode, and to break vnto vs this celestiall bread. For in your handes onlie it is, to geue vnto men, this heauenlie Manna. In your handes onlie it is, in this tyme of death, to
<pb facs="7"/> preserue the lyues of your brethren, least they perishe by famine. And wee againe (my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik brethren) let vs as boldie aduenture our lyues to geue thē harbour and entertaynment. Imitating herein our noble Patron and Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tomartyr of England, blessed S. Alban, who presented himself, yea and gaue his owne life, to preserue the life of his Priest Amphibalus Imitating also (in some sort herein) the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious virgin S. Catherin of Sienna, who bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and afflicting her bodie soe seuerelie that shee drew the bloud, the Deuill appearing vnto her, and persuading her that it was both fooli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sh and needlesse deuotion, shee made him answer, that her Lord and Sauiour had geuen his bloud for her, and that shee would requite and repay him againe, with bloud for bloud. Euen soe, when either foolish heretiks, or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous frends, shall condemne you of follie, for loosing your goods, or exposing your lyues, for to harbour Priests, consider with your selues, that you harbour him, who bringeth vnto you, the bodie and bloud of Iesus Christ: and that if you shed your bloud, to receaue him
<pb facs="7"/> who consecrateth in your houses the bloud of Christ, what else doe you, but render bloud for bloud, and spend your blouds for the bloud of Christ. Comfort your selues likewise with this consideration, that when our Lord and Sauiour instituted his last supper, and consecrated this misterie in the house of a frend, euen a fewe dayes before, did the traytor Iudas, betray and sell the same most innocent bloud for thirtie pence. Yow therefore, the right Honorable and Worshipfull of our english nation which haue bought the holie sacrifice at a hūdred marks: and such as were poorer, with the vtter depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of all the poore litle they had in the world: and further, such as haue not had soe much monie, as heretiks haue asked for the price of this sacrifice, nor no wordlie goods at all to geue them, and insteed of monie, haue layd to pawne their verie carcasses, into sundrie pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Iayles, and loathsome dungeons, ô with what great and vnspeakeable reward, will our Lord and Sauior one day repay and requite your charitie! Verelie neuer was their anie acte in the world so vyle and abhominable, as that
<pb facs="8"/> of Iudas, to sell to the Iewes for money the bloud of his master: nor neuer can there be amongst Christians anie acte more honorable, thē to buy with such sōmes of mony, with such losse of landes and lyuinges, the bloud of Christ. That cursed creature sold the bloud of his master, but onlie for thirtie pence, and yet how hatefull is he to all the world, as also to heauen? you pay for the same aboue threscore poundes, ô how gratefull shall you be, both to God and his Angells! Surelie this sacrifice cannot be estimated by you that loue it at any lowe price, sith those that hate it, doe value it vnto you at soe high a rate: for that thing most needes be pretious, which both the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant doth set soe high, and the Chapman is contented to buy soe deare. In a word, all the sufferances, all all the ignomynies, all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuryes, all the dammages, and all the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which you shall endure for the defence of this sacrifice, will minister matter to all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueing posteritie of your most noble, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall actes: which though you dye, will euer liue to future memorie, resound to your owne
<pb facs="8"/> immortall glorie, and to the euerlasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne of our english nation.</p>
   <p n="6">
      <hi>6.</hi> Finallie, for as much as I may haue iust occasyon to feare, least I haue offended, for offering to touch, or support with my pen, this sacred Arke, I therefore here from the bottom of my hart, right humblie craue pardon of the blessed Trinitie, the maker and worker of this ineffable misterie, of Iesus Christ reallie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in this misterie, of all the blessed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells which assist at this misterie, of all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik Priests the consecrators of this mysterie, and of all Catholik people the true worshippers of this ineffable misterie. And in further satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for this my presumption, I am, and euer wilbe readie soe long as I liue, to cast my self vnder the feet of the meanest Priest in the world, and to serue him as his foot stole whilest he celebrateth this sacrifice. And lastly if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduēture there be any thinge cōtayned in this Treatise, which in the iudgmēt of the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Church (the onlie elected Spouse of Iesus-Christ) shall seeme contrary either to the fayth, or good manners of the same Church, I vtterly
<pb facs="9"/> abiure, damne, condemne, and detest the same, protesting my self to be the man that with the same hands wherewith I writ it, with the self same handes, to be the first that shall throw the same into the fire.</p>
