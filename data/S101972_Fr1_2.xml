      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, as you maye by this present declaration perceyue the miseries and calamities which are dayly suffered in the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries by the people there, so can you not but withall acknowledge how greatly you are bounden vnto almightie God for all the benefits wherewith it hath pleased his Diuine maiestie so many yeares to blesse our countrie for these foure and thirtie yeares and more, what age hath seene a more happie estate than ours? What Nation hath had so well guided a gouernment as this? what people haue inioyed the free disposing of themselues and their goods more than we? what countrie vnder the vale of heauen hath bene more adorned with the ensignes of peace than England? O England! Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land! Peace hath bene thy blisse, Take heed it be not thy bane. For if through peace you become so put out of memory of warre, that the remembrance thereof is not able to put you in mind how ingratitude and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
<pb facs="3"/>
      will be punished by warre, then vndoubtedly as you growe by Peace, so by Peace you shall fall. Wherefore let vs beseech God of his mercie to giue vs grace to eschew sinne; the cause of warre and all miserie, for so the cause being auoyded, the effect will take no place. Which God graunt for his glories sake, and the good of all Christian people.</p>
