      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E'L disposed and good christen rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, so it is, that about. xvii. or xviii. yeres past, I beganne to write ageinst Frithes booke which he made ageinst the veritee of the holy sacrament of the Altare: And I beeing then, where a print was in vse and occupacion, procuryng the same for the puttinge foorthe of that I did intende, by that tyme ii. or iii. chapiters of that I had written was printed for assaie, to see how the printer wolde and coulde set it forth, I fell so sicke, that I was fayne to gette me to London, for the remedy and helpe of mine infirmitee, where I laie a longe tyme in greate daunger. And before I was able to go abrode, the printer (as I suppose for lacke of worke) beeing where he myght come by my scrowes and papers, printed vp the reste of that I had doone, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter suche sorte, as he coulde pike it out of my first draught therof. And sent me the booke, before I was able (as I sayd) to come out of my chamber: wherin, he displeased me so muche, that I did not intende to go any farder with the matter. And that not only because he did so muche with out my consent, but also specially because it was doone, before I had perused and dewly examined that I had written, as that and other like thinges, dothe alway require. For I thinke there be no writer, that willeth any matter of weight to passe his handes, before he hath made with hym selfe, vpon the first drawght, a dew exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacion therof, wherby, he may perceiue and see, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it shulde nede, either any addicion, or diminucion, or
<pb facs="3"/>
els alteracion, and better disposicion of order, wherby the worke maie bee the more compendious, and of lesse difficultee or tediousnes vnto the readers. For my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was (if I might than haue had tyme) to digeste, dispose and order the matter after this sort: First, that it shulde appere by it selfe, what the state of an heretike is, and in what condicion he leadeth his life. And after that, what maner of foundacion it is, where vpon Frith (as he saieth) doth builde and frame his purpose. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it shulde appered also by it selfe, how falsely and foolishely he dothe take, not only the holy scripture, but also the olde holy fathers and auncient doctours of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church, whom he bosteth so muche to make for him, not withstandinge that thei are all directly ageinst hym. Fourthly, what his reasons and argumentes are, which he pretendeth to be no lesse then inuincible, and yet so false and foolishe in dede, as are not worthe the heringe. Fiftly, what is to be sayd vnto hym and all his adherentes, in that they holde, that one bodie can not bee in two places at once. Sixtly, that the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitee therof (whan they haue all doone) is yet probable, by very naturall reason, one principle graunted, whiche no reasonable man can denie. This was mine order, whiche I did intende. And although I were then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apointed therof, thorowe the hastie rashnes of the printer (as is aforesaid) intending therfore to go no farder with all, litle thinking then, that the venim of Frithes booke wolde haue spredde so farre abrode, as the lamentable experience therof doth presently declare: yet now vpon that, and other suche vrgent occasions, as I haue since and dayly do see, I haue returned vnto my first purpose ageyn, and so gone forwarde with all, that I haue newe
<pb facs="3"/>
written all that I wrote before, with such alteracion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as the tyme and change of thinges hath synce mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred great, and worthie occasion. Wherfore moste gentill readers, vse therin your indifferent iudgement, and impute of my labour no more vnto me, but only a mocion or occasion geuen vnto other, that can dooe much better. And thus I committe you to god.</p>
