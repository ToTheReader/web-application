spouses joynture: of this most comfortable subject I have published this small treatise, and the cause inforcing mee to the publication thereof, was the earnest request of some speciall and neere friends, whose affections were much moved with the Subject handled in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit: to satisfie their desire (being no lesse to me than a command) and for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Edification of Gods Church, I have endeavoured to publish the notes somewhat more fully handled than in the Pulpit, hoping that none
<pb facs="4"/>
will despise <hi>Timothie</hi> for his Youth, considering that out of the mouth of Babes the praise of God is perfected. Although I want not some private respects to inforce me to dedicate this my labour unto your Worships, as that I may give some open testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of my gratefull minde to you both, for those perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall favoure received, yet the chiefest reason was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Treatise seemes to be due to you both, who are joyned together not onely in the common bonds of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but as <hi>Aquila</hi> and
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Priscylla, Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> married together in the Lord and to the Lord Jesus, as to one Husband: this relation to Jesus Christ appeares by that high respect you shew to the spokesmen and faithfull ministers of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, by your Pietie and Zeale for the honour of the Lord Iesus. Let <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> contend for superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority in fading and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing greatnesse. Let your Worships contend with an holy ambition for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and retaining of Gods favour, and an humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
<pb facs="5"/>
and communion with his heavenly highnesse, by <hi>keeping Faith and a pure Conscience.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Let the men of this world, whose sole portion is in this life, glory that they are crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a concurrance of present felicities. Let your Worships glory be, that toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a confluence of worldly contentments, the God of heaven hath crowned you with his Mercy and Grace in Christ, and esteeme it your chiefest Honour that God hath made you Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable with the <hi>Bereans</hi> for

your love to the truth; with <hi>Iabez</hi> for your Piety and Devotion, and that he hath made you Noble with <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> for your love to God, his People, his Lawes, his Cause, which love of truth, piety, and devotion; love to God and his cause, shall give a luster to all your other greatnesse, and shall be able in the day of tryall and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to make you stand like an unmoveable Rocke with triumphing confidence before the terrour of the last day, when all other worldly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes without the former shall
