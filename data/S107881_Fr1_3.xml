      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is a thing sufferable, and daiely seene, that eche man fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors those personages, whose nature, qualitie, or condition agreeth together, so I hope (albeit I am but a small Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour, I maie boldly write of Marciall affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and men of warre, without dislikyng of any: because suche matter or menne, are fittest for my penne to be honoured withall, and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest the compasse of my knowledge, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. Yet albeeit that some of the malicious sort, doe maruell at my boldnesse herein, I let them babble, and aunswere the quiet people of milde and sounde iudgemente, that I thinke the beste tyme I can bestowe, is to further the fame of the honest, nexte to the prefarmente of my countries commendation. And that before all other thynges (excepte the honouryng of Prince and publike state) a true writer ought of duetie, to haue in admiration and reuerēce, the valliaunt Soldiours, and men of worthy value. For thereby the beste are knowne, and reape the reward of wel doyng: and the worst will blushe, in the beholdyng of the vertues of other, when the burthen of their owne vices cōdempneth theim, as idell drones of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

wealth. And surely in myne opinion, the nexte waie to make a nomber of meete mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (to the state wee dwell in) is to giue them that deserue, as mutche renowne as can bee clapped on their shulders: and followe with infamie the base mynded fellowe so farre, that he shall scarcely knowe, in what soile he maie hide his hedde. The noble <hi>Romains</hi> in the tyme of their greatnesse of courage and conquestes, were regestred not onely in golden bokes and monumentes: but also were made in a maner halfe gods, and more then men in any kinde of condition, or respecte.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians, Athenians</hi> (and other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a nomber did striue so by vertue, one to excell an other) that the whole worlde to this daie, dooeth ryng of their glorie. And happie was he in those daies, that either deserued well hym self, or might finde by fine inuention and iuste cause good matter, to aduaunce any one of singulare learnyng or manhoode. But now euery manne is so couetous, and greed<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

A custome so perillous and

cankred, that I feare will ruste, and corrupte all good sciences, and bring in obliuion, better matter then I speake of, or can bee remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Yet some hope is left to the wise and well doer, because the honest and rieppest menne of iudgement, are glad to embrace and welcome the labours of well disposed people, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful exercises of the learned. But now to what ende make I this florishe, and recitall of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use in any: since I want power to reforme any one persone, enuious of others reputation. Wherefore, without further recitall of neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse causes, I will followe the substaunce of the matter, here intended to bee written of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiryng the readers to admit, I praised them selues (if any be praise worthie) for some war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like exercises, in the whiche consaite of theirs thei will be the better contented, to beare with the commendation of others. For if euery one were a Soldiour in deede, that readeth this volume, I knowe but a fewe would be angry, to heare of their owne glory and deseruinges. Thus committyng this discourse, to the iudgement of the wise, I commende you to the Almightie. And fall to my matter.</p>
