   <p>SOme perhaps will maruel at the newe impression of thys boke / and so muche the more will they wonder / because they shall see / that with great confidence &amp; bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes (notwythstanding our most gracious Princes late published proclamation / procured rather by the Byshops / then willingly sought for by her maiestie / whose mildnes is such / that she were easyer led to yelde to the proclamation of the highest / then drawne to proclaime any thing against hym / were it not for the subtil perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and wicked dealings of thys horned generation / as by their false doctrine and cruell practises is to bee seene) and by the speciall motion of Gods spirite / and hys protection / it hath bene both attempted and ended. But cease to muse good chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian reader / whosoeuer thou art: and learne to know / that no lawes were they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so hard and seuere / can put out the force of Gods spirite in hys children / nor any cruelty / though it stretched it selfe so far / as to sheding of bloud (from which kynde of dealing the Byshops are not cleare (as the Prysons in London / the Gatehouse at Westminster. &amp;c. can witnesse) the Lord for geue them and vs our sinnes) can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the sayntes and seruauntes of the Lord / from going forwarde in that which is good. For the profite therefore of the godly and their instruction / haue we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded our selues / and / as it were cast our selues into suche daungers and troubles as shalbe layed vpon vs if we come into y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hāds of the persecuting Bishops. From the which pray the Lord if it be hys will to delyuer vs / if not / yet that it woulde please hym to geue vs both patience / to beare what so euer he shall geue them power and lyberty to lay vpon vs / and constancy also to contynue in hys truth and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession thereof / vnto our lyues end. Farewell in the Lord and prayse God for thys worke.</p>
