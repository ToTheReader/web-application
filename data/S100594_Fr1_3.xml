And as the false worshyppynges or execra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble ydolatryes began to increase by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uylyshnesse of false prestes, God raysed vp the prophetes, with an earnestnesse to rebuke them and agayne to renewe the hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenly doctryne and gouernaunce. And as their course was out by a myserable muta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon through warres and captyuyte, that lyuely doctryne of saluacyon, by the sectes of pharysees, Saducees, &amp; Esseanes was yet ones agayne obscured, and the hygh gouernaunce clerely decayed and also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from the chosen flocke of God, the scepture trāslated to Herode a cruel straū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

And y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fort part shal manifest their horrible fall in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre age by y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> groūded doctrines of the true preachers &amp; writers.
