   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y honoured Lords, it is a true saying, that <hi>Conscientia est mille testes,</hi> which sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence makes me confident, because I know the vprightnes of my heart to God, and faithfull and obedient loyalty vnto my King, and loue to you the honourable <hi>Peeres and Princes</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my honest zeale vnto my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries benefit, is, in the presence of heauens Maiestie testified by a thousand witnesses, and therefore in the iustice of my hopes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue, I haue aduentured, vnto your honours to dedicate this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle booke, and in the clearenes of my consciencs, I cannot but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a kind acceptance at your Lordships hands.</p>
   <p>The last vntimely fruit, which by a publicke print I rashly published▪ gaue iust occasion to procure your dislike: and my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse there in, was greater, then at first I could conceiue, for it is an euill not to be borne with, when the greatest (much more, when so meane a subiect as my selfe) shall dare to call in qresti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, things formerly determined, by the iustice of the Law, iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the honoured <hi>Peeres,</hi> and prudent wisedome of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes most honourable Councellers: and too high doth their

presumption clime (especially in a cause of so great consequence▪) whose words would seeme as if they did desire, so to extenuate an offence, as that in respect of the offendor, opinion should bee taught, eyther to taxe the Lawe with crueltie, or the State with inhumanity: he therefore whose actions shall but beare a shew, as if they were directed vnto some such purpose, iustly deserueth to be punnished. And yet may it please your Honours; I must needes confesse, my punnishment was compounded of an absolute <hi>Lenitie,</hi> without (in the least sort) beeing mixt with any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Seueritie:</hi>
      <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

      </gap> as I am in this respect, bound vnto you all (my Lords) so principally my thanks must humbly runne, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Right Honorable the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> by whose loue and bountie, my cause was fauourably censured, my liberty procured, and my wants relieued. Concerning the worthinesse of whose euer honourable disposition, I would largely speake, but that I know; true honoured <hi>vertue,</hi> whose euer constant <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and approued <hi>Iudgement,</hi> laboureth to performe each vertuous and well commended office, so as it cannot, but by a certaine kinde of supreame excellence, worthily deserue worlds praise, yet will it not indure to heare it selfe praised.</p>
   <p>As iust cause there is, so now I doe reioyce to see, that <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercurie,</hi> are in Coniunction ioyned, the powerfull <hi>Venus,</hi> Lady of that house, and mightie <hi>Iupiter,</hi> with kinde Apect, Predominate: Maiestie, Honour, Wisdome, loue, and wisdomes gouernment, haue wrought a happie worke, vnto them all, be still continued and increast, the glory of each best esteemed happinesse. And that <hi>Emperiall</hi> greatest vnion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, whose prudent iudgement, laboureth in peace for to vnite, great <hi>Brittons</hi> Monarchie, in him, and in his Royall line, shall most Princely and potent <hi>Monarches</hi> be establish<gap reason="illegible" extent="5 letters">

      </gap> vsuall course▪ for without hauing respect to a vaine varietie of words, or painted circumstance, I haue onely applyed my inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, vnto the effectuall life, and materiall Substance, of that which I desire to describe.</p>
