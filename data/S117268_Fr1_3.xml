      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, to discourse the worth or commendations of the Author, (especially the pens of others having done sacrifice unto him in that kind) I judge it but an impertinencie: and make no question, but that if I should exchange thoughts or judgements with thee herein, I should have but mine owne againe. The booke it selfe, judiciously interpreted is a volume of his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: and those though from his owne mouth, without any touch or tincture of vanitie or selfe affectation.<note place="margin">Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>uere ut videa?</note> The best sight of a man is to heare him speake, the tongue being a voluntary and pleasant rack to the heart, to make it confesse its treasure whether it bee good or evill. The diligence and care of those, that have interposed for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of what came from him in this way from perishing, have made the Christian world deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors unto them, and great pitty it had beene, that what he spake in publicke, should have dyed in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and not be made seven time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> more publicke, then speaking could doe. The sparkes of such fires as he kindled, would have beene ill quenched, till the world had beene further serv'd with the light and heat of them.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>It is true, heapes of bookes is one of the oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world, and the invention of the Presse hath beene the exaltation of weakenesse and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie amongst men as well as of learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Yet know I no way better to reteine the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in this kind, then for men of worth and growne judgements and learning, to appeare in bookes also among the multitude. The time was, when there were (as the Apostle speaketh) <hi>Gods many,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>1 Cor. 8.5.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>and Lords many</hi> in the world, when the world was pestred with Devills of all sorts, in stead of Gods: but the onely meanes of discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world of them, was the setting forth and preaching of the one true God, and Lord Iesus Christ: so the furnishing the world with such bookes, as are bookes indeed, that breathe spirit and life, and are strong of heaven, speaking with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and power to the consciences of men, is the onely way to affamish the multitude of Idoll books, and to have them desolate without a reader. It is (questionlesse) with men in respect of bookes, as it is in respect of men themselves (and indeede how there should be any difference betweene men and bookes I know not, the booke being but the minde of a man, and the minde of a man being the man himselfe) <hi>Homo homini Deus,</hi>

      <hi>homo homini Lupus.</hi> There are men that are Gods to men, and there are men that are Wolves to men; and the more men-wolves there are in the world, the more men-gods there had neede to bee; otherwise the darkenesse would overcome the light, and make the

earth as the shadow of death. So there are bookes that are laden with divine and true treasure, that will recompence the Reader, his labour and paines seven fold into his bosome, that will open his mouth and enlarge his heart to blesse God, that hath given gifts unto men: Againe there are bookes also that will deale cruelly and deceitfully with men, consuming their pretious time &amp; oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, taking their mony for that which is not bread. Now the more dreamers of dreames there are, there had neede be the more that see visions. The more weake, hungry, loose and emptie discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the world is overlayed and encumbred with all, the more neede it hath, by way of a counter recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, of a full provision of solid and masculine writings, that may make men, men; and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes children in understanding.</p>
   <p>But I must remember, that prefacing Authors with long Epistles is no imployment of any sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne necessitie. Therefore I will no longer sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate betweene thee, and that which I desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend unto thee more then any thing of mine owne. The blessing of him that giveth the increase be upon the labour of him that planted and watred much in the courts of the house of his God; that though hee be dead, hee may yet speake to the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of thine and of many soules.</p>
