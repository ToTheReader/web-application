   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese are a Widdowes teares, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe your wonted eye; Elegies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted forth by the sad Relict of Master <hi>Henry Chitting:</hi> I had else no purpose thus to feed the surfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as little desire as desert for Printing; And therefore here my penne (as for the most part, man) comes into the dangerous World, first crying, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting common frailty in a private losse, indeed such blackes best suit this season of
<note n="*" place="margin">Printed in Lent, the Plague not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ceased in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> humiliation. For though our bloody waters (thanks bee to God) are
<pb facs="5"/>well abated, yet still our <hi>Rachel</hi> mournes, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets rod still cryes unto the Citty,
<note place="margin">Micah 6 9.</note> and to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try also; both sicknesses of body and security of minds, call loud enough for cautions of mortality: one, through the wealth and pleasures of the world, perswading us of Tabernacles heer; The other by the downefall of many round about us, bidding us build on a more firme foundation. None knowing how soone the lot of <hi>Jonah</hi> may fall upon their heads, it becomes us all (like <hi>Abraham</hi>) to be oft sitting in the dore of our tents <hi>.i. Cogitantes de Egressu,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gen. 18.1.</note> thinking of our dissolution and more permanent provision: and in this <hi>Christian-Map</hi> you have the means of both, both worlds delineated, compared, motives and directions for the better choyce. I confesse, an ordinary, but a needfull subject, drest like a childe of sorrow and my busie charge; plaine and serious, without either descant or embellish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Such as it is (with the Authour) is your Honors prostrate; Importunity brings it

I am not ignorant how that the gravest <hi>Pauls</hi> and learned <hi>Gamaliels</hi> of the times ambiat your Noble Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; enough to argue it presumption in the younger <hi>Timothys</hi> (to erect such great gates to their little Citties, as your prefixed Name) but that tis knowne as well,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.12.</note> your equall goodnesse (tutor'd by Saint <hi>Paul</hi>)
<pb facs="5"/>countenanceth virtue in all ages; and for mine owne part (I confesse) of all ill manners I most decline in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude:
<note n="*" place="margin">Qui ingratum omaia dixerit.</note> Pardon then well-affected <hi>Zaches</hi> though they clime a little to have a sight of virtue, suffer us engag'd spectators, to behold your brightnes, as wel as to enjoy your influence: stars lose not of their height or luster, for the gazers meanenesse; nay, oft have I seene an humble Valley grace a stately Mountaine: nor will a Deaths-head spoyle a Christian feast, any more than those old Macedonian Banquets. Yet this I serve up here (Right Honorable) not as a <hi>Philips</hi> Monitor (I know your zeale needs no remembrancer) but as the Poets congratulator, <hi>Qui monet ut faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as quod jamfacis, &amp;c.</hi>
