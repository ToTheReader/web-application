   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He heauenly sayinges
of <hi>Moses</hi> (Right Honorable)
concerning <hi>Melchisedek Gen.</hi> 14
and the commaundement of
consideryng howe great the
party is. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. can not well
take place in our hartes, vnlesse
the person be knowen: that
all spoken of hym may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in due sense. For eyther we shall clymbe three
steppes too hygh with <hi>Melchisedekians, Hierax,</hi> or yet
<hi>Origen,</hi> who make hym more then a mortall wight: or
we shall fall too low, with the common <hi>Greekes,</hi> who
make hym eyther a <hi>Chanaanite,</hi> or leaue hym to be an
obscure man. But when we find out certaynely who the
person is, then we may safely examine all that is spoken
of hym. And in my opinion, that which is written of
hym, reacheth so farre both to the first <hi>Adam</hi> one way,
and to the seconde <hi>Adam</hi> an other way, styll ouershy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
<hi>Aarons</hi> ceremonies: that an errour in this matter
wyll no lesse frette the webbe of holy Story, then the
worke of a VVeauer is hurt, when many thriddes in
<pb facs="3"/>
one place are pulde away, which reached through the
whole peece. In a matter of this weight, I iudged my
labours shoulde be well spent, that I myght both shake
off quite, from all myndes which vse my paynes, that
which is to be reiected: and helpe to settle better the
ancient trueth. To that ende I handle the chiefe diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
that haue been touching <hi>Melchisedek:</hi> and speake
for one opinion more at large: which <hi>Hebrewes</hi> alwayes
helde, and <hi>Latines</hi> most commonly: that <hi>Sem</hi> the father
of all the sonnes of <hi>Heber,</hi> must needes be the man.
Whereas many and great men thought otheryse: but
neyther the most ancient, nor the most part, nor onely
of the best: I leaue all to the Reader to iudge: who, yf
he be of Learnyng wyll eyther (as I trust) folow the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
opinion continued styll, or without blame geue
others leaue to folow it. In chosing a particuler Iudge,
I finde your Lordshyp, meete to geue a right censure in
difficulties: and I suppose you wyll delyght to heare
what antiquity speaketh, and the matter it selfe in this
cause. You shall finde this matter muche lyke that,
wherein once your L. bestowed long tyme in speach
with me: and many of the very same poyntes (though
to an other conclusion) wyll here offer them selues.
As the other, in my mynde, were of profite to be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen:
so by these I trust, the student in Diuinitie wyll
thinke hym selfe somewhat holpen. And that both may
come togeather, yf it be not a trouble to your leasure to
remember, it wylbe a benefite to Scholers for to marke
how some Counsellers looke into theyr studies, and
teach by sodayne demaundes what poyntes experience
of whole kingdomes require to be playnely taught in
the worlde: which the common sort lytle thynke of:
and for want of indgement rashly dispise. Fiue yeeres
ago your L. requested me to repayre to the Court, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng
the <hi>Greeke</hi> translation of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Prophetes
<pb facs="3"/>
presented to you, and concernyng perusing of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysh:
to haue more integrity and playnnesse accordyng
to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the Apostles <hi>Greeke.</hi> Then you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
most wyllingly three houres spech for matters
of chiefe and generall vse, and of great hardnesse: in such
sort that I was amazed how you shoulde haue eyther
such leysure, to be ready in them, from your politicall
affayres and studies, or so right and profounde a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the bones in the body of Scripture, as Diuines
skant thinke of, tyll great errours driue them to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Beginnyng from the <hi>Greeke,</hi> you demaunded why
the 70. should not be more accompted then the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
seeing the Apostles folow it: Reason beyng rendred,
that they were to folow it, because Heathen commonly
knew no other Bible. You further examined how farre
they folowed, and in eache kinde tryed out the matter.
Their strangenesse of imitation was, in that they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not bare faultes of Grammer, as often appeareth: to
teach vs not to fight for wordes: Secondly, they folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
the 70. where they hid their mynde, as in <hi>Kenan,
Gen.</hi> 11. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. and in Seuentie and fiue soules, for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentie▪
<hi>Gen 46. Acte.</hi> 7. or deale as Paraphrastes or abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
which often they do. Thirdly, in some rare vse of
a worde. One example of that offered it selfe. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.
which mystaken by Translaters, putteth all men to a
plundge. For it is sayd: No further offeryng remayneth
for sinne, yf we after knowledge of the trueth sinne
<gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> whiche ought not there to be translated wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly:
rather of pretended malice, from <hi>Exo,</hi> 21. 13. where
<gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> is in Hebrew <hi>Zadah, insidiatus,</hi> lying in wayte,
or <hi>iazid.</hi> 14 wylfull, or malicious spitefull. And so the
disputation was playne agaynst the <hi>Iewes,</hi> wylfully
faythles: and no further griefe to distresse the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of any. This was examined as a thyrd kinde of the
70. folowed. You examined likewise, turning to your
<pb facs="4"/>
Bible the 70. Translations refused: when a chiefe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was weakened by the 70. therefore <hi>Paule</hi> sayde, for
this cause <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>I raysed vp,</hi> not <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>Thou hast been
suffered aliue:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 17.</note> because he woulde expresse the <hi>Hebrewe</hi>
more playnely.<note place="margin">Exod. 9. 16.</note> Moreouer for heauenly eloquence, how
the Apostles departed from the Translation: namely
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. that your L. diligently tryed by <hi>Esay.</hi> 4. and
other places. Neither was the <hi>Hebrew</hi> left vntryed with
the 70. for a rare text: or in some vse an onely: VVhy
we say <hi>Psalm.</hi> 2. Kisse the Sonne: where the <hi>Latin</hi> hath
after the Greeke, <hi>Amplectimini eruditionem.</hi> The openyng
of that drewe more matter. I answered, that by both
Translations it myght appeare, that the Hebrew worde
was <hi>Bar.</hi> Now the Hebrew worde <hi>Barar</hi> (To teach)
might by proportion of language haue <hi>Bar</hi> for doctrine:
though so in vse any where it commeth not: but for a
sonne, it doth in the <hi>Prouerbes. 31. 2. Bar,</hi> and <hi>Dan. 3. Bar:</hi>
and in the new Testament <hi>Actes. 4. Bar-nabas</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
Sonne of consolation. This text <hi>litigious,</hi>
for the wryting amongst the <hi>Romistes,</hi> for the meanyng
with <hi>Iewes</hi> folowyng the 70. your L. mooued to be
expounded. For the Translaters I gessed, that eyther
they feared to translate for <hi>Heathen,</hi> vngrounded vpon
the Trinitie a distinct saying of one person, The Sonne,
least <hi>Heathen</hi> shoulde turne it to a wrong meanyng:
or they marked it not. As in <hi>Daniel</hi> they knew not how
to translate <hi>Iccaret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> Messiah: Messiah shalbe killed:
because they vnderstoode not the matter: or they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to publyshe it in a playne phrase, and in <hi>Greeke.</hi>
Vpon mention of <hi>Daniel,</hi> your L. requested an opening
of the whole Booke, and examined the particulers:
what tymes or yeeres it conteyned, what Empires: and
how the Image legges, which were to be made dust,
before the Stone was made a Mountayne, myght not be
taken for the <hi>Romans.</hi> For so we shoulde conclude with
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Iewes,</hi> that Christ is not yet come: as also by the fourth
Beast: yf we made it the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And for the golden
text of <hi>Daniels</hi> Seauens, your L. had read some that I
then had not, of great accompt. It woulde be too long
to runne now through all. I coulde not faster runne
then through any part of myne owne studies, then you
pursued in demaundes for the chiefe matter. Your
shortnesse in propounding questions, readinesse in
conceyuing a full answere, diligence in trying Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
dexteritie in replying vpon colour of doubt,
quicknesse in trying what confidence I had in myne
assertions: and lastly, singuler gentlenes of encouraging
my studies, with entreatie to repaire often to you: these
partes do assure me of a Iudge fitte for wyll and skyll.
VVherefore I willingly reuiue the memory of your
Lordshyps spech: to liue through all memory: and to
ende as I began: to your Lordshyppes protection I
commit this Treatise, to finde intertaynement: but so
farre as trueth shall be seene to require.</p>
