   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue euer been of opinion (good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader) that as nothing in this world is more pleasing to the eye of a Christian soule, then a pure aspect or knowledge of the true Church, which is the louelie and most beautiful Spouse of CHRIST himself, and the onlie <hi>Arke</hi> of Man's saluation; so is the same neuer more clearly represented vnto vs, then in the cristallin glasse of reuerend Antiquitie, the puritie and truth wherof was euer so highly esteemed, as that it was not only required<note n="(1)" place="margin">Censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus de Die Nat. c. <hi>1.</hi>
      </note> by the <hi>Lying Gods</hi> of the Gentils, that al the firstlings of the people should yearely be offred in Sacrifice vnto them, but it was further like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise approued and<note n="(2)" place="margin">
         <hi>Exod.</hi> 22 29.</note> prescribed by the only-true and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing GOD, that the <hi>first-fruits</hi> yea and the <hi>first-borne</hi> both of men and beasts, in regard of their primacie being his worthiest creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, should peculiarly be applyed, offred, and deuoted to the highest seruice of his Greatest Maiestie. In best proof and example wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the perfect<note n="[3]" place="margin">
         <hi>Coloss.</hi> 1.15.</note>
      <hi>Image of the inuisible God, the first-borne of al creature,</hi> CHRIST IESVS, was not only offred to God himself in the Temple, and there redeemed, but also offred vpon the Crosse for
<pb facs="3"/> the Redemption of others, as the sweetest Holocaust to his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie Father.</p>
   <p>Yea this Prioritie or Ancestrie is so specially affected by the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and so directly maligned by the Enemie of man, as that in the verie first planting of the Church of Christ it is sayd, that he first <hi>sowed</hi>
      <note n="(4)" place="margin">
         <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.24.25.</note>
      <hi>good seed in his field,</hi> and after <hi>the enemie came, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sowed cockle;</hi> thereby not obscurely intimating vnto vs, that true Faith, Religion, and the <hi>Word of God,</hi> which is this<note n="[5)" place="margin">
         <hi>Matth</hi> 13.19. <hi>Luc.</hi> 8.12.</note>
      <hi>good seed,</hi> was first and ancient to Sects and Heresies. And so, as in temporal Nobilitie that Stemme is most honourable, which is lineally deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the ancientest bloud; and in earthlie possessions that Title strongest, which pleadeth longest Prescription or ancientest Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and as also it may not be denyed, but that Truth hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedencie to falshood, and substance to shadowes: so must it needs be granted or rather supposed as an infallible truth, that that Ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Faith, and Church, which is first or eldest, is the only true Ghospel, Faith, and Church of CHRIST, and al other Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions afterwards arising or going out from thence, are but only the malignant inuentions of the Enemie, who euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world was chiefly euer busyed in obscuring, peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and detorting that, which at first was alwaies created<note n="[6)" place="margin">
         <hi>Genes.</hi> 1.31.</note>
      <hi>very good,</hi> very gracious, and most pleasing in the al-seing Eye of the Omnipotent Maker.</p>
   <p>In which respect for the euer finding out of the prime truth in al occurring difficulties, we are specially forewarned, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to Antiquitie, so to suspect Noueltie. <hi>Moyses</hi> a litle before his death desiring to leaue some holesome documents to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel,</hi> directeth them, saying:<note n="(7)" place="margin">
         <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.7.</note>
      <hi>Remember the old dayes; thinke vpon euerie generation; aske thy father, and he wil declare to thee; thy elders, and they wil tel thee.</hi> In like sort <hi>Baldad</hi> (Iob's friend) aduised him in his greatest extremities, to<note n="(8)" place="margin">
         <hi>Iob</hi> 8.8.</note>
      <hi>aske the old generation, and search diligently the memorie of the fathers; for we are</hi> (sayth he) <hi>but as yesterday, &amp;c.</hi> Yea wisest <hi>Salomon</hi> his aduise is:<note n="(9)" place="margin">
         <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8 11.12.</note>
      <hi>Let not the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ancients escape thee; for they learned of their fathers; because of them thou shalt learne vnderstanding, and in time of necessitie to giue answer.</hi> According to which, God himself by the Prophet <hi>Hieremie</hi> teacheth:<note n="(10)" place="margin">
         <hi>c.</hi> 6.16</note>
      <hi>Stand ye vpon the wayes, and see, and aske of the old pathes, which is the good way, and walke ye in it, and you shal finde refreshing to your soules.</hi> So that the old way is the way of truth; and the same is to be learned by our Elders and Fathers.</p>
   <p>Now of the contrarie, God reproueth such as<note n="(11]" place="margin">
         <hi>Ier</hi> 18.15.</note>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>walke, &amp;c. in a way not trodden;</hi> and Salomon's lesson is, that thou<note n="(12)" place="margin">
         <hi>Prou.</hi> 22 28.</note>
      <hi>transgresse not the ancient bounds, which thy fathers haue put.</hi> From whence I take it to be, that as in the Scriptures our true God is called<note n="(13)" place="margin">
         <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.23 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.26.52. 1. <hi>Tim</hi> 4 10</note> the <hi>God of the Fathers and of the Faithful,</hi> so false Gods and new doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines are termed<note n="(14)" place="margin">
         <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.17.</note>
      <hi>New and fresh ones, whome their fathers worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped not.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Agreably heerunto <hi>S. Paul</hi> likewise aduiseth <hi>S. Timothie</hi>
      <note n="(15)" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20.21.</note>
      <hi>to keepe the Depositum, auoyding the prophane nouelties of voices and oppositions of falsely called knowledge; which certain promising haue erred about the fayth:</hi> thereby shewing prophane <hi>innouation</hi> to be the shipwrack of fayth. Vpon which place likewise thus writeth that worthie Patron of Antiquitie Vincentius Lyrinensis:<note n="(16)" place="margin">lib. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers proph. nouit.</note>
      <hi>He sayd not antiquities, he sayd not Ancientnes, but prophane Nouelties. For if noueltie is to be auoyded, antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is to be kept; if noueltie be prophane, ancientnes is holie &amp; sacred.</hi> And againe: <hi>This with al Heresies is as it were solemne and allowed, that in prophane nouelties they may alwaies reioyce, and scorne the decrees of Antiquitie: But on the contrarie, to Catholicks this is almost proper, to keepe the things left and committed by holie Fathers, and to condemne prophane nouelties &amp;c.</hi> Wherupon he sayth of Nouelists: <hi>What doe they promise but new and vnknowne doctrine? For you may heare some of them to say: Come, Ã´ you foolish and wretched, who commonly are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Catholicks, and learne the true fayth, which none but we do know, which for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie former ages lay hid, but now of late is reuealed and shewen &amp;c. Are not these the words of that Drab?</hi> sayth <hi>Vincentius.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But indeed it was ordinarie with the ancient Fathers to confute Hereticks by their owne Innouation. So <hi>Tertullian</hi> vpon this ground reproueth the Nouellists of his time for their then vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and intruding by their latter vpstart doctrine vpon the then more ancient Catholick possession, saying to that end vnto them:<note n="(17)" place="margin">De Prescrip. c. <hi>37.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Who are you? When, and from whence came you? What do you in my</hi> [grounds] <hi>not mine? By what right</hi> [Marcion] <hi>dost thou cut downe my woods? By what licence</hi> [Valentine] <hi>dost thou ouerthrow my fountains? &amp;c. It is my possession; long since I possessed it; I possessed it first.</hi> Yea he prescribeth in general<note n="(18)" place="margin">lib. cont. Prax.</note>
      <hi>that to be true, which is first; that false, which is later.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Answerably vnto which writeth <hi>S. Hierome</hi> of the <hi>Luciferians:</hi>
      <note n="(19)" place="margin">Cont. Lucifer fin.</note>
      <hi>In this that they are afterwards begun, they shew themselues to be those, which the Apostle foretold were to come,</hi> to wit, Hereticks; of whome he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth further:<note n="(20)" place="margin">Ep. ad Pamach. et Ocean.</note>
      <hi>Why doe you go about after</hi> 400. <hi>yeares to teach that, which we knew not before? vntil this day the world was Christian without that doctrine.</hi> With whome agreeth <hi>S. Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> saying:<note n="(21)" place="margin">Ep <hi>2.</hi> ad Chelid.</note>
      <hi>They tel vs</hi> (as Protestants stil doe) <hi>of a wisdome hidden since Christ; a thing deseruing teares. For if Faith began within these</hi> 30. <hi>yeares, seing almost</hi> 400. <hi>yeares</hi> (and as I may now say 1600. yeares) <hi>are past, since Christ was openly
<pb facs="4"/> knowne, so long then was the Ghospel in vaine, in vaine also our fayth, in vaine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs suffred death, in vaine also such and so great Bishops did gouerne the people.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>From this verie Argument of Innouation S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> confuteth the <hi>Arians</hi> in these words:<note n="(22)" place="margin">de De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Nycen. Synod.</note>
      <hi>Behold, we haue proued this doctrine to haue been deliuered to vs from fathers to fathers: But you (new Iewes, and the sonnes of Caiphas) what progenitours of your name are you able to shew?</hi> Of whome also sayth <hi>S. Hilarie:</hi>
      <note n="(23)" place="margin">Lib. <hi>6.</hi> de Trin. ant. med.</note>
      <hi>This our fourth Age hath brought forth ouer late for me these</hi> [pretended] <hi>most godlie Doctours.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>S. Austin</hi> writing against <hi>Donatus</hi> vp braydeth his new or late birth in this manner:<note n="(24)" place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> de Bap cont. Donat. c. <hi>2.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>From whence hath Donatus appeared? Out of what earth hath he budded? From what sea hath he swum? From what heauen hath he fallen?</hi> And he obiecteth thus vnto the Manichees:<note n="(25)" place="margin">de Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate Cred. c. <hi>14.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>But you being so few, so turbulent, and so new, euerie man knoweth, you can produce nothing worthie of credit.</hi> In like sort writing against the Pelagians he vrgeth<note n="(26)" place="margin">Cont. Iulian. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag. l. <hi>2</hi> c. l.</note> that <hi>Christian people ought to preferre the sayings of Saints before your profane Nouelties, and rather choose to adhere to them, then to you.</hi> Yea <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> relateth, that the<note n="(27)" place="margin">Diuin. Instit lib. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>11.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>most holie Fathers not suffering the true Faith to be wronged, ordayned Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Rules in the Councel of Chalcedon, striking with the Diuine sword</hi> (of Excommunication) <hi>the obstinate Inuentours of new Heresies;</hi> And, <hi>Decreing that none ought to bring-in new questions; but content with the authoritie of the old approued Doctours, should obey the holesome Decrees without deceipt and fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; for there are some, who thinke it commendable, if they can conceaue anie thing against the ancient</hi> (writers) <hi>and inuent something new, wherof they may be deemed skilful.</hi> But I wil cÅclude this with this sweetest saying of <hi>S. Bernard:</hi>
      <note n="(28)" place="margin">
         <hi>Ep.</hi> 174.</note>
      <hi>Against the custome of the Church nothing at al wil please me presumed Noueltie, the mother of Temeritie, the sister of Superstition, and the daughter of Leuitie. What I haue receaued from the Church, I securely deliuer.</hi> So secure it is, in al ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing difficulties to recurre to Antiquitie, and to eschew Nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
   <p>And as thus we haue seen from Scriptures and Fathers the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial account euer made of reuerend Antiquitie or Ancestrie, and the sharp reprehensions of prophane Noueltie: so are there none, who seeme more ioyfully to applaude and approue the force of the foresayd Argument, then the learnedst Protestants of these our dayes: amongst whome for breuitie in a Case so manifest to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce only one of our owne domesticks, who for his supposed worth in iudgement and learning may suffise for manie, D. <hi>Morton</hi> affirmeth<note n="(29)" place="margin">Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale for Protestants p. s <hi>11.</hi> See also White in the Way to the Chur. Pref. to the Reader n. <hi>17.</hi>
      </note> that <hi>our Sauiour Christ by his Parable of the diuers seedes, first wheate in the day, and then tares in the night, doth teach vs, that Truth may challenge prioritie of Errour yealding principalitie vnto Truth, sayth</hi> Tertulian, <hi>and poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie vnto lying. And so it must needs be; because as there must be first iron, before there can be rust, which canckereth the iron; so must there be a virgin-truth before errour, which is nothing else but an adulteration therof. So that Primum and Verum,
<pb facs="4"/> that is, primarie Antiquitie and Truth are both inseparable twins, begot and bred in the same instant.</hi> And againe<note n="(30)" place="margin">Ibid p. <hi>512.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>But tel vs, what is Noueltie? When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle exhorted his Timothie to keepe that, which was committed vnto him, and to take heed of profane Nouelties, he did in effect instruct him to preserue the doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, not to suggest anie doctrines newly conceaued, as sayth</hi> Lyrinensis, <hi>who accounteth it (according vnto Salomon's description) a whorish trick, to cal anie out of the ancient and beaten way, and to say, Come vnto me.</hi> In like sort<note n="[31]" place="margin">Ibid p. <hi>679.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>As it becometh the children of God, who commanded that the first-borne euen of the woman that was hated, should be respected before the yonger sonne of the beloued wife, we, albeit hated by our Romish Aduersaries, yet only desire, that they would hold (as S. Chrysos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome teacheth)</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
         <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>that is, euerie Noueltie a vanitie; and in al Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies suffer the first-borne to finde a preheminence, by preferring each doctrine according vnto the prime antiquitie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now in this desire of preferring Antiquitie, al Catholicks most ioyfully wil ioyne hands with M. Doctour <hi>Morton,</hi> desiring nothing more, then that al Questions at this day controuerted between the Roman Church and the Protestant Congregation might strictly be examined and finally decided by the square of Antiquitie. And for this cause haue I compiled this Treatise following, intending thereby to set downe the true <hi>Progenie</hi> both of Catholicks and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, from what Ancesters they are lineally descended, and of what continuance their names and families haue formerly been. And although the guard and strength of Truth in this point of Antiquitie is euer such, that she resteth stil accompanyed, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and fortified with surest friends, strongest towers, and best munition, yet neuer may she repose in greater quiet, or more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously appeare with greater honour, then when her soueraigne right, titles, and prerogatiues are plainly admitted, granted, and acknowledged by the sworne and professed enemies of Truth. And yet, according to that of <hi>S. Austin,</hi>
      <note n="(32)" place="margin">Cont. Donatist. post. collat c. <hi>24.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Truth is more forcible to wring out confession, then anie rack or torment.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>No wit of man can finde out Arguments more conuincing in themselues the truth of Religion, then the plaine Texts and literal sense of holie Writ, the infallible decrees of the Church and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councels, the vnanimous consent of ancient Fathers and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, and often the common light of Nature and Reason itself; yet <hi>ad hominem</hi> (as the Schoole-men terme it) and for the final pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of al further Plea, shifts, and euasions in the Aduersarie, no course more speedie, no victorie more certain, no obiection more vnanswerable, then the plaine, simple, and sincere confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Aduersarie himself.</p>
   <p>In Ciuil and temporal differences concerning lands and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<pb facs="5"/> very forcible and hopeful are the Arguments drawne from the ancient and authentical Euidences, from lawful and vninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Prescription, from the plaine and literal word and sense of the Law, from the swarming consent of Iudges and Councel learned, and from sufficient testimonie of most credible aad ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued witnesses; yet not one, no nor al of these ioyntly concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, are anie thing so potent for the speediest and surest decision of the Cause, as the free acknowledgement and assent of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie, only enforced through the rack of clear and vndenyable Truth.</p>
   <p>So <hi>Moyses</hi> hauing sundrie wayes proued the Goodnes and Power of God Almightie aboue the Gods of the Gentils, vrgeth as the strongest argument, that the Gentils his<note n="[33)" place="margin">
         <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.31.</note>
      <hi>Enemies are also Iudges in his behalf.</hi> Which course likewise obserued <hi>S. Paul</hi> against the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Athenians, vrging to the same purpose the authoritie of their owne<note n="(34)" place="margin">
         <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28.</note>
      <hi>Poets;</hi> and against the <hi>Cretensians</hi> he argueth, that<note n="(35)" place="margin">
         <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.12.</note> one of them sayd, their owne proper Prophet: <hi>The Cretensians alwayes lyers, naughtie beasts, slouthful bellies. This testimonie</hi> (sayth <hi>S. Paul) is true.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But this kind of reasoning learned this blessed Doctour from his best Maister Christ our Sauiour, who at the last day wil vrge as the clearest proof against the <hi>Naughtie seruant</hi> his owne confession, saying:<note n="(36)" place="margin">
         <hi>Luc.</hi> 19.22.</note>
      <hi>By thine owne mouth I iudge thee, naughtie seruant.</hi> Yea this kind of victorie as most glorious in itself, and most disgracious to the enemie, God himself vsed against his owne enemies, when he caused the <hi>Madianit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

   <p>And as the Prophets and Apostles thus affected this kind of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, so was it stil pursued by the ancient Fathers. So <hi>S.

      <hi>Thy testimonie, which in another man's cause is smal worth, against thyself is weightie.</hi> So that the Argument drawne from the confession of the Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries is the proof most conuincing against the Aduersarie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
   <p>A truth so cleare, that none more fully acknowledge the same, then our moderne Protestants, amongst whome writeth D. <hi>Morton</hi> thus:<note n="(45)" place="margin">Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale Ep. Ded.</note>
      <hi>Which kind of assistance of learned Aduersaries the Apologists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues haue layd downe for the greatest reason of satisfaction; and we do accordingly admit. For if it be held an excellent point of Physick,</hi> Ex vipera theriacum, <hi>to turne poyson into an antidote against poyson; and in God accounted a high degree of vengeance, to turne the Aegyptians against the Aegyptians; and in Dauid celebrated as a principal matter of triumph, to cut of Goliah his head with his owne sword; and in Christ obserued as an vnanswerable kind of conuiction, to iudge the euil seruant from his owne mouth; and acknowledged in S. Paul as the most expedite meanes of confutation in the men of Crete, to oppose against them their owne Poet, whome he calleth their Prophet; then may we iustly presume better of our cause, wherin our Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Aduersaries wil proue our rightful Aduocats.</hi> For it must needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged (say other<note n="(46)" place="margin">Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.

      <hi>Bellarmine maketh the confession of the Aduersaries to be the Thirteenth Mark</hi> (of the Church) <hi>Surely the argument must needs be strong, which is taken from hence &amp;c.

   <p>Now this kind of inuincible and vnanswerable argument haue I specially chosen and pursued throughout this Treatise following, as wel thereby to take the most speedie &amp; surest course for the final deciding of CÅtrouersies, as also clearly to preuent the endles shifts, euasions, and deceipts, so generally and so cunningly practised by al kind of Sectaries. For who would not thinke, but that anie man of iudgement and learning diligently perusing the large and learned Works but only of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Iodocus Coccius,</hi> men so studious, payneful, and sincere in describing the pedigree of the Church of Christ, but that he would easily see, iudge, and confesse the ancient primitiue Church, Faith, and Religion, the most approued General Councels, and learnedst Doctours, the most authentical Records, Histories, and Monuments of those pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest times, al of them to testifye, to depose, and confirme the self-same Truth, Faith, and Religion, which the present Roman Church at this day beleeueth, practiseth, and professeth? And yet what a world of tricks, fallacies, and inuentions hath the Enemie suggested to our moderne Hereticks, for the blemishing and obscuring of that clearest glasse of the Primitiue Church, wherin our present Roman is so liuely represented? Who would thinke it equal to oppose a dark and casual saying of <hi>S. Austin</hi> (for example) against his knowne practise and laboured proof to the contrarie? And who would not blush to oppose <hi>S. Austin</hi> (to his fowlest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace) as contrarie to himself? What more desperate course can be taken, then to censure his most certain writings for counterfet, because they contradict and confute their impious Nouelties? What greater schisme can be raised against the Church, then to pretend her chiefest Bishops, Doctours, and Pastours in the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest articles of Faith to be at mutual and deadlie warres amongst themselues? What more audacious temeritie and base ingratitude can Malice itself offer to those our so noble Progenitours, then to alter and corrupt their learnedst writings, which as clearest eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for the Catholick Faith they bequeathed to Posteritie? And yet these and manie more then these are the ordinarie Sophismes of our late Sectaries. For the surest and final preuention of al which, what shorter or more expedite course can I take, then
<pb facs="6"/> (Protestants for example appealing to the Primitiue Church, and her Doctours and Pastours) to produce themselues confessing al these to be their Enemies, and the Teachers and Patrons of Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie? How more vnanswerably can I conuince, that <hi>S. Austin</hi> beleeued &amp; taught our Catholick doctrine of Purgatorie, &amp; Prayer and Sacrifice for the Dead, then if sundrie Protestants of greatest knowledge and reading, not beleeuing the same doctrine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, doe yet acknowledge and reproue the same in <hi>S. Austin?</hi> Now whether in this Treatise following I performe this, and that by the confessions not of few, or of those of the least esteeme, but of very manie, and those of the primest Protestants that are or euer were, and these not only reprouing <hi>S. Austin,</hi> but with him <hi>S. Ambrose, S. Gregorie, S. Hierome, S. Chrysostom, S. Leo, S. Epiphanius, S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie Nazianzen, S. Gregorie Nyssen, S. Cyril, S. Hilarie, S. Basil, S. Cyprian, S. Ireneus, S. Ignatius, S. Dionisius,</hi> and the rest of the most renowned Doctours of the purest and most approued times, and this not only in the Doctrine of Purgatorie, but in al the points of chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest weight; I remit myself wholy to the seuerest Censures of al Iudicious and Diligent Readers.</p>
