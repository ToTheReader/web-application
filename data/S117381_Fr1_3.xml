   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He highest Points of Christian Religion, and such as are most above the Reach of Humane Wisedome, are those that lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in the foundation; and therefore are they called <hi>the Mysteries of the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> Mat. <hi>13.11.</hi> and <hi>the deepe things of God, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>2.10.</hi> And the knowledge of these things, is tearmed <hi>an ascending into Heaven,</hi> Iohn <hi>3.13.</hi> a knowledge of such things as <hi>eye hath not seene, nor eare heard,</hi> nor would ever <hi>have entred into the heart of man,</hi> had they not beene revealed to us by him <hi>that came downe from Heaven, even the sonne of man that is in Heaven.</hi> That blessed Apostle <hi>S. Paul, that was rapt up into the third Heaven,</hi> did yet chiefely desire to studie and teach <hi>these Principles of the Doctrine of Christ: I determined not to
<pb facs="5"/>
know any thing among you, save Iesus Christ, and him crucified, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>2.2.</hi> Yea and after all his studie and teaching, was not ashamed to confesse of himselfe, that he was not <hi>yet perfect</hi> in the knowledge of Christ, nor <hi>had attained</hi> so much as might be attained, but was still therefore looking upward, and <hi>pressing forward to that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> Phil. <hi>3.12, 13.</hi> And indeed, what <hi>David</hi> acknowledged, concerning his searching the Scriptures in generall; that though he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded further in the discoverie of Divine Truths, then those that went before him, <hi>Psal. 119.99. I have more understanding then all my Teachers, for thy Testimonies are my meditation;</hi> yet he was still to seeke of that which might be knowne, <hi>Vers. 96. I have seene an end of all perfection, but thy Commandement is exceeding broad.</hi> (Even as those great Discoverers of the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Lands in <hi>America,</hi> at their returne were wont to confesse, that there was still a <hi>Plus-ultra,</hi> more might be descryed then was yet seene;) that may we say concerning those glorious things revealed unto us in the Gospel concerning Christ: Proceed we as farre as we
<pb facs="6"/>
can, in the studie of them; that, we know, will be nothing, to that which is still to be learned: for <hi>the Riches of Christ,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ephes 3.8.</hi>
      </note> herein discovered, are indeed <hi>unsearchable.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It is disparagement therefore at all, either to those that are <hi>the chiefe Masters of the Assemblies,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Eccles. 12.11.</hi>
      </note> to teach, or those that are of the highest Forme in Christs Schoole, to learne, yea,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Heb. 5.12.</hi>
      </note> and that againe and againe, <hi>the first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Oracles of God.</hi> Sure I am, how-ever others puffed up with an opinion of their owne worth, may be otherwise minded, the Reverend and learned Author of these ensuing Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>atises was of this judgement; who, though he were <hi>a wise Master-builder,</hi> yet, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the grace that was given unto him,</hi> (which was indeed like that of <hi>Elisha,</hi> in regard of the other Prophets, <hi>2 King. 2.9.</hi> the elder Brothers Priviledge, <hi>a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) he was still taking all occasions to <hi>lay</hi> well <hi>the foundation,</hi> and that in one of the most eminent Auditories for Learning and Pietie that are in the Kingdome.</p>
   <p>They that were his constant Hearers, know this well; they that were not, may see it by these his Sermons now published, (reduced, as was
<pb facs="6"/>
deemed most fit, into four severall Treatises) wherein, as the season required, he still tooke the opportunitie of instructing his Hearers in this great Mysterie of our Religion, <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>carnation of the Sonne of God</hi>; one of the chiefe Fundamentals of our Faith, one of the chiefe of <hi>those Wonders in the Mercy-Seat,</hi> which <hi>the Cherubins gaze at, which the Angels desire to prie into, 1</hi> Pet. <hi>1.12.</hi> And indeed, by reason he spake at severall times, and by occasion of so many severall Texts of Scripture concerning this subject, there is scarce any one of those incomparable benefits which accrew to us thereby, nor any of those holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions which the meditation hereof ought to worke in our hearts, which is not in some place or other sweetly unfolded. In the first Treatise, the Mysterie it selfe is indeed chiefely opened, and is therefore called, <hi>The Fountaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sealed:</hi> the rest, as in so many strea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es, convey to us <hi>that Water of Life</hi> which issueth from thence; teaching us how to improve the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hereof <hi>to the glory of God,</hi> and <hi>the spirituall enriching</hi> of our owne soules. The noted Humilitie of the Author I now the lesse wonder at, finding how often his thoughts dwelt
<pb facs="7"/>
on the Humiliation of Christ. If we that now reade them, be not <hi>changed into the same image from glory to glory,</hi> it will be our owne fault. This take from me, the Treatises following are published by Copies of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which himselfe approoved and appointed, and that by subscribing his owne hand, purposely to prevent imperfect Copies. Embrace them therefore as truly his; and the Lord so raise up thy heart in the carefull perusall hereof, that <hi>thy profiting may be seene of all.</hi>
