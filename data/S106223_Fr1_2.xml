First, and foremoste these are the wordes of thapostell: Maryage is honourabell amonge all, and the bed vndefyled. Wherby this apostel doth admonish vs, that as incontinency, is a disease commen to men of all sortes, and degrees, so maryage beynge the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie against it, is offred by the free mercy and goodnes of god, to al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men withoute anye respecte,<note place="margin">The mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vse of a woman in lawfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony is reputed for no sinne.</note> and that the moderat vse of a womā in lawfull Matrimonie, is not repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for sinne, for which cause, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the bedde of the godly maried, vndefiled.

Againe, this holy Apostel in his firste epistel to the Corinthiās saieth plainely thus: let euerye man haue hys wyfe, and let euerye wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man haue her housbande,<note place="margin">i.

Let the vnma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ried and widowes, yf they cānot ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine, mary, for it is better to marie then to burne. Againe if thou takest a wife thou sinnest not: likewyse if a virgine mary she sinneth not, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse suche shall haue trouble in theyr flesh.

   <p>¶Fyrst and foremoste we learne by Baptyst Mantuan, who, as I sayd, was a Carmelite, that Hilarius, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Poetiers was maried, &amp; that neyther his wife, nor his children, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he had by her, did let him to be a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. Secondly, howe that many did complaine, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they were depriued of the libertie to marye, hauing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable burdone of cōstrained cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie laid vpon their sholders, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many, not being able to beare it, were driuē to commit those thinges that were vnlaweful, &amp; most detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in goddes sighte. And therfore he did righte well conclude, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the life of
<pb facs="7"/> them in time past, which had wiues children, &amp; housholdes, did farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede &amp; passe in godlinesse, the life of the wiuelesse cleargie of his time. Siluianus also, bishop of Massilia, shewing y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> matrimony is lawful for the ministers of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> church,<note place="margin">Siluianus. li. v. De pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidentia dei.</note> doth speak thus of the forbidding of it. <hi>Nouum pro sus est conuersionis genus, licita non faciunt, illicita committunt.

Truly this a newe kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion. They do not those thinges that be laweful, &amp; commit those thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges, that be vnlaweful. They do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine frō wedlocke, but they do not absteine frō rapine. What dost thou foolishe perswasiō?

Wherein two thinges are playnly graunted of thys Pope. fyrst, that they that be coupled in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryage, maye bothe be receyued into the ministerie, and also vse (and that by the lawe of nature) in the tyme of it, theyr matrimonye. Secondlye, howe that if it were not for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions and lawes of the churche, they mighte also marye, after that they be called to the ministerye.</p>
   <p>But as for the churche, this are we sure of, that the true spouse of oure sauioure Iesu Chryste, wyll make no lawes and constytutiōs contrary to the word, institution &amp; ordinaunce of hyr heade and husbande, Iesu
<pb facs="9"/> Christe, who in all places, bothe by him selfe, and by his Apostelles do geue vnto all thē,<note place="margin">The true church wyl make no lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God his worde.</note> that haue not the gifte of continencie, free libertye to marye, and with a good conscience, to vse that remedy, whych god from the beginning hath appointed for al men. Therefore the constitutions &amp; lawes of the church,<note place="margin">Panormita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus wordes are so nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble▪ that I could not but bring them.</note> can not debarre from matrimonie, those, that by a singular gift and callinge of god, be not appointed vnto a single, &amp; wiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse life. Of force I am constrayned contrarye to that, whyche I sayde before, to brynge in the wordes of Abbas Panormitanus,<note place="margin">Panormi. de clericis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingatis. capi. Cum olim.</note> whyche are these, Continēcie is not in the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, of the substance of the order, nor of the lawe of God. For, elles the Greekes should sinne: neyther shuld custome excuse thē, forasmuch as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome ought in no wise to preuayle, nor to beare or haue anye place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the lawe of god. And I do not onely beleue, that the church hathe power to graunt y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the cleargie may marrye, as the Greekes do, but also
<pb facs="10"/> that this would be a wholesome sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, for the profite &amp; healthe of the soules, that they, which can absteine &amp; merite more, should be left to their owne will, and that they which can not abstayne might marry. For the experience doth teache vs, that a con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trarry effect doth ensue and folowe, of that lawe of continencie, sith that men liue not spirituallye, nor be cleane, but are defyled with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawefull vse of women, not wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great offence agaynst god, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>as the lawefull vse of theyr owne wyues, should be chastitye. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the churche oughte to do, as a good phisiciō, which hauing learned by experiēce, that his medecine doth more hurte than good, doth remoue or take it away. Hitherto haue we taught briefely, that it is laweful by goddes worde for al them that haue not the gifte of chastitye, to couple them selues in matrimonye, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that the auncient ministers of the prymatiue church, as Hilarius and other, had wiues, in the time of
<pb facs="10"/> theyr ministery, whereunto I maye by the waye adde these wordes of Hierome: If Samuel being brought vp in the tabernacle,<note place="margin">Hieroni. lib. prun. in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinianum.</note> did marrye a wyfe, what is this preiudiciall to virginitye?

Again: if they be suffered to marye, that wil minister a greate occasion to theym to be couetous, and to kepe nygarde houses, so that the poore shall not be refreshed by theym as they ought to be, they wyll geue theym selues to pourchase houses and lande for theyr brottes: What hospitatytye then shall they be able to keepe?

<pb facs="12"/> if they wil not in their life time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for their wiues &amp; children, shall thei not fil the world with beggars?

I do not denye, but that there be some, vnto whom it is geuen, that they shoulde gelde theym selues, or make theym
<pb facs="13"/> selues chaste for the kyngedome of heauē sake, but they are very thinne sowen. They that be so, let theym with all thankefulnes employe that gift to the aduauncing and settinge forth of goddes glory,<note place="margin">i.

But nowe will I come to the rest of theyr obiections. As touching the troubles &amp; cares that are commō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in matrimony, we haue spoken of them already, shewinge that they do pertaine vnto the crosse whych God wil haue to be annexed to this holye estate: and that for them (as I sayde afore) no man wanting the gyfts of continencye oughte to forbeare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.<note place="margin">No state of mans lyfe here in this world can be without trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bles &amp; cares.</note> Howebeit I woulde by the way that they should shewe me any estate of mans life her vpō y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> earth, that can be wythoute troubles and

If any hauing the gift of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity &amp; beinge called to the misterye, doe go aboute to kepe hospytalytye, how manye thinges, he shall daylye and hourely be troubled with al com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mune experience doeth sufficyentlye teache vs. How many times shall he be faine to playe Marthas part, and by hym selfe to doe many thynges euery houre of the day almost, which yf he had a trustye yoke felowe, he neded not to trouble hym selfe with all? but geue hym selfe quietly to his boke? Although I say he doth all the day long geue hym selfe to his owne studye, beynge onelye carefull ouer the flocke of Chryste, yet he is sure that all thynges shalbe well seen to at home: Whereof els (suche is the vnfaythfulnes of seruauntes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one that shuld alwayes ouer see him) he will alwayes be in doubte, and neuer be quiet in hys mynde.

<pb facs="14"/> to vse the lawfull waters, that God hathe appointed, for to quenche it? Howe well (I praye you) shall they be able to applye theyr learnynge, and to geue them selues to heauenly contemplation? And as for the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge of the people wyth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye foode of Gods worde, this I am sure, no man is able to denie, but that there haue beene more God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Sermons made in one yeare, by faythfull maryed Mynysters, sence oure Souerayne Lady Quene Elyzabeth dyd come in, than were made in all Queene Maryes time, by theyr wyfelesse and Virgyne Pryestes.

<pb facs="14"/> which is worse, how they may abuse other mens wyues, and haue theyr children to sit by other mens fyers, were it not better, for suche a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyster, as hathe not the gyfte of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynencye, but yet hathe the feare of GOD before hys eyes,<note place="margin">It is not bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter in the fyghte of the worlde.</note> to care for hys owne lawfull wife, and for his children lawfullye begotten in true wedlocke, in the which he maye kepe hym selfe an vndefiled member of oure Sauiour Iesu Christe, than to be put, for wante of hys lawfull remedye, to carke and care, and that to the vtter destruction of his bodye and soule, for a vyle strumpet,<note place="margin">Sapience.</note> and hys bastardes, whyche another daye, shall beare wytnesse against theyr vngodlye parentes?

And why, because that they alone wyll reygne heare vppon the earthe, and wyll haue the whole worlde in theyr handes.

And where good fermers dwelled and kepte great hospitalitie reliuing the whole towneship, there they kepe a shepeheard with his boy and his dogge, so that a man maye aswell breake hys necke as breake his faste there, from whense afore no poore boy was suffered to go awaie emptie or vnrefreshed. And yet they will seme to fauour hospytalytie, for sothe. But it muste be at other mens costes, and that they theyr selues maie be feasted, &amp; haue good cheare when they come to Master persons, or to master Vicares. For, although the faythfull Mynister doeth to his power refresh his pore neighbours, yet onelesse he doeth euerye foote feaste these great cobbes, and make theim lustye cheare, when soeuer
<pb facs="16"/> they luste to come, he is not coump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to kepe any house at all. Nowe, if the paril of couetousnesse, whyche they wyll haue the maried ministers to be so subiecte vnto, can debarre them frō mariage, which they graūt to be lawfull by goddes worde, what myghte bee sayde of those that be in office vnder a prynce? myghte it not wyth a better reason bee sayde, that it were most parillous to suffer them to marrye,<note place="margin">No lesse pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryl of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes in thē that be in office vnder a prince, than in the Miny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> lefte beynge moued wyth an inordynate desire to leaue their wiues and children in a welthy and rich estate, they shoulde pill and pole the people, and pilfer from the prince?

<pb facs="16"/> be striken wyth couetousnes, yet manye (god be praysed) haue the feare of God before theyr eyes, and do from the bottome of theyr hartes detest and abhorre couetousenesse. It was not preiudicyall to the reste of the Apostels, that Iudas beynge one of the .xii. was bothe couetous &amp; a thefe.
