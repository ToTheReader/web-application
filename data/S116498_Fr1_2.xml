   <head>To the right worshipfull, <hi>Thomas Couentrey Esquire; of Hill,</hi> and <hi>Croome Debitat</hi> in the County of Worcester; Grace, Mercy, and Peace <hi>from God our gracious and</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father, and from our blessed Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ.</head>
   <p>AS about the space of sixe and twentie yeares since (Right Worshipfull and right deare in the Lorde) I dedicated to your worthy Father (that iust &amp; vpright Iudge (as a testimony of my thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for his manifolde fauours, and for some other respects which I then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred) certaine fruitful instructions (as the first fruits of my study and paines-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the ministry of the Gospel) which hee wel esteemed and accounted of: So now, for the reasons heereafter expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, haue I presumed to present to your selfe, (though a little, yet) a liuely image
<pb facs="3"/> of my progresse and growth in the mayne duties of that calling, which no lesse then your godly Father, I am wel assured, you do affect. But yet, from a priuate &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler respect and consideration of your selfe, the principall motiue (as I freely confesse) for the divulging of these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, did not spring at the first, but euen as the Lord God (according to his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouidence and mighty power, for the good of his children) dooth oftentimes fetch light out of darkenesse, good out of euil, honour, and glory, out of that which in it selfe is loathsome and dishonorable; euen so, from the verie corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of some of the hearers, traducing &amp; reproaching, wresting and peruerting them, hath beene deriued the especiall cause of their publication. Whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, as a broken voyce sounding in the Ayre, woorthy of no regarde, they had clearely fleeted and vanished away. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the particuler cauils and obiections of such detractors, in an Apology, direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to some of the principal Knightes and
<pb facs="3"/> Gentlemen, and to all others truely fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God in the East part of our Countie, both Ministers and people, I haue alreadie discouered and confuted at large. Which Apologie, howsoeuer (by some others wel affected, and by my selfe at the first) it was thought fit to be published in as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and general a maner as the Sermons themselues; yet vpon later cogitations, I resolued otherwise. For when I haue done my best endeuour for the clearing of mine innocency, touching both Doctrine and life, in the Consciences and experience of such, who dwelling in our Coasts, might be induced by the secrer whisperings and backbytings of the contrary-minded, to iudge amisse, and so to speake euill of the way of saluation; it is enough for mee, though the whole world besides remayne ignoraunt of my condition, and that for euer.</p>
   <p>As the Lord God decreed from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, that there should bee a difference betweene man and man; and that out of one lumpe or masse there shoulde spring
<pb facs="4"/> two seedes: The elect contained vnder the seede of the Woman, and the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate or maglignant Church comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder the name of the Serpents seed. So if it may please you to take a serious view and consideration of these ensuing Sermons, you shall clearely discerne, that in teaching and discouering the seuerall notes and markes of this difference, as they are distinguished in the word of God (a Doctrin most vnsauoury and vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to the Naturall and vnregenerate man, and that the people vnto whom they were preached, might be directed &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the good and right way that leadeth vnto life, and haue their steppes turned from by-wayes and crooked pathes which tende vnto death, consisteth the maine scope and drift of them al; &amp; that there is not so much as one sentence ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it selfe to the reproach or disgrace of any other: but onely of such, who by continuance in euill dooing doo disgrace themselues. According to my measure, which your worship knowoth well enough
<pb facs="4"/> to be but weake and smal, you shall finde our Lord Iesus Christ in euerie Sermon discouered and pointed out (though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so learnedly, eloquently, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically as many others of greater gifts &amp; graces vse to do, yet) so truly, sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and faithfully, I trust, to bee the way, the truth, and the life, that you may haue cause to conclude &amp; to rest resolued, that howsoeuer through the malice of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, in the slaunderous tongues, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightful endeuours and attemptes of his instruments, the course of my ministery be much interrupted, and verie often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into mine owne bosome agayne, without any good effect in some that hear it, yet doo I vnfaignedly desire the good and saluation of euery one, without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and respect of personnes, and that I apply my selfe for the furtherance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to the vttermost of my power.</p>
   <p>But letting these things passe, &amp; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to trouble your worshippe, nor to grieue myself any further in discoursing of them, I wil now briefely, through your
<pb facs="5"/> patience, shewe the Reasons that mooued mee to the Dedication of these my poore Labours, vnto your selfe, which are in number foure.</p>
   <p>First, because I haue founde by long and sure experience, that as you haue suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded your good Father in all the rest of his Vertues and good Qualities; so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, in vnfaigned Loue and kindnesse to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wardes mee and mine: Nay, if (vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out note of Flatterie) I may bee bolde to speake, what I haue alwayes found to bee true, the Loue and Fauour which I did enioy in your Fathers dayes, sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no ebbe by his decease, but beecame rather freshly renewed, and verie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably flowing with encrease; yea, and (wherein it resembleth the Loue of our Heauenly Father, and much swarueth from the ordinarie Loue of most mortall Men:) it deminisheth not, but dayly groweth more and more with the time. For the ordinarie feeling and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whereof, what shall I render? Nay, what can I render in any competent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure?
<pb facs="5"/> Siluer and Golde haue I none, and although I had, yet (God bee praised for it) you neyther neede it, nor expect it (I am sure) at my hands. Well, such as I haue, I heere make tender of. Accept therefore (I beseech you) these fewe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, as our Sauiour Christ did the poore Widdowes Myte; How meane soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it either bee indeede, or may seeme to bee, (beeing compared with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Workes of Learned men) yet is it a great part of the best of such Riches as I possesse: And if it were much better then it is, yet should I as willingly bestowe it vpon you and yours.</p>
   <p>A second Reason is, because that the whole summe and substaunce of two or three of the first of these Sermons heerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue sounded in your Worships eares: at what time they found such kind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, that although they now come accompanyed with diuers others, yet do I fully perswade my selfe, their welcome therefore will bee no whit the lesse, but
<pb facs="6"/> rather so much the better; yea, and so as henceforth they shal haue a resting place, not in your house alone, but euen in some part of your very heart, and that for euer.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, that by this meanes occasion and opportunity may bee offered to adde some little helpe for the furtherance of the peoples saluation in that my Natiue Countrey. From which though I bee seperated in person and habitation, yet not in affection and good will: and the good whereof, in the best things that are, I cannot but vnfaignedly wish and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. Which wish and desire of mine, by the commending of this to your Worships patronage and protection, wil bee great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furthered and holpen forward, I know, to a good effect. And last of all, which yet is not the least of all, that vnder your Name and Title, I might expresse some thankefulnesse to the right Christian and vertuous Gentlewoman your wife, and to her Godly and Religious Parents, who now loue mee, not for your sake alone (as
<pb facs="6"/> I clearely discerne) but for the truth, yea whose Loue and Fauour, whose ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and chearefulnesse (euer since I knew them) by all good meanes, by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and by others, to do me good, hath beene, and is so exceeding great, that as I freely confesse, I haue not onely admy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, but beene in some sort astonished at it, considering howe free it is alwayes from all desert. But to conclude, if I for my part, see verie good and sufficient cause to reioyce and praise God, as I doo indeede, for your daily growth in fauour both with God and men, for the Riches of Gods mercie and bountifulnesse bestowed in plentiful measure vppon both your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and minde in heauenly and in humain Wisedome and Knowledge, and in manie other fit and necessary guifts and graces; for your Health, Peace, and Prosperitie; for Gods Blessinges and Fauour in your louing and faithfull yoake-fellow, being a chearefull and faithfull helper, as I am wel assured, aswel in matters of Religion, as of this life; and for that godly Stocke
<pb facs="7"/> and generation from which shee is discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (the fellowship and society whereof, to your very great comfort you do inioy.) As also, for diuers other particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects which I might remember, &amp; that aswel in your little Oliue braunches, as otherwise; and if there bee good and sufficient cause for mee, to pray vnto God to blesse and sanctifie these, and euerie of these, to your ioy and consolation; yea to multiply his mercies in them, and in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of them, as your dayes and years: How much more cause you your selfe then haue to reioyce and praise God, for such special loue; and how much more zealously and feruently it behooueth you to pray vnto him, to sanctifie them for you, and your selfe for them; that so in your selfe, in them, and euery of them, the Name of God may be glorified, and your own soule and Conscience strengthened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by them, in the vndoubted hope and assurance of eternal life. I neede not vrge it, as being out of doubt, that with godly Wisedome and Consideration, you
<pb facs="7"/> do daily remember, and take it to heart. And thus crauing pardon for this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, I now take my leaue, and commend your selfe, and al yours, to the Grace and Fauour of God, in Iesus Christ.</p>
