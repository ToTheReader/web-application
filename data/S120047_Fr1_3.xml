      <hi>1</hi>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue written here a <hi>Treatise</hi> in answere to <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Fitzherberts</hi> Reply, touching the <hi>POPES</hi> power to depose <hi>PRINCES,</hi> and the new <hi>oath</hi> of <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> which I thought fit to Dedicate to you, <hi>Deare Countrimen,</hi> those especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, who haue taken vpon you a charge to teach, and instruct others, for that the matter, which here is handled, doth as much concerne your soules, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, or rather much more, then my owne. Doe not you imagine, that when there is a controuersie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his <hi>Holinesse,</hi> and your <hi>Soueraigne,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your spirituall, and temporall allegiance, you may safely, and without danger of deadly sinne adhere to
<pb facs="7"/>
his <hi>Holinesse,</hi> and forsake your <hi>Soueraigne,</hi> vnlesse you duly examine the right, and title which either haue: for that by the law of <hi>GOD,</hi> and Nature you are bound to giue to <hi>GOD,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> that which is their due; that is, spirituall obedience to your spirituall <hi>Pastours,</hi> and temporall allegiance to your temporall <hi>Prince.</hi> Wherefore if the <hi>Pope</hi> should challenge, and exact from you not onely spirituall obedience, which is due to him, but vnder colour of spirituall obedience, should demand also temporall allegiance, which is not due to him, but onely to your temporall <hi>Prince,</hi> you should in obeying the <hi>Pope</hi> therein yeeld him that obedience, which is due only to your tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Prince,</hi> and so transgresse the law of <hi>GOD</hi> and nature, and consequently it being a matter of so great moment, you should, according to the approued do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of all <hi>Diuines,</hi> by yeelding such obedience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre a most heinous deadly sinne.</p>
   <p n="2">
      <hi>2.</hi> For as there are but two only supreme powers on earth, to which all Christian subiects doe owe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and subiection, to wit, <hi>spirituall,</hi> which doth reside speciallie in the chiefe spirituall <hi>Pastour,</hi> who in things spirituall is <hi>supreme,</hi> and <hi>temporall</hi> power, which doth reside in temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> who in things temporal are <hi>supreme,</hi> and subiect to none but <hi>God;</hi> So also there be only two subiections, and obediences answerable thereunto, to wit, <hi>spirituall</hi> and <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:</hi> So that if such a power, or obedience be not spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, it must of necessitie be temporall, and with the same certaintie or probabilitie, that one is perswaded such an authoritie not to be spirituall, he must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that it is temporall. That authoritie is spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<pb facs="7"/>
and due onely to the <hi>Pope,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> hath giuen to his <hi>Church,</hi> and the spirituall <hi>Pastours</hi> thereof; All other supreme authoritie is temporall, and due only to <hi>temporall Princes.</hi> And therefore if it be probable, as in very deede it is, and as you may see it in this <hi>Treatise</hi> clearely conuinced so to be, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no authority giuen him by <hi>Christ</hi> to depose <hi>Princes,</hi> it is consequently <hi>probable,</hi> that the aforesaid authoritie (if there be any such authoritie on earth to depose Princes) is not spirituall but temporall, and that therfore, whosoeuer granteth it to the <hi>Pope,</hi> doth giue to him that obedience, which is due to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Princes,</hi> and consequently he doth against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse command of <hi>Christ,</hi> not render to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> that which is their due.</p>
   <p n="3">
      <hi>3.</hi> Well then thus you see, that if the <hi>Pope</hi> should challenge that obedience as due to him by the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Christ,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> hath not giuen him, and which consequently is due only to temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> he should vsurpe that authority, which he hath not, &amp; in so doing he should transgresse the law of God and Nature, and those subiects, who should adhere to him, and yeeld him that pretended spirituall obedience, should also transgresse the law of <hi>Christ,</hi> and be not only pretended, but true Traitors both to <hi>God</hi> and their <hi>Prince,</hi> in not acknowledging their <hi>Prince</hi> to be their true <hi>Soueraigne,</hi> by yeelding that obedience, which is due to him to an other, and so by taking from him his <hi>supreme</hi> power, or <hi>soueraingtie,</hi> and giuing it to an other <hi>Prince,</hi> which in very deed is to take the Diademe, which doth signifie his supreme authoritie, off from his head, and place it vpon the head of an other.</p>
   <p n="4">
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <hi>4.</hi> Now there is none of you, as I suppose, of so meane vnderstanding, that can imagine, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is so infallible in his opinion, iudgement, or any declaratiue command grounded thereon, as that he can not <hi>possibly</hi> erre therein, and challenge that authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as due to him by the institution of <hi>Christ,</hi> which neuerthelesse <hi>Christ</hi> hath not giuen him, but it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth only to temporall Princes. This you may see by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, who pretended, that <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>faire</hi> the most Christian <hi>KING</hi> of <hi>France, was subiect to him in spiritualls and temporalls,</hi> and declared them to be <hi>heretikes,</hi> who should beleeue the contrarie: and that he was a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Monarch</hi> of the Christians world, and therefore that the <hi>kingdome</hi> of <hi>France</hi> by reason of the diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and rebellion of <hi>Philip</hi> their King, was falne into the handes of the <hi>See Apostolike:</hi> for which cause Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> was taxed by many learned Catholikes of great <hi>impudencie, pride,</hi> and <hi>arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie:</hi> and his <hi>extrauagant, Vnam Sanctam,</hi> which he made to curbe the said <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring <hi>that the temporall sword is subiect to the spirituall, and temporall power to spirituall authoritie,</hi> was reuersed by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fift, the next Successour but one to Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> who declared, <hi>that by the definition, and declaration of Pope</hi> Boniface in his extrauagant, Vnam Sanctā, <hi>no preiudice should arise to the</hi> King, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of France: <hi>and that by it neither the</hi> King, kingdom, <hi>or</hi> inhabitants <hi>of</hi> France <hi>should be more subiect to the Church of Rome, then they were before, but that all things should be vnderstood
<pb facs="8"/>
to be in the same state, wherin they were before the said definition, as well concerning the</hi> Church, <hi>as concerning the</hi> King, Kingdome, <hi>and</hi> Inhabitants <hi>of</hi> France. The like temporall authoritie Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift, if he had liued, would also haue challenged, for that as I haue been credibly informed by diuers <hi>Iesuites</hi> of good account, who then liued at <hi>Rome,</hi> hee did intend to suppresse Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> first Tome of Controuersies, because he did not with the <hi>Canonists</hi> grant to the <hi>Pope</hi> this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect temporall Monarchie ouer the whole Christian world.</p>
   <p n="5">
      <hi>5</hi> So that the onely controuersie now is, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> hath <hi>de facto</hi> erred or no, in declaring the <hi>oath</hi> of <hi>allegiance</hi> to be vnlawful, and <hi>to containe in it many things flat contrarie to faith and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,</hi> vpon this supposall, that it is a <hi>point of Faith,</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath authoritie giuen him by <hi>Christ,</hi> to depose Princes, which is the substance of the oath, as Fa: <hi>Suarez</hi>

      </note> in expresse words confesseth. Now you may see, if you please to reade, that I haue cleerely proued in this <hi>Treatise,</hi> that it is <hi>probable,</hi> that the authoritie, which the <hi>Pope</hi> claimeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Princes, is not true, but vsurped, not granted him by <hi>Christ,</hi> but giuen him by men contrarie to those expresse words of <hi>CHRIST,</hi>

      <hi>Render the things that are</hi> Caesars <hi>to</hi> Caesar, <hi>and the things that are</hi> Gods, <hi>to</hi> God. And therefore consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I pray you, in what danger you stand, of doing great iniury to your Soueraigne, and committing flat
<pb facs="9"/>
treason against his Royall person and Crowne, if you rashly, and without due examination follow the <hi>Popes</hi> opinion, iudgement, or also declaratiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand grounded thereon, who, vnder pretence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of you a profession of his spirituall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and your spirituall obedience, exacteth in very deede not spirituall allegiance, but that obedience which is <hi>probably</hi> thought by many learned Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes to be a meere temporal allegiance, and due onely to your temporall Prince.</p>
   <p n="6">
      <hi>6</hi> But obserue, <hi>deare Countrimen,</hi> a more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, and dangerous gulfe, into which for want of due consideration you may easily cast your selues. For if once you grant, that it is <hi>probable,</hi> that it is a <hi>controuersie,</hi> that it is a <hi>disputable</hi> question, as in very deed it is, and as I thinke very few of you, who haue studied this question, are perswaded to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, that the right, title, power, and authoritie, which the <hi>Pope</hi> challengeth to depose Princes, is no true title, but pretended, a meere temporall, and not a true spirituall authoritie, although I should grant you also for Disputation sake, of which as yet I doe not dispute, that it is also <hi>probable,</hi> that the said title is good, and that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath such an authoritie to depose Princes giuen him by <hi>Christ,</hi> yet there is none of you so simple, but if you will duely consider, will presently perceiue, that this title, so long as it is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, is <hi>titulus sinere,</hi> a meere title, which so long as it is disputable, and debated on either side, can neuer be put in <hi>practise</hi> by any man; what opinion so euer he follow in <hi>speculation,</hi> without doing the <hi>Prince,</hi> who is deposed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> manifest wrong,
<pb facs="9"/>
and if he be a subiect, by committing that detestable crime of treason in a most high degree.</p>
   <p n="7">
      <hi>7</hi> For if any one of you should be inlawfull pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of a house, iewell, or any other thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto an other man pretendeth a title, and claimeth a power to dispose thereof, and perchance it is also <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,</hi> that his title is in very deede the better, and his Lawiers doe bring strong reasons, and euidences to confirme the same, would not you thinke, that it were a manifest wrong, as in deed it were, and against the knowne rules of iustice grounded vpon the light of reason, that your <hi>Aduersarie,</hi> or any other in his behalfe, notwithstanding the <hi>probabilitie</hi> of his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, should put you out of possession, and take it away from you by violence, before the Iudge had decided the controuersie?</p>
   <p n="8">
      <hi>8</hi> And if any one should <hi>Reply</hi> and say, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is our <hi>Soueraignes</hi> Iudge; to whom also all Christian Princes are subiect, and that hee hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided this controuersie betwixt him and our Prince, and defined, that this his title to depose our Prince and all other Christian Princes, is a true and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretended, a spirituall, and not a temporall title, he is manifestly deceiued. For neither is the <hi>Pope</hi> the Iudge of temporall Princes in temporall causes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are supreme, and subiect to none but God; neither hath the <hi>Pope</hi> as yet decided this controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, or defined by any Generall Councell, or any other authenticall instrument (for I will not at this time contend what authority the <hi>Pope</hi> hath to define mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith without a <hi>Generall Councell</hi>) that this title, and authoritie which hee challengeth to depose
<pb facs="10"/>
Princes, is a true spirituall title, and an authoritie granted him by the institution of Christ. For concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this point <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>Emperours haue euer beene at great variance,</hi> as well said Fa: <hi>Azor,</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">
         <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 11 <hi>cap q.</hi> 5.8.</note> and it is in controuersie among Catholike Doctors, as I haue conuinced in this <hi>Treatise, and as yet the controuersie is not decided by the Iudge,</hi> as Abbot <hi>Trithemius</hi>
      <note n="e" place="margin">See beneath part. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>
      </note> doth well affirme.</p>
   <p n="9">
      <hi>9</hi> And if any one should perchance imagine, that his <hi>Holinesse</hi> that now is, hath by his late <hi>Breues</hi> decided the controuersie, and defined, that hee hath authoritie to depose Princes, hee is also most grosely mistaken; both for that there is not so much as one word mentioned in any of his <hi>Breues</hi> concerning his authoritie to depose Princes, but onely in generall words he declareth, that Catholikes ought not to take the oath, <hi>for that it containeth many things flat contrarie to faith and saluation,</hi> but what those many things be he doth not expresse (and perchance he might imagine at the first sight, as Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> did, that the <hi>Popes</hi> power to excommunicate, to binde and loose, to dispence in oathes is denyed in the oath, and that it was framed to make a distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Protestants and Catholikes touching points of Religion, al which how vntrue they are I haue cleerely shewed in my <hi>Theologicall Disputation</hi>) but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for this reason hee is fowly mistaken, because there is not in the <hi>Breues</hi> any one of those words, which, according to the doctrine of Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and other Diuines related by me in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Disputation</hi>

Neither is euery <hi>Breue,</hi> or <hi>Apostolicall</hi> letter of the <hi>Pope,</hi> although it be registred in the body of the Canon Law among the <hi>Popes Decretall</hi> letters, a sufficient instrument to define matters of faith, for that in them is commonly contained onely the <hi>Popes</hi> opinion concerning some doubtfull case, or question, and not a finall decision or definition, which all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes are bound to follow. Otherwise it must needes be granted, that <hi>Popes</hi> haue defined in their <hi>Breues</hi> false doctrine, and also <hi>heresie,</hi> as may bee seene in the <hi>Decretall</hi> letters, and <hi>Breues</hi> of Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> the first, Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> the third, and Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, as also I obserued in the aforesaid <hi>Disputation</hi>

and now against those Catholikes, who do any waies fauour the <hi>Oath,</hi> (to omit many other exorbitant dealings vnder this pretence of furthering the common good, which if it were needfull I could make manifest) but assure your selues that neither good ends are sufficient to excuse bad practises, nor the zeale of the person is a sufficient warrant to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie all his actions, nor iniustice is to be done to any man be he neuer so wicked.</p>

      <hi>15</hi> Call to minde, I beseech you, the doctrine of the ancient Fathers, and the practise of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, obserue the causes of the beginning and increase of this practise, and doctrine for the Popes power to depose Princes, and the continuall contradiction thereof, and you shall finde, that no man of any learning can perswade his conscience, that this doctrine is certaine, and of faith. For the zeale of <hi>Pope Gregorie</hi> the seuenth, the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth Emperour, the discord of the <hi>German</hi> Princes, the riches of the Countesse <hi>Mathildis,</hi> the warlike forces of the <hi>Nortmans,</hi> and the desire of all men that the Emperour might be restrained from doing such euills, were the first occasions,<note n="m" place="margin">See beneath part: 1. cap: 6. nu: 24.</note> that this doctrine began first to bee practised by the said Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, it being in regard of the strangenesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, so greatly contradicted, iustified by him to bee lawfull, for which cause it was by <hi>Onuphrius</hi>

by him at large.</p>
   <p n="16">
      <hi>16 Secondly,</hi> the aduancing of them, who did maintaine this doctrine, the depressing of those, who did impugne it, the suppressing of Bookes, and the threatning of Ecclesiasticall Censures, which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse if they be vniust, are not of force in the<note n="p" place="margin">Suarez de Censuris Disp. <hi>4.</hi> sec. <hi>7.</hi> nu. <hi>2. 4. 23.</hi> &amp; seq.</note> Court of Conscience, and the indiligence of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Princes to maintaine their Soueraigntie (the causes whereof I dare not presume to examine) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the former reasons, and pretence of aduancing Catholike religion &amp;c. were the chiefe causes, why the defenders of this doctrine, did so increase in number from the time of Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the <hi>7.</hi> in comparison of those who did impugne it. But if temporall <hi>Princes</hi> would yet be pleased, to vse here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after those meanes to defend their right, and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, which <hi>Popes</hi> haue heretofore, and doe continually vse to maintaine their pretended tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall authoritie ouer <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> to depose them, to dispose of their temporalls &amp;c. in order to spirituall good, I do not doubt, but that the streame of Doctors would quickly turne backward, and my <hi>Aduersaries</hi> would haue small cause to brag (consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering especially the weaknesse of their grounds, and that their doctrine is ouerswaied by authoritie, and not by reason) that so many Authors fauour the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depose <hi>Princes,</hi> and so few the right of <hi>Princes</hi> not to bee deposed by the <hi>Pope.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="17">
      <hi>17</hi> Neuerthelesse it is also manifest, that it hath euer been contradicted by Christian Princes and people, and notwithstanding the foresaid motiues,
<pb facs="14"/>
and also the feare that some might haue, lest wicked Princes might be in some sort incouraged to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere in euill by impugning that doctrine, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be a bridle to restraine their bad purposes) it hath continually been impugned, disproued, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by learned Catholikes, as I haue cleerely proued in this Treatise. And therefore remember, into what danger of soule, bodie, and temporall fortunes, you (for want of reading and due examining,) doe throw headlong your selues, and many innocent men, who doe follow your example and counsell, for the which at the day of iudgement you are to make a most strict account, where no fauour of Man can helpe you, and willfull ignorance will not excuse you, but condemne you, and it will be too late to say then <hi>Non putaram,</hi> vnlesse you doe now, abstracting from all humane affection &amp; respects, examine duely what dutie you beare <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> what obedience you owe to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and your temporall <hi>Prince.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="18">
      <hi>18</hi> But perhaps some of you will demand, how can you by reading examine this controuersie, seeing that the Bookes, which treate thereof are forbidden by the <hi>Pope?</hi> In answer to this I will onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound at this time to your prudent considerations, whether if there should arise a controuersie betwixt the <hi>Pope,</hi> and a temporall <hi>Prince</hi> concerning the title to any kingdome, especially which that temporall <hi>Prince</hi> hath in his possession (as there is betwixt the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> touching the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Sicilie</hi>) the <hi>Pope</hi> hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to command that temporall <hi>Prince,</hi> and his Subiects not to read, and pervse those euidences,
<pb facs="15"/>
which doe make in fauour of his owne title, but onely those euidences, which doe proue the <hi>Popes</hi> title?</p>
   <p n="19">
      <hi>19</hi> Now if the reason, why my bookes are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the <hi>Pope,</hi> (or rather by the euill information, importunitie, and iudiciall sentence of Card. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> against whom, as my principall Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in this cause, I did write both my <hi>Apologie</hi> for the right of <hi>Princes,</hi> and also my <hi>Theologicall Disputation</hi> concerning the <hi>oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> which two bookes are onely forbidden, and who ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was pleased to bee an <hi>Accuser, Witnesse,</hi> and <hi>Iudge,</hi> in his owne cause) be, for that they doe fauor the <hi>oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and impugne the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depose <hi>Princes,</hi> (as all my <hi>Aduersaries</hi> confesse, that for this cause they are forbidden to bee read) then you may cleerely perceiue, that therefore my bookes are forbidden, for that they doe shew, and declare the euidences, which doe make for the right and title of temporall <hi>Princes,</hi> and their right not to be depriued, or thrust out of their kingdomes by the <hi>Popes</hi> pretended authoritie, but especially of our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne,</hi> whose case concerning this point is more singular, and concerneth him more neerely, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the opposition betwixt him, and the Popes <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> with whom he is not linked in vnitie of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and friendship, then it doth concerne other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes, who haue not the like reason to feare tumults, rebellions, and Powder-treasons, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of restoring Catholike religion in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and of hauing the <hi>Popes</hi> expresse or virtuall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence for the same; which prohibition of the <hi>Pope</hi>
      <pb facs="15"/>
to forbid such kinde of bookes, how far it can binde either those <hi>Princes,</hi> to whom it belongeth by the law of <hi>God</hi> and nature to defend their Soueraigntie, or else their Subiects, who also by the same Lawe of God and nature are bound to examine the reasons and euidences of their Princes title, authoritie, and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, least that for want of due examination they should deny to <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Caesar,</hi> that which is their due, I remit to the prudent consideration of any iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Catholike man.</p>

although I shall hereafter suffer, as hitherto I haue done, reproch, infamie, disgrace, losse of friends, and other euils, yet I will still pray for my persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and remit my cause to <hi>GOD</hi> aboue, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my selfe, that in time conuenient he will in this world, or the next, or both, be a iust Iudge reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Protector, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of the Innocent.</p>
