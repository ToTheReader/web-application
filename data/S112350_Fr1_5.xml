There did ye plainly learne vs, how to take the Canons of the Churche, and how before tyme thei haue been v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, allowed, and repelled againe by consente of the people, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="b"/> particular realmes, and did no further or otherwise binde, but as the kyng and his people receiued them. By your orations did we learne, that the Prince hath it incidently in roiall aucthoritie and belonging to his croune by Gods worde, to cōstitute lawes, to abolishe lawes, to vse any Ecclesiasticall lawes, at free will, at pleasure, lo longe as thei were thought meete for his policie: and those to be of so strong validitie, that no forren power ought once to conuell them, or to disturbe them. And to these and many other suche thinges, haue we not onely been induced, by the force of the learnyng and aucthoritie, of some one, twoo, or three of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="c"/> you, but it hath been deliuered vnto vs, as doctrine of saluation, to credite this saied aucthoritie of our and your soueraigne in his realme, by the whole consent and subscription, of all, and euery one of you, with diuerse others ioyned vnto you. In your booke intituled, The institution of a Christian man, presented by your whole aucthorities, to the kyng of famous memorie, kyng Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the. viij. where in the preface ye affirme to his highnes, with one assent by all your learnynges, that the saied treatise is in all pointes concordante, and agreable to holie scripture: yea, suche doctrine, that ye will, and desire to haue it taught, by all the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="d"/> pastours, to all the kynges louyng subiectes, to be doctrine of faithe. And there entreatyng of the Sacrament of Orders, ye desire to haue it taught, that we be in no subiection to the bishop of Rome and his statutes, but merely subiecte to the kynges la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, vnder his onely territorie and iurisdiction. And that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
<pb n="5" facs="11"/>
         <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="a"/> and rules of the Churche, were therefore alowable in the realme, because the assent of the kyng and of the people accepted the same: And that Priestes and Bishops whatsoeuer, neuer had any aucthoritie by the Gospell, in matters Ciuill and Morall, but by the graunt and gifte of Princes, and that it was alwaie, and euer shalbe lefull vnto Kynges and Princes, and to their successours, with the consente of their Parliamentes, to reuoke and call again into their owne handes, or otherwise to restraine all their power and iurisdiction, geuen and permitted by their aucthoritie, assente or sufferaunce. &amp;c. without the whiche, if the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="b"/> Bishop of Rome, or any other Bishop whatsouer, should take vpon them any aucthoritie or iurisdiction, in suche matters as be Ciuill (as matters of Mariages for the tymes and persones, bee confessed in your learnynges to bee) no doubte, saie ye, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop is not worthie, to be called a Bishop, but rather a tyraunt, and an vsurper of other mennes rightes, contrary to the Lawes of GOD, and is to bee reputed a subuertor of the kyngdome of Christe: yea, besides these thynges and many other, ye put it in our Crede and belief, as an article of saluation and damnation, that the Churche of Englande, is as well to be named a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="c"/> and Apostolike Churche, as Rome Churche, or any other Churche, where the Apostles were residente. And ye will vs to beleue in our faithe, that there is no difference in superioritie, preeminēce, or aucthoritie one ouer the other, but be all of equall power and dignitie: And that all Churches be free from the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, and iurisdiction of the Churche of Rome. And that no Churche is to be called Scismaticall, as variyng from the vnitie of the Churche of Christe, if it persiste in the vnitie of Christes faithe, hope, and charitie, and vnitie of Christes doctrine and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, agreable to the same doctrine.

At the debatement of whiche greate controuersie, <hi>Brithnodus</hi> the firste Abbotte of Elie, was presente with all the other multitude of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="c"/> Monkes, and waited and looked for helpe from heauen, and not from the yearth, from God, and not of man. And when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God, perceiued that there remained nothyng to them of right, hauyng the helpe of the Kyng and his Nobles, thei fell to supplication, wherein thei besought the Bishop, that the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes receiued in, might bee expelled out of their Churches, and that thei whiche were expelled, might bee restored. While this man of God was doubtyng, and musyng in hym self, and gaue no answere to the said request: a merueilous matter chaunced, that was neuer heard of before, will ye sée: The forme or Image <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="d"/> of Christes bodie, grauen in stone, and nailed on a crosse, set vp in somewhat an higher parte of the house, expressed the voice of man, and putte them all to silence, that were present, and saied: God forbidde that this should bee doen, God forbidde that this should bee doen: ye haue iudged well, ye should doe ill to change

         <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="a"/> it. At whiche voice, the Kyng and all the aunciente men there, were afraied almoste to death, and therevpon made the house to ryng, by their loude shoutyng, and praisyng of GOD. By this meanes (writeth <hi>Polidore</hi>) the Monkes retained the vniuste pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,<note place="margin">

         </note> by the helpe of God, or rather (saieth he) by the helpe of man, and the Priestes put backe for that time. But yet thus was not the matter ended. An other Councell was holden at Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, and an other miracle there wrought, that is: the ioystes brake, and the plaunchers fell doune sodainlie, while the matter was in examination. But holie <hi>Dunstane</hi> and all his friendes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="b"/> escaped well enough: but verie many of the residue there slaine by that miracle. This was doen about the yere of our Lorde, ix. hundred fiftie nine. Thus the Priestes loste their Churches, but yet kepte still their wiues, till Hēry the firste his daies after the Conqueste. Wherevpon is coumpted in Fabian, that Priestes had wiues in Englande, by the space of a thousande yeres and adde, after Christes incarnatiō. But then Monkes wer in suche estimation, that <hi>Odo</hi> beyng Bishoppe of Winchester, and elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Archbishoppe of Canterburie, to take that See the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lolie, professed hym self firste a Monke, as in <hi>Polycronicon</hi> is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="c"/> rehearsed <hi>lib. vi.</hi> where Treuisa the translater, reproueth that fonde superstition, seyng that neither Christe, neither his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were Monkes or Friars, saith he. Yea, wée reade in storie, that Ihon the .xiij. Pope of Rome, graunted a decree, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of kyng Edgar, and by the instigation of the foresaid three Monkishe Bishoppes, <hi>vidz,</hi> Dunstan, Ethelwolde, &amp; Oswold, that no secular Priest should be eligible to these Sees, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly professed Monkes, as by his decree appeareth. Thus we see in storie, that Dunstan, with the helpe and assistaunce of his twoo sworne brothren, Ethelwolde Bishop of Winchester, and Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="d"/> Bishop of Worcester, all three verie Monkes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fauoured the multiplication of Monkes, did put it yet to the choise of the Priestes, whether thei would forsake their wiues, or their benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      <p>Alas, alas, O Lorde God, saieth <hi>Barnard,</hi> thei be the firste in persecutyng thee, whiche be seen to loue the firste roomes in the Churche, and to chalenge the primacie. Their miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, is the miserable ruine of thy people. Thei be of a very large deuotion to take cure of soules, but as for the healthe of soules, is furthest from their thought. Alacke fewe Pastours we haue, but many excommunicators, and would to God that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="d"/> Wolle and the Milke would satisfie you, for you thirste bloude. Wherefore, wo to this generation, for their Pharisaicall leuen, which is hypocrisy, if at the least waie, it maie be called hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, whiche for the abundaunce thereof, cannot be hidden, and for impudēcie, seeketh not to be hidden.

And leste thei might bee deceiued, to take one for an other, lette them beare in mynde, that the Sermon is the .xlvij. and not the .xxxvij. for this maketh not for them. For in this thei maie reade, that fornicatiō is farre more forbidden to a Prieste, then is mariage, and there should thei reade, that Priestes had somewhere wiues, and yet in suche an abstinence, as saincte <hi>Augustine</hi> writeth, that if these aforesaid chaste Prelates, went no ofter to their harlottes, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="c"/> thei did to their wiues, their faire ladies would not bee halfe so glad, of the ouerthrowe of Priestes mariages as thei be. Well, that thei maie bee sure of that Sermon, I will tell theim how it beginneth by <hi>S. Augustine. Audite nonfratres charissimi, sed principes Sodomitarum, percipite auribus legem dei vestri po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus Gomorrae.

Therefore is your lande become a wildernesse, your cities burned vp with fire: Your countrey doe straungers deuoure before your face, and your lande is laied waste, as with the enemies inuasion.
