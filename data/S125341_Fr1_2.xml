      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough you haue gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Labours of some (as much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for your courtesie as they for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion) who might haue beene condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for presuming to importune you for their Patron; yet it would seeme a prophanation of greatnesse to place your name vpon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tispice of euery vulgar Paper, but as no Worke hath more need of your countenance, then <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of Colonies;</hi> So it would appeare to me (I know not suspecting my owne partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whither seduced by Desire, or warranted by Reason) that there is no ground whereupon your
<pb facs="3"/>countenance may shine with a more publike ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause. This is the way (making the Gospell of Iesus Christ knowne in vnknowne parts) by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the necessities of many, with a lawfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of necessary commerce, to procure glorie vnto God, honour to your selfe, and benefit to the World; By this meanes, you that are borne to rule Nations, may bee the beginner of Nations, enlarging this Monarchie without bloud, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Conquest without wronging of others, whereof in regard of your youth any good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this (like your vertue vpon which it doth depend) boding a speedie Progresse Time in your own time, doth promise a great perfection. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of greatnes (that it may haue a harmonie with goodnesse) consisting more in raysing then in rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of others, it is a farre better course to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase fame by the Plantation of a new World, nor as many Princes haue done by the desolation of this. And since your Royall Father during whose happie raigne, these seeds of Scepters haue beene first from hence sowne in <hi>America,</hi> by his gracious fauour farre aboue any merit of mine hath emboldened mee the meanest of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of his subiects to attempt so great an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, as to lay the foundation of a Worke that may so much import the good of that ancient
<pb facs="3"/>Kingdome, where so many of your Ancestors were buried, and where your selues were borne. I haue both by reading what doth rest vpon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and by conferring with sundry that haue beene imbarked in such a businesse, beene curious to remarke the managing thereof, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of times past might with the lesse dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at the charges of others, improoue them that are to practize at this present. And the fruits of my Labours I doe humbly offer heere vnto your Highnesse, hoping by the commendable endeuours, therein remembred (though it selfe be but a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiall Treatise, not worthy your sight) to conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate your good opinion towards them that are to aduenture in this kind. Amongst whom (if euer my fortunes haue any conformitie with my mind) I purpose to contribute as much as my weake abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities can bee able to affoord for accomplishing this braue Designe, wherein my greatest Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall be that both this Age and the Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie may know how much I desire by some obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect to be remembred for being</p>
