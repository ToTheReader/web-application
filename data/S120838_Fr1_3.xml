   <head>TO THE WORTHIE, LEARNED AND INDICIOVS GENTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, WILLIAM REDMAN of great <hi>Shelford,</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Cambridge</hi> Esquire.</head>

   <p>It is a prescription of such priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and so familiar a custome at this day, to dedicate Books to some person or other, either of great place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or of honorable minde and disposition, that hee keepes not <hi>Decorum</hi> with these times, that accompanies not the same course. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion at first was propagated by two parents, <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Care:</hi> the one rising from the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted good conceit of the Patron: the other to preuent the malice of detractors vnder the shield of Protection: for weakenes hath need of helpe and supportance, as well in Politique as Naturall bodies, so likewise in the studies and labours of the minde. Such, whose fame goes still before them to dilate their actes, craue no
<pb facs="3"/>
other Apologie then their owne worthines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their power is able to defend them: but in priuate and inferiour studies, that want counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in themselues, the extensiue power of greatnesse giues strength and encouragement to intensiue weakenesse, when our indeauours (though vnworthie of acceptance) are suffered in their insufficient age to growe vp, and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the defensiue bulwarke of Protection, against the stormes of enuious, and calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tongues, that by continuance through vse and practise they may happily afterwards proue worthie of regard.</p>
   <p>Knowing therefore your eminent knowledge in matter of learning, and that you are a Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in all the faculties of the minde: in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I beare this worke to your worthy iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: presuming, in the want of mine owne worth, to shield the same vnder your worthines, and to passe it vnder your patronage, against the sowre humours of such, as still doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet value themselues by detracting from others; for <hi>Liuore nihil sublimius,</hi> and dogges euen by Nature must barke against the Moone.</p>
   <p>The worke I consecrate vnto your view, is as a Tree spreading with diuers branches, and
<pb facs="3"/>
bringing forth seuerall fruits, in which if any of them proue pleasing and acceptable to your tast and liking, I shall hold the paines well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, that haue brought the same to such ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and perfection, and pretermit no times or occasion, wherein I may shew my thankfull remembrance of your loue in some worthier la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour hereafter: but euer rest,</p>
