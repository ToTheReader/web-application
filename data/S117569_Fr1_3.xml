   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Know not what <hi>Apologie</hi> to make for my selfe, that now in the copious multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of <hi>Treatises</hi> of this nature, I should yet thrust forth more, as though I could be a poore meanes to bring vnto thee any new matter, which by some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Worthy had not beene said before. And surely, this had almost discouraged me, vntill I called to mind the speech and counsell of a <hi>Right Reuerend Father of the Church,</hi> (yet aliue) which was, <hi>That if a thousand seuerall men had all written on these seuerall subiects: yet he could wish them all Printed. For (said he) though all doe agree in the maine, yet should we see a different carriage of elegancy and variety of the same spirit in the diuers distributions, amplifications, and prosecutions of the same subiect;</hi> Whereby (at least) this profit would come, that the soule might now and then be rauished in the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rarities of that <hi>Wonder-working-spirit,</hi> which so diffuseth it selfe in choyce of excellent abilities (all exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site and diuers) among such multitudes of seuerall men. This with the delight I tooke in reading, trimming and writing them out (with very much adoe) together with the desire I had to doe some poore seruice to the Church, and perpetuate the memory of the <hi>All-deseruing, most worthy, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Author</hi> (sometime my deare friend) imboldened mee to venter them vnto thy view: at the request of his som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time <hi>deare Wife</hi> and Executrix. I beseech thee therefore, fauourably, to censure what is done, accepting the same in good part, from him who chused rather to present thee with a few <hi>Crummes</hi> which fell from this <hi>Holy mans Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
then altogether bury in silence with him, his <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Workes.</hi> True it is, he wrote an infinite, intricate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding small abreuiated hand: out of all hope and possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be read (a fault yet incident to too many good Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, whereby they robbe Posterity of their Labours) by reason whereof, these three Treatises (mangled as they are) were, with much adoe, by a painfull Writer, and other helpes, fetcht (as it were) out of the fire, and so brought to this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect perfection. <hi>The former two</hi> by him were neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the publike view: onely that of <hi>Repentance,</hi> with his owne Epistle, he had appointed for the Presse, at our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest intreaty, but left it vnfinished to his mind. Therefore if therein thou findest any thing pleasing for thy good: and so canst measure <hi>Exvngue Leonem:</hi> iudge, if the <hi>Eccho of his voyce,</hi> the <hi>traces of his foot-steps,</hi> be such in <hi>scattered vnperfect Notes;</hi> what were those <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>Excellent Straines of Learning</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> wherewith he was most Plentifully indowed, and wherewith this Booke had beene more abundantly stored if his exact curious hand had lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it out for this vse. Much more I might say of him, but why should I? seeing it were but to extenuate the worth of such a shining and a burning <hi>Lampe,</hi> by labouring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, that which was vnexpressable, and which my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was neuer able to reach or search into. Onely my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest vnto thee now is, to forgiue my weakenesse, and those <hi>mangling mistakings,</hi> which (by my ignorance and want of iudgement to dispos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> aright) are found therein: assuring thy selfe I meant well, though I could not reach the Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Author as I wished; nor amplifie his breuities (as not daring to meddle with <hi>Apelles vnfinished Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture:)</hi> which great fauour shall bind me yet further to ayme at thy good: remaining in the meane time,</p>
