   <p>
      <note place="margin">The encrease of Papists in this Kingdome.</note>In the meane time, it is certaine that Papistes, vpon what false grounds I know not, (considering his Maiesties heroicall and constant Resolution to maintaine the puritie of the Gospell) bragge much of their number and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes within this Kingdome, whereby they haue encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their malicious zeale, in so much as they seeme to be euen almost ready to breake forth into actuall Rebellion. I will not speake of the multitude of pestilent <hi>Books,</hi> which they haue lately brought into the Realme, to moue Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor of the flocking hither from beyond the Sea of whole swarmes of <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> besides two <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine Prouincialls,</hi> with their fellow <hi>Locustes,</hi> who are said to haue shared the Kingdome betwixt them, to prepare the people for their purpose; nor of their labouring to ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enate the common peoples affection from their loyaltie towards his Maiestie; nor of their pernicious <hi>Libelling</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the State; nor yet of their <hi>Insolencie</hi> and <hi>Rage</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the persons of some particular Ministers and others that stood in their way: Onely their furie and malice may be partly gathered by their outragious and enormous fact lately committed at <hi>Enborne</hi> in <hi>Barkeshire,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ontragious parts plated by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes as Enborne in Barkeshire.</note> as may appeare by this parcell of the Libell they left behinde them, in the Church; which in perpetuall detestation of their insolent Libelling-spirit I thought good here to insert, as foloweth.<note place="margin">

      <note place="margin">The Papistes vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent carriage an argument of their imminent ruine.</note>This violent carriage of the Papistes in time of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, as it doth sufficiently declare their more then Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolicall audacitie, if they had libertie granted them: so vnto me, it is an euident argument of their imminent ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; For in deadly diseases, it is commonly seene, that before the period of death, the patient is wont to receiue some small strength, which vnto the vnskilfull giues hope of perfect recouerie, but vnto the learned Physition, as the extreamest endeuor of Nature, is an infallible token of certaine death.</p>
   <p>To this end, at the commandement of such whom in the Lord I am bound to obey in all things, I haue penned this subsequent <hi>Tractate,</hi> wherein I haue proued <hi>the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfullnesse and Danger of Toleration</hi> of promiscuous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of diuers Religions, aswell by <hi>Lawes, Diuine and Humane;</hi> as also by <hi>Reason</hi> and the woefull <hi>Experience</hi> of such as euer found themselues deluded by humaine Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or Policie.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Of Toleration of Heretiques.</note>If any man shall aske, whether I thinke it altogether vnlawfull for a Christian Prince in any case to tolerate Heretiques, within his dominions, where true Religion is setled: I answer, that I thinke I haue manifestly proued in this Treatise, that the exercise of a contrarie Religion ought not to be admitted; because it prouoketh the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and wrath of GOD against the whole Land, exposeth orthodoxe Christians vnto the danger of Gods reuenging furie, and breedeth contempt of Religion.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Of Heretiques co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitatiō amongst true Christians.</note>But if Question be made concerning the cohabitation
<pb facs="5"/>only of such with vs: I answer, that submitting my selfe, I willingly commit that vnto the grauer iudgement of such as haue experience of publique affaires, and exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all Antiquitie: albeit I am perswaded, that all Christian Princes ought carefully to labour, as much as in them lieth, that Heretiques do not inhabite together with Orthodoxe Christians: they should waigh whether Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Church, and Common-wealth by mutuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change receiue any thing which may more benefit them. So that I thinke,<note place="margin">Note will.</note> onely Ciuill and Politique Reasons, as the profit of some Citie or Prouince, greater gaine in traffique, enlargement of buildings, or encrease of reuenewes, are not to be regarded in this case; if they be compared with the mischieuous &amp; wilfull contempt of Ecclesiastique and Ciuill Magistrates, and with the certaine danger of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting good Citizens, who can hardly touch pitch, and not be defiled therewith: especially by such as are wholy bent to peruert and infect aswell their owne children &amp; friends, as their fellow-citizens and neighbours. Almightie God, Lord of Heauen and Earth, of his infinite mercy and loue in Iesus Christ, giue his Church rest, and deliuer vs from this great plague of Popish Heresie. <hi>Amen.</hi> Farewell good Reader.</p>
