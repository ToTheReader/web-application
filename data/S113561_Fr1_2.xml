Peace, Peace is so fixed, but the varietie to
which all things worldly are subiect, may giue
necessary, and vndelayd occasion to the Theorie
of warres, if not their practise; if neither, yet
the knowledge of both, being by long and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
experience so substantially turnd into
the powers of your minde; the vnequall subiect of this resolute and
deadly siege, cannot but adde one welcome forme to your discourse,
and finde some of your emptiest minutes fit to vouchsafe it accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
The bloodlesse and quiet transformation it receiues from my
tributorie labours; wanting so much life of the death and actuall
excitations it naturally presented, I knew must want as much of the
Honor and fire it should confer to the Protection and spirit of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier:
but I know withall, the lost liues of so many resolute and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
Commanders, hauing a little restitution made them in this
willing remembrance, will finde no lesse cherishing and strength of
propagation in your liuing disposition: to whose true Nobilitie and
