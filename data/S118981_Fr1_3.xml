   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN
READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing minded (Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Reader) to publish
in Print my Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made at Paules
crosse, I thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
to make thee
priuie what occasions
mooued me heereunto. First therefore know
that the request of a worshipful frend of mine,
and his reason for the same alleged were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
and chiefe motiues in this matter: his
manifolde good turnes on the one side did so
greatly binde me, that by denying his reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and godly demand, I should haue spotted
and defiled my selfe with the ignominious, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
&amp; beastly staine of ingratitude which
I haue alwayes in all men discommended and
hated, and in my selfe (to the vttermost of my
power) shunned and auoided: on the other side,
his reason proposed did, as it were, command
me for my countries good, to bring to publike
view my weake and vndeseruing labors. His
reason was, that as I had, in alienating the
faithfull children from the obedience of their
naturall mother, bin a publike hurt (the scar
whereof would long be a blemish in that faire
<pb facs="4"/>
spouse the Church of Christ) so I might hereby
vse a publike meanes, both to heale the wound,
and also (if it were possible) to take away the
scarre. His demand seeming euery way both
reasonable, necessary, &amp; not to be denied, I cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discended:
considering also with my selfe, that
as I had done great hurt in the church of God,
so I was in cōscience bound to make her all the
satisfaction for the same that I could. To these
motiues I added further certein cōsiderations
of mine owne, why it was necessary that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> thing
should be printed: which were these. First,
that I might shew a reason for the satisfying of
euery man, why I did omit some things which
were thought necessary by diuers to haue bene
spoken of, as Transubstantiation, Indulgences,
Seruice in an vnknowen tongue, &amp; such like:
whō I desire to remaine satisfied with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.
My purpose &amp; meaning was not at that
time to discourse of cōtrouersies, or particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one by one to confute euery error, for that (as
euery wise man knoweth) had bene impossible
for me as then to haue performed: for euery
error and controuersie doth minister sufficient
matter for a whole, yea, for many sermons, but
my cōming thither was to no other purpose, but
to confesse &amp; acknowledge my fault, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to renounce and abiure all those false o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
which I once held. Neither do I think
<pb facs="4"/>
it greatly necessary to make any supply in this
Preface of those supposed wants which before
I mentioned: onely I desire thee (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
to haue this opinion of me, that, although
I haue but spoken of a few particulars, yet that
(according to my protestation made) I haue
a generall, and faithfull detestation of all the
rest, as my future life and labours (by Gods
grace) shall sufficiently witnesse. Wherefore
rest not discontented or vnsatisfied in any
thing, but if haply thou be driuen to any doubt
through the malicious suggestion of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
or thine owne infirmitie and weakenesse,
know that in such cases thou art bound both
in religious charitie and Christian duetie to
reforme and remooue such corrupt &amp; vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
opinions against thine euen Christian,
or at the least suspend thy iudgement in what
matter soeuer that is not too openly manifest
&amp; apparent. Carie not a suspicious &amp; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
iudgement of the trueth and sinceritie of
my soule, for feare of iudging thine owne soule.
<hi>In quo enim iudicio iudicaueritis,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note>
      <hi>iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimini:
&amp;, In qua mensura mensi fueritis,
remetietur vobis.</hi> With what iudgement
you iudge other men, you shalbe iudged: and
with what measure you mete, the same shalbe
measured to you againe. But thinke that I
am a Christian as thou art, and haue a care
<pb facs="5"/>
to please God, as haply thou hast, and haue fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowledge in spirituall matters then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one, to whom the perusing of these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
may come, &amp; therefore do know in more
ample sort, that hypocrisie and double dealing
with God and his Church is a double wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
at whose girdle there hangeth a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
scourge and punishment. Remember that
thou art admonished by the the Apostle Saint
Paul,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> not to iudge another mans seruant for
he doth either stand or fall to his master; that
is, to God, before whose tribunall we shall all
stand, and giue an account euery one for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
let vs not therefore, sayth he, any more
iudge another, but iudge this rather, that no
man put a stumbling blocke, or an occasion to
fall in his brothers way. My meaning here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou mayest easily gather, and God grant
thou may vse it to the benefite of thine owne
soule, and Christes small flocke.</p>
   <p>The second cause that mooued me to the
publishing heereof, was the good that might
hereby grow to those that be but lightly infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with Papistrie, that by my example, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my conuersion, and reading my Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they may be mooued to consider, for the
safetie of their soules, the great perill and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
danger wherein they doe continually
liue, and so they may call to God for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<pb facs="5"/>
vnction of his holy spirit, and the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
gift of his grace, that may cure their
wounds, and leade them to the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his pure trueth. And those that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
by my doctrine &amp; example haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or doe goe astray, may by these meanes
(which I heartily aske of God for his sonne
Iesus Christ his sake) be reduced againe into
the right way: and for mine owne part I shall
for euer heereafter haue the testimonie of a
better conscience, that I haue not bene negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
herein to performe the duetie of a good
Christian, in putting such in minde of their
estates, and shewing them the meanes (the
like wherof, if they aske it as they should, God
doubtlesse will not denie them) of my conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
If I had contented my selfe with the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
matter, and not haue proceeded any
further to publish the same, the world might
haue layed some blame on me, and reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me for lighting of a candle, and putting
it vnder a bushell, but being put on a candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke,
and left indifferently to giue light to all,
not presently, but for posterity, I shall be, I
hope, in this behalfe, free from the calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any.</p>
   <p>Consider I pray thee (deare Christian) if
thou bee a Papist, or any thing addicted that
way, that thou canst not imagine any sinister
<pb facs="6"/>
cause for the which I should (as they say) haue
turned my coat; the greatest cause of all things
which thou canst thinke of, is worldly wealth,
which on that side I neuer wāted, nor any thing
els that was cōuenient either for my pleasures
or necessities, and therefore I had no cause for
that to forsake them, if I had not bene induced
thereto by further consideratiōs &amp; means, thē
is the regard of worldly cōmodities: but cōtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywise,
(as thou shalt more largely vnderstand
in my recantation) they were the onely things
that for a lōg time withheld me frō embracing
the pure waters that spring to euerlasting life.
But perchance thou wilt say, I hoped for better
then I had, beleeue me no, I neither hoped for
better, nor haue so good; notwithstanding (if I
should be driuen to beg my bread) let all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
in the world know, that I will not forsake
the kingdome of heauen for this worldes good,
neither doe I make my bodily life more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
then my soule: for what would it profite
me to winne the whole world, and to lose my
soule? or what exchange should I make
with God for my soule? I know they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
me againe, if I would like a dog returne
yet to my vomite, but farre be that from me:
better it were for me neuer to haue bin borne
then once to thinke on any such matter, and I
hope, God that hath done thus mercifully by
<pb facs="6"/>
me, and delt thus mightily with me, hath not,
nor will not bestow his grace in vayne vpō me,
but will perfect his worke so effectually begun.
The last cause that moued me to publish these
presēts, was, to assure the aduersaries (to whose
hands I am sure they wil come) that I neither
haue done, nor hereafter wil doe any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thē of malice, but in all my procedings I
haue, &amp; will deale as charitably as I can, not
betraying the trueth of God, which I preferre
before the estimation of the whole world: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would I haue any mā to think, that I speak
as though I did any thing at all relie vpō their
good opinions of me, for that I am assured they
hate me as the deuil, and will not sticke to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
all the labour they can to deface and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite
both me and my calling. But let them
not spare, their enuious carping will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
in them the lying spirite that ouerru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them, and euery one that is not as blinde
as themselues, will soone perceiue their <hi>legier
de maine:</hi> and although their buzzing will
obtaine place in the eares of their complices
and fautors, who are alwayes ready to bandie
the balls which their leaders tosse, so farre as
the slanderous blastes of their wicked mouthes
will cary them, yet I hope the force of them
(flie they neuer so stiffely) shall not bee able to
make winke the least child in Gods Church,
<pb facs="7"/>
much lesse ouerthrow him.</p>
   <p>Moreouer I doe heartily desire euery
Christian reader to weigh with good conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
these presents. Yf thou be already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with error and blindnesse, pray to God
that he will bestow vpon thee the cleare light
of his truth: persist not wilfully in wickednes,
but take occasion hereby to sift and try the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that is aswell in thy selfe as in thy teachers,
if thou be ignorant and vnlearned, builde not
thy faith vpon the credite and good opinion of
other men, say not (as I know many haue and
doe say) I am not able to render an accompt
of this or that thing, but I know it is true, I
must beleeue so, because this learned man, or
these diuines, and good men beleeue so: aske,
them, they are able to giue you an answere
both for themselues &amp; me: it is a weake buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that hath so shallowe, and vncertaine a
foundation, and a simple faith is it that is pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
so slenderly to other mens sleaues: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
Saint Peter biddeth thee to bee able
and readie to render an account of thy faith
to euery one that shall demand it at thy hands,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note>
I meane not that thou art so exactly bound as
he that teacheth both thee and others, but in
some good measure according to thy abilitie,
and the talent that God hath lent thee, thou
art bound to knowe what thou beleeuest, in
<pb facs="7"/>
whom thou beleeuest, &amp; what thou art bound
to beleeue. Build not therefore thy faith vpon
the faith of other men, for that foundation
cannot chuse but faile thee, but erect thy buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vpon the immooueable rocke Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
of whom the scriptures doe most plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beare witnesse.<note place="margin">Iohn 5.</note> Art thou learned? search
the scriptures for in them ye thinke to haue
eternall life, and they are they that testifie of
me, &amp;c. Art thou vnlearned? goe to thy
Pastor, goe to him that hath charge of thy
soule, and receiueth instruction from God for
thee, The Priestes lippes shall preserue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
&amp; thou shalt seeke the law at his mouth,
for he is the messenger of the Lord of hostes.<note place="margin">Mal. 2.</note>
So thou seest whether thou be learned or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
thou art without excuse if thou be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
in thy duety, because God of his great
goodnesse and infinite mercy hath left thee
sufficient meanes to come vnto him, for which
cause we were all created, I meane truly and
duetifully to serue God. God hath created all
things both in heauen and earth for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe
and benefite of man, but hee hath made
man onely for his owne selfe, for his owne ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
wherein to be negligent and ignorant, is
a hie contempt of God, &amp; meere ingratitude
for his manifold benefites. If hitherto there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou hast beene negligent and blinde, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
<pb facs="8"/>
thy time with thy future diligence.
What shall I say (deare Christian) but onely
this, leaue the muddie and troubled waters,
which thou drawest out of the durtie pits of
mens imaginations, and returne to pure
springs and welles of life, where thou mayest
freely without money or danger drinke thy
fill, and so satiate thy selfe, that thou shalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thirst againe.</p>
   <p>Those whom God hath called in his feare,
I doe earnestly wish to bee warie how they
walke, and carefull that they be not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
by any maner of false prophets: if at any
time thou conuerse with them by chance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
God to giue thee strength and grace not
to be tempted, if thou be tempted, that it be not
aboue thy strength. <hi>Qui stat videat ne ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat,</hi>
hee that standeth let him take heede hee
fall not: for wee carie this treasure that God
hath giuen vs in vessels more brittle then
glasse: for glasse is not more subiect to brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
thē our bodies (which ought to be the tē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the holy Ghost) be subiect to pollution by
sinne, and our soules to bee infected with false
doctrine, which will seeme in the mouth as
pleasant as hony, but in the throate it will bee
more bitter then wormewood and gall. It is
like a canker which creepeth secretly, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
infected is most hardly killed. Wherefore
<pb facs="8"/>
if thou wilt not be bitten with the snake, sleepe
not neere the hedge: hee that toucheth pitch,
must needes cary away some stayne, and the
Mariner that harkeneth to the Syrene shalbe
in danger of shipwracke: so hee that will curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
talke and hearken to the papistes sweete
perswasions, shall scape very hardly, (such is
the outward face &amp; shew thereof) but he shall
be intrapped, <hi>(expertus dico,</hi> I haue tried it)
and therfore giue credence to me that knowes
more therein then thy selfe, and wish thee so
much good as my selfe.</p>
   <p>Lastly, I am to giue thee to vnderstand
(good Reader) that for sundry causes I haue
hereunto ioyned my first recantation made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in a publique assembly, where I am to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
thee not to looke for any expresse methode
of my speeches therein, as in this other, for I
neuer meant to publish it eyther in print or
writing, but was only requested to make know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to some of my friendes, by way of declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
what I had done, and nowe it is thought
meete to publish it in the same forme together
with this: whereby thou mayest consider how
willing I am to make such sufficient satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Church of God as my abilitie may
extend vnto, and how glad I shal be if any one
doe take benefite by my labours. And for that
I knowe it a thing impossible that any one
<pb facs="9"/>
worke should please euery man, but that there
will be some fault foūd, &amp; either the insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of the man, or the maner of his methode,
or the raggednesse of stile, or some such like
matter will bee reprehended, because it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to the scanning of farre more sufficient
persons then the Author himselfe commonly
is, (though one man sometimes is as sufficient
as another) some also are more ignorant, and
therefore can not iudge vprightly, and some
are curious, and seeke rather a fine and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
phrase, then the sounde substance of the
matter, and because they are sicke of the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
there remaineth a great corruption in
their taste, so that nothing will please them bee
it neuer so conuenient and fit for them: for
my part I regard not the slanders of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious,
nor the scoffes of the curious, nor the
blunt bolts of the foolish, but as in humilitie I
vndertooke these labours for the causes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayde,
so in humilitie I offer them for the
benefite of the good and vertuous, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of any other gayne but of their good
prayers, which if I obtayne, my paynes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited,
and my selfe satisfied. Vale.</p>
