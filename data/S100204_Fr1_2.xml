   <p>WHen the Children of Israell had sinned against the Lord, he delivered them over in the hands of spoylers, and sould them into the hands of their enimies round about, so that they could not stand before them, <hi>Levit. 26. Deut. 28. Iudg. 2.</hi> Our estate is so, we have transgressed his laws with an high hand, and yet we have not hearts to lament it as we should, nor eies to see the hand of God goe out against us in all we sett our hands unto, both in peace and warre; but we attribute all to secondary causes, &amp; looke not to the Lord against whom we have sinned: some of us can see that our best Nobility and valiantest Captains and Souldyers, are cutt off by indirect means, and our wealth and honour consumed, to our great reproach and ignominie. Yet we do not observe it as we should, and what a fearfull estate our land now stands in, this short treatise doth shew amongst them that beare sway, or at least might be heard by the rulers, <hi>All seek their own, and no man that is Christs.</hi> Some of them pretend to be conversant for him <hi>in superficie boni,</hi> but it is indeed <hi>in alto mal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

What true heart will not bring help to quench this fire? alas it will be vain to bring water when the house is burnt to ashes.</p>
   <p>Who will not at least crye when he seeth his mother murdering, I will conclude with the Apostles words: <hi>Lord save us else we all perish.</hi>
