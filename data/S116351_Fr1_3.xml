      <salute>DEare Reader:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>It may seeme strange vnto thee, that an <hi>Hermit,</hi> whose entertainment and conuersation, ought chiefly to be in solitude, meditation, &amp; contemplation, should trouble himselfe in his <hi>Cell,</hi> with the turbulent controuersies of this tyme, in matters of faith which in former ages, when innocencie, and vertue most florished, euery Christian receaued with his baptisme, after most constantly to hould and professe the same, all the dayes of his life. yet so it fell out, that in conuersing with dyuers <hi>Puritans,</hi> I found by experience, that out of ignorance and want of knowledge what our visible sacrifice is, by whome it was instituted or to what end, they hate it, more then they doe Iudaisme, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme, or Paganisme it selfe, in such sort, that they obiect our offering of visible Sacrifice, as one of the chiefest causes of their alienation from vs; when in truth, and veritie, exterior visible sacrifice, is the cheef exterior visible honor, which is due to God, as he is
<pb n="6" facs="4"/> God, and Creator of all things, as will appeare by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, if we shall passe through all the exterior visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worships, respects, &amp; reuerences, which are vsed by men in this life: and it is so due vnto God alone, that it may not be giuen vnto any Creature, or false God, vnder penaltie of high treason against his Deuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, punishable by death as witnesseth his lavv, and euerlasting decree saging. <hi>He that sacrificeth to Gods shall be put to death: But to our Lord only.</hi> So that the first motiue, which moued me to wryte of this subiect, was the grosse ignorāce, and blindnesse I found in many <hi>Puritans,</hi> who commonly would bitterly inueigh against our visible sacrifice, not knowing what it was, nor wherfore it was instituted; for otherwyse I suppose they would not be so vehement against the honour of God: &amp; therfore thought with my selfe, for the honor of God, and good of their soules, to wryte plainly and manifestly of this subiect, without any flourishing words, or loftinesse of style, or farr fetcht inuentions, to make euery well minded simple Protestant, or Puritan (who will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyghted with truth) capable to perceaue and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that the exterior visible sacrifice, or <hi>Masse,</hi> which he so much hateth is the cheef exterior visible wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp, which doth belong vnto God alone, that he may
<pb n="7" facs="4"/> also defend the honor of God and not oppose it.</p>
   <p>Secondly the emminencie &amp; excellencie of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Alter is so greate, that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in the 24. chapter of his first booke <hi>de peccatorū meritis,</hi> calleth it <hi>The lyfe of the world:</hi> S. Ignatius disciple to <hi>S. Iohn</hi> the Euangelist, <hi>The medecine of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and antidote against death; S. Epiphanius,</hi> in his Epistle to Iohn of Hierusalem, <hi>The chiefest saluation of Christians,</hi> vvhich before God is also so highly pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that vvhen through wickednes of men, and of Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, it shall be quyte taken a way out of the face of the earth, the world shall end, as witnesseth our fauiour saying, <hi>The bread which I will giue is my flesh for the lyfe of the world. Iohn.</hi> 6. 51. for euē as when lyfe is takē from a man a man dyeth: so when the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Lord, shall be taken out of the world, by the meanes of wicked men, and of Antechrist, the world shall be consumed with fyer, as witnesse <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. 27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 15. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. Which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered &amp; fynding the passion of the Puritans of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so furious against this said Sacrament of the Alter as to esteeme the reuerence &amp; respect, which is due vnto it, Idolatrie, and so to persecute it, that if it lay in their poners, they would not only extirpate it
<pb n="8" facs="5"/> out of this Iland of great Britanie, but out of the whole globe of the earth, to bring in their fancie of eating a peece of bakers bread: The honour of my lord, the saluation of their soules, and the lyfe of my Countrie, moued me to abstract some howers from my ordinarie recollections, to defend with my penne the dignitie of so emminent a Sacrament. If this worke of myne fall short of thyne expectation, accept of my good will, which is, if it were in my poner, te giue all honor vnto God vnto whome all honor and glorie is due, and vnto thee, Reader, lyfe of eternall lyfe: and so Irest thy seruant in Christ Iesus.</p>
