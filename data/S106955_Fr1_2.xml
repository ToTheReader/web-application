   <p>When upon just grounds (as I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and am confident) I appealed from Parties and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to your Sacred Majestie for iustice in so waighty a cause, as here is presented before you: I thought long ere this to have had the happines, to have presented both an humble Petition, and Apologie to my Appeale to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, in mine owne person. But two causes especiallie hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred mee: the one, Gods hand of visitation in this Citty, which continuing so long and great, I durst not make my approch to the Court, and chiefly to Your Maiesties Sacred Person, least I might give offence: the other (and which of the twaine is much more perillous to my selfe) the Pursui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants continuall watch about my dore, threatning to catch
<pb facs="3"/> me, and make mee fast, or run my Countrey (as he saith) so as I cannot passe in or out, without present danger. And I confesse I have small list to come into that Lions denne, <hi>Quia me vestigia terrent:</hi> not that I am affraid of any such ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as not if conscious to my selfe of any such crime as they lay to my charge; but (as the Apostle said in the like case) <hi>If I bee an offender, or have committed any thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, I refuse not to dye: but if there be none of those things whereof they accuse me</hi> (as matter of sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>no man may deliver mee unto them: I appeale unto Cesar.</hi> And blessed bee God, that I have such a Christian <hi>Cesar</hi> to appeale unto. Neither yet have I neglected what possible, or probable meanes I could use in Court (being an old outcast Courtier, worne out of all favour and friends there) for the conveying of my said Apologie to your Maiestie but in vaine. So as being now out of all hope of acquainting your Maiestie with so great a cause, by that way and meanes as I desired: I am at length compelled to give forth copies, in hope at least, that some well minded man, or noble sparke, may upon the sight thereof (considering how neerely it concerneth the peace, safety, welfare, and honor of your Maiestie, and Kingdome) bee inflamed witb so much zeale to your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, as overcomming all cowardlie feares, to dare to doe you so much worthie service, in bringing a Copie to your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties hand, that so you may therein read the many and great disasters and dangers, where into this your Kingdome is in a precipitancie of being ingulfed, &amp; accordingly in your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely Prudence provide a timely remedy▪ before it be past hope. And the rather conceived I this way so the more necessarie, that comming haply into the hands of some of your Wise and Sage Counsellors, <hi>Davids</hi> friends, they might be a meanes not
<pb facs="3"/> onely to bring it to your hands, but the more to ingage your Maiestie to the perusall of it; considering how many would bee readie to ease your Maiestie of such a commoditie: And now, my Gracious Soveraigne, as I have ever bent my chiefe Studies to your Maiestie the best and faithfullest service I possibly could: so I am persuaded I could not in all my life have had a fairer and fitter opportunitie to expresse my fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to your Maiestie then now, in a case so important, as if your Maiestie shall but take sound notice of it, it may prove the happiest service, that ever a poore subiect could doe to his Prince and Countrey. Nor am I ignorant, how busie many would be to divert your Maiestie from the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such matters, as this; as if the great affaires of a Kingdome pertained not to the King, but that hee might take his pleasure, and leave the care of his Kingdome to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But my Lord the King is Wise, as an Angell of God, considering whose vicegerent hee is, and before whose awfull Tribunall he must give a strict account, how he hath manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged so waightie a charge of so many soules committed to his trust. Againe, what censures may I expect of them, who cannot indure to have their deeds brought to the open light? They will be readie to charge me with Popularity, Faction, Sedition, and what not, and all for thus bringing their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the open stage. But first, they will (I hope) excuse me, when they shall reflect upon themselves, and consider in cold blood how they have provoked mee, by their calling mee forth upon the stage, and by their strange molesting, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting of me, as if I were a fellon, or a traitor: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for as much as they declare their deeds, as <hi>Sodome,</hi> and hide them not, and with a high hand maintaine them too, which is the highest pitch of all impiety: can they with
<pb facs="4"/> any reason blame me, for divulging their practises, which they shame not to pester your Kingdome, and oppresse your good people withall, who therefore have need publickly to be warned of them, least they be seduced by them?</p>
   <p>But not to detaine your Maiestie longer, bee pleased to read over this my Apologie of Appeale to your Maiestie, that your Maiestie may both discerne the depth of the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, and may be pleased thereupon to rescue your old ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant out of those troubles, which hee suffereth for discharging a good conscience towards God, and your Maiestie. Now the Lord give you understanding in all things.</p>
