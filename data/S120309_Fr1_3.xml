   <l>
      <hi>Mancinus</hi> first, and I by him to Vertue shevv the vvay.</l>
   <pb facs="6"/>
   <l> For Vertue is the foe in deede vvhom Vice doth deadly hate:</l>
   <l>And euer yet betvvixt them hath there ben a foule debate.</l>
   <l>And though that Syn hath greater gard and souldiers moe in fielde</l>
   <l>Than Vertue hath, yet Vertue shall enforce the beast to yelde.</l>
   <l>Off shal his head from shoulders go,</l>
   <l>Synne shall be sinne no more,</l>

   <l>As vvho so follovves hym shal come to Vertue vvith a trice.</l>

   <l>Euen so <hi>Mancinus</hi> by this path vvill teache thee how to slie</l>
   <l>The <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of lothsome sinne vvhere Vice and he do lie,</l>
   <l>Delighting in the fall of man and feeding on his soule</l>
   <l>As did that Fiende vpon the men of <hi>Athens</hi> in the hole.</l>
   <l>And loke hovv much the soule excedes this earthly bodies masse,</l>
   <l>So much the monster Synne the beast of <hi>Creta</hi> doth surpasse.</l>
   <l>VVherfore let be our earnest care vvith ioyned hartes and hande</l>
   <l>Against this Sinne on Vertues side vvith sworde and shielde to stande.</l>
   <l>March on your vvay by <hi>Prudence</hi> Path, for there are men of wit</l>
   <l>To make you shevv vvher Vertue dwells, a house for harbour fit.</l>
   <pb facs="7"/>
   <l> From thence there lies a crooked vvay not easie to be founde</l>
   <l>Without a guide and fellovv mate, a harde and rockie grounde:</l>
   <l>VVhere ioyfull <hi>Iustice</hi> sitts in seate and avvefull rule doth beare,</l>
   <l>A happie man is he that can dispatch and soiourne theare.</l>
   <l>The iourney is not farre from that vvhere <hi>Fortitudo</hi> dvvells,</l>
   <l>A famous Dame that all the rest in courage stoute excells.</l>
   <l>Where vvhen thou happen to ariue, be Bolde and neuer blushe:</l>
   <l>For there, there can no cruell care thy minde or carkas crushe.</l>
   <l>When thou vvith these acquainted art, to <hi>Temperance</hi> take thy vvay,</l>
   <l>And do vvith hir as farthest place of trauaile make thy stay.</l>
   <l>For she vvill so thy doings guide and in such modest vvise</l>
   <l>Applie hir care to thy behoofe as best she can deuise.</l>
   <l>She vvill those luring Pleasures pinche, and sause their sugred tast.</l>

   <l>Hovv hard a vvay from <hi>Prudence</hi> to the lodge of <hi>Temperance</hi> lies.</l>
   <l>This, this assured is the meane to maister Monstrous Syn,</l>
   <l>And conquere Vice, that by report this Tovvne of late did vvyn.</l>
   <l>March on, let <hi>Mancine</hi> be your guide, if he the banner beare</l>
   <l>And stately standerde in the fielde, you nede not stande in feare:</l>
   <l>For he so vvisely vvill prouide and deale in ery case,</l>
   <l>As if that Ladie Vertue vvere there prest hir selfe in place.</l>
   <l>For eu'ry vice a Vertue he vvell furnisht hath in fielde,</l>
   <l>For euery sinne a countermate to force the Foe to yelde.</l>
   <pb facs="8"/>
   <l>So that though Syn vvere <hi>Hydralike</hi> and head of head did spring,</l>
   <l>Yet Vertue should the Conquest gaine, and Vice to bondage bring. <note place="margin">The cōquest of Sinne.</note>
   </l>

   <l>VVhose great report of late yspread and rashly so vvas blowne.</l>
   <l>Then (Reader) thou beholding art and must of force confesse</l>
   <l>Thy selfe in debt to him that did this perfite Path addresse:</l>
   <l>A meane to come vvhere Vertue sitts in pompe and princely Cell,</l>
   <l>And teacheth men the vvay to liue and waste their ages vvell.</l>
   <l>And thus with sute for pardon for this long discourse of mine,</l>
   <l>My tale doth ende, my boke begins which (Reader) shal be thine.</l>
   <l>Reade right, and deeme by due deserte, mislike not ere thou see</l>
   <l>VVhat is the ende of this discourse that here I giue to thee.</l>
