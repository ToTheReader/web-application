   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Reuerend Author of this
Booke, hauing now full twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
yeeres since, in his publike
exercises finished a very large
Treatise vpon the Decalogue,
or ten Commandements of
Almighty God, was then pleased at my ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
entreaty, and for my priuate vse, to collect
and gather out of that large Treatise, the
summe and heads of what was therein more
largely handled, which I purposed still, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his first intent, to haue kept by me for my
priuate vse: but since, hauing been often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned
by many learned and religious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb facs="3"/>
for the loane thereof, whereto I had almost
yeelded, had I not considered the wrong and
iniurie which thereby might redound to the
Author, if the same should happen to be printed,
either by some vnperfect copy, or vnder the
name of some other, especially, if euer the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
should be pleased to publish those his larger
volumes. And therefore for satisfaction of the
request of my friends, I endeuoured to gaine
the Authors consent to the publishing heereof;
which hauing obtained, I have now put the
same in print for the publike and generall good,
and doe dedicate the same vnto you, not onely to
be a helpe to you in your priuate meditations in
the Law of God, but also as a testimony of my
thankfulnesse for your many fauours both to me
and mine. The Almighty God make it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for the end intended: to whose blessed
protection I commend you, and will euer rest</p>
