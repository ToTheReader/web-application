      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ew bookes of diuers sorts you haue plentie (louing Readers) some bookes are written for to comforte the afflicted in minde, &amp; confirme the faith of the godlie, suche are the bookes of the learned Diuines, godly Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and faithfull Ministers of God his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woord, some bookes are written to incitate pleasure, to prouoke carnall lustes, to feede fancies, to nourish vice, to maintaine pride, and to magnifie vnhonestie, the authours of these bookes are men voide of godlines, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of their saluation, addicted to selfe will, the instruments of Sathan, and men pleasers in iniquitie, they that buy &amp; embrace bookes wherin consisteth matter of defence in true religion, or a plaine discouery of the hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of the wicked, or the manifestation of the corrupt liues of suche as fight against their own consciēce, (I meane Papists.) What Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piste is there of any knowledge, learning, or reading in diuinitie, but he knoweth, seeth,
<pb facs="5"/>and readeth the trueth. D. Alen. D. Bristow, D. Nicolson, Parsonnes, Campion, &amp; others, were sometimes Protestantes, but nowe as Demas, Crescens, Titus, and Alexander, they are departed from vs, because perhaps they woulde not, nor coulde not anie longer abide with vs, what shall I say of the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie men the most part of them all, forsooke their Countrey for want of liuings, for want of maintenaunce, there are fiftie Schollers in the English Seminarie at Rome, that coulde not tell what shift to make for their liuing here in England, therefore being loth to bee taken as vagrantes, and burnt in the eare as Roges, they thought it farre better for the auoyding of this infamie to hazarde their soules, to keepe their eares whole, and their necke bone vnbroken, they feared maister Recorder of Londō very much, they thought it good to proue the Popes liberalitie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the trueth, which before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, and in acknowledging him to be their Christ, to be their Messias, to be their Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah. And for some succour sake, they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly faine themselues to be Papistes, but inwardly the most part of them doe see the trueth, and confesse they are in a wrong way,
<pb facs="6"/>some of them oftentimes tolde me at Rome, whose names I omitte to put in writing, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their conuersion, (that the Romish faith was not the true faith.) Foure of these with mee determined very often, secretly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake Rome, and returne to our countrey. But these foure Schollers, by their familiar frindes and fellowe Schollers, were with much a doe perswaded to remaine at Rome, vntill by their Rectours they shoulde be sent to England. But as for me, what I once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to do, by the sufferāce of god, that I thought to bring to passe, perswasions coulde nothyng cause me to change my purpose, I was perswaded by diuers, both by the Iesuites and by the schollers to remaine at Rome, but I woulde not, nor coulde not vnlesse I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaired of my saluation, as I did during the time of my sicknesse, for that in hypocrisie I liued as a Papist, my conscience striued so mightily within me, that I feared not in talke with my fellowes to speake against the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe religion, insomuch that oftentimes I was at Rome called heritique. I appeale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them for testimonie of this trueth that haue heard mee so speaking at Rome, but what is this to the purpose, greater was my
<pb facs="6"/>sinne, that for any temporall liuing, I shoulde forsake my God, wherefore very often trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled I am in conscience, and grieued in mind that I committed such an horrible offence in the sight of God. In deede I must needes confesse that I beleeued vnfaignedly a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasticall life to haue beene allowable before God, I graunted inuocation of Saintes, and as for transubstantiation I doubted, these two pointes of the Romish religion, I did hold a little before my conuersion at the Towre, to haue bene firme and agreeable to God his holy worde, and as for the thirde point which was transubstantiation, I could not tell what to thinke therof, but nowe God be thanked I am resolued in these three points as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiā ought to bee, this treatise is called the book of Pilgrimage, for that in my perigrina<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiō I haue seen with mine eies the most things which I haue written in this booke for your instructiō christian readers, not for any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of mine, estimation, fame, or glorie to bee gotten thereby, as the Papistes doe surmize, I am briefer then I woulde bee, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are certaine bookes scattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst mee, and against my workes, whiche bookes if I may geat, I meane God willing to
<pb facs="7"/>pourge my selfe of the slaunders and false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes of the aduersaries, I take no great pleasure in writing, greater pleasure would I take to applie my studies, but seeing that the Papistes seeke to deface my sayings, it is reason that I should defend mine owne cause as farre forth as I may, if they flow in termes of Rhetorique, and seeke to shadow the truth with their subtilitie, I woulde be contented with a plain stile, so that I were able to bring forth somewhat in defence of truth. I craue the spirite of mildnesse, and not the spirite of scoffing, and taunting, which spirite they neuer want. Farewell louing readers, God graunt you a perfect faith and to me likewise, and also for my former sinnes and hypocrisie, the fatherly visitation of God here in this worlde, that I may once feele Gods loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes me a sinner, an abiect and wormes meate, God be mercifull vnto me, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme my faith. God forgiue me mine hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, my wicked life, and lewde behauiour, God giue me grace neuer to commit the like trespasses against his diuine maiestie, in word or deede. Be thou fauourable O Lorde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sion, build vp the broken walles of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, forsake not thy Sanctuarie, but saue
<pb facs="7"/>thine elect from the pernitions customes of the wicke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Such as are gone astray, God bring them home, such as are conuerted, God make them strong, such as are, and euer herevnto haue bene in the true faith of Christ, God giue thē perseuerance vnto the ende, and in the ende, suche as are wicked, God make them good, God increase the number of his elect, God make vs all his faithfull seruantes, to raigne with him in glory, and blisse in his kingdome of euerlasting ioy.
