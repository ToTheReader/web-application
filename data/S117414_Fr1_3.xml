   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is availeable for the better entertainment of this
worke to know something concerning the <hi>Author,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>worke</hi> it selfe, and concerning the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
for the <hi>Author,</hi> my acquaintance with him
was especially towards the declining part of his yeeres;
at what time (as they speake of the Sunne towards set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)
the light and influence which comes from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
men is most mild and comfortable. The gifts of
men then (perhaps) are not so flourishing as in their younger time; but yet more
mature, and what commeth from them is better digested. In the prime of his
yeares hee was trained up in <hi>S. Iohns Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> being there fellow
of the House; and for Piety and Parts esteemed highly in the <hi>University,</hi> of
those that excelled in both. Afterwards he grew to that note, that he was chosen
to reade the lecture in <hi>Pauls,</hi> succeeding therein that great l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ned man, <hi>Doctor
Andrewes,</hi> late <hi>Lord Bishop</hi> of <hi>Winchester,</hi> which he discharged, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the satisfaction, but to the applause of the most judicious and learned hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
witnessed by their frequency and attention. Not long after he was removed
to a pastorall charge in <hi>Clavering</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> where being fixed till his death, hee
shined as a starre in his proper spheare.</p>
   <p>This good mans aime was, to convey himselfe by all manner of wayes into the
heart, which made him willingly heard of all sorts; for witty things onely, as they
are spoken to the braine, so they rest in the braine, and sinke no deeper: but the
heart (which vaine and obnoxious men love not to bee touched) that's the marke
a faithfull teacher aimes to hit. But because the way to come to the heart, is often
to passe through the fancy, therefore this godly man studied by lively representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to helpe mens faith by the fancy. It was our <hi>Saviour Christs</hi> manner of
teaching, to expresse heavenly things in an earthly manner. And it was the
study of the wise man <hi>Salomon</hi> (becomming a Preacher) to finde out <hi>Pleasant
words,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 10.</note> or <hi>words of delight:</hi> but when all paines is taken by the man of God,
people will relish what is spoken, according as their taste is. It falleth out here as
it doth in a garden, wherein some walke for present delight, some carry flowers
away with them to refresh them for a time, some as Bees gather honey which they
feede on long afterwards; some spider-like come to sucke that which may feede
that malignant and venemous disposition that they bring with them. <hi>There
cannot be a better Character of a man, than to observe what hee reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
most in hearing:</hi> for as men are, so they taste, so they judge, so they speake:
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> (besides Propheticall gifts fit for so high a calling) had no doubt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
<pb facs="4"/>
manner of expression of himselfe, whereupon the wickeder sort of Iewes
(engaged in sinfull courses) came to heare him,<note place="margin">Eze. 33. 32.</note> but as a Musitian to please their
eares, neglecting the authoritie of his Person, and the weight of his message, its
no wonder therefore if in these dayes people sticke in the barke and neglect the pith,
though sometimes it falleth out with some as with <hi>Augustine</hi> hearing <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
whilst they bite at the baite of some pleasing notions, they are at the same
time catched with the Spirits hooke.</p>
   <p>Hee was skilfull in the originall languages, and thereupon an excellent Text<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
well read in writers that were of note, in the severall ages of the Church,
which made him a well-furnished and able Divine, his judgement was cleere, and
his conscience tender; and which helpt him most, he brought to the great worke of
the ministerie an holy and gratious heart, which raised and carried him to aimes
above himselfe and the world. In his conversing he was modest, fruitfull, wise, and
winning: in his expressions witty, and gracefull, in so much that hee hath left a
fresh and a sweet remembrance of him, untill this day. Towards his end her grow
more spirituall, setting light by all things here below, and onely waited (as his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
was) for the comming of the <hi>Comforter:</hi> at length (his worke being
finished) breathing out his life,<note place="margin">Revel. 22. 20.</note> with that wish of the spouse, <hi>Yea, come Lord
Iesus.</hi> Thus much I thought not unfit to be made knowne of the Man.</p>
   <p>Now for the <hi>Worke</hi> it selfe it must be considered by the learned Reader, that
these things were spoken though to a People high-raisd in knowledge, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
than ordinary by his teaching; yet to the People; not with a purpose that
they should come to the view and censure of the learned. But though they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to the peop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>▪ yet are they not so popular, but (if my love to the man and
the Worke deceive me not) they will have the best Reader, either more learned,
or more holy or both. It must therefore bee remembred, for the more favourable
acceptation of this Worke, that these Sermons were taken by one of his Parish, a
man though pious and of good parts, yet not skilfull in the learned languages, and
therefore it must needs bee, that many apt and acute sentences of the Fathers (by
which this learned man did use to beautifie and strengthen the Points hee delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
are fallen to the ground and lost, for lacke of skill to take up. But howsoever
much of the spirits bee lost, yet heere you have the corpes and bulke of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and not without some life and vigour, wherein this is peculiar in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of handling, that hee hath chosen fit texts of Scripture, to ground his exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of every article upon.</p>
   <p>Now for the <hi>Argument</hi> it selfe the <hi>Creed,</hi> I thinke it fit to premise some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
because it hath beene omitted by the <hi>Author,</hi> or at least not gathered with
the rest. The <hi>Creed</hi> is of middle authority, betweene divine and humane, and
called the Apostles <hi>Creed,</hi> not onely for consanguintty with the Apostles
Doctrine, but because it is taken out of the Apostles writings, and therefore of
greatest authority next the Scriptures. It is nothing else but <hi>A summary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the counsell and worke of God concerning our superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
condition heere and hereafter.</hi> The Doctrine of Salvation is spread
through the Scriptures, as spirits in the Arteries and blood in the veines, as the
soule in the body. And heere (for easier carriage) the most necessary Points are
gathered together, as so many pearles or pretious stones, that we might have a
ready use of them upon all occasions: being as it were a little Bible or Testament,
<pb facs="4"/>
that Christians of all rankes (as suited for all conditions) may beare about with
them every where without any trouble. In every <hi>Article</hi> there is both a shallow
and a depth, milke for babes and meat for strong men. Though there be no growth
in regard of fundamentall Principles (which have beene alike in all ages of the
Church) yet there hath and will be a proficiencie, in regard of conclusions drawne
out of those Principles. The necessities of every Christian, and the springing up of
unsound opinions in the Church will continually inforce diligence and care in the
further explication and application of these fundamentall truths.</p>
   <p>It will not therefore bee amisse to set downe a few <hi>Directions</hi> for the more
cleere <hi>understanding</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> and for the better making <hi>use</hi> of it. And
first, for the <hi>understanding</hi> of it. It hath the Name of <hi>Creed,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1</note> or <hi>Beleefe,</hi> from
the act exercised about it, to shew that it doth not onely containe Doctrine to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
but that that doctrine will doe us no good, unlesse by mingling it with our
Faith we make it our <hi>Beleefe,</hi> therefore both the <hi>Act</hi> and the <hi>Object</hi> are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in one word <hi>Beleefe.</hi> Secondly, from the <hi>Execution</hi> in creation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
wee must arise to <hi>Gods decree,</hi> nothing done in time, which was
not decreed before all times,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 18.</note>
      <hi>knowne unto the Lord are all his workes,
from the beginning of the world.</hi>
      <note place="margin">3</note> Thirdly, wee must arise from one
Principall Benefit to all that follow and accompany it, as in <hi>forgivenesse of
sins,</hi> follow <hi>righteousnesse, Peace, and Ioy;</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Sanctification,
Christian liberty, &amp;c.</hi> though the Articles be nakedly propounded, yet are we
to beleeve all the fruits and priviledges. <hi>So to Gods creating of heaven and
earth,</hi> we must joyne his <hi>Providence</hi> in upholding and ruling all things in both.
Fourthly, in the <hi>Consequent</hi> wee are to understand all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> went before by way
of <hi>Cause</hi> or <hi>Preparation,</hi>
      <note place="margin">4</note> as in the <hi>Crucifying of Christ;</hi> his preceding
<hi>Agony,</hi> and the <hi>Cause</hi> of it, <hi>Our sinnes,</hi> and the love of God and Christ in
those sufferings,<note place="margin">5</note> &amp;c. Fiftly, though we are to beleeve <hi>Circumstances</hi> as well as
<hi>the thing it selfe</hi> yet not with the same necessity of Faith: as it is more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to beleeve that <hi>Christ</hi> was crucified, than that it was under <hi>Pontius Pilate:</hi>
though when any Circumstance is revealed, we ought to beleeve it, and to have
a preparation of minde to beleeve whatsoever shall be revealed: yet in the <hi>maine
points</hi> this <hi>preparation of minde</hi> is not sufficient, but there must bee a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
and an <hi>expressed faith.</hi> We must know that as in the Law he that breaketh
one Commandement breaketh all,<note place="margin">6</note> because all come from the same authority, so in
the grounds of faith he that denies one in the true sense of it,<note place="margin">Fides non eligit objectum.</note> denies all, for both
Law and Faith are copulatives, the singling out of any thing it contrary to the
obedience of faith.</p>
   <p>For <hi>Particular and dayly use,</hi> wee must know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> First, that every <hi>Article</hi>
requires a <hi>particular faith,</hi> not onely in regard of the Person beleeving, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in regard of the <hi>application</hi> of the Article beleeved: or else the Dev <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>
might say the <hi>Creed,</hi> for he beleeves there is a <hi>Creator,</hi> and that there is a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes, &amp;c.</hi> but because hee hath no share in it, it inrageth him the
more. Our adversaries are great enemies to particular faith, and thinke we coine
a thirteenth Article, when wee inforce particular assurance, because (say they) par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men are not named in the Scripture, and what is not in Scripture cannot
be a matter of faith. But there is a <hi>Double Faith, a Faith which is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
wee doe beleeve,</hi> and <hi>Faith which is the grace whereby wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
and this Faith is matter of <hi>Experience</hi> wrought in our hearts by the
Spirit of God. It is sufficient that that faith which wee doe beleeve is contained
in the Scriptures. Now whereas they object that we make it a thirteenth Article,
their fourteenth Apostle adds to these twelve many more articles of faith,<note place="margin">Bulla Pii quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</note> which
he inforceth to be beleeved, with the same necessity of faith as these twelve; neither
hath he onely entred upon Christs prerogative in minting new articles of faith,
but likewise they have usurped over all Christian Churches by adding <hi>Romane</hi>
to the Catholike Church in the Creed. A bold imposture.</p>
   <p>But for speciall faith, the maine office of the Holy Spirit is, <hi>In opening gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Truths, to reveale our particular interest in those Truths, and to
breed special Faith whereby we make them our owne,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 11, 12.</note> because the Spirit of
God reveales the minde of God to every particular Christian; for as the things
beleeved are truths above nature, so the Grace of faith whereby we beleeve, is a
grace above Nature, and created as a supernaturall eye in the Soule, to see supernaturall
truths.</p>
   <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2</note>
      <hi>Where sacred truths are truely apprehended, there the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
workes an impression in the soule sutable to the things beleeved:</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Article hath a power in it which the Spirit doth imprint upon the Soule.
The Beleefe of God to be the <hi>Father Almighty,</hi> breeds an impression of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
reverence, and comfort. The Beleefe and knowledge of <hi>Christ crucified,</hi>
is a crucifying knowledge. The true knowledge and faith in <hi>Christ rising,</hi> is a
raising knowledge; the knowledge of the <hi>Abasement of Christ,</hi> is an abasing
knowledge, because faith sees it selfe one with Christ in both states. We cannot truly
beleeve what Christ hath wrought for us, but at the same time the Spirit of Christ
worketh something in us.</p>
   <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> it is convenient for the giving of due honour to every person to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of <hi>the worke appropriated to every one:</hi> all <hi>come from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
all are <hi>exactly performed by the Son</hi> in our nature for the Redemption
of those that the Father hath given Him. The <hi>Gathering</hi> out of the world of
that blessed society (which we call the <hi>Church</hi>) into an holy Communion and the
<hi>Sanctifying</hi> of it, and <hi>Sealing</hi> unto it all the priviledges believed; as <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse
of sinnes, Resurrection of the body, and Life everlasting, &amp;c.</hi>
proceed from the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4</note> it hath pleased the great God to enter into a <hi>Treaty and covenant
of agreement</hi> with us his poore creatures, the articles of which agreement are
here comprized. God for his part undertakes to convey all that concernes our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
upon our receiving of them, by beleeving on him. Every one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
that recites these articles (from a spirit of faith) makes good this condition,
and this is <hi>that answer of a good conscience,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note> which <hi>Peter</hi> speakes of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
being demanded what our faith is; every one in particular answeres to every
Article, <hi>I beleeve;</hi> I not onely understand and conceive it, but assent unto it in
my judgement as true, and consent to it in my will as good, and build my comfort
upon it as good too me: this act of Beleefe carries the whole soule with it.</p>
   <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5</note> though it is wee that answer, yet the power by which wee answer,
is no lesse than that, whereby God created the world, and raised Christ from the
dead. The answer is ours, but the power and strength is Gods whereby wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
who performes both his part and ours too in the covenant. It is a higher
<pb facs="5"/>
matter to beleeve, than the common sort thinke it. For this answer of <hi>Faith</hi> to
these truths as it is caused by the power of Gods Spirit, so is it powerfull to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
all temptations of Satan, all seducements of the world, all terrours of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from the wrath of God and the curse of the Law, it setteth the soule as upon a
rocke above all.</p>
   <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6</note> these Articles are <hi>a touchstone at hand to try all opinions by,</hi>
(for crooked things are discernded by bringing them to the rule) what directly or by
immediate and neere consequence opposeth these, is to bee rejected as contrary to
the platforme of wholesome doctrine. That one monster of opinions, <hi>of the bread
turned into the body of Christ by transubstantiation,</hi> overthrowes at once
foure Articles of the Creed; The <hi>incarnation of Christ, Ascension, Sitting at
the Right hand of God, and comming to judgment:</hi> for if Christs body
be so often made of a peece of bread, being in so many places at once here upon
earth, how can all these Articles be true?</p>
   <p>Againe,<note place="margin">7</note> seventhly, these grounds of <hi>Faith</hi> have likewise <hi>a speciall influence
in direction and incouragement unto all Christian duties:</hi> A holy life is
but the infusion of holy truths: <hi>Augustine</hi> saith well, <hi>non bene vivitur, ubi be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
de Deo non creditur:</hi> men of an ill beleefe, cannot be of a good life, wherupon
the Apostles method is, to build their exhortations to Christian duties upon the
grounds of Christian Faith. But we must remember, that as faith yeelds a good
life and conscience: so a conscience is the vessell to preserve the Doctrine of
Faith, else a shipwracke of faith will follow. If there bee a delighting in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
there will not be a love of the truth, and if we love not the truth, then
there will be a preparednesse to beleeve any lye; and that by Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> just judgement,
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
   <p>Eighthly,<note place="margin">8</note> as these fundamentall truths yeeld strength to the whole frame of
a Christian life: So <hi>they are so many springs and wels of consolation for
Gods people to draw-from:</hi> whereupon that good Prince <hi>George Anhalt,</hi>
(whom <hi>Luthers</hi> time became a Preacher of the Gospell) intending to comfort
his brother Prince <hi>Iohn,</hi> raiseth his comfort from the last three Articles,
<hi>Remission of sinnes, Resurrection of the body, and Life Everlasting:</hi>
which as they have their strength from the former Articles are able to raise any
drooping spirit, and therefore in the greatest agonies, it is the readiest way to
suck comfort from these benefits: But I omit other things, intending onely to say
something by way of <hi>Preface.</hi> And thus <hi>Good Reader,</hi> I commend this worke
unto thee, and both it and thee to Gods blessing.</p>
