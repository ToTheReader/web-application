   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN
READER, GRACE AND PEACE
from God the Father, and from the
Lord Iesus Christ &amp;c.</head>
   <p>DEARELY beloued in the truth, you haue in this booke
an answere to an answere written vnto Master Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
at Middleborough by Master Cartwright vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of controuersie betweene them concerning the true
spouse of Christ or his ordinarie visible Churches in Englande,
And it is thought good to put this aunswere before the saide aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
of Master Cartwright. And although the godlywise, and
such as haue onely the glorie of God before their eyes and his pure
Religion and seruice together with the saluation of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
will easily perceiue the reasons, and causes: yet least anye
might take offence in this offence in this behalfe, it is though meete
to shewe some. The first reason therefore is this. Our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is more prone and readie to imbrace the errour of man then
the trueth of God Another cause was for that our vntowarde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is so great, that if an vntrueth be once receiued, it worketh
such a preiudice in the heades and mindes of men, that they will
heare neither God his worde, neither reason or argument to the
contrary be it neuer so good and effectuall. A thirde cause moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to place this answere first, for that it shoulde bee an occasion
vnto the Reader, to vse more diligent conferring of this aunswere
with the other, for the better discerning and finding out of the
trueth in this controuersie. It is not necessarie that any man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose
his iudgement at this tyme, but to attende by prayer the
good euent which God will giue for the further manifestation of
his trueth, and abolishing of the contrary. Nowe these fewe lynes
<pb facs="3"/>
are thought in this matter sufficient, least it might seeme to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudge
any trueth in either of these answeres, or else by accepting
of persons to foster corruption, or a lye in any thing set foorth in
the Name of the Lorde. It is expedient therefore that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
be faithfull searched by the godly Reader, to see whether
these thinges be euen so or not. For no man that feareth God is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the doctrine of our Sauiour christ, that whosoeuer
breaketh the least of the commaundements of God, and teacheth
men so, is least in the kingdom of heauen. Neither ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
&amp; vniuersal doctrine of god his word, true repentance, vnfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
faith with amendment of life, to be necessarie vnto saluation.
But it is said before, these fewe things suffice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the faithfull Reader is to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the grace of God, for his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
direction in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
farewell deare
brother in the
Lord.</p>
