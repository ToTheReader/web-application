   <head>A
SECOND ADVERTISE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to all Priests and Jesuites
of the English Seminaries,
wishing to them Grace,
and Peace in Christ
JESUS.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Epistle (I confesse) is
somewhat large, yet so, that
as it is much necessary, both
for you to read, and for
mee to write, that you may know the
Reasons, whereby I seeke to perswade
Others, that they are not to expect
from you any Reall and conscionable
Answer to that <hi>Booke of the Masse,</hi> by
occasion whereof some of you have
used so vile, vehement, and malignant
detractions and calumniations against
mee. For, first, as that Painter in <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
who as soone as hee had finished
his Picture, in his opinion perfect, and
<pb facs="9"/>
to life, betooke himselfe behinde the
Table, to harken what fault any Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator
should finde with it. I likewise
after the publishing of that Booke,
convincent as I thought, stood atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to understand what exception any
Reader would take: and behold▪ as
there a shoomaker intruding himselfe
among other spectators, and noting
the fashion of the Girdle in that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
to be amisse, was answered by
that Artist, <hi>Ne Sutor supra crepidam:</hi>
even so hath one adventured to impute
Mis-allegations to that Booke, in such
manner, as deserving to be dismissed
by the Author in this sort, <hi>Ne Sciolus
supra Captum:</hi> the exceptions being
such, that it may well be said of them;
<hi>The very repeating them is a refuting
them,</hi> as some also have acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Yet hath this beene of late, your
onely manner of answering, although
it be indeed but a meere Tergiversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that is, a shamefull flying all the
forces of confutation of your Romish
Masse; as men in battell, seeking to
<pb facs="9"/>
evade, when they are in despaire to
invade.</p>
   <p>The experience which I have had
hereof, heretofore, may be to mee a
ground of prophesie for the time
hereafter, to wit, that no Reall answer
shall be had from any of you. And <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>
I call it, when <hi>Res cum re, Ratio cum
ratione concertat,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> speaketh; but
not that which is exercised onely in
Cavillation, about words and syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables.
For were the exceptions now
taken by your Objector never so true,
yet notwithstanding, what then
would become of his cause? but are
they false? what then shall wee thinke
of his conscience? let these two be put
to the tryall. First, do you not know,
that when two witnesses of Ten are
disabled, yet the other Eight, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the eye of Justice untouched,
and untainted, must carry the cause?
Suppose therefore that those few <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,</hi>
against my <hi>Allegations,</hi> were
true, yet how should five, or, if it were
fifty erroneous Citations prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="10"/>
two Thousand (for I conceive
they are no fewer) other Testimonies
therein faithfully alleaged in the same
Booke? whereby your <hi>Ten</hi> Romish
<hi>Transgressions</hi> against one command of
Christ [DO THIS,] are abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
your many Romish <hi>Depravations</hi> of
the sense of the Holy Ghost, in those
words of Christ, [THIS IS MY
BODY] are infringed; the Romish
<hi>Novelty</hi> of your doctrine of <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi>
is discovered; your sixe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
<hi>Contradictions,</hi> against the truth
of the <hi>Bodily nature of Christ,</hi> are confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
the Romish <hi>Capernaiticall eating of
Christs flesh</hi> is exploded; and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
<hi>Sacrilegious Sacrifice,</hi> together
with her <hi>Idolatrous worship</hi> in her <hi>Masse,</hi>
is irrefutably condemned.</p>
   <p>As for false Imputations of fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
as they must needs be damnable
to the Author, who accusing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his owne guilt, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>,
<hi>condemneth himselfe,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 1.</note> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
teacheth: so, to the party un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
taxed, it cannot be but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="10"/>
of advantage and estimation; for
Brazen plates, fixed on grave-stones,
(you know) the more they are trod
upon by mens dirty feet, the greater is
their luster, and brightnesse, as soone
as the dust is but blowne away. Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably
the more the Accusations be,
which are unjustly charged upon any
Adversary, the more shall his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
flourish, as soone as the fraud &amp;
falshood of the Accuser shall be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
except it be among men that
so stupifie their conscience, that they
will not see even that which they see.</p>
   <p>Such a one, of your owne order,
some few moneths past, having onely
so much modesty, as to conceale his
own name, dehorted a Knight by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
from reading the Observations,
which I had concerning the Masse, by
putting him in minde of M. <hi>Parsons</hi>
Booke of <hi>Sober Reckoning,</hi> objecting
Mis-allegations unto mee: but suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all mention and memory of my
<hi>Encounter,</hi> in answer unto him, by
whom he was proved to be indeed but
<pb facs="11"/>
a <hi>Drunken Reckoner,</hi> yet not with
wine, but with a farre worse spirit of
lying, as your owne fellow-<hi>Priests</hi> will
tell you, in the sequel of this discourse.</p>
   <p>Another reason may be, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of those Bookes of <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
Appeale, Encounter, Causa Regia,</hi>
which (notwithstanding many promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or rather threatnings of Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring)
have laine still upon your hands;
beside the former booke of the <hi>Romish
Grand Imposture,</hi> which woundeth the
very <hi>Head</hi> of Romish religion, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Church,</hi> even as this other
doth strike at the fat <hi>Belly</hi> thereof,
your <hi>Romish Masse.</hi> So that this later
Booke may seeme to be secure, till that
be first assaulted, seing that, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
of nature, every sensible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is prone, above all parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to defend the head.</p>
   <p>But principally am I confident, I
shall have no other answer to this
Booke, except onely either a <hi>Nihil
dicit,</hi> or a <hi>Nihil ad rem,</hi> not because it
is my booke (For I alas, I am but the
<pb facs="11"/>
      <hi>Collector,</hi> and Composer) but because
it is yours, fighting against your <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Masse,</hi> with your owne <hi>Principles,
Conclusions,</hi> and <hi>Confessions;</hi> as also
confronting you with your owne <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
Absurdities, Falsifications,</hi>
and <hi>Perjuries, (Bis perit, qui armis suis
perit)</hi> beside the evidences of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
and <hi>Fathers,</hi> which are imprei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
All these are so many <hi>Barraca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi>
to hinder all approach, against
the Materialls of that Booke. I may
not conceale from you a Riddle. It was
but some few weekes since your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Lord intimated unto mee, that
my Booke of the Masse is to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and that he thought he could take
that Opponent off, for some time. My
answer then was, that the dayes of my
life could not be long, but whatsoever
length of dayes God should give mee,
I could not bestow it better than in
defence of his Truth, and therefore
desired his L<seg rend="sup">p</seg> to let the party whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
take his course. Howbeit the
dog-trick, which once M. <hi>Parsons</hi> plaid
<pb facs="12"/>
with mee, would not suffer me to give
saith to that Insinuation, who avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in print, that my bookes of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi>
were then in answerin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> by a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
at <hi>Gratz</hi> in <hi>Austria,</hi> assigning also
the time when it was to be published;
when as he, honest man, beleeved it
not himselfe, but spake it onely by his
Equivocating spirit of Mentall Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
(being a great Master in that
blacke art himselfe) and thereby hath
taught me how to expound the words
of this Lord delivered unto mee. The
<hi>Booke</hi> (saith hee) <hi>will be answered</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
in his minde) when yesterday
shall be to morrow: &amp;, <hi>a Iesuite hath it
in hand</hi> (sub-understanding to burn it;)
and <hi>that hee will goe thorough it</hi> (bearing
in his thought) with an aule, or a
needle: and, <hi>It will be a Booke of some big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
(meaning) mathematicall, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible.
So that this your <hi>will-be</hi> is but
that old lesson, learnt at <hi>Rome,</hi> from
the <hi>Crow,</hi> which sitting on the Top of
Tarpeys hill, cryed still <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by that Poet, <hi>Est quia non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit
dicere, dixit Erit.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="12"/>
I returne to your selves, lest that
you may thinke this Discourse to be
tedious, know then that the Lord, the
Opponent, will tell you a <hi>merry Tale</hi>
by the way; nor may you thinke this
<hi>Rejoynder</hi> unnecessary, seeing that the
Lords Reply hath already inveigled
Lords and Ladies so farre, as to thinke
his Exceptions answerlesse. But be
you (Beloved) lovers of <hi>Truth,</hi> from
what Organ soever it come, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Apparell it shall appeare. For,
<hi>God is Truth.</hi> Thus writeth hee, who
promiseth unto you certaine <hi>Additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls</hi>
to the now impugned <hi>Booke of the
Masse,</hi> of such requisite Explanations,
Confutations, and Corroborations, as
will dispossesse, I hope, even the spirit
of Prejudice it selfe, out of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
and conscionable Reader, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, as will shortly be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
if God permit. Our Lord Jesus
preserve us All to the glory of his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Grace.</p>
