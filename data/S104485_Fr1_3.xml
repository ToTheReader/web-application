   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>entle Reader, my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
inclining to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
induces me
sometimes, to seeke in
my Closet for some diversion, in
the reading of Bookes, suteable
to a Gentlewoman of my quality,
and of eighteene yeeres of age;
That is it wherein I have most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
applied my selfe this
Christmas, and amongst the rest,
in the reading of this Booke,
which hath pleased me; not only
for the subject whereof it treats,
but also, comming from the
hands of an Author, whose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb facs="7"/>
I honor, though of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Beliefe to mine, because that
being in France, in my Parents
company, I have heard a great
esteeme to be made of him, as of
the most learned Prelate of his
time. So as I might make my selfe,
so much the more perfect, in the
French tongue, I resolved to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate
it, for my owne particular
satisfaction, having no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
then to warme my selfe
therewith; as I have done with
some others: But I could not
make this Worke so secretly, but
that those who watch over my
actions, and endeavour my diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
had notice thereof, by whom
I have beene in a manner forc'd
(least <hi>I</hi> should trangresse against
<pb facs="7"/>
the Law of God)▪ to expose it to
the publike view; And all the
favour which <hi>I</hi> could obtaine,
hath beene to suffer mee to make
choice of a second ARGENIS,
under whose Protection <hi>I</hi> sent it.
And J intreat thee, <hi>Gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
to oblige me so farre, as not
to presume that J doe it, out of
vanity; because it is not without
example, and could produce thee
many of my sexe, who have traced
me the way, witnesse the translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into French of Sir <hi>Philip
Sidneys Arcadia,</hi> the <hi>New Amaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi>
and the <hi>Vrania,</hi> with many
others; neither have I done it to
be spoken of, knowing very well,
that those of, my sexe, who are
least spoken of, are the more to
<pb facs="8"/>
bee esteemed: But onely have I
done it by meere obedience and
duty, therefore I pray thee to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the faults, if there be any, and
remember, that women (for the
most part) are unacquainted with
the studie of Sciences; and by
that meanes, may sooner erre; Also,
I esteeme that thou art Courteous
enough, to use mee according to
the courtesie and custome, due to
the Ladies of this Countrie, where
I was borne; And of whose Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
I make use, giving ARGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIS
the precedency, rather then
unto POLIARCHVS in the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tispice
of this Booke; And in so
doing, <hi>I</hi> shall not be a little obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to thee.</p>
