   <p>WHen I see you peremptory to be good; I iudge your vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse no lesse then your Vertue; and I thinke most men haue my thought, though not my way. They iudge you vnhappy, because your Honour is not as large as your goodnesse; and they thinke kindly, though not exactly: that being no part of your vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, because no part of your desire. But I iudge you most vnhappy, in that, being a rare example of Vertue in our Age, you want the comfort of that example, which other good men enioy in the direct contemplation of you; and you enioy not, through your owne modestie: which denyes you the reflectiue contemplation of
<pb facs="3"/> your selfe. And since it hath beene your fauour (and my blessing) to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit mee to the prospect of your faire actions, I knew not how to returne a more cunning thankes vnto you, then to present vnto you another prospect; the gratefull prospect of our late So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, and of your loued Holder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; who may very well stand thus neere in fame, hauing beene as much vnited in danger and deliuerance. And still it is so farre from being an vntruth, that it is not so much as a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxe to affirme, that They both liue; and, by their preseruation, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue not only the Gowries, but also their owne Funerals. By the Sword of the Gowries they could haue beene but proued to be mortall: but by the execution of the Gowries they are
<pb facs="4"/> prooued to bee immortall, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did not die then, they shall neuer die; nay, they are able to giue life to their Epitaphs. And, only by this aduantage of the argument, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance euen this trifle may steale into Posteritie: though, alas, my desire is, that it may only last, till this story bee deliuered to Fame and Enuie, by some nobler pen, then this rude one of</p>
