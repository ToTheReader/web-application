The latter, that hauing found more fauour at your H H. hands, then euer did anie, (my case well considered) both reason, consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and duty requireth, that your H H. should receiue the first fruites or testimonie of my true repentance, because in hope thereof you exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded your fauor, eue to spare his life, that iudged himselfe most worthie of death, and still doe from the bottome of my heart, for so deepely dishonouring my fauiour <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and so greatly abusing her Maiestie, your <hi>H H.</hi> and all Christian people: But as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith in the 32.
