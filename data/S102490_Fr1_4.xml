      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo Cities the Spirit of God by the pen of all the Prophets setteth out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the vision of peace, or the perfect peace; and <hi>Babylon</hi> the confusion of this peace. Wherefore <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> are the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all the Prophets from <hi>Esay</hi> to <hi>Malachy,</hi> while some describe the honour, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the prosperitie, the vnitie of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> others the crueltie, the couetousnesse, the contention, the idolatry
<pb facs="11"/> of <hi>Babylon;</hi> together with the longing desire of <hi>Israel</hi> to bee deliuered out of the Hell of their captiuitie.</p>
   <p>All this is but a very figure, and mysticall type of two greater Cities, striuing vnder the name of the Church, like the twinnes in <hi>Rebeccaes</hi> wombe.<note place="margin">Gen. 25 22.</note> Wherefore the New Testament containeth the building vp of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Ierusalem, the true Church of God, seated vpon the faithfull Rocke of all stabilitie, <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> and sheweth the malignitie, and the conspiracie of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian Synagogue,</hi> the Mysticall Babylon, against the poore flocke, the Turtle, the spouse of Christ, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the captiuitie of the holy Citie for a time: and withall teacheth the Zion of God to striue and labour to bee deliuered from this more then seruile slauery.</p>
   <p>The captiuitie of the terrestriall <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, carnall, and worldly. In which their bodies and goods were carried away, according to the disposition of the Conquerour: Their political estate was ouerthrown: their countrey wasted, and giuen vp into the hands of strangers.</p>
   <p>The captiuitie of the Mysticall <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the militant Church of Christ, is chiefely spirituall, while the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Babylon</hi> raigne not onely in their Palaces, but in the Soules of men, deforming the religion, changing the worship, altering the lawes, prophaning the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, poisoning the faith, blinding the knowledge, terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the consciences, and lading them with traditions, ceremonies, and constitutions, heauier then any clay of Egypt, more burdenous then any iron, any fetters of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi> For this cause, the raigne of Antichrist, and his Lordship ouer the Church of Christ, the Spirit of God calleth great <hi>Babylon,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Apoc. 17 5.</note> the mother of whoredomes, and
<pb facs="11"/> abominations of the earth.</p>
   <p>Some perhaps will maruell,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> how wee can giue vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sect the Title and Appellation of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which doth professe it selfe Christian; and hath for sundry yeares borne the name of the Catholique Church.<note place="margin">Sol.</note> To these I answere, that the second <hi>Babylon</hi> doth in this differ from the first, that the first was a stranger, an open enemie, a professed aduersarie to <hi>Israel;</hi> but the second <hi>Babylon</hi> is a lurking, a secret enemie, who is couered with the cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Sheepe, chalengeth to haue the hornes of the Lambe, will seeme to bee the onely Temple, and the onely Church of Christ, vnder colour whereof she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbeth, peruerteth, ouerthroweth, destroyeth all things. But it is true, as the <hi>Chaldean Babylon</hi> is the head of all those which maligned, vexed, hated, and persecuted the naturall <hi>Israel:</hi> so <hi>Rome</hi> is the head of them which depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate, waste, and destroy the Church.

      <hi>Oecumenius</hi> doe subscribe. This the Disciples of the Romish Church say is to bee vnderstood onely of Ethnicke <hi>Rome</hi> vnder the gouernment of Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours. But to this their euasion the spirit of God it selfe hath framed a sufficient reply in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> where the mysterie of the Woman sitting on the Beast is described. Wee finde that this Beast was twofould; the first, and the second; Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> the professed
<pb facs="12"/> enemie: and the <hi>Pseudochristian Rome</hi> a secret aduersarie, who hath the hornes of the Lambe, and vnder the name of Christ, and of the Church, doth all mischiefe both to Christ and to the Church. And surely of this second Beast the Scripture witnesseth, that he shall preuaile, and deceiue them that dwell on the earth, working signes, and making all captiue to the first Beast, and to receiue his Marke. So that Heathenish <hi>Rome,</hi> which before was wounded, is now healed and magnified by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Beast; which indeed is not diuers from the first in person, but in respect: not in substance, but in qualitie of time and gouernement.</p>
   <p>Now, as the children of <hi>Israel</hi> from the first <hi>Babylon</hi> were by the mercy of God after long affliction deliuered (God mollifying the hearts of Kings and Princes to set them free, and to permit them to reedifie the decayed walles of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) and <hi>Babylon</hi> it selfe also brought to extreame ruine and destruction: so the spirituall <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> is comn into remembrance also before God, and the Lord hath turned the hearts of them who formerly gaue their Kingdome to the Beast; so that now they hate the Whore and make her desolate, and by the mercie of God in sundry Kingdomes and Nations religion is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from superstition, the Gospell truely preached, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments sincerely administred, our soule is escaped, as a Bird out of the hand of the Fowler, and there is sprung vp light for the righteous, and ioifull gladnesse among such as are true-hearted.</p>
   <p>This notwithstanding, as among the Israelites there were euer many found that would rather turne back vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Egypt, and be content to dwell in the house of their captiuitie, then in the good land which flowed vvith
<pb facs="12"/> Milke and Honey: So in the Church of Christ there are found also Owles that delight in darknes; to whom the light, the libertie, the grace of the Gospell is burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some: which had rather be fed with Egypts flesh-pots, with Leekes and Cucumbers, then all the Manna that comes from Heauen; and the captiuitie of <hi>Babylon</hi> is farre sweeter vnto them, then the freedome of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To recall these from their myre and their vomite, to which they are running againe, much labour by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned men hath beene bestowed; and of late time, from the Confession of Schoolemen, Iesuites, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popish writers in their Bookes and Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, testimonies haue beene taken, as it were out of their owne bowels, to conuince Popery. Some also haue gone about to mitigate the opinions on both sides, and to draw them as neare together as they could. But alas, who can make peace betwixt light and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, day and night, truth and falshood, God and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial, Christ and Antichrist? Such contraries brooke no pacification.</p>
   <p>Seeing therefore for these late yeares, in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and especially in my countrey of <hi>Worcester-shire</hi> diuers dayly fall from the truth, bewitched with the Cup of the glorious Strumpet, who sitteth vpon the Beast, and who are daily led captiue into <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the Emissaries of that chaire of pestilence (Seminaries and Iesuits euery where lurking amongst vs) I thought it my duety also amongst the rest, to stand in the gappe for the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> and to cast my poore myte into the treasurie, if so be by my simple labours any weake might bee strengthened, and any doubtfull resolued.</p>
   <p>Now because the abominable desolation is a subtill
<pb facs="13"/> Mysterie, and the Purple Strumpet hath much more gaule and venime in her Cup, then shee openly sheweth to the world (to speake plainely) for that they ouercast their false doctrine, with faire glosses, to the intent they may conceale the dregges thereof from the eyes of men, and by all meanes couer and hide the depth of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, lest the common sort should espy the same, and euery dogge barke at it; I haue endeauoured in this Treatise to strip the Harlot out of the raggs of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, and to shew her naked vnto the world; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her filthinesse, and her botches, the godly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may hasten out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> seeing it is become the habitation of Diuels, the hold of all fowle spirits, a Cage of euery vncleane and hatefull bird, that all her Restrictions, Limitations, distinctions, cautions, are but the guilt of her Hypocrisie cast ouer to deceiue.</p>
   <p>But so great is the lubricitie and subtiltie of this Mother of Whoredome and of Witchcraft, that it seemes as easie to fit a garment vnto the Moone, onely immutable in her mutabilitie: or (as the prouerbe is) to hold an Eeele by the tayle, as to force them to stand vnto any kinde of testimonie in matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For if you vrge them with Fathers, they receiue the Fathers so farre as they agree with the Romish Church: If you alledge Councels, they except against them, as not assembled by the Romish authoritie: if with Schoolemen you presse them, what is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon then, <hi>Hic Magister non tenetur?</hi> Yea, if they bee charged with the authoritie of the Pope himselfe, they say, he taught not Papally out of the Chaire, but spake after his priuate opinion. I haue therefore (not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their priuate writings) produced the most part of
<pb facs="13"/> my proofes out of the Missalls and Breuiaries, the formes of their publique worship. Which, though she haue an Harlots forehead, yet any reasonable man will thinke, the Babylonish Strumpet cannot for shame deny.</p>
   <p>The priuate authors alledged are old and new, obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete and flourishing; which I of purpose haue done, that I might shew, that their new writers, and of best esteeme, are nothing lesse superstitious, and lesse erronious then the <hi>Vetus Comoedia,</hi> the barbarous age of doting Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie.</p>
   <p>To their new and reformed Missalls and Legends I haue also adioined the more ancient, euen for the same purpose. For in them all it will appeare, that, as the <hi>Cnidian</hi> Mason making a watch-tower in <hi>Egypt</hi> for the conduction of trauellers by the Sea in the night, being commanded to set the name of the King, at vvhose charge it was built, in the wall, did so indeed, but hee set it vp deceitfully, in plaister and parget onely; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the which curiously in free-stone hee graued his owne name,<note place="margin">Sostratus Dexipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Cuidius Dijs salutaribu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>

         </gap> in Suctoniu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>s.</note>
      <hi>Sostratus Dexiphanis</hi> the <hi>Cnidian</hi> to the sauing Gods; that when the Morter was fallen off and decayed, all the praise might redound vnto himselfe, as though he had beene the founder of that worthy worke: So the Romanists deceitfully and colourably call their Masse the seruice of God, and pretend his worship in the superficiall appearance thereof; but in deed and in veritie all the honour is giuen to men, vnto Saints, vnto Images, and senselesse blockes; and this is the onely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of their Legends and Missalls.</p>
   <p>It may perhaps be thought in me, an ignorant man, and of very meane gifts, an audacious and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="14"/> part, to deale in a matter of this high nature, and weightie argument. But to this I reply, that I haue read of Cities throwne downe in Spaine by Connies, in Thessalia by Moles, in France by Frogges, in Africa by Locusts; and there is no instrument so exile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, by which that great power cannot worke, who calleth light out of darknes, and in the mouth of Babes and sucklings hath ordained praise.</p>
   <p>Hereto I must also adde, that these my weake la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were in a manner extorted and wrested from mee by diuers of them, who in these parts are blinded with Popish errour and superstition. For while I bended my selfe chiefely to this purpose in my ministerie, to beat downe the walles of the spirituall <hi>Iericho,</hi> which I saw goe vp so fast, and to bee fauoured by many of great authoritie with vs, they there vpon tooke occasion to slander my doctrine, and to report of mee, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Iesus Christ to be crucified, and that I preached, how men ought not to come vnto God through Iesus Christ; and sundry other slanders both towards my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and my selfe. Wherefore I thought it meet, by this my trauaile, to make profession of my faith pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, and also to lay open vnto them that shall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to peruse these ensuing obseruations, the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and Antichristian opposition, wherewith the Man of <hi>Rome</hi> impugneth Iesus Christ, the glorious Sonne of the liuing God.</p>
   <p>To conclude, if by these my simple trauels GOD may bee glorified, the truth defended, fals-hood dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, Hypocrisie vnmasked, the ignorant informed, the wauering and doubtfull confirmed, <hi>Litatum est,</hi> I haue my desire; if not, I haue done my indeauour, and
<pb facs="14"/> discharged my owne soule, referring the successe vnto him, who is onely able to giue strength and power to the weake things of the world to ouerthrowe the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to perfect his owne power, in our weakenesse: To whom, the Father of all that is called Father both in Heauen and in earth, the blessed and eternall Sonne, with the sweet and sanctifying Spirit, three persons and one glorious God, be all power, might, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie and dominion, vpon the knees of all hearts ascribed for euer and euer, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
