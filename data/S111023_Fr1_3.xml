      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing the deedes of the most iust,
and the writings of the most wise,
not onely of men, but of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
haue beene diuersly traduced
by variable iudgements of the
Times opinionists; what shall such
an ignorant as I expect? Yet reposing my selfe on your
fauours, I present this rude discourse, to the worldes
construction; though I am perswaded, that few do think
there may be had from <hi>New England</hi> Staple commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
well worth 3 or 400000 pound a yeare, with
so small charge, and such facilitie, as this discourse will
acquaint you. But, lest your Honours, that know mee
not, should thinke I goe by hearesay or affection; I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
your pardons to say thus much of my selfe: Neere
twice nine yeares, I haue beene taught by lamentable
experience, aswell in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> as <hi>Affrick,</hi>
and <hi>America,</hi> such honest aduentures as the chance
of warre doth cast vpon poore Souldiers. So that, if

I bee not able to iudge of what I haue seene, contriued,
and done; it is not the fault either of my eyes, or foure
quarters. And these nine yeares, I haue bent my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours
to finde a sure foundation to begin these ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
protects: which though I neuer so plainely and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
propound; yet it resteth in God, and you▪ still to
dispose of. Not doubting but your goodnesse will pardon
my rudenesse, and ponder errours in the balance of good
will▪ No more: but sacring all my best abilities to the
good of my Prince, and Countrey, and submitting
my selfe to the exquisit iudgements of
your renowned vertue, I
euer rest</p>
