   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>IN the beginning when the Lord of hostes,</l>
      <l>After his image liuely face and feature;</l>
      <l>Created man in all the lands and coastes,</l>
      <l>And for their succors euery liuing creature.</l>
      <l>He did ordaine in lue thereof each day,</l>
      <l>That they should praise his blessed name for ay.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>All lands and people then he did deuide,</l>
      <l>And parted them with watrie surging seas,</l>
      <l>Asundry language ouer and beside,</l>
      <l>He did appoint to men for better ease.</l>
      <l>With vnderstanding of each others minde,</l>
      <l>That so they might be to his lawes enclinde.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Which lawes or statutes were by him erected:</l>
      <l>Declaring them to man on <hi>Sinay</hi> mount,</l>
      <l>Through <hi>Adams</hi> sinnes from <hi>Paradise</hi> abiected,</l>
      <l>He vowd aday of Iudgement for account,</l>
      <l>Of euery sinne or vaine offence Comitted,</l>
      <l>Which Cannot be without his mercy quitted.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And knowing well that man of his owne nature,</l>
      <l>Was most vnapt t' obserue his holy word:</l>
      <l>He did erect his plagues for euery Creature,</l>
      <l>Ordayning for them hunger, fire and sword,</l>
      <l>And finding waighty sinnes of man abound,</l>
      <l>The whole world men and all he deeplie drownd.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Sauing his seruants whome he did apoint,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Noah</hi> and his family to be in arke:</l>
      <l>God of his mercie only did anoynt,</l>
      <l>Those eyght to liue within the selfe same barke.</l>
      <l>Hauing of euery creature with them two,</l>
      <l>For worlds encrease which after should ensew.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <l>This is most credible the time is past,</l>
      <l>Approu'd of truth before we liu'd in age:</l>
      <l>The sinnes of man yet being apt to last,</l>
      <l>Procure the Lord to anger, wrath, and rage,</l>
      <l>But what should I of these things meane to write,</l>
      <l>The holy Scriptures plainly them recite.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But as concerning this our latter time,</l>
      <l>Considering by the aboundance of our dayes:</l>
      <l>To greater sinne mans nature's apt to clime,</l>
      <l>Which is a meane that Sathan sprenges layes,</l>
      <l>To catch the sonnes of men by subtile guile,</l>
      <l>Into his Nets, and so their soules to foile.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>GOD (as before time) for the better peace,</l>
      <l>And keeping vnder of each wicked wight:</l>
      <l>In euery land true duty to encrease,</l>
      <l>Hath plac'd a Prince to rule the people right.</l>
      <l>Whose swords &amp; Scepters beare so great a sway,</l>
      <l>That they expell disorders quite away.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But oftentimes the kindest man in sight,</l>
      <l>He that will handle tongue in smoothest sort:</l>
      <l>To simple meaning man doth seeme a light,</l>
      <l>Yet slilie creepes and bites him to the heart.</l>
      <l>Which glauering people being least suspected:</l>
      <l>Liue in that order long time vndetected.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But God creator of the world and man,</l>
      <l>Finding the hearts of such to be corrupt:</l>
      <l>Reueales to world and people now and than,</l>
      <l>The sliest plots and treasons most abrupt.</l>
      <l>Which in the hearts of such are closely hid,</l>
      <l>At length from world such members he doth rid.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <l>
         <hi>Dicke Whipper</hi> now (mans conscience 'tis I meane,)</l>
      <l>Knowing the guiltie hearts of euery sort,</l>
      <l>Hath summoned a meeting, where all men,</l>
      <l>Are to repaire in person at that Court.</l>
      <l>Aswell the rich as poore, the good, as bad,</l>
      <l>The wise, as foolish, reprobate and mad.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>A Iewrie of the best hee hath appointed,</l>
      <l>To be impanneld on the worser sort:</l>
      <l>And sit in Iudgement with him as anoynted,</l>
      <l>To be the pillers of Celestiall Port.</l>
      <l>For whom he hath elect a Princely coast.</l>
      <l>For th' other, whipstock, whip, and whipping poast.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The deeds of good hee doth pronounce in Court,</l>
      <l>To th' endlesse praise and comfort of their soules:</l>
      <l>The others misdeeds to their endlesse hurt,</l>
      <l>He hath engrossed faire in his Court roules.</l>
      <l>The good shall weare and haue the heauenly Crowne,</l>
      <l>The other feele the whip to pull him downe.</l>
