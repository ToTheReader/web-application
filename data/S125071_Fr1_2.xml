   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my opinion gentle Reader (which also is the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; writing of all the Philosophers,) those things are most principall to bee taught and maintained, which in the common wealth are most profitable and necessary, then may I say without iust cause of reproofe: if some thinke no shame to displeasure many, for the pleasuring of a few, then I neede not to blush, nor feare to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit many, by hurting of none, by the publishing of this my booke abroad: not pend without paine, nor drawne without diligence, nor ended with ease, wherein are such and so many notable, rare, profitable, and precious things, as neuer were yet set forth in any volume in our English tongue, nay, diuers of them were neuer hetherto imprinted. Although I haue giuen the onset to publish in our owne naturall tongue thys most excellent worke for all diseases, for the which cause it should not bee the lesse esteemed, although some, more curious then wise, esteeme of nothing but that which is most rare, or in hard or vnknowne languages. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, these kinde of people cannot abide that good and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arts should be common to many, fearing, that theyr name &amp; practise should decay, or at the least should diminish: the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion truly of such persons, seemeth much like them that gape for all, and would all haue, leauing nothing to any body, but that which they must needes forgoe: not considering that we are not borne for our selues onely, as <hi>Plato</hi> sayth, but for the profite of our Country. Surely, if I did not feare to be too long in thys my Praeface, I would proue, how all Arts and Sciences may be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in that tongue which is best to be vnderstood, as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Gallen</hi> the Prince of this Art, being a Grecian, wrote in the Greeke. Also, King <hi>Auicene</hi> he wrote in the Arabian speech. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Plinie, Celsus, Serenus,</hi> and other of the Latinists, wrote to the people in the Latine tongue. <hi>Marcillius Ficinus,</hi> whom all wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters assent to be singulerly well learned, disdained not to write in the Italian language, generally to all men. If then the intent of all that euer set forth any notable studie, haue beene to be read of as many as would, what reason is it that we should keepe secrete a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a few, the thing that was made to be common to all? Christ sayth, no man lighteth a Candle to couer it with a bushell, but set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it to serue euery mans need: and these goe about not onely to couer it when it is lighted, but to quench it before it bee kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, if they might by malice: which as it is a detestable thing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny godly Science, so me thinks in thys so necessary an Arte, it is exceeding damnable and deuillish, to debar the fruition of so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable benefits, which our heauenly Father hath prepared for our comfort and innumerable vses, wherewith he hath armed our impotent nature, against the assaults of so many sicknesses, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his infinite mercy and aboundant goodnes., is in nothing else more apparantly confessed: by the which benefits, as it were with most sensible arguments spoken out of heauen, hee constraineth vs to thinke vpon our owne weakenes, and to acknowledge, that in all flesh is nothing found but misery, sicknes, sorrow, sinne, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, &amp; death: no, not so much strength as by our own power to releeue one member of our bodies diseased. As for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of medicines, comfort of hearbs, maintenaunce of health, prosperitie and life, they be his benefits &amp; proceed of him, to the end that we should in common helpe one another; and so to liue together in his Lawes and commaundements: desiring all those which shall find any fault herein, that they will friendly amend that is amisse.</p>
