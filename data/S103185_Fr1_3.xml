   <head>Introduction.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>VVHen <hi>Phebus</hi> Chariot (flaming liuing fire)</l>
      <l>Was drawne with winged horses to the West,</l>
      <l>And obscure darknesse clad in blacke attire,</l>
      <l>Had summon'd euery sleeping eye to rest,</l>
      <l>The cloudie curtaines of the heauens were spread,</l>
      <l>And glorious day from faire <hi>Aurora</hi> fled.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The windes were all lockt vp and nothing spoke,</l>
      <l>The dribling waters murmur was not heard,</l>
      <l>No fire was seene, yet all the ayre seem'd smoke:</l>
      <l>The starry lamps were from their shining barr'd</l>
      <l>Fower-footed tramplers, all had drowsie heads;</l>
      <l>Bush-breeders wrapt vp in their feather-beds.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>An vniuersall slumber ceas'd on all,</l>
      <l>To bury cares in sleepes forgetfulnesse,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="3"/>
While dreames and visions did in question call,</l>
      <l>Charging the minde with much vnquietnesse,</l>
      <l>And did present an obiect to my sight,</l>
      <l>That made next day to wonder at last night.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>I sawe, (or seem'd to see a well shap'd man,</l>
      <l>His body formed comely as I thought;</l>
      <l>Yet not describe him perfectly I can,</l>
      <l>Because his outside was so ouer-wrought,</l>
      <l>With Taylors art, new fashion'd from the stall,</l>
      <l>What I be held was but mans making all.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>His face being masked with his hat pull'd downe,</l>
      <l>And in french doublet without gowne or cloake,</l>
      <l>His hose the largest euer came to towne,</l>
      <l>And from his nostrels came much stinking smoake;</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="4"/>
Garters would make two ensignes for a neede,</l>
      <l>And shoo-ties that for circle did exceede.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>His head hung downe, his armes were held a crosse,</l>
      <l>And in his hat a cole-blacke feather stucke,</l>
      <l>His melancholy argued some great losse,</l>
      <l>He stood so like the picture of ill lucke:</l>
      <l>I longed much his humour for to finde</l>
      <l>Vntill at length he thus reueal'd his minde.</l>
