For what is ther, that can vse itself: onlesse it bee enfourmed with reason, and vnderstanding? Dūme creatures, and liuelesse of other bee vsed: but themselues can they neuer vse.

      </gap>rder we bee from the brutishnesse of beastes, and the nerer approche we to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diuine.</p>
   <p>In as much then as euery thing is borne to do that, which to his kinde is moste agreable: &amp; vs it beseemeth moste to vse ourselues: our parte w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute doute, &amp; our dutie shall wee do best: if we employe the vsing of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to deedes, that be honest, &amp; cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēdable.

   <p>For whether we be doing somwhat, or at rest: whether wee abide in the

countrey, or in the citie: whether we be occupied in ernest, or in game: no pawse ther is at all, but night &amp; day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap> we vse ourselues continually.</p>
   <p>Which thing sithe in euery portion of a mans life it hathe place: if it bee well, and wisely, and conueniently done: we shall be wealfull, and in a blessed case: if vngraciously, &amp; fōdly, and wickedly: wretched shall we be, and in a wofull plight. This ar we taught tomuch, by the cōmon life of men: who for defaulte of skyll, how to behaue themselues, be cōfounded in deepe derknesse of errour, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norāce: and wanting the right rule, they take chalk for cheese, as the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng is: they can not frame theyr af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, nor keepe them in temper. But such maner clowdes be clerely dissolued, by the beames of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie: which setts before our yiesight the verie endes, and markes, that self nature hath appointed vs.</p>
   <p>For in this worlde here beneath, ar thre kindes of liuing wightes: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of somme haue nomore, but life: as plants, herbes, and trees, growing oute of the grounde: sōme haue not
<pb facs="7"/>
onely life, but senses also: as sheepe, oxen, &amp; other beastes: y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> third compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth bothe these: and ouer life, &amp; senses, hath the souerain ruler, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: as in the nature of man we see thē all conioyned. It remains ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and meete it is for him, such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to practise: as may bothe seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie agree with eche of these parts, and generallie with thē alltogither. To the parcell inferiour (by which we receiue our norishment, our gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, &amp; the state of our bodie) well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare is appointed the vttmost ende: wherin the thing cōsisteth, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> we call profitable: which concernes the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, maintayning, or recouering of helth. Of the soule, or life endewed with senses, pleasure is the end, that it would enioye. The third nature, which is partener of reason, hathe this pricke to shoote at (if you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it by itself alone) science, and knowledge of trouth: if you beholde it with the other two accōmepanied: it hathe honestie, worshipp, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
   <p>These bee the verie endes, wherto mannes life, and nature must ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
<pb facs="7"/>
to attein: hither dothe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie promise to bring a mā, by her information. For when she hathe tolde in a generaltie, what is honest, cōmely, vaylable, praiseworthy, and in euerie pointe conuenient: then may mē, by intelligence perceiuing the trouth, truly expresse the same in euerie particular deede.</p>
   <p>Wherfore seing reason conteins the holle life of mā: and to it, as to theyr captein, the other parts bee obediēt, or at leste wise ought to bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>: first, marke we the peculiar propertie of reason: then, how with the other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers it exerciseth man: afterward, the cōmely behauiour, and dutiefull dealing in the open resorte, &amp; felou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp of men.</p>
   <p>Mannes minde is contented, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with nothing somuch, as the clere vnderstanding, and the vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauable science of soothe. Chiefly standeth his minde in contemplatiō of immortall, &amp; perdurable thinges: therto, in suche as fade, and fall, it teacheth, ordeineth, appointeth, cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maūdeth. Wherupō y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> order, course, figure, light, influēce of sōne, moone,

      </gap>erres it obserueth: conceiueth intelligences, aungels, soules, and fourmes immaterial: procedeth frō them, and so moūteth vp to the verie author, and prince of this worldes vniuersitie: whome it knoweth, and knowledgeth to be one, the best, the mightiest, the thetru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>, the moste righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and euerlasting. Yet is the selfsame minde by the felouship, and companie of the senses, and desires, many a time called awaie from that principall office, to consider these vnstable, and mutable thinges: and sōmtime to cast in conceite fourmes disseuered from the mater, mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically: &amp; sōmetime to view thīgs sensible, that can in no wise bee son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from the materiall substance: as eleme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>es, beastes, herbes, trees, metalls, stones, and such like: all the which must needes be fensed, &amp; forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the trade of debating doutes, and discerning of trouth from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouthe: which is the art of Logik, the verie rule of reason, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all discourse.</p>
   <p>Now, to speake of the vsing of the holleman: by the continuall tenour,
<pb facs="8"/>
and stedfast rate of bodies celestiall, and naturall, the minde of man ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth order, obedience, and concorde. For like as god gouerneth thinges manyfolde, moueable, and falling awaye, beyng himself but one, vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouable, and euerduring: so reasō within vs ought to rule raunging lusts, &amp; rash motions of the minde, and the other vnworthyer, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker parts: beeing itself stedfast, sage, principall, and strongly esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.</p>
   <p>In case a man loue any one parte of himself tomuch: or sewe after y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> end therof by a wronge waye, and clene oute of fashion: he shall not leade a life all euē, and streyght, but hoked, and croked: nor easie, and quiet, but miserablie distempered. For whoso bee ouermuch enclined to paumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and pleasing of the vitall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: thei be all bent to gather good, and holly giuen to gaine. They, that alonely serue theyr senses, and sett theyr delite to feele the pleasures of the same: be excessiue eyther in ryot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp; banketing, or in outragious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> or in other such
<pb facs="9"/>
pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>aunces, as bee sensuall. They, which holde them content to leade a life cōtēplatiue, hauing no regarde, ne respect to y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> forenamed {per}cels: do proue sowre, sowring, blockish, rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, &amp; farre from all ciuilnesse of life. He, in whome reason <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>oynes with the senses, for to do thē seruice: will enforce himself to win worldly glorie, and soueraintie. He, that can comprise in his thought no large cōmepasse, nor deepe consideration: but is faynt, feeble, wauering, and full of infirmitie: will showe forthe himself chieflie with appareling, or w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> sōme outward bragge, to supplie his want within.</p>
   <p>To such sortes of annoyaunce, and disconuenience, light, and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is brought by morall doctrine: the which, Marcus Lullius Cicero, in these bookes of duties, professeth. This lerning teacheth, somuch to graunt the vitall parte, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therest: as will be suffisant to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the life in helth, and wellfare. It willeth also the feeling portion so to take fruitiō of pleasures: that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it defraude the lower parte of
<pb facs="9"/>
the {pro}fits therto appropriate: nor w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> importune egging annoye y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> minde, which aspireth vnto veritie of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and vprightnesse of maners.</p>
   <p>Withoute mo wordes, it assigneth that for to reigne, which is borne to reigne: &amp; that to be obeysaunt, which is franied for obeysaunce.</p>
   <p>Now, when a man is so enstructed with philosophie: that he can full cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniētly liue sole, &amp; at pointe deuice by himself: he must be brought forth abrode into the face of the worlde: to the intent he may procure, not onely that becōmes himself to do, but also the welth of other folke. He must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the three folde state, &amp; diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, that he hathe espyed, &amp; practised in himself: and must trans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>erre the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same to the gouernaūce bothe of his housholde priuatlie, and of the holle commons openly. So shall the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest sorte, like the vitall parcell in man, bee occupied aboute the moste seruile, and needfull workes: men of middle degree, like y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> sensiue soule, shall attend to affaires, and sciences more liberall: the nobilitie in the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gouernment, like reason in the
<pb facs="10"/>
nature of mā, shall rule all the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. That thing also dothe Lullie touche in this treatise: and showeth mē in authoritie theyr duties, bothe iu warr, and peas: wherby thei may make themselues, and theyr subiects happy, and fortunate.</p>
   <p>And not onely them, but all sortes of men he admonisheth: what thei haue to do, thorough out their life: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theyr age, trade, and estate: with respect to the circumstaūces of times, places, and persones.</p>
   <p>In the first boke, he first diuideth dutie into the perfit, and the meane: leauing the one (which belongeth to the end of good, &amp; is in it self right) to men of perfectiō: and prosecuting y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> other, in certein rules, &amp; preceptes: so that therby euery mā may frame, and order his life. Then he leades vs to the fynding oute of duties, by taking aduisement aboute the choise of honest thinges, and refusall of the vnhonest. Afterward he setts for the the originall causes, and the chiefe parts of honestie, with theyr duties, &amp; properties. At the last, he warneth vs to discerne y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> more, or most honest
<pb facs="10"/>
thing frō the lesse, or le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>: &amp; allwaies, in the vse therof, to preferr y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> greater. In the second, rehersing profitable, &amp; vnprofitable thinges: he showeth, how to attein, and to vse the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; how to eschewe the contrarie: and in the end, makes a comparison of profits: teaching to preferre the greater before the smaller, or the mo before the fewer.</p>
   <p>In the third, he cōpareth profit with honestie, &amp; with euerie parte therof: not as if ther could indeede bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie bitweene them: but hee means the profit, which semeth not honest, &amp; the honestie, which seemeth not profitable: or of eyther of thē the apparaunt showe: and hee tells vs, what is to be done, when these seeme so to striue, one with an other: that honestie allureth vs one waye, and profit calleth vs an other waye.</p>
   <p>Thus the holle mater is referred, and applied to honestie, and profit, two principall pointes of good: the third (which wee call pleasure, and is placed by the Peripatetiks in the noumber of good thinges) Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, like a Stoik, dothe but briefly
<pb facs="11"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ouche, as a thing impertinent.</p>
   <p>But of the other two places, contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the doings of men, Cicer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> hathe tolde his minde, and left it vs in this boke: euen as fully, as in his lifetime he conceiued it in his hed.</p>
   <p>For who euer sawe in so few leaues so much morall doctrine, and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, set out with so many conning castes, and feates oratoriall? What a sort of stories be there so notable of themselues, so handsomly applied, so elegantly tolde? You shall not lightly reade the like, within so litle commepasse, in any historian, that of purpose dothe nothing els.</p>
   <p>How finely, &amp; featly be y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> poets ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses alledged? With what a discretiō ar sōme auncient writers reproued? With what subtilitie, &amp; fynesse of wit be certein cōtrouersies debated? Either of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> chief philosophie, or of all humanitie what pointe is ther lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king?

Posidonius, a Khodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane, meddled with the same mater: but nothing to Tullius. So did He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato: but nothing to Tullius. And many other mo of later time: but, lorde, how farr be thei from Tulli{us}?

Tullius out of the Greeke

      </gap>ours in florishing em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires: trāslated a greate deale. Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius to Marcus, his wellbeloued sonne, abyding euen at Athenes, among the best philosophers, was not afraid to send this parcell of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie. Nodoute, as welcō it was to y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> lerned Athenians: as y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Greeks doings were to the Romanes: or as now adayes, the French, &amp; Italians welframed writings be to those En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish men, that vnderstand thē: yea and somuch the more wellcōme: as it was a rare thing then, to see that kinde of knowledge expressed in pure latine. But in Rome, in Italie, in Europa, in all quarters, where la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine speche had place: O, so it was embraced at all times, of all men, in euery degree, order, &amp; estate. Rulers haue here foūde much witty policie, apperteining to the gouernaunce of realmes. Householders, &amp; parents haue pyked oute of these bokes ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous instructions for theyr chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp; theyr seruauntes. Doctors, &amp; diuines haue here mett with morall

Schoolemen haue taken herehence problemes, and questions, to debate at large: and haue fetched from hence philosophicall conclusions, with reasons, and argumentes to proue, and to disproue. Oratours haue been well furnished hereby, with sondry graces, and ornaments of speeche: and in the like maner of mater, haue marked, how to bestowe their style. Rhetoriciās, who for their exercise, do vse declamatiōs: haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken oute of this, cōmon places, like large feldes, where mē may walk at libertie. Schoolemasters neuer wist of fyner phrases, for to make theyr scholars acquainted with the verie veine of the latine language. At few wordes, all men, that of wisdome be studious, may gett sommewhat herein to sharpe the witt, to store the intelligence, to feede the minde, to quicken the sprite, to augment the reason, to direct y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> appetite, to frame the tounge, to fashion the maners:

   <p>These richesse, &amp; treasures of witt, and wisdome, as Cicero trāsported oute of Greece into Italie: so haue I fetched from thence, &amp; conueied thē into England: and haue caused also Marcus Tullius (more, thā he could do, whē he was aliue) to speake En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish. Maruailous is the mater, flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the eloquēce, ryche the store of stuff, &amp; full artificiall the enditing: but how I, in our maner of speche, haue expressed the same: the more the booke bee perused, the better it may chaūce to appere. None other trāsla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō in our toug haue I seen, but one: which is of all men of any lerning so well liked: y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thei repute it, &amp; count it as none: yet if ye list to cōpare this sōmwhat w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> nothing: perauēture this somwhat will seeme somwhat y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> more.

For if it be not as brief, as the verie authors text requireth: whatso is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his perfite style, shall appeare superfluous, &amp; to serue rather to the making of sōme paraphrase, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie. Therto, if it bee vttered w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> ynkhorne termes, &amp; not with vsuall words: or if it be phrased w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> wrasted, or farrefetched fourmes of speche: not fine, but harsh, not easye, but harde, nor naturall, but violent it shall seeme to bee. Then also, in case it yeeld not the meaning of the author: but eyther folowing fansie, or misledde by errour, forsakes the true pattern: it can not bee approued for a faithfull, &amp; sure interpretation: which ought to be takē for y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> greatest praise of all. These points as I haue studied to {per}fourme: so where I haue not allwaies atteined vnto them: I shall desire you, gētle reader, gētely to cōsider bothe the excelence of the author, who is a perfit oratour: and also the greatnesse of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> mater, which is profounde philosophie.</p>

Eyther they shall like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the better: when they conferre it with my poore workmāship: orels perchaūce conne me the more thank, for attempting, folowing, &amp; accōpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of this enterprise. Be it so, one hathe neyther the latine, nor the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish eloquēce: yet, by the benefite of nature, sythe a mā may do much: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely if he therto adioyne vse, &amp; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise: here is for him occasiō bothe to whet his wit, &amp; also to fyle his toūg. For allthough an English mā hath his mother toung: &amp; can talk apace, as he lerned of his dame: yet is it one thing to title tattle, I wott not how, or to chatter like a iaye: &amp; an other, to bestowe his wordes wiselye, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, pleasauntly, &amp; pythiely. Such as haue english meatly well, &amp; but a smatterīg, or small taste in y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> latine: which noumber is great, among the scholars of this realme: may hereby fail into such acquayntaunce, and

familiaritie with this most excellent latine man: that neither shall his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise seme hard, nor his art obscure, nor his style straunge. I dare well saye, if this worke happe into a good students hand: hee will not think it ynough to runne ouer it once: as we fare with trifles, and toyes: but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisediy, and with good leasure, thre, or foure, or fiue times, he will reade it, and reade it, and reade it againe: first, by the principall points, by the definitiōs, and the diuisions: to see, what is treated, how farreforthe, in what order, and with what varietie: then, to mark the precepts, reasons, conclusions, &amp; commō places: after, vnto the sayd places to referre all the stories, with the verses poeticall: finally, as well in the english, as the latine, to weygh well properties of wordes, fashions of phrases, and the ornaments of bothe. Moreouer, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny clerks haue I knowne, eare this: which could conceiue, &amp; vnderstand full well: whose toung neuerthelesse in vtteraūce, and vse of speche, was in a maner maymed: yea and sōme, that could also speake latine redyly,

and wellfauordly: who to haue done as much in our language, &amp; to haue hādeled thesame mater, would haue bene half blāk. What neede mo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des?

   <p>Now therfore, good reader, fare you well: and remember, how vnfyt (as Aristotle sayeth) and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearers of morall science yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be: as long as eyther they folow their youthly affections: or do conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue vnskylfull, and rude in y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> deeds, that of dutie belonge to mannes life.

And how shall they be able to iudge, what is discreetly, rightfully, valiauntly, moderately, &amp; worthylie done: who neyther haue any such qualitie, nor vnderstand by experiēce any pointe of the same?
