muche as ī them liethe, the iuste title claime
and intereste of the noble and excellente
Ladie Marie Quene of Scotlande, to the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resaide
crowne: Yea they haue in vtteringe
theire grosse ignorāce, or rather theyr spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

also that the ciuill regimente of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
ys repugnante bothe to the lawe of

ouer well knowen to all Englande and
Scotlande, what a busines and sturre there
hathe bene, what earnest vehemente and
violēte talke, what false fained and forged
reportes and opprobriouse slaunders haue
bene bruted, as well in the one as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
realme, againste the sayde vertuouse
good innocence Ladye and Quene, by the
craftie maliciouse drifte of her rebelliouse
subiectes. Who haue not onlye blowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode,
and filled mennes eares with lothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and heynouse accusations against her

and also bereaued her of her princelye and
Royall aucthoritie, intrudinge them selues
<pb facs="3"/>
into the same, vnder the name and shadowe
of the yonge Prince her sonne. Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge
all theys poinctes, ye shall haue

deuided in to three bookes,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes of the bookes followīge.</note> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.
And for as muche as Salomon wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tethe,

losse of anye worldelye honour, hanginge
vpon her by expectation, or that she hathe
enioyed, or dothe presentlye enioye, or
any other greauouse iniuries that she hathe
most wrongfullye but most pacientlye
suffred. Yt ys thowght good that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of her honour shoulde forgoe the
other two bookes, wherof the former
entreatethe, debatethe and discussethe the
right title and interest of the sayde
Quene Marye, to the succession of
this crowne of Englande. Declaringe
her sayde right and title to be good
and lawfull, by the common lawe of this

realme, and the actes of parliamēte therein
holdē, with a full answere of suche obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as the aduersaries laye forthe against
her saide right, by coulour of the saide lawe
or parliamentes. And for as muche as with
our foresaide newe foūde doctour, neither
common lavve, nor actes of parliamente,
seame to serue for a sufficiente plea, but that
we are by him driuen, also to pleade by the
lavve of nature and by scripture: We haue
adioyned in the thirde booke a cōueniente
answere to this fonde fantasticall and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
assertiō, as well to the states of other
Princes, as to the state of his and our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouse
Souereigne. Wherein we auouche
womans regimēte to be cōformable bothe
to the lawe of God, and the lawe of nature.
Which tretise maye seme {per}chance to some
as superfluous, neither I greatlye denye yt,
and there fore might, and vvolde gladlye
haue spared so muche labour and trauaile,
yf this litle poisoned pamflett had not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye

Souereigne, or yf this lewde assertion were

fonde fansie therein euen in the latin and
most common tongue of all. For theys and

a confutation of this grosse and dangerous

slaughter vvith bare naked, but spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull
reproches and oute cries, with ovvte
anye manner of kinde or countenance of
good proufe, we will referre the Reader to
the foresaide defence of her honour. By the
which ansvvere ye shall see her integritie &amp;
innocencie, and vvith all that her accusers
have in this matter played suche a Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
agaynst theyre gwyltles Ladie and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouse
Sovereigne, as lightlie the worlde
hathe not harde of the lyke. The whiche
theire false slaunderouse,<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēdations of diuers kinges for releauinge of other Prīces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie.</note> owtragiouse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliouse
doynges, yt ys hoped that our gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiouse
Quene wyll well consider and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and wyll take some conveniente order
also, aswell for the repressinge of them, as
for the restitution of the sayde Quene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
into her owne realme. And the rather
bycause our saide Quene ys learned, and
therefore not ignorante what greate cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēdation
and immortall fame, manie kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
haue purchased to them selves for su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
benefitt bestowed vpon other Princes,
beynge in the like distresse and extremitie.
The monumētes of antiquitie, as well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
as Ecclesiasticall are filled withe
<pb facs="5"/>
the memorie of suche noble factes. In ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
scripture we reade that Abraham cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouselie
and manfullie delivered hys
brother Lothe,<note place="margin">Genes. 14.</note> whith certaine Kynges ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
prisoners by theyre enimies.<note place="margin">Esdrae▪ 1.</note> Cyrus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
the Iewes from captiuitie.<note place="margin">4. Reg. c. vlt.</note> Evelme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodache
delivered Ioachim the Kynge of
Iuda ovvte of prison.<note place="margin">1 Machab. 15.</note> The Romans dyd
write to divers Kynges in the favour of the
Ievves vniustlie oppressed. What shall I spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
of Alexander the greate, that restored
Ada the Quene of Caria? Or of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide
Romans that restored Masinissa the
Kynge of Numidia, with manie other Kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges?
Or of our noble Cordell, that sett vp
agayne in the Royall throne of our Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
her father driuen from thence by hys
two other vnkinde and vnnaturall dowgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
Some Princes of this our realme haue
in theyre greate calamitie, &amp; amōge other,
kinge Henrie the sixte fownde muche cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte,
frēdshippe, succour and relief, at the
kinges handes of Scotlande. This Ladie &amp;
Quene desierethe nowe to taste the like at
our Quenes handes. Whereby she shall
winne greater commendation, then did
Charles the late Emperour, for restorīge ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Frācis Sfortia to the dukedome of
Millane, or of Muliasses to the kīgdome of
<pb facs="6"/>
Tunes, or of his sōne kinge Philippe for {pro}<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curinge
the restitution of the Duke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoye.
For this Ladye and Quene ys her most
nighe neighbour by place: And her nighe
cosen and sister by bloude. She ys a Quene,
and therefore this vvere a fitt benefitt
for her relief from a Quene. Yea she
ys, as yt were her dawghter, bothe by
dawghterlye reuerēce she bearethe her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
and by reason she ys of God called to
the daughters place in the succession of the
crowne, yf her maiestie faile of issewe. And
I dowbte nothinge, yf she imploye this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlye
benefitt vpon her, but that she shall
finde her, a myndefull, thankfull, &amp; an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diente
dawghter. For of all women in this
vvorlde, she abhorrethe ingratitude. She
hathe hitherto depended onlye vpon the
hope,<note place="margin">The greate truste that the Quene of Scottes hathe euer had in her deare sister the Quene of Englād.</note> to haue helpe and succour of her
maiestie, geuinge ouer, partelye voluntarie,
partelye at the motion of her maiestie, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
profers of ayde and succour by other
mightie and puissante Princes her frendes
frelye to her offered: reposinge her self vpō
the fayre and princelye promises that her
Maiestie hathe made to her sondrye tymes
aswell by lettres, as by messengers, for her
relief: when so euer oportunitie shoulde oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb facs="6"/>
her to craue yt. For theys and manye
other cōsiderations, there ys good hope, as
ys a foresayde, that our gratiouse Maistresse
will take in hande her restitution. Wher
vpon, I trust, shall followe suche farther and
entire amitie betwene them bothe, and
theire realmes, that the benefitt,
fruite, and commoditie therof
shall plentifullye redowne,
aswell to all the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of bothe the
sayde realmes
heare after,
as to vs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlie.
