                 <title>Loves revenge : VVherein is briefly shewed from the historie of the holy scripture, the rising, grouth, and finall fall of the man of sinne; with the long and continuall strife betwixt the two seeds, how they have, from time to time, sought to disinherite each other: and ho that Christ, by his righteous life, and long sufferings, in the end shall get the victory, and justly revenge himself upon his adversarie.

   <lg>
      <l>I Do believe in God alone,</l>
      <l>Whose love doth passe all breadth &amp; length:</l>
      <l>And do relie on other none,</l>
      <l>To make the arm of flesh my strength:</l>
      <l>My faith is such, not to remove,</l>
      <l>Such is my Hope, such is my Love.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>He is the onely Lord of lords,</l>
      <l>A King of mighty strength and fame,</l>
      <l>His Majesty with truth accords,</l>
      <l>And great <hi>Iehovah</hi> is his name:</l>
      <l>The first, the last, the totall summe,</l>
      <l>Which is, which was, which is to come.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>He is the God of Israel.</l>
      <l>Their root and generation:</l>
      <l>The vanquisher of Death, and Hell,</l>
      <l>The horn of our salvation:</l>
      <l>Before whole throne all flesh shall come,</l>
      <l>The wicked to their finall doom.</l>
   </lg>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <lg>
      <l>Then why should I fear mortall man,</l>
      <l>Whose breath within his nostrills lies?</l>
      <l>His life for length is but a span,</l>
      <l>Although his malice never dies:</l>
      <l>My body he may keep in thrall,</l>
      <l>But cannot hurt my soul at all.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Let cursed <hi>Cain</hi> then fret and rage,</l>
      <l>And wicked <hi>Lamech</hi> boast his fill:</l>
      <l>Let scoffing <hi>Ham</hi> come on the stage,</l>
      <l>Let bloudy <hi>Nimrod</hi> work his will:</l>
      <l>Let <hi>Babels</hi> Tow'r, through <hi>Satans</hi> pride,</l>
      <l>Be once again re-edifi'd.</l>
   </lg>

      <l>Let <hi>pharaoh</hi> with his hoast pursue,</l>
      <l>Let <hi>Amaleck</hi> stand in the way:</l>
      <l>Let Og and <hi>Sihons</hi> hatefull crue,</l>
      <l>Their bloudy banners still display:</l>
      <l>Let proud <hi>Goliah</hi>'s hellish cry,</l>
      <l>The God of Israel defie.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Let <hi>Balaam</hi> lay a stumbling block,</l>
      <l>Let <hi>Rabshecah</hi> come railing down:</l>
      <l>Let dogged <hi>Doeg</hi> accuse Christs flock,</l>
      <l>Let <hi>Shemey</hi> curse, let <hi>Nabal</hi> frown:</l>
      <l>Let Philistines their battells pitch,</l>
      <l>Let <hi>Saul</hi> ask counsell of a Witch,</l>

      </l>
      <l>And build an altar unto <hi>Baal:</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Let <hi>Baals</hi> Priests cry till heare doth break,</l>
      <l>Their God can neither hear nor speak.</l>
   </lg>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <lg>
      <l>Let <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> pour out</l>
      <l>His thundring threats, rage, and revile,</l>
      <l>Let <hi>Baltazar</hi> his drunken rout,</l>
      <l>The vessells of the Lord defile.</l>
      <l>Let haughtie <hi>Hamans</hi> pride bewray</l>
      <l>His hatefull thoughts to <hi>Mordekay.</hi>
      </l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>
         <hi>Antiochus,</hi> that wicked root,</l>
      <l>Let him run on his wretched race:</l>
      <l>To waste and trample under foot,</l>
      <l>Gods Temple, and his dwelling place.</l>
      <l>Let <hi>Holofernes</hi> rule and sway,</l>
      <l>Till <hi>Iudith</hi> take his head away.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Let <hi>Samballat</hi> the Horonite,</l>
      <l>With all his cursed crue accord,</l>
      <l>To race, to sack, to vanquish quite</l>
      <l>The walls and building of the Lord.</l>
      <l>Let men conspire with malice fraught,</l>
      <l>Yet shall their counsells come to nought.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Let cruell <hi>Herod</hi> still assail,</l>
      <l>The tender infants for to stay,</l>
      <l>Let Scribes and Pharisees prevail,</l>
      <l>Give <hi>Iudas</hi> money to betray.</l>
      <l>My faith is fixt on him above,</l>
      <l>So is my hope, so is my love.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>His waies are right, his judgements just,</l>
      <l>His mercy alwaies firm and sure,</l>
      <l>To such as on his goodnesse trust,</l>
      <l>And stedfast to the end endure.</l>
      <l>He giveth all men life and breath,</l>
      <l>And grieveth at the sinners death.</l>
   </lg>
   <pb facs="6"/>
   <lg>
      <l>He did admonish wretched <hi>Cain,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>To leave his wicked enterprise:</l>
      <l>Suffer (said he) not sinne to reigne.</l>
      <l>Least <hi>Abels</hi> bloud for vengeance cries.</l>
      <l>Abandon wrath, ther's grace in store,</l>
      <l>If not, lo sinne is at thy door.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And when he saw, and well perceiv'd.</l>
      <l>All flesh corrupting of their waies,</l>
      <l>His spirit strove, his soul was griev'd,</l>
      <l>Contain'd his wrath yet many daies:</l>
      <l>Had true repentance there been found.</l>
      <l>The world had sur'ly not been drown'd.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>When <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorahs</hi> cries,</l>
      <l>Ascended up unto his throne,</l>
      <l>Yet was there mercy in his eyes,</l>
      <l>He would have saved them each one:</l>
      <l>Could he have found some godly men.</l>
      <l>He would have spar'd them all for ten,</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But <hi>Cain,</hi> which was through malice led,</l>
      <l>Quite to renounce his chiefest good,</l>
      <l>Did in his wicked collar shed,</l>
      <l>His brother <hi>Abels</hi> guiltlesse bloud:</l>
      <l>And wrath, commixt with deadly hate.</l>
      <l>Brought <hi>Cain</hi> to be a Runagate.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And boasting <hi>Lamech</hi> could not scape,</l>
      <l>Which in his heart a man would slaie,</l>
      <l>The wicked world for filthy rape,</l>
      <l>Was drown'd, and taken all away.</l>
      <l>And <hi>Ham,</hi> which in the Ark was nurst,</l>
      <l>Was after for his sinne accurst.</l>
   </lg>
   <pb facs="6"/>
   <lg>
      <l>And <hi>Nimrod</hi> was not quite forgot,</l>
      <l>Which hunted sonnes of Shem away.</l>
      <l>The wicked ones which vexed <hi>Lot,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>The Lord at length did them repay,</l>
      <l>They suffer for their foul desire,</l>
      <l>The vengeance of eternall fire.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with his hoast was drown'd.</l>
      <l>The waters ouerwhelm'd them all,</l>
      <l>When Israel did finde drie ground,</l>
      <l>And passed through both great and small.</l>
      <l>Thus can the Lord, from Satans rage,</l>
      <l>Preserve his own from age to age.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>For <hi>Amalech</hi> was rooted out,</l>
      <l>And <hi>Sihon</hi> was cast headlong down.</l>
      <l>And mighty Og in battell stout.</l>
      <l>Was dispossessed of his Crown.</l>
      <l>And proud <hi>Goliah,</hi> wicked bred,</l>
      <l>Returned back without his head.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>When <hi>Balaam</hi> came at <hi>Balacks</hi> call,</l>
      <l>To bring his wickednesse to passe,</l>
      <l>To work the means of Isr'els fall,</l>
      <l>He was rebuked by his Asse.</l>
      <l>And <hi>Ashurs</hi> king could not prevail,</l>
      <l>Though <hi>Rabshecah</hi> ceas't not to rail,</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>
         <hi>Doeg, Shemey, Nabal,</hi> and the rest,</l>
      <l>Vilde instruments of Satans rage,</l>
      <l>Whose mindes with malice be possest.</l>
      <l>Quite to supplant Gods heritage,</l>

      <l>Receive their due deserved hire.</l>

   <pb facs="7"/>
   <lg>
      <l>And Israels anointed King</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Saul,</hi> did himself of grace deprive,</l>
      <l>Sinne struck him with a mortall sting,</l>
      <l>For sparing <hi>Amalec</hi> alive.</l>
      <l>His heart and hand was wholly bent,</l>
      <l>To persecute the innocent.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And <hi>Ieroboam</hi> could not stand,</l>
      <l>Because he was a wicked man,</l>
      <l>God struck him with a with'red hand,</l>
      <l>When he did sacrifice at <hi>Dan.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>For money he wrought many evills,</l>
      <l>Made Priests, which sacrific'd to Devills.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And <hi>Ahab</hi> wicked imp of hell,</l>
      <l>Which built an altar unto <hi>Ball,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Was rooted out with <hi>Iesabel,</hi>

      <l>None left to pisse against a wall.</l>

      <l>The dogs lick't up the Tyrants bloud.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> for pride,</l>
      <l>Was metamorpos'd to a beast.</l>
      <l>And <hi>Baltazar,</hi> whom lust did guide,</l>

      <l>A hand prescribing on the wall,</l>
      <l>His overthrow before them all.</l>

      <l>And trode Gods Temple under foot,</l>
      <l>And set an idoll in the place;</l>
      <l>God did him strange diseases send,</l>
      <l>And brought him to a fearfull end.</l>

      <l>And Christs dear bloud still vengeance cries,</l>
