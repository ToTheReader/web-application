   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ike as in the time of darcke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and ignoraunce, fyndynge our people seduced and drawen from the truth by hypocrisy and superstition, we by the helpe of god &amp; his worde haue trauayled to purge and clense our realme frome the apparant enormities of the same, wherin by openynge of goddes trueth, with settyng furth and publishyng of the scriptures, our labours (thankes be to god) haue not ben void and frustrate: So nowe perceiuing, that in the tyme of knowledge, the deuil (who ceasseth not in all tymes to vexe the worlde) hath attented to returne agayn, (as the parable in the gospel she with) into the hous purged and clensed, accompanied with seuen worse spirites: and hypocrisy and superstition beyng ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and put away, we fynde entered into some of our peoples hartes, an inclination to sinister vnder standynge of scripture, presumption, arrogancye, carnall liberty, and contention: we be therfore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned for the reformation of them in tyme, and
<pb facs="3"/>
for auoyding of suche diuersitie in opinions, as by the sayde euyll spirites might be engendred, to sette furth with the aduise of our clergy suche a doctrine and declaration of the true knowledge of god and his worde, with the principall articles of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as wherby all men may vniformely be ledde &amp; taught the true vnderstandyng of that whiche is necessary for euery christen man to know, for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of him selfe in this lyfe, agreably to the will and pleasure of almyghty god. Which doctrine also the lordes bothe spirituall and temporall, with the nether house of our parliament, haue both sene and lyke very wel. And for knowlege of the ordre of the matter in this boke conteined, for as muche as we knowe not perfectly god,<note place="margin">Faythe</note> but by fayth, the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith occupieth in this tretise the first place. Wherunto is nexte adioyned the declaration of the articles of our Crede,<note place="margin">The crede</note> conteinyng what we shulde beleue. And incontinently after them foloweth the explication of the seuen sacramentes,<note place="margin">The sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes.</note> wherin god ordinarily worketh, and whereby he participateth vnto vs his speciall giftes and graces, in this lyfe. Whiche matters so digested and set forth with sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie and plainesse, as the capacities and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standynges of the multitude of our people may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily receyue and comprehende the same:<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</note> There folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth conuenientlye the declaration of the .x. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, beyng by God ordeyned the hyghe way, wherin eche man shulde walke in this lyfe, to finishe fruitfully his iourney here, and after to rest eternally in ioy with him. Whiche bycause we can

not doo of our selfe, but haue nede alwayes of the grace of god, as without whom we can neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this lyfe ne without his speciall grace doo any thing to his pleasure, wherby to atteine the life to come: We haue after declaration of the cōmande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, expounded the .vii.<note place="margin">The pater noster.</note> petitions of our Pater noster, wherin be conteined requestes and suites for all thynges necessary to a christen man in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent lyfe, with declaration of the Aue Maria,<note place="margin">The Aue</note> as a prayer conteinyng a ioyfull rehersall, and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of god in the worke of the incarnatiō of Christ whiche is the grounde of our saluation, wherin the blessed virgin our Lady, for the abūdance of grace, wherwith god indued her, is also with this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance honoured and worshypped. And for as mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che as the heades and sensis of our people haue ben imbusied, and in these dayes trauailed with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandyng of Freewill, Iustification,<note place="margin">
         <p>Freewyll, Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
         <p>Good wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes.</p>
         <p>Praier for soules.</p>
      </note> Good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and Praying for the soules departed: we haue by the aduise of our clergie, for the purgation of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious doctrine, declared and sette furthe openly plainly, and without ambiguitie of speche, the mere and certain truthe in them. So as we verily truste that to knowe god, and howe to lyue after his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to the atteining of euerlastyng life in the ende, this boke conteyneth a perfecte and sufficient do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, grounded and established in holy scriptures. Wherfore we hartily exhorte our people of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, willyngly and earnestly bothe to reade and printe in theyr hartes the doctrine of this boke, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that god (who as saynt Paul sayeth, distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth

diuideth to his churche his graces distinctly) hath ordered some sorte of men to teache other, and some to be taught, that al thynges shulde be done semely and in ordre, and hathe beautified and set furthe by distinctiō of ministers and offices, the same church: And consideryng also that for the one parte whiche shuld teache other, is necessary not only knowlege, but also learnyng and cunnyng in the same know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, wherby they may be hable conueniently to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence and distribute to their audience the trueth of god, accordyng to theyr connyng for the edification of other, and by true exposition of the scriptures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to the apostolicall doctrine receyued and mainteined from the beginnyng, and by conferring and declaration of them, to conuince, refell, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue all errours and vntrouthes set furthe to the contrary &amp; finally be also able to giue an accompte, as saynt Peter sayeth, of that they professe: It must be agreed than that for the instruction of this parte of the church, whose offyce is to teache other, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, redyng, and studyeng of holy scripture, bothe of the olde and newe testament, is not onely conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient but also necessary: But for the other parte of the churche ordeined to be taught, it ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied certainly that the reading of the olde and newe testamēt, is not so necessary for all those folkes, that of duty they ought and be bound to reade it, but as the prince and the policy of the realme shall thynke cōuenient, so to be tollerated or taken from it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant whervnto the politike lawe of our realme hath nowe restrained it from a greate meyny, este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="4"/>
it sufficient for those so restrained, to here and truely beare away the doctrine of scripture taught by the preachers, and so imprint the lessons of the same, that they may obserue and kepe them inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their harte, and as occasion serueth, expresse thē in their dedes outwardly, wherby they may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that blisse, whiche the gyuer of blessednes our sauiour Christe spake of and promised to suche, sayeng: <hi>Beati qui audiūt uerbum dei, &amp; custodiunt illud.</hi> Blessed by they that here the true doctrine of god, and kepe it, whiche is the true sense of that texte, Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we exhorte and desyre al our louyng subiectes, that they prayeng to God for the spirite of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, do conforme them selues as good scholers and learners ought, to here and beare away as afore, and willingly to obserue such ordre, as is by vs and our lawes prescribed, and to rede and beare well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the true doctrine, lately by vs and our clergye set forthe for theyr erudition, wherby presumption and arrogancye shall be withstanded, malyce and contention expelled, and carnall libertie refrayned and tempered, and disdeyne clerely remoued and ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken away. So as endeuouryng our selues to lyue quietly and charitably togither, eche one in his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, we shall be soo replenyshed with manifolde graces and gyftes of god, that after this lyfe we shall reigne in ioy euerlastyng with the onely head of the vniuersal catholike churche our sauiour and redemer Iesus Christe.
