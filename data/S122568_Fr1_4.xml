I am not ignorant what <hi>base aspersions,</hi> &amp; <hi>unchristianlike slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> (like a generall infection) haue spread themselues throughout the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> nor can I hope that the publishing of it can stop <hi>all</hi> those wide mouthes which are opened against it; yet I must not despaire of so much <hi>justice</hi> from the <hi>Candide,</hi> (for their <hi>owne honestie</hi> is interested in the Action) as (when they shall behold the innocence of it) to confesse, that I suffer most unjustly in these reports. How it was accepted of their <hi>Majesties,</hi> whom it was intended to please, we know, and had gracious signes: how the rest of the <hi>Court</hi> were affected, wee know too; Such as were faire and intelligent will yet giue it sufficient Testimonie: As for those which came with starch'd faces and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to dislike whatsoever they saw or heard, (all due reverence being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the faire fields they weare upon their backes) they must perforce giue mee leaue to be of that haeresie, and thinke that there is something else required to the composition of a Iudgement, then a good Suite of taken-up Clothes, a Countenance set in a frame, and some three shakes of the emptie Noddle. The difficulties, and disadvantages wee went upon were many, and knowne, neither did we faile in the successe we hop'd for; for indeed wee expected no other thing then to be cried downe by many-mouth'd <hi>Detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Alas, wee are all but men, and may erre; and our offence was the same that was imputed to <hi>Cicero,</hi> by a great <hi>Romane Ladie,</hi> who told him that it was <hi>Saucinesse</hi> in him amongst so many <hi>Patricians</hi> of eminent blood, to dare to be <hi>Vertuous</hi> or <hi>Eloquent.</hi> I doe confesse we did not goe such quaint wayes as we might haue done; we had none of those <hi>Sea-artes,</hi> knew not how, or else scorn'd to plant our <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

breath</hi> of the <hi>Spectatours;</hi> but freely &amp; ingenuously labourd rather to <hi>merit</hi> then <hi>rauish</hi> an <hi>Applause</hi> from the <hi>Theatre.</hi> Wee neuer yet were so poorely ambitious (nor euer will) to court the <hi>Claps</hi> of <hi>young Ones,</hi> who are more <hi>delighted</hi> to see an <hi>Ape</hi> play his <hi>forced trickes,</hi> then to behold the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most naturall Action in the world. Let such as despaire of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of <hi>Men,</hi> cry, <hi>Let in the Boyes, wee shall haue no noyse else.</hi> I envie not the applause comes from such hands or tongues. As for the <hi>Objections</hi> made by <hi>Envie</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> such as I haue heard, I will answere, and then dare all their <hi>Snakes</hi> to hisse out more. And first, the <hi>Lownesse</hi> of many of the <hi>Persons</hi> did displease some; I conversed too much with <hi>Sheepheards</hi> they say.</p>
   <p>It is the misery of <hi>Poetry</hi> aboue other <hi>sciences,</hi> &amp; in <hi>Poetry</hi> of the <hi>Dramme</hi> especially, that it lies open to be <hi>profan'd</hi> by every <hi>adulterate</hi> judgement. The <hi>Musician</hi> dares onely judge of <hi>Musicke,</hi> the <hi>Philosopher</hi> in naturall causes, the <hi>Mathematician</hi> of those Arts: But what <hi>fly-blowne</hi> piece of Man is there, whose best of vertues is to cry <hi>God dam him,</hi> whose top of knowledge the <hi>Alphabeticall</hi> and <hi>Greeke healths</hi> but thinks himselfe a Doctor of the Chaire in what belongs to the <hi>Scene?</hi> Let them looke into <hi>Plautus,</hi> and they shall find the chiefest person in his <hi>Persa</hi> to be a <hi>Servant;</hi> and it is accounted one of the greatest excellencies in <hi>Sydney,</hi> that he was able so much to humble his phant'sy, as truly and naturally to set forth the clownery of <hi>Dametas,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested and unlickt words and phrases of his wife and daughter. But these <hi>squirt-wits,</hi> (who are able onely to bring forth a paper of verses in a yeare, it may be of a haire that fell from their Mrs. Peruke, and think this sufficient to stile them <hi>Laureat</hi>) in the Description of a <hi>shipwracke</hi> (peradventure) would take great delight to see a faire <hi>Cypresse tree</hi> pictured. All that I will say to them is this, if their mouthes be out of tast, I am not bound to answer for it. But why this before their <hi>Majesties?</hi> say they. And I say, why not this before their <hi>Majesties,</hi> rather then higher things? (although they may perceiue that the straine is not continued.) The Court is not acquainted with such <hi>groueling humours;</hi> Therfore (my obstinate Heretike) the better. To haue showen them nothing but what they see daily, had bin but course entertainment, and if that was my errour, that the two <hi>Changelings</hi> spoke no strong lines, but plaid at <hi>Chackstones,</hi> when it may be some of our <hi>butterfly-judgements</hi> expected a set at <hi>Maw</hi> or <hi>Primivista</hi> from them, let it lye upon my Conscience.</p>
   <p>Next, whereas my discretion was call'd in question for making one to raile so bitterly upon Women before the Ladies, whō we should haue labour'd to please rather. I answer, that the Ladies (as some report) should take offence at <hi>Anteros</hi> his part, will not yet enter me; for although I know many of that sex weak enough, yet me thinks it cannot be that such as they, who are taken out of the <hi>Ore,</hi> refin'd and wrought up unto such a degree of <hi>purity</hi> by the <hi>Court,</hi> that we may not be afraid to say, that they are more then halfe men (that is) come not far short of us in that which gives us our denomination, Reason; it cannot be (I say) that these should so much discredit the opinion which the world has of their apprehensions and judgements, as to be offended to see a Woman-hater personated: for then, how shall we hereafter dare to bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stage a <hi>Bawd,</hi> an <hi>Vsurer,</hi> an <hi>Intemperate</hi> man, a <hi>Traytour,</hi> or one that
<pb facs="4"/>
commits <hi>Idolatry</hi> to his <hi>Mistris,</hi> (which is as great a sinne as most of these) if onely to <hi>personate</hi> be to <hi>approue?</hi> No, when we act a <hi>vice,</hi> it is not because we <hi>allow</hi> of it, but rather labour to <hi>exti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>pe</hi> it by shewing the odiousnesse of it to the world. As for that which they object against bringing in of the foure Guls in the third Act, as impertinent to the Plot; I answer, that it was a most <hi>naturall</hi> passage, &amp; although it conduc'd nothing to the <hi>maine hinge</hi> on which the chiefe <hi>carriage</hi> of the <hi>Comoedie turn'd,</hi> (no more then <hi>Liuely's</hi> drinking of Sack, the Donation of the Living, with the bestowing of the crooked change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Anteros</hi> turning sheepheard, or <hi>Stypes</hi> being tyed to the tree) yet if they please to turne to the latter end of the fift Act, they shall find that they were not all foysted in as meere strangers. Let them shew me (if they can) a rule in Poetry, that binds us so strictly not to meddle with any persons but what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine primarily to the plot. If they can (which I cannot beleeue) I will shew them again that <hi>Rule</hi> broken by most of the prime Writers in this kind, both of Ages past and present, I meane not only in our owne <hi>Mother tongue,</hi> wherin the <hi>Dramme</hi> but lately is arriv'd at any <hi>perfection,</hi> but in <hi>Latine, Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and others. But this is the bolt of some shallow &amp; narrow capacitie, who peradventure was puzled with the multitude of names, and would haue been better contented with three Actors and a halfe, and some seven or eight pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of verses tyed together with <hi>Coblers</hi> ends. As for the false and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable imputations laid upon it by my Tribe with the short haire and long eares, my <hi>formall outsides,</hi> that looke demure, and snuffle; I doe not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them, because it is their Trade; nor are they onely at open defiance with <hi>this,</hi> but with <hi>all kind of learning.</hi> Yet I cannot see how any <hi>Good man,</hi> should be displeased, or thinke Religion any whit wronged, to see those sores and Biles of the Church brought to open view, (the onely way to cure them) to see those (cursed Simoniacall patrons) rowsed from out their dennes, to see such <hi>Mock-sch<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>llers,</hi> nay <hi>Mock-christians</hi> expos'd to publique laughter.— A <hi>Scrivener,</hi> a <hi>Box-maker,</hi> a <hi>Cloth-worker,</hi> a <hi>Fuller,</hi> and such <hi>mechanicall sordide</hi> people, must with <hi>unwash'd</hi> hands now adayes dare to offer at Gods <hi>Altar,</hi> and yet these men must not be touch'd, but <hi>Religion</hi> (forsooth) suffers in it.— Reade, and blush at thy <hi>credulitie.</hi> — Reader, not to tire thee with a Preface, thou hast it <hi>verbatim,</hi> and <hi>punctually</hi> as it was acted. I confesse, I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly haue altred some things which upon more mature deliberation I haue found to be subject to mis-constructions, but that I knew the malice of some would upon that take advantage, to make the world beleeue, that that which hath, or shall be spoken against it, is true.— Reade it with <hi>Candour</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi> and then call me</p>
