The best Historians hath not scaped uncensured: <hi>Livie,</hi> so much commended by <hi>Quintilian,</hi> was condemned by one of too much verbositie: by another of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Patavinity: I am ready to undergoe the common fate, armed against ill Language, with that innocency which accompanieth Truth, and my desire of communicating, that Intelligence, (which at first was private) to the publick bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: Hee that ingrosseth all to himselfe, may thinke himselfe wise, but will scarce prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe honest▪ and they which censure the labors of them, who intend a common good, give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against themselves of a snarling Cyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme,
<pb facs="3"/>not Scholasticall ingenuitie. I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, I have deliuered truth unpartially; and although collected with much labour out of scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered papers, yet it is set downe so methodically, that a meane capacity, may runne along with the History; apprehend by Jmagination, what was don by Action: I wish it may in the reading work as well upon the generous English spirits, as <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophons Cyropaedia</hi> upon the
