   <p>discoursed, and published the excellencie of your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and merits: Shee seemes to be sparing of your prayses, which are so justly due to you; For Experience hath now made me know a thousand times more therof, then heretofore I heard or understood, because I find so much benignity and goodnesse among you, and especially your Honours house, that I should esteem my selfe to be guilty of a base ingratitude, if I consecrated not the remaynder of my dayes to the honour of your service and commands; For I confesse, that this small Present, which I now present and proffer you, cannot counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile or equalize those sublime favors; whereby you have eternally made me your debter.</p>
   <p>Those Philosophers, which entreat and discourse of naturall causes, doe affirme, That the Sunne which makes the Raynebowe in the firmament, by the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and defusion of his rayes, in a watry clowd dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to receive it; doth there forme and ingender this diversity of colours so pleasing to our sight. Your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (my good Lord) is the Sunne of my happinesse, and I am this clowd covered with the rayes of your favors, which makes all the world admire in me, the greatnesse of your Generosity, and the excellencie of your goodnes.</p>
   <p>But herein (notwithstanding) consists not my satisfaction, but rather your honor and glory, and as I desire to publish that, so I likewise desire to finde this; For I cannot live contented, if I made not a publique acknowledgement of those many favours, whereby you have perfectly purchased and made me yours, and this Confession consisteth in the oath of fidelity and obedience, which I have sworne to the honour of
<pb facs="2"/>your service, and to testifie the immortality of my vowes, wherein with all possible humility I present you my selfe, and this small Booke to your Honours feete; A worke proportionable to my weakenesse, but meerely disproportionable to your Greatnesse.</p>
   <p>If I am any way guilty herein, your goodnesse is the true cause thereof; in regard it makes me beleeve that you will rather excuse my Zeale, then accuse or condemne my presumption; and I doe promise my selfe this hope, and flatter my selfe with this confidence, that your Honour will partly excuse this worke of mine, if it be not accuratly or delicately polished, and that the will remayning where the power wants, is free and current payment with great and generous spirits.</p>
   <p>Some perchance may affirme and say, that I have discoursed and treated those Matters with too much simplicity, which indeed is my only intent and designe. Because my text and matter doe necessarily oblige and tye me thereunto, as also in regard I ever find the easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way to be the best, for that the thornes of Studie and Schollership, doe but ingage and ingulph our Wits in the labyrinth of insupportable length and lauguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the which most commonly when we have all done and ranne thorow, wee in the end finde but a Minotaur of doubts, and a pensive melancholy anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie which devours them. My Lord, I have no other designe or ambition in this my Dedication, but to pay this tribute to your Honour, hoping that your charitie will cover my defects, and your goodnesse over-vayle and pardon my weakenesse and imperfections.</p>
   <p>And my Lord, it is with all manner of right and reason, that I consecrate and inscribe this small Worke
<pb facs="3"/>of mine to your Honour, and place your Honourable name in the Frontispice thereof, as a bright Phare and relucent torch, which shall communicate and lend its lustre and light, to make it see and salute the world.</p>
   <p>And so my good Lord, I will seeke my delights in the honour of your service; my inclinations shall have no other centre, but the execution of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. My vowes and prayers shall be incessantly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth for your prosperities: and my Ambition shall never flye or soare higher, then to conserue the honour of your favours, and to be both to your Honor, and to the young Noblemen your Sonnes,</p>

      <signed>Your most humble, and truely devoted Servant, I. M.</signed>
