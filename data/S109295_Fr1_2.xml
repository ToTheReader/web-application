   <head>TO THE READER, VVITH ANSVVERE to the <hi>Discoursers</hi> two epistles.</head>
   <p>It greiues me (christian reader) <hi>I</hi> assure thee, still perforce to be thus trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blesome not onely to my selfe, but also to thee. It must needes be enough, and more then enough for thee, to haue pervsed so many simple treatises al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, all harpinge on one string. And as for my selfe, how can <hi>I</hi> after so great vexation by the <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> so long imprisonment, such publicke producemēt into open courts, &amp; lastly my paynes to cleare the truth frō <hi>M. Harsnets</hi> slaunders, but like a tired &amp; weather beaten bird, wish sōe quy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er corner to rest my selfe in, &amp; to dry my feathers in the warme sūne? But it is not my lot, I thīke, to breath me, no not a litle: For behold two new chā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pions, that haue been bucklinge on their harnesse these two or three yeares, with a proud swelling volume like a Spanish Armada, challenge me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh to a new encounter. Wherin yet this comforts me, that this new on set <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> an open declaration to the world, that in these mens Iudgments at the least, the <hi>Bishop</hi> with his home forces hath bene to weake. Neither this onely, but even the <hi>B.</hi> himselfe by entertaininge this fresh ayde, doth as it were plainly confesse, his victory to be as yet vnperfect. Otherwise it were idle eyther for them to offer, or him to imbrace a needles supply, if they per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaved not their former platforms by that poore battery, which my cōtēned writīgs haue made, to be tottering &amp; falling. Blessed be God which though he suffer his truth to be shrewdly pressed, yet not to be altogether oppressed, to be shrewdly thrust at, yet not vtterly cast downe: to be laden indeed with heavie burdens, yet to grow vnder them like a prevailyng palme. Great i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> the power <hi>I</hi> see of a iust cause, how simple so ever her taile be. But what? shall the matter now be put out of all doubt? Must it needes in these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogues be convinced by Logike, and perswaded by Rhetorike, that all this brute of Possession and Dispossession is but a mere deceit? O foolish and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>advised men, which thinke to overthrow that by fond Sophisticall words, which by sad wordes and deedes hath not hetherto beene vanquished. No doubt men of iudgment will heerein deeme the <hi>Bishop</hi> to haue failed in a great poynt of circumspection, in committing the brunt &amp; execution of a battayle to these the weakest and cowardliest companies he hath. For if himselfe could not be satisfied to haue wounded the cause to his power, with the sword of his authority, but that he must needes race the memory of it with consuminge fyre, he should not for performance thereof have sent vs this <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> as every one may easily discerne this to be.</p>
   <p>I pray thee Christian Reader, haue patience with me. I will spare thy paynes, and myne owne, as much as <hi>I</hi> can. My purpose is not to man out an other Galeasse like this <hi>Discoursers</hi> gallant, but to set vpon it with my
<pb facs="3"/> poore fisher boate, &amp; yet <hi>I</hi> hope by God his assistāce to make her lay her top sayle in the broth. Neither thinke thou, I endevour hereby a defence more for my selfe, then for thee. I could haue contemned their frivelous reproches, had it not bene thou wert greatly endangered by the manifold grose errors wherewith they would poyson thee. And therfore intending thy good, more then myne owne credit, I will take a breife view of their <hi>Dialogicall Dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>courses,</hi> before <hi>I</hi> come to them which properly concerne me.</p>
   <p>These <hi>Discourses</hi> be fronted with a double epistle, one to the <hi>Right H. the L. Keeper,</hi> and cheife Iudges of the land, to which we will answer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none: the other <hi>to the Reader:</hi> wherin omitting their <hi>earnest care to find out the truth</hi> in this doctrine, proceeding even to dissention betwene thee two, otherwise sworne brethren in matters of fact, first we haue a large re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hearsall of sundry <hi>reasons</hi> for the edition of this treatise, both wherfore it hath beene <hi>hitherto suppressed,</hi> and also for what causes now at last it is <hi>published.</hi> For <hi>suppresing</hi> the <hi>regard of your owne imperfectiōs</hi> were not to be misliked, if you had not repented of this humilitie so soone. But <hi>I</hi> can hardly beleeue you conceaued so meanely of your owne facultie, as to feare the censure of any for <hi>scholasticall forme,</hi> your whole discourse is so Analyticall, &amp; your <hi>Phisiologus</hi> &amp; <hi>Othodoxus</hi> such ripe &amp; pregnāt concluders, besides your continuall vpbrayding me with my <hi>Hotchpotch</hi> and vs all which haue dealt in this cause with our intricate riddles. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can <hi>I</hi> thinke you distrust your <hi>eloquence</hi> as you pretend, wherein you braue it so every where. Whether it be <hi>Ciceronian vernish</hi> or no, <hi>I</hi> cannot tell, my skill is not great. In my poore iudgment, to giue you your right, the sentences are well stuffed with good ratling wordes, able to still the babes crying, &amp; replenisht <hi>eftsoones</hi> with many <hi>Timely</hi> epithites, sweetly buz<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zing in every corner like a swarme of flies. <hi>I</hi> graunt you that therebe many buysy controlers of other mens labours. But why should you feare a quippe for a poynt of learnyng, which haue inured your faces not to blush at grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter matters? No doubt your <hi>compassion and care of me</hi> was great: least by publishing this worke, you shoud <hi>increase my afliction,</hi> such is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable regard you carry towards me in this you haue published, in every page imbracinge me no lesse tenderly then the Ape her young ones. Lastly you hoped, <hi>Authoritie might haue caused silence:</hi> for which purpose you remember <hi>the obeydience of the prophet to Amaziah his commaund,</hi> after he had done his message though not so fully as he would, yet sufficiēt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly: such is your great skile, or at least your fidelitie in reasoninge, that by your rule, the hungry man must patiently fast, because he doth so which hath his belly full. Withall you would faine charge our stirringe in this cause, with want of respect <hi>to her Maiesties Princely prerogatiue,</hi> but in ans<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>were
<pb facs="3"/> to your <hi>Queres</hi> this imputation shall appeare to be no lesse absurde, then malitious, and your selues rather pernitious Sycophants, then wee in the smallest allegyance vndutifull. And thus haue wee these worthy <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for suppressing</hi> as forcible to this end, as if one should suppresse wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If they had found our fact worthy thus to be he censured, I hope they wolde not be so partiall, as to suffer all the rest of the practisers, in the same ranke of guiltynesse with vs, eyther not to be called to accompt at all, or being examyned to be dismissed againe without any correction. <hi>I</hi> wolde desire you (if any honest request may prevaile with men of your stampe,) that if you mvst n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>edes be lying, you would lye with more probabi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lity least all the world cry shame of you. Tenthly your Scorpions sting is ever wagging, in obiecting <hi>disobedience to the Maiestrate, and printinge without pryuilege:</hi> you shall receave answer in your <hi>Queres</hi> where you vrge this matter more importunatly. And thus mvch for the wynde that moved the Aspen tree, of whose leaves it seemes, for all your reasons yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, your tongues are made.</p>
   <p>The rest of the Epistle is spent in preventinge <hi>lauish tongues,</hi> against whom you fence both your <hi>Persons,</hi> and your <hi>Cause.</hi> For your <hi>Persons,</hi> and first for your learning, It is ioy that men of your skyll can be so humble. Howsoever you in modesty deeme your selues <hi>Minimi Apostolorum, the least of ten thousand:</hi> yet for my part when I consider the multitude of good <hi>Authors</hi> prefixed before your Dialogues, and scattered sentences in them, &amp; how little you are behoulding to any of them in the cheefest points you handle, having through the quicknes of your owne conceit found out that, which they neuer once dreamed of.</p>
   <p>When I say, I consider these things, I am forced to yeild this praise vnto you: that you are profound Rh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>psodistes, &amp; men expert in Tablatine, which by the helpe of an Index are able in some few yeares to marshall a troope of sentences and Authors to some terrible shew. Besides who can but cōmend, as your multiplicity of reading, so your faithfulnes in alleging, which would not vse the phrase of <hi>Dare manus,</hi> but cite your Author <hi>M. Tullius Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> for it? which phrase only, hath put <hi>Cicero</hi> in the list of <hi>Authors</hi> to
<pb facs="4"/> make vp the nomber: and the like diligence hath afforded vs the names of diuers others. Nay me thinkes I see in you the skil of prudent Captaynes, which to terrify their enemies, can make an handfull of men shew like a great multitude, some one seeming two, yea sometimes three. This stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageme hath placed <hi>Aristotle</hi> in <hi>A,</hi> &amp; <hi>Philosophus</hi> for the selfe same author in the letter <hi>P.</hi> So <hi>Iohannes Darrell</hi> beeing a great learned mā, first makes one in the ranke of <hi>I,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Narration of Darrell</hi> an other in the troopes of <hi>N.</hi> But <hi>Gregorius</hi> in <hi>G</hi> keepes a terrible styrr: for first he is part downe simply <hi>Gregorius,</hi> then againe <hi>Gregorius Magnus,</hi> and the third time <hi>Gregorius 1. Rom.</hi> and yet all these are but one. You muste needes ouercome, which are so full of pollicie, not inferiour to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that by certain Idols made for the nonce, and men of straw, tooke <hi>Cresus</hi> at <hi>Sardis.</hi> Feare not therfore ye learned <hi>Discoursers,</hi> howsoever the ignorāt may lightly passe over your Table, painted margēt, &amp; many autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ityes without due regard, yet the Iudiciall Reader (able to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish betweene a counterfeyt, &amp; a grounded knowledg,) will giue you such commendation as you deserue.</p>
   <p>For the carriage of your <hi>liues precedent</hi> &amp; <hi>present,</hi> we haue a whole page persumed with many slonenly tearmes. And herein you lay about you mightely, bragging your selues like butchers mastiues with their collers of iron pykes, &amp; daring any to set vpon you. If your hornes peepe out of the bushes whether you are fled for covert, you may thanke your selues which haue eaten away the leaues.
