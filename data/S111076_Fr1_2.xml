   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, both the Argument of this short Treatise (the better part of which consisteth in Oppositions, which the more plainely they bee set downe, the more clearely they appeare) and the purpose of the Author (who made it for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned) hath made me to abstaine from the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of Rhetorique in the translation thereof, wholy applying my selfe to expresse the Authors meaning, as knowing that there is nothing heere but for the simple, who ought rather to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted then delighted in matters of Religion. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Translater hereof, that hee nameth not himselfe, since that he had rather purchase profit to others, then vaine-glory to himselfe. The name of the Author is a sufficient patronage for the booke, who is so acute, and subtill in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of Religion, that he neuer disputeth, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he refuteth. Many bookes haue beene written of this Subiect, but none as yet so fitted to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie of the vulgar, neither comprehended in so
<pb facs="3"/> fewe leaues. Here are no nice distinctions to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract the ignorant, but onely those Papisticall errours are here shewed, which are repugnant to the written verity. Let intention accompanie thee in reading, discretion in iudging, gratulation in profiting: and if thou beest profited, then shall I count my selfe to haue well translated. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi>
