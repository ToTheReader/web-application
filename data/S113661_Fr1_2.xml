But I may not here dilate of this difference of Scripture, and therfore will come
<pb facs="4"/>
directly to that portion of it, <hi>Christs Sermon in the Mount,</hi> which is here explaned in this Commentarie; endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring briefly to shew some notes of eminence in these <hi>three Chapters,</hi> for which they deserue among all the <hi>Lords Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies</hi> to haue the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>first three.</hi> And to omit the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> hereof, though <hi>Iesus Christ the Sonne of God,</hi> because the <note n="g" place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 16</note>
      <hi>whole Scripture was giuen by inspiration from the same spirit;</hi> as also his <hi>preparation</hi> hereunto (though extraordinarie) <hi>by</hi>
      <note n="h" place="margin">Luk. 6. 12.</note>
      <hi>prayer to God the whole night before,</hi> which must needes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port some consequence of great importance; I will onely point at the <hi>manner of penning</hi> this Sermon, and the matter which it containeth.</p>
   <p>For the first: when the beloued Apostle saith of Christs sayings and doings, that <hi>many things were not written,</hi> and yet<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>, 31</note>
      <hi>some things were written</hi> for the ground and confirmation of our faith, none (I hope) will denie, but these things which were written, were by the H. Ghost iudged more behooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Church, thē those which were omitted, whence by good collection it will follow, that things more largely penned were also deemed the more expedient: for why should the holy Ghost in penning be more copious, vnlesse the things propounded were (to vs at least) more pretious? Now search the holy records of Christ throughout, and see what Sermon is so fully registred as this is; vnlesse it were his <note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 14. 15. 16. 17. chapt.</note>
      <hi>consolation</hi> vttered to his Disciples, with his <hi>prayer</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Father a little before his passion: <hi>This</hi> beeing his <hi>wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> to them into their Apostleship, and <hi>That,</hi> his <hi>farewell</hi> at his death.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">The matter of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note>But to come to the matter it selfe. This Sermon contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth 12. seuerall heades of Doctrine, answerable indeede to the number of the 12. Apostles, to whome it was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intended, vpon their calling to that office, although I dare not say, particularly to be applied <hi>part</hi> to <hi>person,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generally the whole to euery one; vnlesse it may be, in
<pb facs="4"/>
the last parcell by the <hi>great ruine of the house vpon the sandes,</hi> Christ had a speciall ayme at the fearefull fall of <hi>Iudas</hi> that betraied him. Now the <hi>first</hi> of these concerneth mans <hi>chiefe</hi>
      <note place="margin">Chap. 5. v. 3. to the 13.</note>
      <hi>good in true happinesse,</hi> which is here so plainly declared in eight seuerall rules, as they lead euery man hereto, and giue the child of God most comfortable assurance hereof, euen in his greatest miserie.

My paines herein hath beene chiefly this, as neere as I could, out of mine owne and others notes, to commend vnto the publike view, the authors faithfull labours in his own mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Onely I haue here and there vpon good occasion (though priuate to my selfe) added some references in the margent vnto classicall popish writers, for such opinions as are herein charged vpon them. Mine interest for the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of this worke, I hope I shall approoue vnto any gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayer. Now whatsoeuer it is, in all bounden dutie &amp; seruice, I humbly commend it vnto your Lordship, and vnder your Honourable protection, to the houshold of faith. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I doubt not of your diligence in the faithful and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent perusall of it, I wil turne my perswasions towards you this way, into praier to the Almightie for you, that by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying of your faith, and other graces of God herein, you may more and more abound in the fruits of righteousnesse, inioying here much true honour, with long and happie daies, in the peace of our Syon, and the prosperitie of your familie, and in the ende eternall life through Iesus Christ. </p>
