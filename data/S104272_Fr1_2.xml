   <head>THE STATIONER to the READER.</head>
   <p>Courteous Reader, I need not by these few lines invite thee to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey this ensuing divine Poemè; the true worth, that it containes, hath saved mee that labour. The Authour her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>of (being my worthy Friend) ere hee had fully perfited the same, was himselfe transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the place of all perfection, and changed the Egypt of this world, for the full fruition of a celestiall <hi>Canaan.</hi> In his life my desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse selfe was so endeared vnto him, that he pleased to bestow vpon me the Copie thereof, and I haue taken the paines to make that publique, which was before smoothered in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb facs="3"/>
and perhaps might haue beene buried in oblivion. Many yeeres sithence he writ a Worke intituled, <hi>The Historie and Raigne of EDVVARD the second, with his miserable and cruell death:</hi> But the same being by supreamest Authoritie forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to bee printed, was for a long time cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily kept, us a Iewell in his secret Cabinet, or rather (amongst divers other Workes of his excellently well composed) as a chiefe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his owne priuate Librarie, till at length some Sacrilegious hand, (pardon mee if I so tear me it) stole this Wedge of Gold, and for gaine, without allowance of Authority, or knowledge of the Author, brought it to the Presse: but so much drosse was mixt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, &amp; such foule faults escaped the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">

      </gap> To remedie this, the Authour was induced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">

it was originally composed; the which with his assistance I effected: but the sale thereof was so hindered by the former Impression of the false Copie, that the true one found little or no successe. Now once againe (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) I haue ventured to present to thy view this second Worke of the same Author, which if the reading thereof may both profit and pleasure thee, I shall reape a satisfaction of mine owne desires, and thy selfe good content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for time so well expended. Farewell.</p>
