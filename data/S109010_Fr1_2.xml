Of whom more fitly might I seeke Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage

then of him who is indeed <hi>the Great

there is in all Eminency of
Honour and Heroicall vertues so great
and so faire a correspondence, that who
so looketh on either of both, may in
him as in a resplendent Glasse, behold
the full and liuely portraiture of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Both descended of most Princely
Progenitors: Both borne and bred in
this most happy Iland: Both Inheritors
and Possessors of the Imperiall Crowne
of great Brittaine: Both by treacheries
of malignant enemies to the Gospell,

which was pulled out for the profession of

<hi>Eusebius</hi> relates,<note n="n" place="margin">Id. lib. eod. ca. 33</note> how while
himselfe preached before the Emperor,
he though being in dutifull manner
requested by <hi>Eusebius;</hi> not onely <hi>refused
to sit downe,</hi> but when <hi>Eusebius</hi> fearing to
be too tedious, intended abruptly to
breake off his speech, the Emperour
would not permit him so to doe, but
exhorted him to proceed to the end of
his Sermon▪ and when <hi>Eusebius</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

and take some ease, the Emperour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
refusing, with a <hi>sad and seuere coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
answered, It is not fit, either with
negligence or irreuerence, to heare the Word of
God.</hi> His <hi>loue to the Churches and Houses
<pb facs="4"/>
of God</hi> such, that almost <hi>euerywhere</hi>
      <note n="o" place="margin">Eus. lib. 3. ca. 47.</note>
      <hi>throughout his Empire,</hi> he either builded

Churches, and that with such beauty
and Munificence, that <hi>hee spared</hi>
      <note n="p" place="margin">Id. lib. 2. ca 44.</note>
      <hi>no
cost</hi> in so pious a Worke. His <hi>Loue to
the peace of Gods Church</hi> such: that he not
onely tooke away<note n="q" place="margin">Ruff. lib. 1. ca. 2.</note> the occasions of
quarrels among Bishops, but to preuent
contentions himselfe sat<note n="r" place="margin">Eus. lib. 3. ca. 10.</note> in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodall

Bishop</hi>

      <hi>of them all,</hi> and by his vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy
and prudence, reduced all both
to vnity in faith, and amity in affection.
As the like sincere Loue vnto <hi>God,</hi> to his
holy <hi>Bishops,</hi> and to the <hi>peace and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of his Church, is relucent in your
Maiesty, and by innumerable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
made euident vnto all: So in
the manner and meanes of <hi>propugning</hi>
and <hi>propagating</hi> the faith, it may be truly
said, to the immortall honour of your
sacred Person, that neither <hi>Constantine,</hi>
nor any other Prince or Emperour is a
match therein. <hi>Constatine</hi> like <hi>Dauid,</hi> a
King of Warre, by the sword of battell
<pb facs="5"/>
subdued the pride and rage of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Tyrants, and so with the borders
of his Empire, enlarged the profession
of Christ: your Maiesty like <hi>Salomon,</hi> a
King of Peace, by that depth of diuine
and vnexpressable knowledge and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
wherewith the God of Heauen
hath filled your sacred brest, with the
Sword of Gods Spirit, subduing the
Pride, Idolatries, and Impieties of that
<hi>Man of Sinne,</hi> hath made glorious the
true faith of Christ, not onely in, and
beyond the bounds of your owne, and
the Romane Empire, but from Great
Brittaine, euen to the vtmost borders of
the Earth. <hi>Constantine</hi> for his great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and loue vnto it, is most highly
and most iustly renowned. His <hi>vacant
times</hi>
      <note n="t" place="margin">Id. lib. 4. ca. 29.</note>
      <hi>he bestowed in writing of most vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Treatises,</hi> which custome <hi>he continued</hi>
      <note n="u" place="margin">Id. ca. 29.</note>
      <hi>euen to his last age.</hi> The excellency of
whose writings may bee easily discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
partly by that one <hi>Oration, ad coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

heart, fraught with all humane and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

which <hi>whole</hi>

      <hi>multitudes had,</hi> who
flocked to heare his Princely and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

and mellifluous <hi>Orations,</hi> which
haue, and still doe flow from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptied
Fountaine of your Maiesties
sacred tongue and pen? which euen en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
all iudicious and religious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers

      <hi>was a true
word which I heard of thy sayings and of thy
wisedome: but behold the one halfe thereof was
not told vnto me. Happy are thy men, and
happy are thy seruants, which stand before
thee alway, and heare thy wisedome. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be the Lord thy God, which loued thee, to
set thee on his Throne, as King instead of the
Lord thy God Because thy God loued Israel, to
establish it for euer, therfore hath he made thee
King euer them, to execute Iudgement &amp; Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi>
This <hi>Eminency</hi> of Piety, Knowledge

and Wisedom, as in all true Christian &amp;
Religous hearts it hath, and will euer
most deseruedly purchase both <hi>Honour</hi>
and <hi>Admiration:</hi> So from the <hi>sonnes of
Belial,</hi> &amp; enemies to the faith of Christ.
What else could bee expected, but the
bitter scoffes and scurrill Calumnies of
of their most virulent and venomous

when the vnblemished <hi>Honor</hi> and the
