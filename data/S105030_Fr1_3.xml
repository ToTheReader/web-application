   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Daily trouble the good</hi> Reader with Bookes, Verses, Pamflettes, and many other tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flyng thinges, as mutche to hold thee occupied in good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes me (and keepe thee from losse of tyme) as for any matter that I either cā gaine glorie by, or deserueth to bee embrased: but vsyng me and my workes thankefully, and paiyng me for my pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, with the like courtesie, that other men reapeth for their labours, I thinke my studie well bestowed, and promes yet with my penne, to pleasure thee farther. And for that I would haue all menne to thinke, that in trothe and plainnesse I haue greate felicitie, and doe hate any kinde of flatterie or finenesse. I meane in my next booke, called my Challenge, to ronne ouer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of myne other woorkes, and where peraduenture by some reporte of others, (that knewe not the trothe,) I haue failed in settyng foorthe of some seruices, emong the whiche Maister Ihon Norrice, and diuers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
<pb facs="6"/>
gentlemen Captaines now in Flaunders, haue not the worthinesse of their seruices declared. I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes that now beyng better instructed, and hauyng true intelligence of thynges as thei were, I will at large write the commendation of as many, as merites to bee honoured for their well doyng, and make amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, where either by ignoraunce, or the report of others I haue failed. For so sure as GOD is Almightie, if I could gaine mountaines of golde, to flatter any one in Printyng an vntrothe, I would rather wishe my handes were of, then take in hande sutche a matter. For neither affection, fauor, commoditie, fame, nor par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallitie, at no tyme nor season, shall willyngly lead my penne amisse. And farther, if I thought any one for his owne glories sake, had tolde me more then is truely to bee proued: I would not onely condempne my self for giuyng sutche hastie credite, to vainglorious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: But in like sorte my penne should shewe the blotte in their browes, that giueth me wrong aduertisemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. And so good Reader, condēpne not me if anything bee amisse, or lefte out that ought to haue been tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: For as I knowe and am instructed) seeyng not all my self) I must write, and so till my nexte booke come forthe (where many thynges shall be treated of) and that my good will to the honouryng of vertue
<pb facs="6"/>
shall bee seen. I bidde thee fare well freendly Reader, crauyng thy fauourable Iudgemente on that I haue written. From those men for whom my booke hath bin a blast of fame vnto (as I did beleue by the true trō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of penne) are not of sutche greate abilitie, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their purses power or countenaunces, could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptll me to followe their humours: nor by any meanes woorke my muse to their willes, whose ritchesse and wealthe is not able (if men would be hired) to wrest a wrie the hande and hedde of an honest writer. And to make manifest that I neither will be infected, nor car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried awaie from that whiche is good, for any badde practice and perswasions, I confesse before GOD and the worlde, I scarce haue receiued thankes, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest labors I haue taken (at their handes that I haue written of) mutche lesse haue I been recompenced, or founde cause to flatter the worlde. But in one thyng I maie reioyce, the honourable persone to whom my Choice is dedicated (and others of great callyng) hath bothe been gratefull sondrie waies (in moste bountifull maner:) and also hath encoraged me to proceede in the like paines, whiche in very deede I mynde to go about as well to the fame and glory of good menne, as for the aduoidyng of sloth and idelnesse my self.</p>
