                 <title>A posie of spirituall flowers : taken out of the garden of the holy scriptures, consisting of these sixe sorts: hearts ease, true delight, the worlds wonders, the souls solace, times complaint, the doom of sinners.

There is no man liuing who may claime that interest in mee, or challenge my very best endeuours in that measure as your selues, who may iustly say to me, as</hi> Paul <hi>did to</hi> Philemon;
<note place="margin">Philem. 19.</note> Thou owest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs euen thine owne selfe. <hi>For besides that, your house hath been to me as the house of</hi> One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siphorus <hi>was to</hi> Paul,
<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.16.</note>
      <hi>euen this also that I my selfe haue an house to dwell in, and a pastoral charge to labour in, I may impute it vnto your selues, as principall meanes, raised vp by God, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it for me.
<note place="margin">Iob 31.20.</note> The loines of me and mine may blesse you, because by your meanes wee are cloathed
<pb n="39" facs="25"/>with a fleece. I haue nothing to returne vnto you for your so great paines, but these few home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie papers, the poore present of an euer remaining debtor; I would they were as worthie of any respect with you, as in many respects they doe belong vnto you. My soule perswadeth it selfe that you both are of the number of those,
<note place="margin">Reuel. 6.4.</note> who haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the seale of the lion of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,
<note place="margin">Galat. 6.16.</note> that long since the world hath bin crucified vnto you, and you vnto the world, &amp; that you haue proposed Christ Iesus to your selues the onely gaine:
<note place="margin">Philip 1.21.</note> I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore send not vnto you this fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well which I haue sung vnto the world to perswade you, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to encourage you:
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.6.</note> He that hath begun a good worke in you, will performe it and encrease it
<pb n="40" facs="26"/>more and more:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Vers. 9.</note> And this I pray that your loue may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound yet more and more in knowledge, and in all iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<note place="margin">Vers. 10.</note> that yee may discerne things that differ, and may be pure and without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vntil the day of Christ. <hi>Amen.</hi>
