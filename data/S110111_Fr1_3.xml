   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen (according to the laudable custome) I am
to court you with a few premisses considered: but a
number of you there bee, who consider neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses
nor conclusion, but piteouslie torment Title
Pages on euerie poast: neuer reading farther of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
Booke, than Imprinted by <hi>Simeon</hi> such a signe, and yet with
your dudgen iudgements will desperatelie presume to run vp to the
hard hilts through the whole bulke of it. <hi>Martin Momus,</hi> and
splaiefooted <hi>Zoylus</hi> that in the eight and sixt age of Poetrie, and
first yere of the reigne of Tarltons toies kept a foule stir in Poules
Church-yard, are now reuined againe: and like want on Whelpes
that haue wormes in their tungs, slauer and betouse euerie paper
they meete withall. Yea, if they chance but on a moate or a wind
bladder, they neuer haue done with it till they haue cleane ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
and tost it out of sight. For my part, I wish that I may be both
out of their sight and out of their minde too: and if their winy
wits must needs be working, that they would rather be Tailors to
make, than botchers or coblers to amend or to marre. Come, come,
I know their dull tricks wel inough, you shal haue them lie in child
bed one and thirtie weeks and eight daies of three bad lines and a
halfe, &amp; afterward spend a whole twelue month in spunging &amp;
sprucing them, honest thriftie <hi>Peter Littleton</hi> discharging their
commons all the while: but such poore fellowes as I, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
put out money to be paid againe when wee come from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
either must haue our work dispatcht by the weeks
end, or els we may go beg: and yet I will not beg of them neither
go the world neuer so hard, no not so much as a good word: but if
in word or deed I hear that they wrong me, Ile meet them right
if I can, And so I leaue them to stop mustard pots with my leaues
if they will, or to their owne will what soeuer.</p>
