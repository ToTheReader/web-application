   <head>The Epistle to the Reader,</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S in the dayes of <hi>Noe</hi> they all perished in the waters, that entred not into the Arke prepared by Gods owne appointment, for the preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such as should escape that fearefull and almost vniversall destruction: So is it a most certaine and vndoubted truth, good Christian Reader, that none can flie from the wrath to come, and attaine desired happinesse, but such as enter into that society of men which we call the Church, which is the chosen multitude of them whom God hath seperated from the rest of the world, and to whom he hath in more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall sort manifested himselfe by the knowledge of reuealed truth, then to any other. So that nothing is more necessary to be sought out and knowne, then which, and where this happy society of holy ones is, that so wee may joyne our selues to the same, and inherit the promises made vnto it: according to that of the holy Patriarch <hi>Noe:</hi> Blessed be the God of <hi>Sem,</hi> and let <hi>Chanaan</hi> be his seruant: the Lord perswade <hi>Iaphet</hi> to dwell in the tents of <hi>Sem.</hi> The considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof moued me, when I was to enter into the controuersies of these times, first and before all other things, carefully to seeke out the nature and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Church, the notes whereby it may be knowne, which it is amongst all the societies of men in the world, and what the priuiledges are that doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto it: of all which things I haue treated in those foure Bookes of that argument, which not long since I offered to thy viewe and censure. Now it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth that in this insueing Booke then promised, I shew in what sort almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, who sitteth betweene the Cherubins in this his holy Temple, reuealeth himselfe from off the mercy seate, to such as by the calling of grace he hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to approach &amp; draw neare vnto himselfe, and how he guideth, and directeth them, to the attaining of eternall felicity. Many &amp; sundry waies did God reueale himselfe in ancient times, as it is in the Epistle to the Hebrewes. For some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he manifested himselfe to men waking, by visions: sometimes to men sleeping, by dreames: sometimes he appeared in a piller of a cloud: sometimes in flaming fire: sometimes he came walking a soft pace among the trees of the garden, in the coole of the day: sometimes he rent the rockes, and claue the mountaines in sunder: sometimes he spake with a still and soft voyce: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his thunders shooke the pillars of heauen, and made the earth to tremble, as in the giuing of the lawe, when he came downe vpon Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> what time the people by <hi>Moses</hi> direction went forth to meete him: but when they heard the thunders, and the sound of the trumpet, and saw the lightnings, and the mountaine smoaking, they fled &amp; stood a farre off, &amp; sayd vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> Talke thou with vs, and we will heare thee, but let not God talke with us, lest we die.</p>
   <p>This their petition Almighty God mercifully granted, and knowing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were made, resolued no more to speake vnto them in soe terrible and fearefull manner, but rather to put heauenly treasures into earthen vessels,
<pb n="406" facs="215"/>
that is, to enlighten the vnderstandings, and to sanctifie the mouthes &amp; tongues of some amongst themselues, and by them to make knowen his will &amp; pleasure to the rest. In this sort after the giuing of the law he imployed the Priests &amp; Levites in a set and ordinary course, appoynting that the people should seeke the knowledge of the same at their mouthes; and in case of great confusion, and generall defects of these ordinary guides, raised vp Prophets, as well to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his judgements against offenders, and to reforme abuses; as also to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shew the future state of things, and more &amp; more to raise in men, a desire, hope, and expectation of the comming of the promised <hi>Messias,</hi> whom in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of time he sent into the world as the happiest Messenger of glad tidings, that euer came vnto the sonnes of men, and the Angell of the great couenant of peace, causing this proclamation to be made before him, This is my welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Sonne, in whom I am well pleased; heare him. In him were hid all the treasures of wisedome and knowledge, so that as it was sayd of him, Hee hath done all things well, so likewise, that Neuer man spake, as he spake. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he came not into this lower world, to make his abode here perpetually, but to cary vp with him into heaven, our desires first, and then our selues: after he had wrought all righteousnesse, and performed the worke for which hee came, he returned backe to God that sent him; Choosing out some of them that had been conuersant with him in the dayes of his flesh, that had heard the words of his diuine wisedom, &amp; were eye-witnesses of all the things he did &amp; suffered; &amp; sending them as his father sent him, who were therefore named Apostles. These had many excellent preeminences, proper to those beginnings, and fit for the founding of Christian Churches: as immediate calling, infallibility of judgement, generall commission, the vnderstanding and knowledge of all tongues, power to confirme their doctrine by signes and wonders, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the miraculous gifts of the spirit vpon other also, by the imposition of their hands. In which things, when they had finished their course, they left none to succeede them; yet out of their more large, ample, and immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, they authorized others to preach the Gospell, administer Sacraments, to binde and loose, and to performe other like pastorall duties, sanctifying and ordayning them to this worke, by the imposition of hands. These they honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the glorious title of Presbyters, that is, fatherly guides of Gods Church and people; and knowing the weight of the burden they layd on their shoulders, added vnto them as assistantes, other of an inferiour degree and rancke, whom they named Deacons or Ministers. Amongst these fatherly guides of Gods Church and people, for the preuenting of dissention, the avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of confusion, and the more orderly managing of the important affaires of Almighty God, they established a most excellent, diuine, and heavenly order, giuing vnto one amongst the Presbyters of each Church, an eminent &amp; fatherly power, so that the rest might doe nothing without him: whom for distinctions sake, and to expresse the honour of his degree and place, afore and aboue other, wee name a Bishoppe. And farther, by a most wise disposition provided, that amongst Bishoppes all should not challenge all things vnto themselues, but that there should be in seuerall provinces, seuerall Bishops, who should be first and chiefe amongst the brethren: and againe constituted and placed certaine other, in greater cities, who might take care of more then the former. The former of these were named Metropolitanes, the later were knowen by the name of Patriarchs, or chiefe Fathers, who also in order and honour were one before and after another, By meanes of this order established by the Apostles of Christ among the guides of Gods people, and receiued and allowed by the first and Primitiue Christians, vnity was preserued, the parts of the Church holden fast together, in a band of concordant agreement; questions determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, doubtes cleared, differences composed, and causes aduisedly &amp; deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard, with all indifferencie and equity. Fow how could there bee any
<pb n="407" facs="215"/>
breach in the Christian Churches, when none were ordained Presbyters in any Church, but by the Bishop, the rest of the Presbyters imposing their hands on them, together with him? None admitted to the degree and order of a Bishop, but by the Metropolitane, and other Bishops of the Prouince, sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing that they did, to the people ouer which they set him? None receiued as a Metropolitane, vnlesse being ordained by the Bishops of the Province, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon notice giuen of their orderly proceeding, &amp; the sincerity of his faith and profession, he were confirmed by the Patriarch? Nor none taken for a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, though ordained by many neighbour Bishops, till making knowne the soundnesse of his profession, and the lawfulnesse of his election and ordination, to the rest of the Patriarches, hee were allowed &amp; receiued by them as one of their ranke and order? Or what feare could there be of any wrong, injustice, or sinister proceedings in the hearing of causes, and determining of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, vnlesse there were in a sort a generall failing? When if there grew a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence betweene a Bishop and his Presbyters, or if either Presbyter, Deacon, or inferiour Cleargy-man, disliked the proceedings of his Bishop, there lay an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the Metropolitane, who had power to re-examine the matter in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node, and to see they were not wronged? And if either Clearke or Bishop had ought against the Metropolitane, it was lawfull for them to appeale to the Primate, or Patriarch, who in a greater and more honourable Synode, was to heare the matter, and to make a finall end? When if any variance rose between any of the Patriarchs and their Bishops, or amongst themselues, it was lawfull for the Patriarchs that were aboue and before them, in order and honour, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose themselues, and with their Synods to judge of such differences; and in such cases as could not so be ended, or that cÅcerned the faith, &amp; the state of the whole vniuersall Church, there remained the judgment and resolution of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell; wherein the Bishop of the first See was to sit as President, and Moderatour; and the other Bishops of the Christian world, as his fellow Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and in the same commission with him. This order continued in the Church from the Apostles times, and wrought excellent effects, till the Bishop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> first sought, and after him the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> obtained, to be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in order and honour before the rest, as anciently he had beene, but to haue an absolute and vniuersall commaunding power ouer all, that either by fraud, or violence, he could bring into subjection. Whence followed horrible confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the Christian Church, and almost the vtter ruine and desolation of the same. For after that this childe of pride, had in this <hi>Lucifer-like</hi> sort advanced himselfe aboue his brethren, hee thrust his sickle into other mens haruests, hee encroached vpon their bounds and limits; hee pretended a right to confer all dignities, whether electiue or presentatiue, to receiue appeales of all sorts of men, out of all parts of the world; nay, without appeale or complaint, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to take notice of all causes, in the Diocesses of all other Bishops: so ouerthrowing their jurisdiction, and seizing it in his owne hands. Hee exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Presbyters from the jurisdiction of their Bishops, Bishops of their Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans, and Metropolitanes of their Primates and Patriarches; and leauing vnto the rest nothing but a naked and empty title, tooke vpon him to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all doubts and questions of himselfe alone, as out of the infallibility of his judgment: to excommunicate, degrade, &amp; depose, &amp; againe, to absolue, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, and restore, &amp; to heare and judge of all causes, as out of the fulnesse of his power. Neither did he there stay, but hauing subjected vnto him, as much as in him lay, all the members of Christs body, and trampled vnderneath his feete, the honour &amp; dignity of all his brethren and collegues, hee went forward, and challenged a right to dispose of all the kingdomes of the world, as being Lord of Lords, and King of Kings. To this height he raised himselfe by innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sleights and cunning devices, taking the advantage of the ignorance, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, negligence, and base disposition which hee found to be in many of the
<pb n="408" facs="216"/>
guides of the Church in those dayes, and by their helpe and concurrence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing against the rest that were of another spirit. Neither did he demeane him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe any better after he had attained to this his desired greatnesse; for such was his pride, insolencie, and tyrannie, and such, soe many, and vnsupportable were the burthens he layd on the shoulders of them that were noe way able to beare them, that the voyces of complaint and murmuring were euery where heard, and the mindes of all men filled with discontentment, and desire of alteration, which after many longing desires of our ancestours, hath beene effected in our time. God, at the last, hearing the cryes of his people, and stirring vp the heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call spirits of his chosen seruants, to worke our deliuerance, to take the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens from our shoulders, the yoake from our necke, and to bring vs out of that <hi>Babylon,</hi> wherein we were captiues, and that spirituall <hi>Egypt,</hi> wherein we were formerly holden in miserable bondage. But as there were some of the children of the captiuity, that after long continuance abroad forgat <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <hi>Babylon</hi> before <hi>Sion,</hi> neuer desiring to returne into their owne country any more: And as many of the <hi>Israelites</hi> brought out of the house of <hi>Pharoahs</hi> bondage by God himselfe, and conducted by <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to take possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the land of promise, a land that flowed with milke and honey, in their hearts returned backe: so are there many that would neuer be induced to come out of the spirituall <hi>Babylon:</hi> and other that are easily perswaded to looke backe, and in their hearts to returne into <hi>Egypt</hi> againe. For the winning and gaining of the former, and the staying of the latter, I haue indeauoured by the true discription of them out of the Scripture, &amp; the authenticall recordsof an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, to make it appeare, how farre <hi>Canaan</hi> exceedeth <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Sion Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> how different the gouernement of Christ is from that of <hi>Antichrist:</hi> how happy the people are that liue vnder the one, and how miserable their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that are subiect to the other.</p>
   <p>Beseeching God for his mercies sake, to enlighten them that sit in darkenes, to bring backe them that are gone astray, to raise vp them that are fallen, to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them that stand, to confirme them that are doubtfull, to rebuke Sathan, to put an end to the manyfold vnhappy contentions of these times, to make vp the breaches of <hi>Sion,</hi> to build the walles of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and to loue it still.</p>
