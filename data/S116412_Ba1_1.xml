      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Eentlemen, if a straunger may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest a fauour, (which I am sure no honest well-willer to Learning will denie,) then let me intreate you in the behalfe of my friend, (the Author heereof) to affoorde him your kinde acceptance of this his first labour, which I am the more earnestly to craue at your courteous hands, because I animated him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same. For comming one day into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I found (amongst other things) this History of Parismus roughly penned by him, and carelesly cast by in loose papers, as minding that it should neuer haue come to the presse. But I gathering them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and reading them, found the inuention so pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the matter so delightfull, and the Stile (although plaine,) yet so pleasing, as (liking it,) requested him to suffer it to come abroad, assuring him, that it could not but be generally well liked of the better sort.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Andtherefore since he hath through my perswasions
<pb facs="119"/>
performed the same, doe not you (I pray you.) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him in his first attempts, but kindely accept his will meaning intention, which was to please al, and displease none. So shall you winne him, to finish what hee hath promised, that is, the second part: which I protest, I will hasten him to doe with as much speede as may bee. Fare yee well.</hi>
