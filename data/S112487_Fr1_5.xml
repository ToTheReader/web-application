C. yeres sithens, &amp; let vs se whether this playn word vagabon was vsed or no, I beleue not and why, because I rede of no such name in the old estatutes of this realme, vnles it be in the margente of the booke, or in the Table, which in the collection and pryntinge was set in, but these were then the cōmen names of these leud leuterares Fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores, Robardesmen, Drawlatches, &amp; valyant beggares, yf I should haue vsed suche wordes or the same drder of wryting as this realme vsed in kynge Henry the thyrd or

But accordinge to my playne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I haue setforth this worke symplye and truelye, with such vsual words and termes as is among vs wel known and frequented. So that as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> prouerbe saythe (all though truth be blamed it shal neuer be shamed) well good reader I meane not to be tedyous vnto the, but haue added fiue or sixe more tales because some of them weare donn whyle my booke was fyrste in the presse, and as I truste I haue deserued no rebuke for my good wyll, euen so I desyre no prayse for my payne cost and trauell. But faythfullye for the proffyt and benyfyt of my countrey, I haue don it, that the whole body of the Realme may se and vnderstand their leud lyfe and pernitious practisses that all maye spedelye helpe to amend that is amysse, Amen saye all with me.</p>
