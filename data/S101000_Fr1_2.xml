   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost Gracious and</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prince, the many great and kinde fauours which I receiued from the hands of your late Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceased, vnto whom I was tutor in the skill of weapons, to my no little credit, which makes me now turne backe to shew my loue in a small measure vnto your Princely selfe, and yet it is as much as I am able, a bunch of grapes is but a small present, and yet King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>did receiue them, and accept them, and the rather, because a poore man presented them, and therefore J trust your Highnesse will more esteeme the good-will of the giuer, then the value of the gift.</p>
   <p>Three things did chiefly encourage me to publish it vnder the glorious name of your gracious Highnesse: The first is, in regard of your Highnesse deepe desire to gaine experience in all Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the which is seene by jour Graces fauouring and furthering any man which is endued with any good quality, therein rightly resembling a branch of the same Stocke from whence your Excellency sprang, of whom in my next Epistle to the Reader I will speake more at large: But at this time for doubt of beeing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue, with the renewing of olde griefes, I stand in a maze, like vnto that childe,
<pb facs="3"/>who being asked whether he loued his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or his mother best, stood mute as dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bting how to answer for feare of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the one of them: euen so in this place will J. Now the second cause of this my Dedication vnto your Excellency is, in respect of my vehement loue wherto in duty I am bound vnto your Princely selfe: and thirdly, that it may passe vnder your Highnesse protection, the better to shroud it selfe from backe-biters and fault-finders, least amongst such it be taken vp like a friendlesse vagarant: Oh therefore let it find fauour, J humbly intreate your Highnesse, although it can little pleasure your Princely selfe, yet it may stead many others, and so doubting least J haue troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led your Highnesse ouer long. J will therefore heere drawe the Curtaines, and commit your Highnesse to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Almighty, who euer blesse,
<pb facs="4"/>preserue and keepe your Highnesse with long life, and prosperous health, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse to the worlds end.</p>
