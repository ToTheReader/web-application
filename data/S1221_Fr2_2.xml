   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>COnsidering with my selfe (gentle
reader) how common a disease the
Stone is, and how little helpe the
parties grieued haue by vsuall
meanes in this our time, and of long time
haue had: and also hearing it diuers times
obiected, that the most learned Physitiā
can neither preuent the Stone in those
who naturally are inclined thervnto, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cure it in those in whom it is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
I did indeauour my selfe with all
studie and diligence, to finde out some
speciall thing, which might farre excell
the remedies now daily vsed, for the cure
of that grieuous disease.</p>
   <p>Whereupon taking mine inuention
frō <hi>Etius,</hi> who vsed very much the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Goates blood for cure of the same:
also being further perswaded thereunto
by authoritie of diuers writing of the
nature of Goates blood: I did draw a
pure &amp; cleere liquor out of the blood of
the male Goate, which I haue thought
good to name the Quintessence for the
Stone.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="68" facs="38"/>
And hauing made experience thereof
now two yeares and better, with diuers, I
thought good to publish the same, to the
reliefe of many, which are grieued with
that infirmitie, and that in such sort, as it
shal appeare vnto the world▪ that I rather
seeke herein to benefit my Country, then
any priuate gaine to my selfe.</p>
   <p>For wheras no man troubled with that
disease, can haue the helpe of the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
without his great charge: I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
that meane, that any man so disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
may haue such ease with very small
charge, as I dare boldly auouch, can not
be had by any vsuall meanes.</p>
   <p>But<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> for the commendation hereof, I
leaue it rather to be commended by the
helpe &amp; ease of those, who feare &amp; feele
the passions of that most terrible disease,
then vse any long rethorical perswasiōs,
knowing that the good Wine needeth
no Garland; and that the fairest Garland
can be no long credit to sower Wine.</p>
   <p>And now that this my Quintessence
may take the better effect, I thinke it very
necessarie, to signifie vnto such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to the Stone, and to those that are
already troubled with the same. First, the
causes of the Stone, and whereof it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered.
<pb n="69" facs="38"/>
Secondly, the difference of
Stones ingendred in mans body. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the vsuall way both to preuent &amp; cure
the Stone. And fourthly, the way or
meane now late deuised, for preuenting
and curing of the same. Wherein being
somewhat instructed, they shall be the
better able to gouerne themselues in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding
and curing the disease, as not
needing the Physitians continuall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
but being Physitians to themselues.
Yet I would not haue any man think that
I minde to make any long or curious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the Stone, touching all the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
poynts of the same, as indeauouring
to make the readers perfect Physitians
herein; but onely to shew them a superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
knowledge, sufficient to direct them
in the taking of my Quintessence.</p>
   <p>And thus (gentle Reader) haue I deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that, whereof I minde to write, into
foure partes; wherein I will not indeuour
my selfe to speake whatsoeuer may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently
be spokē: but rather to speake
nothing that may conueniently be le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
