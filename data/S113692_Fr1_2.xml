      <hi>TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, THE LORD</hi> Arch-bishop of Canterburie his Grace, Primat and Metrapolitan of all England, one of his Maiesties most Honorable priuie Counsel, &amp; the right worthy Chaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>celour of the famous Vniuersitie of Oxford.</head>

      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost reverend, religious, &amp; right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honourable, so small a present for so great a <hi>Patrone</hi> is not tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by the rule of proportion, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie when so great weaknesse lyeth open to the eie of so great worthinesse. My apprehension at the first conceited mee so strongly that I designed this to aternal oblivion &amp; resolved that it shoulde haue dyed and beene buried in the place it first breathed, but fearing lest an action of presumption would bee commenced against mee, for burying so poore an <hi>Orphan</hi> in so princely a place as <hi>the Kings Chappel,</hi> I adventured to lay it in the graue of the presse, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it in these <hi>sheetes,</hi> as in a <hi>Syndon,</hi> &amp; mantling it on a <hi>sable</hi> letter, as in a <hi>hearse,</hi> and yet after foure aates pressing to death, it revived, and is crept to present it selfe vnto your Grace presuming that as you affoorded it gratious <hi>attention</hi> at the <hi>preaching,</hi> so you will affoord it gratious <hi>acception</hi> in the <hi>printing.</hi> If there bee anie thing worthy Patronadge in it, or in mee, I humbly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it, reioycing much I may tender any observāce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, whom his roiall Maiestie, the gracious Queene,
<pb facs="3"/>my Princely Master, the noblest Personadges, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test schollers, both the Vniversities, the Church, Commō wealth, arts and schooles, doe for his studies, conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, labours, &amp; imploymēts, acknowledge, reverence, and preferre to the Confluence of all honour. I must confesse it had manie verie honorable friends who desired after the preaching to bee acquainted with it, but I was then doubtful whether I should publish it or no, somtimes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving it, sometimes resolving for it, til now at length I haue adventured to let it see the sunne. It is the first tender of my dutie, and the first dedication frō our <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity Presse,</hi> since the time your Grace was pleased to entertaine the protection of vs. The Lord preserue your Grace to continue for manie and manie yeeres, that the Church may long enioie so worthie a <hi>Piller,</hi> the Common wealth so wise a <hi>Counseller,</hi> and this famous Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity so honourable a <hi>Chauncellour.</hi>
