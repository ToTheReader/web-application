                 <title>The ephemerides of Phialo : deuided into three bookes. The first, a method which he ought to follow that desireth to rebuke his freend, when he seeth him swarue: without kindling his choler, or hurting himselfe. The second, a canuazado to courtiers in foure pointes. The third, the defence of a curtezan ouerthrowen. And a short apologie of the Schoole of abuse, against poets, pipers, players, [et] their excusers. By Step. Gosson, stud. Oxon</title>

I coulde wishe it,
that I had that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in my penne,
whiche the Beare
hath in her tounge,
too licke out mye
whelps in some proportiō, whē I haue
cast them in a rude lump. But I see my
cunning serues me so il, that whilest I
desire to perfect my worke, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned
with <hi>Apelles</hi> too set it out,
where euery beholder may view it at
will, and tell me his minde when hee
sees a faulte. Many hands make light
worke. Coppie of Preceptes breede an
Arte. Where sundry woorkmen shewe
them selues, a rare deuice is broughte
to light. Reade and runne ouer, I giue
you leaue, I set it downe to none other
ende. Diuers are the studyes of men
in one Schoole, some followe Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie,
some the tongues some are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with meaner Lectures; infinite
wares in one fayre, where the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
approcheth to cheapen a Swoorde,
<pb facs="6"/>
the wanton inquireth for a glasse. And
I knowe that in Bookes, as in open
fieldes, euery man pursueth that game
that he lyketh best: a noble minde wil
chase the Hart, but fooles pick Dasies
if they may find them. Therfore if idle
Drones assayle me, let them know that
I shewe no sporte for them, my desire
is, to seeke out meate for manly sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes.
I haue seene what Cankers
shoote alofte, where amorous toyes
are dayly sowen. He that troubleth the
Springe where you shoulde drinke,
may be turnd to a Frog if <hi>Iuno</hi> frowne.
Such as flatter the Reader with vaine
delightes, beare the shape of a monster
in their heartes, and are to be fled as
dangerous shelues. Those stormes that
forbid vs to shoot into harbor, ar more
to bee feared then those that discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
vs too hoyst our sayle; and those
discourses are worst of all, that hinder
our passage when we trauell home, &amp;
seeke for the ende in which we shoulde
rest. As I write not this for mine owne
behoofe, to iustifie that which I do my
selfe, of too spurne at other that haue
<pb facs="6"/>
gone before mee; So I hope you will
take it for a lawfull excuse, that I write
not so loosely as some desire. I haue
bin requested by some of my friendes
to take longer time, and encrease my
volume, wherein I perceiue they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
not that the Countrieman
casteth his seede very thin, yet findeth
his barnes to be filled by them. That
the spirite of man, in the straightest
Trumpet hath greatest sound; blowne
through a barrel, makes no noyse. But
sith they had rather see their handes
full of Paper, then their heades full of
knowledge, I let them goe. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
too the curtesie of you that are
skilfull Gentlemen, I haue performed
my promise, and discharged my
handes, giuen <hi>Phialo</hi> his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte,
and sent him
to you.</p>
