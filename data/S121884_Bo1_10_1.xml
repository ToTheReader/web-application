   <p>HITHERTO are the letters which I
haue thought good to translate out of
French, &amp; to sett downe in this place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the euent of this triall and combat,
as also of the great and high honour, which
the most Christian King of <hi>France</hi> hath gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by being present &amp; furthering the same
in his royall person. Which act will be vnto
him (besides the benedictiō of almighty God
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>erby gayned as we hope) an euerlastinge
praise with all posterity. And yf yt might
please the same mighty hand of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
by his holy grace to inspire the heart
<pb n="40" facs="21"/>
of her<note n="*" place="margin">This petition may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be made now to his royall Maiestie as more intelligēt in such affayres, &amp; better enclyned to heare truth.</note>
      <hi>Maiestie</hi> of <hi>England</hi> by the example of
so famous a fact of her neighbour and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league,
and deare Cosyn the K. of France,
to take the same course in England, and to
heare and permitt the like triall betweene
such Catholiks, as would offer to prooue, &amp;
conuince the like falshoods &amp; falsifications;
(and greater also perhaps) in the chiefe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
wryters of our nation, as <hi>Iewell, Fox,
Fulke,</hi> &amp; the like: and that some of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and zealous of the other side, might be
intreated or commaunded toe defend the
same; or if they refuse this, then at least some
competent number of equall iudges, might
be assigned on both sides to heare the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
with the same lawes and conditions as
the matter passed in France, to witt, that no
point of controuersie or disputation be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to be disputed of, but only matter of
fact discussed: As for example, whether such
and such places and authorityes as are cyted
&amp; quoted in their wrytings, out of Fathers,
Doctors, Councells, and storyes, and are
auouched by Catholiks to be falsified, be so
or no? If this (I say) might be obtayned
(seeing larger triall &amp; disputation, so often
and earnestly by vs demaunded, cannot be
had) and that by the wisdome and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of her Maiestie &amp; her honourable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
this at last might be brought to passe;
yt would be an infinite comfort to all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
and true meaninge men of all sides,
<pb n="41" facs="21"/>
which desyre indeed to know the truth.</p>
   <p>And as for the triall it selfe, yt would be
more easy, breefe and pleasant vnto her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
and other assistants, whosoeuer they
should be; For that as the B. of <hi>Eureux</hi> well
noteth before, yt wilbe sufficient for this
triall, to bringe only eyes, and to open the
books, whence the authorityes are cyted.
And to the end that some tast before hand
may be taken of the matter, which would
breake forth in such a triall, concerning the
Protestants part; I haue thought good to
adde these few obseruations that do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
which are of a person that would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
offer himselfe in this seruice, or at least
to send, and represent some part of those
obseruations, which to this effect he hath
gathered.</p>
