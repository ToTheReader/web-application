   <head>THE AVTHOR to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, before thou take pains in perusing these my poore meditations, I thought good first to giue thee an account of my selfe and this Labour. Hauing in my yonger yeeres sucked some sweets of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from the Vniuersities of <hi>Strasburge, Heidleberge, Wittemberge,</hi> and <hi>Lipnick,</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> as also <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Geneua,</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sauoy;</hi> but chiefly from the famous
<pb facs="3"/> Vniuersitie of <hi>Oxford;</hi> in my manly yeeres, <hi>Mars</hi> distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted me from the Studies of <hi>Minerua:</hi> but when that Planet was set, I retired to a Countrey life: And now hauing in my old age (I thanke my God) receiued satiety of all worldly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, it hath pleased His Goodnesse, to incline my heart to more supernal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations; which I did commit to writing, for the benefit of my children (with whom God hath plentifully blessed mee) that thereby, when I am departed from them, they may finde a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of my labours for their practice and imitation. I beganne with <hi>Moses,</hi> and haue drawne paralels out of the Old Testament, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="3"/> the Lawes of <hi>Israel</hi> with our Ciuill and municipall; and the auncient formes of warre with the moderne; and the sinnes of former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, rebuked by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, with the enormities of our times, and GODS Iudgements on them both.</p>
   <p>Secondly, proceeding to the New Testament, I found the three former Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists easily drawne into a Harmony, by the context of the History: But this of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Iohn,</hi> as written the last in time, so it appeareth, as it were, the <hi>Metaphysicke</hi> of the Gospell. I therfore helped my selfe with the expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the auncient Fathers, and some of the late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; whose iudgements, when the place was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
<pb facs="4"/> I haue set downe in their own words. The work thus growne to a reasonable Volume, I imparted it to some Learned men, who with much importunity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged me to put it to the Presse; whereas I neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but that it should lye Leiger with my other Papers. The words are my ordinary style, which I gaue free passage vnto, auoyding all spirituall pride, and not seeking ostentation or fame. I humbly therefore craue pardon of the reuerend and learned Diuines, for aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing on so high a taske; my endeuour being, not to make meate for the children of the Prophets, but to draw milke from the bosome where my Lord leaned, for
<pb facs="4"/> the nourishing of such babes as my selfe; though I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both <hi>Moses</hi> Rod, and <hi>Samsons</hi> strength, to bring water from so hard a Rocke, and honey from so strong a Lyon. I wish peace both to the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and that it were in my power to aduance so happy a worke. And rather thā Gods cause should suffer (as old and vnable as I am) I would, with a cheerefull heart, once againe aduance my Arme with my vtmost strength, to helpe the Lord against the mighty, and to assist in fighting his battels. In the meane time, I craue a charitable acceptance of what I haue weakely perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in another kind; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I haue laboured to auoyd
<pb facs="5"/> both tediousnes and offence; for which cause, I haue set downe some words of the Text in the margent, for the Reader's direction, hoping hee will supply the rest with his owne paines. Wherein I haue falne short, or strayed, I desire to be reduced vnto the right way by more able iudgements. This Mite I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to Gods Treasury, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope or expectation of any Talent of reward, but when I haue done all I can, acknowledging my selfe an vprofitable Seruant.</p>
