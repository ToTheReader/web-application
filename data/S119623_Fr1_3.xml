   <head>The Author to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His smal Tract, Christian Reader, was at the first composed out of a religious zeale, and feruent desire I had to haue withdrawen some of my best friends from that Egyptian darkenesse of Popish superstition. And this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I the rather made choice of, because it was often obiected, (though very vntruely) that we durst not handle the Grounds of Religion. After I had finished the same, I recōmended it to my best friends as you may see by the Preface thereof: the which was by them reciprocally receiued, hauing no lesse loue and desire to reclaime me, than I had to winne them. To which purpose they sent it to some one of the learned on their part, by whose suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie the same might bee fully refuted; which, I assure my selfe by many probable coniectures was Doctor <hi>Norris.</hi> After I had staied some thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene weeks, with desiee and expectation to see the answere therof; &amp; hauing often solicited the same: about that time I receiued a Letter (as I take it, from the said D.N.) importing (among many seuerall reproches wherewith hee had laboured to
<pb facs="9"/> giue satisfaction to them, and to impeach the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit both of me and my booke) that if I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure two or three of the best learned of our side to auow it vnder their hands to be the doctrine of our Church; That then hee would take vpon him to proue <hi>14.</hi> or <hi>15.</hi> seueral absurdities, and vntruths therein, as by his Letter here likewise set downe <hi>verbatim,</hi> may truely appeare. This Letter I then answered, as it is here likewise inserted. And when I had stayed another quarter of a yeere, and heard of no answere made, or intēded to be made, I procured with much importunitie, the redeliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the booke. After which, because I would leaue the said D.N. (as I take it) without all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, and also let my friends see, I would presse it to the vtmost, I procured two reuerend and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ministers, M.D. <hi>Sutcliffe,</hi> and M. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wootton,</hi> to subscribe the same booke vnder both their hands, in this forme following; <hi>viz, The summe and substance of the doctrine contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this booke is sound, and shal be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by the grace of God, against the whole packe of Iesuits and Masse-priests of the Romish Synagogue.</hi> After this, vpon the late discouery of those hellish and matchlesse trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against our dread Soueraigne, and the whole body of the Realm; hauing heard, that the said D. N. was apprehended and committed to <hi>Bridewel</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/> (where I likewise vnderstood that he was not close prisoner) I repaired vnto him, and shewed him this my booke, with the subscriptiō annexed and before specified, demāding of him whether he had seen the booke, and were the author of that Letter. Which hee denied, affirming that he had neuer seen it till thē: reseruing belike (according to their maner of Equivocating) that he had neuer seen it till then, subscribed in that maner, or with some such men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall reseruation. All which considered (though I am stil perswaded, that he was the Author ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) I haue preferred the publishing of it (though therein mine own wants &amp; defects for the maner of handling, might by the iudicious &amp; learned be in some sort taxed) rather than to bury it in silēce: for that I hope it may bring some benefit (not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy my trauel) to the indifferent Reader, and may happily effect that which thereby I first inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; when they shall see I am not afraid (in regard of the doctrine therin) to diuulge it to the whole world. And the rather I am incouraged hereto; for that the same is not onely the doctrine of the best learned writers of this our age &amp; Nation (as it is by me collected) but also is warrāted to be iustified by men of so great sufficiencie, that I shall not need to feare shipwracke though the seas swell, and the storme rise neuer so hie. And so farewel in Christ.</p>
