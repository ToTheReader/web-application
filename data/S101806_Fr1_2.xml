   <head>To his fellow-labourers in the Lord, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Abraham Colfe</hi> Pastor of <hi>Lewsham</hi> beside <hi>Greene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch,</hi> and M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Isaac Colfe</hi> Pastor of Hearne beside <hi>Canterburie,</hi> and to their sixe Brethren with their louing Sister M<seg rend="sup">is</seg>. <hi>Mann</hi> of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, all happinesse in Christ.</head>
   <p>HEaring by iust and certaine report, not of a few, what work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and effect my meane labours at the Funerall of your FATHER (that graue and godly Minister of Christ) had, through Gods blessing, in the hearts of sundry, and very many
<pb facs="3"/>
hearers, that houre in great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies assembled: and being once and againe, by writing and word, earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly solicited to copie out that SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON which I vttered by helpe of memory, without any benefite of Notes, through straightnes of time, and store of businesse: I condiscend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against all thought and purpose on my part (when I first conceiued, and was deliuered of this lesse then nine houres birth) not onely to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie it out and put it in paper, for the priuate vse of some; but to commit it to the Presse, for the more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good of many, which were not present auditors: Euery good thing being so much the better the more common it is; and writing being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned of GOD to be a meane of the teaching of his Church, as well as liuely voyce.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>Now, after I entred this resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vpon these grounds, to whom could I more fitly dedicate it then to your selues, his nine CHILDREN, whom towards his last breath hee did as earnestly couet to make you heyres of his graces, as of his goods? Pictures serue to put vs in minde of our friends departed; so let this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and testimony giuen him at the preaching of it, be to you a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of your good Father, who left behinde him much more good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to imitate, then goods to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy: yet of earthly substance so much as may witnesse how greatly God had blessed him with worldly and spirituall blessings, with the dew of heauen, as well as with grace from heauen.</p>
   <p>Walke carefully in his steps: thinke it to be your greatest shame to degenerate, and your chiefest
<pb facs="4"/>
commendation to resemble him. As hee before his death prouided for foure of you Flockes to feede, fields to sowe, houses to build; so like good shepheards attend the flockes whereof the holy Ghost hath made you ouerseers, and which Christ hath purchased with his own bloud. Let not such a rich prize perish through your negligence and sloath, but as scribes, taught to the kingdome of God, store vp old and new things in aboundance, which you may draw out to refresh the tender Lambes and deare sheepe of Christ: Withall, like good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen prouide pure and good seede, which you may scatter in the morning and in the euening, in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and out of season; for yee know not which will prosper. Finally, as skilfull builders, lay no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation then that which is layd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
<pb facs="4"/>
euen Christ Iesus, the head corner stone, vpon which see you doe build Gold, Siluer, and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stones, that is, pure Doctrine, which will abide the examination of the spirit; that when the LROD of the house commeth you may heare the blessed voyce, <hi>Enter into your Maisters ioy yee faithfull seruants.</hi> Farewell.</p>
