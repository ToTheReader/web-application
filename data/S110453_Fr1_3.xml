      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ALLINGE TO MINDE
(Good Reader) the estate of
this oure myserable tyme,
knowing that CHRISTE
in his Gospell hath geuen vs
knowledge therof, forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
vs therfore to th'intent
that our mindes should not
be troubled or caried aboute, as the weather Cocke is
commonly with euery puffe and smal blast of Winde.
Let this therefore aduertise thee, that thou looke not
backe from that Canonicall and heauenly doctrine,
Which our maister Christe hath taught, and confirmed
as his blessed will and Testament, with the price of
his precious death and bloudshedding on the Crosse:
with which he hath sealed the same, and left it vnto vs
and our posterities, that we and they vvhich shal come
after vs might teache it vnto our Children, as a law
giuen by him to be obserued for euer: Then sith he
hath so mercyfully and louingly delt with vs, shall we
rewarde his good will, with ingratitude? or shall we
in recompence of so greate benefites yelde or quit him
with disdaine? No, rather like obedient and louynge
children, let vs indeuer to obey his commaundements,
and to show our selues followes of his worde, not
only in talke but in deede: for deedes to confirme our
profession are required, not that by them vve may me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb facs="5"/>
ought at all: for faith and not workes are our iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacion,
yet I condemne not workes, for they are the
fruites of faith and testefie the same: sundry causes haue
mooued me, though vnworthy to take this labour in
hande: the one, the mutteringe of Papistes, whiche
mutter there and here, as oportunitie seruith their
turnes, strange lies and newes far distant from truth.
Another cause is, that the mindes of many men are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
and brought out of frame by the vngodly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes
of suche▪ as not only rebell against God and his
worde, but also agaynst the estate of this Realme, our
Queene and dignitie of her Crowne: and so through
the meanes and actions of a few vnnaturall braunches,
stande halfe in doubt whether they may turne to the
right hande or the left: this therefore may be to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the one, to discourage and vtterly deface th'other:
Whiche not only purpose the ruine aud spoyle of their
naturall Nourse and countrie, but also as their vniust
dealynges, their craftie attempts, and subtill pretences
plainly showe and demonstrate the domage and decay
of our moste gratious and excellent Princesse, whose
high renowne of maiestie euery true and faithful sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
as far as life and goods wil stretch▪ ought to defēd,
support and maintaine, as hir Maiesties person is the
lawfull heire of the famous Prince Kinge Henrie the
eight (who was) a suppresser and ouerthrower of all
superstition and Idolatrie, so our Delbora doth not
only studie to vanquish and confounde the same: but
followeth the trace of hir most excellent Father, a wise
and prudent Salomon, as did that yonge and godly
Ezechias the sixt EDVVARDE hir maiesties valiant
<pb facs="5"/>
brother, who▪ as she planted the Lords Vineyarde,
and repayred the walles of Sion againe, Till such time
as our God seing our ingratefulnesse deliuered vs into
the hands of the Bulles of Basan, who no only defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the buildinge substancially framed and begon: but
more then this, gaue the greedy Boare of Rome free
libertie to enter therunto: whose spoiling Tuskes did
spoile aud roote vp such good and godly Braunches,
as therin did beautifie and cause the same increase: and
after in their steads planted Dernell weedes and stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Brambles, which fruict was vnsauery and vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt
before GOD, who for the greeuous grones, the
Teares, and plaintes, most bitterly throwne forth of his
litle flocke and Churche, restored vs againe from the
yoke of Cruell and bloudy Pharo, and in place of CY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SERA
or DIOCLESIAN, who alwayes were bente,
to worke the destruction of his people and Churche▪
shortned their rage, abated their pride, and gaue vs a
wise and wittie HESTER, a godly IVDITH, a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
DEBORA, or rather a chaste SVSANNA, to rule,
to gouerne, and raygne ouer vs, whose clemencie we
can witnesse, whose loue, wee coulde neuer want, but
euer hath abounded towarde hir subiectes: and as for
the loue she hath to GOD wee are able sufficiently to
witnesse: hir mercie, the verie obstinate and blinde
bluddringe BALAMITS can sufficientlie recorde;
Why then doo wee so disdainefully recompence hir,
whom we are bounde by GOD and nature to loue and
obey? as it becometh good and godly subiects to do.
Therefore to put those in minde that be negligent, of
their duties, whiche though they know, yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
<pb facs="6"/>
to execute, and to confirme those that are waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng:
as to condemne the whisperinges of Papistes and
other, as a man may say, <hi>Iackes of both sides,</hi>
I haue framed this worke, called <hi>A freindly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
or faithfull warning to the true har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Subiects of Englande:</hi> Wherin is discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and plainelie set forth vnto all faithfull people, as
well the obstinate and malicious mindes of the Papist
and Rebels here in England: as also the cruel murthers
aud shamelesse persecution latelie done in other places
by the consent of their patron the monstrous Pope, the
onely cause of this whurly burlie, and disquietnesse of
all Christendome: the verie Antechrist or Babilonicall
strompet▪ that S. Iohn speaketh of in his Reuelation,
whose Sorcerie and craftie iuglinges haue bewitched
and disceaued the Princes of the Worlde, and blinded
their externall eyes from beholdinge the light of Gods
profounde and endelesse wisedome: Whiche when
thou hast Read, then I pray thee iudge according to my
plaine and simple meaning▪ and not vnto knowledge:
for if thou looke for any Eloquence or fine Phrases of
Rethorike, thou art deceaued: and thus lothe to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or molest thy minde with tediousnesse, or to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
thy minde with reading, so grose and rude Letters,
deuoyde of skill or conninge, I commit the to GOD,
vvho defende aud saue thee for euer.</p>
