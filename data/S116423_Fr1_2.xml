For as much I say, as it hath pleased the Lord you shoulde beget me after this sort, I thought good to present vnto your learned view some part of the fruites of your owne labour in me begotten, not to the intent in any respect to benefite your selfe therewith (sauing that you wyll reioyce to see, that your labour on me bestowed is not altogeather lost) but onely to the intent to incourage others to the studie of the most absolute &amp; perfect word of God: because that Satan our old enimie striueth styl most lyke a subtle Serpent, especially to perswade men to the contrarie: Therefore so much as in me lyeth, I labour to ouerthrow him therein, and to styrre vp others in lyke sort, to take vp the weapon of their warfare the worde of God

VVherefore, seeing the Lorde hath made you a <hi>Paule</hi> (from the Apostle <hi>Paule,</hi> and other his felowes) to plant in me these thinges, and that it hath pleased his heauenly maiestie to geue the increase, I thought it meete to dedicate these some part of the fruites vnto you a speciall meanes thereof: humbly beseeching you to shielde them vnder your most graue &amp; learned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, that so the benefite thereof may redownde to them, for whose sakes I brought them foorth. The summe whereof is, to shew the brightnes of our sauiour Christ in all ages: according as it is sayd by the Apostle, Christ yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and to day, and the same for euer: As also to what ende the Lord hath created man: which is, to set soorth his praise and glory aboue all the creatures that he hath made: and lykewyse, how that can not be done but by the knowledge and direction of his owne most perfect worde: and howe that all nations and people that haue delighted or not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted herein, haue founde accordingly the louing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or the seueritie of the Lord. And thus I cease, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord to blesse you with a long and happie lyfe euen to the begettyng of thousandes more, vnto the kingdome of the euer-lyuing God: that so your selfe may shine as a most glorious starre in the life to come.</p>
