      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vch countries and people, (good Christian Reader) which almost from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, or at the least, so long as anye humane creature hath had habitation on the earth, haue of late yeres, by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> industrie of diligent sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ben explored: it hath likewise plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they should be found out by those people, which for the temperature of their habitatiō, are most apt to atchiue the same. As for example, the Spaniards, the West Indies. Spaine is situated much more neere y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Tropike of Cancer, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christian countries be: wherby, the Spaniards are better able to tolerate Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus burning beames, then others whiche are more Septentrional thē they. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I suppose them the most apte men for the inioying of the habitation of the West Indies: and especially so much, as is vexed with continual heate, or that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their temperature, God hath


<pb facs="4"/>
ben pleased that they, as the most apt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, should both explore &amp; inioy y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same. Semblably, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Portugals, whose tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is correspondent to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Spaniards, God is also contented, that they haue explored Africa, euen through the burning Zone, both the West and South coast, with al y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> coast of Asia, vnto the Oriental cape ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the Islands adiacent to them bothe wherefore, both for their habitation, and temperature, I account them y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> most apt people to atchiue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same, and to reape the benefite, where about they haue taken no small paines and labor. In like maner, the French men, where y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Spaniards thought y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> place not apt for their temperature, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered Noua Francia, and other places in America: wherfore, I iudge them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the commoditie thereof, as people most apt to inioy and possesse the same. Lastly, it hath plesed God, at this present, by the great diligence &amp; care of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Countrieman, Master Martine Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bisher, in the 18. and 19. yeare of oure Queenes Maiesties reigne, to discouer,


<pb facs="4"/>
for the vtilitie of his Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, other regions more Septentrional, then those before rehearsed: which, from the beginning, as vnknowne till nowe, haue bene concealed and hidden. Which discouerie, I iudge most apt for vs English men, and more agreeing to our tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then others aboue rehearsed. I leaue the famous discouerie of Moscouie, and other countries on those partes, (whiche of late yeares haue bene explored by the industrie of other our worthie countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) to the diligent Reader: whereby he may consider, that this our countrie, hath fostered vp men of no lesse value and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, then those, which are intituled, The second, thirde, and fourth Neptune. And doubtlesse, hee, by whose endeuour this last discouerie of the world is explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, may bee celebrated as well with the title of Aeolus, as also of Neptune. By whose singular knowledge and cunning, God hath preserued vs in this voyage, from bothe their cruell daungers.</p>
   <p>Thus (Christiā Reader) thou maist per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,


<pb facs="5"/>
that the worlde, of late yeares, hath beene discouered by sundrie regions of this our Europe: which God hath so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided in the exploring of the same, that it seemeth apt and agreeable to the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerer, more then to any other, to inioy all such commodities as they yealde and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorde. Consider also, that Christians haue discouered these countries and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which so long haue lyen vnknowne, and they not vs: which plainely may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that it is Gods good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that they should be instructed in his diuine seruice and religion, whiche from the beginning, haue beene nouzeled and nourished in Atheisme, grosse ignorance, and barbarous behauiour. Wherefore, this is my iudgement, (in conclusion) that who so euer can winne them from their infidelitie, to the perfect knowledge of his diuine institutions and seruice, hee or they are worthie to receiue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test rewarde at Gods hands, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter benefites from those countries, which he hath discouered. Fare well.</p>
