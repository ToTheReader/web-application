      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>VR life, saith the Apostle, is a warfare, &amp; euery day we are more or lesse to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coūter with our aduersary. And therfore is the Church of God vpō earth called Militant, because the mēbers therof are prest soldgiers, stā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding continually vpon their garde, knowinge, that their enemy is an olde wily Serpent, and a fierce rauenous Lion, cōtinually seeking whom he may deuoure. But amongst many snares he hath laide to intrappe the soule of man, eyther presuming too much of himselfe, or deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too much from the graces of the spiritt in him, this is not the meanest, that he laboureth, to deuide the kingdome against it selfe, and to vse men as his instrumentes for their owne destruction. For well he knowes, that where cumming in his owne likenes, he should seeme odious and be valiently resisted; there, masked vnder a vayle of humilitie, he may more secretly incroch vpō the fearful spirit; &amp; if the Lord doth not put the bitt into his mouth, to curbe him with, he may at length display his banners in the heart. But we haue a valiant leader, let vs sticke vnto him, euen Iesus Christ the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who is a Serpent also lift vp in the wildernes to cure all whose hearts are scorched with the venemous heat of the firie serpent; who is a Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi>

<pb facs="4"/>
this present booke is so copious, as I doubt (gentle Reader) whether thou shalt finde any want; much lesse of that which I am able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde thee. Onely it had beene to be wished the Author of these Treatises, had himselfe sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued to the publishing of them, that the same might haue come more full &amp; perfect into thy handes. But since it hath pleased the Lord, for cause best knowne vnto himselfe, to bereaue his Church in this land, of so excellēt a piller, there remaneth nothing for vs, but to submit ourselues vnto his prouidence, &amp; to take vp that cōplaint of <hi>Elisha</hi> for <hi>Elias,</hi> when he was takē frō him into heauen. <hi>My Father, my Father, the Charet of Isra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ell &amp; the horsemen therof.</hi> But to returne vnto our selues, thou art to be intreated, courteous reader, to take in good part these few things at this time, &amp; to make thine vse of them, till some other (the only true coppies wherof are yet in the hands of his friends) may be obtained of them. Amongst which there are many things of diuers argumēts worthy thy knowledge, &amp; of good profit vnto the direction of a Christian life; Of which I haue thought good to set down vnto thee a briefe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolog, that thou maist know: that as our Authors labours in the ministery of the gospell, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great in that part of the Church which was cōmitted vnto him, so as he might, he was not vnmindfull of posterity, but carefull to leaue a remembrance of himselfe in some profitable instructions for those that should come after.
