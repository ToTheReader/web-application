   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas in a Sermon preached at Paules Crosse about two yeares past, I had tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched (on occasion) some part of this <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Discourse,</hi> then lately set foorth; and for the peoples satisfaction, I had aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red some principall argumentes of the same, in defence of her Maiesties supreme gouernment in Eccl. causes, and for our Bishops iurisdiction; as appeareth by the Sermon it selfe, which for the further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting the occasion hereof, I haue set forth also, and recommend (deare Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader) to thy fauourable interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: which Sermon (according to the diuerse affections of the auditorie) tooke diuerse effectes; some beginning to relent and be resolued, which before had beene greatly carried away, in the contrary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of these matters, and promising reconcilement vnto their Bishops, whose state be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had misliked; some (on the otherside) tooke such offence at that part of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which touched these thinges, that they ceased not to deface it, and to chalenge mee for it: I then promised, not only the anowing of that I had spoken; but also (God assisting me) the publishing both of the whole sermon, and the aunswering atlarge of all the <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Discourse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For discharge of which promise, and because this booke pretendeth such a plausible title, and withall is reckoned of so great account; as I afterwarde could get oportunitie and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure thereunto, proceeding by little and little in the same; and (by the way) taking withall some parts of the like argument, that other our Brethren haue since composed; and partly passing vp from them, to the very fountaines, (as I take it) from whence all our Brethren fetch their chiefest motiues, or the groundes of them, especially in these three reuerend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and learned Fathers, Caluine, Beza, &amp; Danaeus: I haue now (thankes be to God) at length, after many delaies and stoppes thereof, thus farre forth accomplished &amp; set out the same.</p>
   <p>It is no small griefe to me (I protest) that on this occasion, I was thus drawen into these questions, with those, whom otherwise in Christe, I humbly acknowledge to be our deare Brethren. And much gladlier (the Lord knowes) would I be, to haue wholly obiected my selfe (as before to my mediocritie I haue endeuoured) against the publike aduersaries of Gods truth. And would God, all we which are of the houshold of faith, professing the light and libertie of the Gospell, would againe bende our forces that wayes, against the errours and tyrannie of Antichrist. In which course a while, we <hi>did runne well</hi> (but as the Apostle sayth to the Galathians) <hi>who hath let vs?</hi>

         </gap>.</note> For so long as we ioyntly followed the quest of that vncouth beast, and of the purple Harlot on his backe; God mightely prospered vs in all our affayres. Yea it is wonderfull to consider, if we haue grace to acknowledge it, how God hath still hetherto, (aboue any Nation in the worlde, in this last age thereof) and yet doth not cease to blesse vs, his name of vs againe ineessantly, be blessed and magnified for it.</p>
   <p>Howbeit, the shadowe is not more concomitant to the bodie, than enuie is aemulous of vertue and glory. As there is no state so happy on all partes in this life, but it shall euer be crossed with some or other daunger, or disturbance: so doth the enuious man (in these our Alcions dayes) labour nothing more, than to impugne and to ouerthrowe this our bless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d state, yea, to haue bereft vs of the Lordes annoynted, his holy handmayden, our most
<pb facs="3"/>
gratious Soueraigne, by whom (vnder our Lord Iesus Christ) God hath vouchsafed vs all these blessinges. In which practise, although the aduersaries attempts haue beene so peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and vnnaturall, that the very remembrance of them breedeth horrour: yet the Lords continuall deliuerance from them, hath bin so admirable, and almost miraculous; that we can not but all reioyce together, &amp; breake forth into the prayses of our so gratious father, our most mightie, righteous &amp; m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rcifull God, and cast all our repose vpon his prouidence.</p>
   <p>But as the holy Apostle S. Peter prudently forwarneth vs, <hi>be sober and watch, for your aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie the diuell as a roaring Lyon walketh about seeking whom he may deuour:</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8.9.</note> so, see the malice and craft of this old serpent. That thing which he could neuer atcheiue by himselfe, withall the subtleties of his smooth temptations; nor by his grand deputie, the man of sin &amp; sonne of perdition, withall his stratagems &amp; violent forces: Sathā eftsoones hath now not only crept in among the childrē of God; but hath so broken a sunder the bondes of Gods peace; hath sowen the cockle of such contentions, &amp; diuisions among vs that are brethren; wherby such discord hath also risen, euen among those that sowed before the good seed wheat; that no small hindrance hath growen therby to the course of the Gospell, &amp; as great hazard to the state of all our Church &amp; Realme; as could haue bin inflicted by the open hostilitie of the publike enemie. Yea, what could lay vs more open to his iniuries, thā to fall out thus amōg our selues into these garboyles? Or how freely can we nowe oppose our faces to confront our aduersaries; when euermore we must haue a skew eye, to the awke blowes of our own fellowes &amp; Brethr. hard at our elbowes? Which double fight is so daungerous &amp; so distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; that it maketh many amongst vs to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uolt or at least to hoouer: and is such an incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragemēt &amp; aduantage to the enemies, to be more cōfirmed in their errors, &amp; strengthned in their confederacies: that they insult vpon vs both; yea they blaspheme the very gospel it selfe which we professe; and all by occasion of these intempestiue, but too tempestious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrements.</p>
   <p>When Abraham saw the falling out between his and <hi>Lots</hi> heardmen; fearing the euill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of such discorde, he sayth vnto <hi>Lot</hi> let there be (I pray thee) no strife betweene thee &amp; me, neither yet betwixt thy heardmen and mine: and he addeth this reason, <hi>For we are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> Which reason did so mooue the prudent <hi>Ioseph,</hi> that after he had reuealed himselfe vnto his Brethren, returning thē to fetch his father; fearing least any expostulations might breede iarres among thē, he gaue them this especial charge; <hi>See that ye fall not out by the way.</hi> Thus did these auncient &amp; holy Patriarkes esteeme of cōcord among brethren, &amp; shunned (as a thing most vnnatural) all Brethrens discord. Which the godly &amp; propheticall kinges, <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; <hi>Salomon</hi> well considering;<note place="margin">

The sonne (in detestation of the vice contrary) when he had set down the 6. things that the L. hateth; <hi>Hautie eies, a lying tong; handes that shed innocent bloud; an heart imagining wicked enterprises; feete that are swift in running to mischiefe; and a false witnesse that speaketh lies:</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Prou.</hi> 6.16.</note> he concludeth (as with a greater vice than all these) in the seuenth and complete number, with this sinne, which he sayth, <hi>the soule of God abhorreth; And him that rayseth vp contentions among his Brethren.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And therefore when our sauiour Christ had fore-told his Disciples, all the persecutions that they should sustaine by their outward enemies: against all these, that they might haue brotherly loue among them selues; <hi>Peace</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>I leaue with you, my peace I giue vnto you.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ioh.</hi> 54.27.</note> And againe; <hi>These thinges haue I spoken vnto you▪ that my ioy</hi> (which is the frute of peace) <hi>might remayne with you,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.11.12.</note>
      <hi>and that my ioy might be full. This is my commaundement, that ye loue one another.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.33.</note> And so, he knits vp his exhortation with this repetition; <hi>These things haue I spoken to you, that ye might haue peace in me.</hi> Which bond of <hi>peace and loue in Iesus Christ</hi> one towardes another, both the <hi>Apostle S. Paule, the Doctor of the Gentiles,</hi> and especially <hi>S. Iohn whom the Lord loued, and S. Peter that so loued the Lord,</hi> and <hi>S.

      </gap>le (if these contentions should hold on &amp; increase) though our Brethren and we be moued hereat, beholding this our most flourishing kingdome, with these diuisions to be thus rent in sunder, that almost no Citie or Towne in the same (I can not say, no <hi>house</hi>) but is either <hi>diuided,</hi> or at least disquieted by these factions.</p>
   <p>Neuerthelesse, this among other is our chiefest comfort against all these and other like tentations; that hauing both of vs (for the ground of our religion) Gods euerlasting &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible truth; for the which our common aduersaries do maligne and oppugne vs, but can neuer expugne and ouercome vs; for alwayes (as Zorobabell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ayde) <hi>The truth is greater and stronger than all</hi>: Howsoeuer therefore we be exercised with such plunges,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Esd.</hi> 3.35.</note> I meane not of the open enemies (for the troubles that we receaue from them, doe more corroborate vs in Gods truth) but arising by the waywardnesse of our owne deare Brethren in the gospell: that yet we should not be too much dismayed, but stayed &amp; recomforted. Sith that, albeit these last dayes (according to Christes and his Apostles prophecie) are more contentious: yet in serching the former ages, we shall finde that this selfe same tryall of our faith, is not now first laide vpon vs alone; but that heretofore the Church of God, and the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Princes, Prelates, and people among them, haue often times bought this experience very derely, and with great molestations euen from their brethren.</p>
   <p>No sooner had God deliuered his peculiar people, from the Aegyptians bondage and idolatrie, by the conduct of Moses and Aaron, and giuen them lawes and orders to be gouerned by; but those their guides were more molested, and the people more wasted them selues by their owne mutinies, than by the hande of any forraine enemies. And since the comming of our sauiour Christ, so soone as euer <hi>Constantine</hi> (worthily surnamed) <hi>the Great,</hi> had extinguished all the tyrantes persecutions, and procured publike peace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gospell: what a number of contentions straightwayes brake forth (besides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictes with the pestiferous Heretikes) among the true professors of the right faith, euen for matters of discipline and orders, disquieting the vnitie and concord of the Church, and breeding no small griefe, and stoppall to that good Princes proceedinges, as we feele and lament the like in these our dayes.</p>
   <p>There is great difference (I graunt) both in matter and manner of these contentions, and in the qualities of the persons that breed these vexations; euen as much as is, between him that would plucke my coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e from off my backe, and so spoyle me; and him that would pull my skinne ouer mine eares, and so destroy me. The controuersies between the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon aduersaries and vs, are <hi>pro Aris &amp; focis</hi>; for matters, &amp; that capitall matters, of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance &amp; life of our Christian religion; not trifles, as some newtrals would beare the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in hande. And therefore our aduersaries in matters of religion, are incensed against vs with mortall, or rather, with immortall hatred. Whereas the controuersies betwixt vs and our Brethren, are matters, or rather (as they call them) but manners, and formes of the Churches regiment: Howbeit, whether by sufferance, or by neglect of them, growen yet vnto so many heads, and so sharply prosecuted: not now contending so much for cappe &amp; surplesse; nor for quarels at the vnlearneder sort of the poore ministers; nor inuectiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Bishops &amp; their titles, or their superiour iurisdictions only: but withall, calling in question all their whole authoritie, &amp; their very ministery of the worde and Sacramentes; and all our forme of publike prayers; yea, the prescription of any forme at all; the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Clergie; the translation, and new limitation, of euerie Diocese, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular parish in the Realme; the erection of a new Tetrarchie, in eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ry seuerall congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Doctors, Pastors, Gouernours, and Deacons; by which fower estates &amp; offices, all
<pb facs="4"/>
matters should be directed, and all crimes eccl. or ciuill censured by their discipline. Yea, they mount vp to the highest toppe, euen of the Princes supreme gouernment. Since that therefore, these contentions haue aspired thus farre, to the imminent daunger of all our whole estate; though in an other sort than do our aduersaries in religion: it is more than high time, against these (though otherwise in Christe our well meaning, but misweening Brethren) to enter into the necessarie defence, of these, be they matters, or manners of such moment.</p>
   <p>I am not ignorant that vnto many, this labour wil be thought superfluous, either of those that would haue these matters go forwarde without misliking; or of some also that allowe them not. Howbeit, because they haue eyther before beene sufficiently trauersed in, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alreadie, both <hi>pro &amp; contra:</hi> or that now these controuersies (if they be not dead and buried long ago) yet the feruour of them is meetly well slaked; therefore according to Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras wise counsell, <hi>ignem opertum noli fodere,</hi> it were much better to let it alone, than to rake abroade the fire, that is couered in the cinders: these men thinke this to be the best aunswere, not at all to aunswere them, but to passe thē oue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> in silence and contemne them. Whereby, eyther the parties contending (hauing wearied themselues in vaine) will the sooner giue ouer; or at least, other will thinke the matters not worthy, to be vouchsafed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aunswere. And that to aunswere, yea to confute them, is but to prouoke further contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies, of which wee are pestred with too many, and those not a little raysed, or enkinled, by often and intemperate disputing, aunswering, and replying one to an other.</p>
   <p>And in very deede, with them that thinke thus, in some matters and manners of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, I my selfe am of their opinion. For this licentiousnesse of writing such reciprocall inuictiues, hath bred and breedeth much vnnecessarie trouble. Notwithstanding, as the Preacher (among all other thinges, that keepe the reuolution of their seasons) reckoneth vp this; <hi>there is a time to keepe silence, and a time to speake</hi>; when a matter groweth to importance, and is vrged too importunately, admitting it be a wrong and daungerous errour, and yet on all sides it winneth fauour; to let it so passe without all controlement; what were silence then, but grosse negligence, the very yeelding to the errour and danger, yea the wilfull betraying of the truth, and consenting to the ouerture of our state?</p>
   <p>And euen so fareth it in this matter. The Papists, from whose grosse errors in doctrine we both dissent, and against whome, in the vnitie and substance of Gods truth we both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree (and for a while conioyntly we impugned their errors, idolatrie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, and superstitions) at the first in defence of them, they began to write freshly and stoutly against vs, but when they saw, they were not able that way, to mainteine the badnesse of their cause, they left off writing, and followed (for the most part) this policie, to seeme to despise all further triall, by disputing and writing of the matter, and would seeke to vphold it onely or chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by countenance and authoritie: but finding againe the experience of this, that <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas non potest cogi,</hi> the will of man must be perswaded, can not be compelled: and that <hi>nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum violentum est perpetuum,</hi> the thing that is only with violence coacted, can not possibly continue: and that in these controuersies, all men are most desirous to be satisfyed with some aunswere or other: they fall againe to writing, though hardly driuen thereto, vsing all the shifts they can, to bodge vp the insufficiencie of their cause. But in a good matter there neede no such practises.</p>
   <p>True it is (as I sayd before) that the poynts to be discussed betwixt our Brethren and vs, be nothing of such waight as those are, wherein our Brethren and we do varie from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, in the mayne and principall standerds of our faith, but are questions most what of discipline, and of the Churches gouernment. Neuerthelesse, since that heerein also, our Brethren haue not only made a breach from vs, but they haue bred such further contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them, as in which, a pacification is fo requisite, that without it, we see what broiles and daungers dayly growe, to the disturbing of our owne estate, to the aduantage of the publike aduersarie, to the hinderance and obloquie of the Gospell. It is necessarie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that (as God be praysed) we haue the truth in doctrine, and defend it well, not only by the authoritie of the Magistrate, but by the words owne authoritie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

hauing (as we trust) a good established forme, of the regiment &amp; discipline of our Church of England; if any eyther of our professed aduersaries, or of our malecontented Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, shall withstand or write against it: we are all obliged (after the measure of each ones calling and habilitie) to maynteyne and defend it, and that not onely against the breakers of it, by the Magistrates execution of authoritie, but the Ministers no lesse in their vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when it is openly written against, are bound by their writing againe (if the goodnesse of the matter be able so to iustifie it selfe) to lay open all the whole state thereof, by dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and confuting all the paralogismes and fallations of the gaynesayers, and by defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, euen with the firmenesse of the grounds, and the owne good nature of the cause: which manner of defence, being not destitute of lawfull authoritie, to see it obserued, not only represseth the resisters bodie, but satisfyeth, or conuinceth his minde, which is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in these contentions to be respected.</p>
   <p>And although this also be true, that both our aduersaries in the controuersies of our religion, and our Brethren, in the questions of our regiment (for such matters as then were moued) haue beene by other of excellent learning, sufficiently aunswered alreadie: yet must we be still as ready to aunswere, in defence of both these causes, as either of them are ready to oppugne them, seeing that (God be thanked) we mainteine nothing in our doctrine, or in our regiment, whereof we can not render a sound reason, and sufficient proofe, from the verie foundation of Gods word, to mainteine it with a good conscience. Howbeit, sith that our Brethren cease not, but as they first began these controuersies, so they hold not yet themselues contented, but <hi>Plus vltra,</hi> they proceede further, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, and as they rise higher, so more eagerly they presse vpon them; not onely declaiming in the Pulpits, as they get any oportunitie thereunto, and exclaime if they be put to silence, but also put vp billes and supplication<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>d of the vulgar sort, many begin to doubt of our established gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to suppose some great and inuincible validitie to be in their assertions, if too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie be not alreadie carried away too farre in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> opinion, that the regiment and discipline which our Brethren desire, is suppressed onely by meere authoritie, against the manifest prescription of Gods word, against the cleere examples of the Primitiue Church, against the manifold testimonies of the vnsuspected hystories and auncient Fathers, against the sound interpretations, and approued practise of all or the best reformed Churches, and against reason it selfe, as they pretend: how much behoueth it vs againe, in all brotherlie modestie, constantlie to stand vpon our gard in so iust a defence? For although many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, learned, and wise, haue in searching found out the shallownesse heerein of all their grounds, yet is it requisite to lay them open to all other, that desire to be more thoroughly satisfyed, yea, euen to exenterate and rip vp the verie bowels of the whole cause, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their chiefe and principall arguments, to go to the authors themselues from whence they fetch them, to set them downe at large, (least any might complaine they were mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or inuerted) and to do all this by the more diligent search and conference of the holie Scripture, by the better examining the state of the Primitiue Church, by the particular perusing the autentike hystories and testimonies of the auncient Fathers, by reuising the states, and writing of the reformed Churches, and by weighing the peyse and inference of their reasons; if happily by all, or by any of all these meanes, we shall see all, or any of the thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> that they crie so much vpon, to be truly and substantially prooued. Which thing, while heere I haue laboured to performe, though the volume haue growne bigge, and the search may seeme tedious vnto some, yet the desirous readers satisfaction may be part of his recompence, which I haue chiefely intended in this aunswere.</p>
   <p>I know that some, too much dazeled by preoccupate affection, and wholy mancipated to their forestalled opinion, will be still picking byous quarrels, to replie vpon one thing or another. But to him that is desirous indeede to boult out the truth, to sound the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to their deapth, to leuell his ayme, not to euery incident, but to the head and state in question: such replyes (as bubles) will die as they rise, being of no regard, but seruing onely to feede and foade contentions, and foreseasoned humors: and such (I graunt) it is
<pb facs="5"/>
in vayne to aunswere, except they be too vrgent, or preuayle too much, or by silence and permission get too great credite.</p>
   <p>But when as heere the persons with whome I deale, professe in the front and first title of their booke, that this is, <hi>A briefe and plaine declaration, concerning the desires</hi> (not of such, or such an one, or of some fewe or many of them, but) <hi>of all those faithfull Ministers that haue and doe seeke for the discipline and reformation, of the Church of Englande:</hi> and say againe, in their conclusion and last leafe of this Discourse, that if <hi>this forme of reformation</hi> (which they haue here set foorth) <hi>may not nowe be receaued; yet the present age may see and iudge, what is the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of our desire concerning reformation, which hitherto for lacke of such a publike testimoniall, hath beene subiect to infinite sclaunders, deuised by the aduersaries of Gods truth, and hindrance of godly proceedinges vnto reformation</hi>: And for remedie hereof, they haue nowe at length ioyned all their heads together; consulting and consenting vpon this plotforme of the Churches go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement; which for greater aestimation they recommende vnto vs, with this plausible title on the toppe of euerie leafe; <hi>A Learned Discourse of Ecclesiasticall gouernment</hi>: And that this is nowe set foorth to this ende, <hi>that the posteritie may knowe, that the truth in this time was not generally vnknowen, nor vntestified, concerning the regiment of the Church of God:</hi> thus coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously prouoking vs, to aunswere vnto this <hi>Learned Discourse,</hi> if we be able so to doe, or else to holde our peace for euer hereafter: who may not hereby see, that it is high time, either now, or neuer to speak for our selues, and for our Churches defence; or else (as conuicts) by silence to yeelde vnto them?</p>
   <p>But now againe, while we thus contend by inueighing against, and aunswering one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; some good men (I knowe) there are, that wish vs both well, which are most of all afraide of this, that wee shall lay our shame and nakednesse open to all the worlde, and namely to the publike and deadly aduersaries of vs both; who by occasion of these inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our matters of circumstance, wherin we agree not; diffame the higher matters of substance wherein we agree. And I confesse with griefe, so we doe. But when this ariseth not by vs, nor by vs is growen so farre; and yet betweene our Brethren and vs, it is so farre growen, that the aduersarie alreadie, and all the world doth, or may see our dissent herein, although neither our Brethren, nor we had set it foorth in writing: yet when our Brethren by writing also diuulge it to the wide worlde, and still followe it with one treatise on the necke of an other: what booteth it any longer for that respect, to refraine from the publike defending of our cause? Yea, how doth it not nowe stande vs more vpon, to publish our so necessarie defence, that all men may better knowe and iudge it, hearing both partes? So that wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende ours, and aunswere theirs, in such reuerende forte, as the Apostle putteth vs in minde; <hi>Let your modestie</hi> (or <hi>your patient mind) be made knowen to all men.</hi> And when the worlde shall see vs deale together thus:<note place="margin">
         <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.5.</note> they shall see, that although we must needs (as the sonne of Syrach bids vs) <hi>Striue for the truth vnto the death,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Eccl..</hi> 4.28.</note>
      <hi>and defende iustice for thy life:</hi> yet still we are desirous (as the Apostle also willeth) <hi>If it be possible, so much as lieth in vs, to haue peace with all men.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18.</note> And when the aduersarie shall see, how loath we are, and euen haled to enter into this conflict against our Brethren; and with what reuerence (for our partes) wee striue with them, or rather, stande onely at the bay of our defence, in the shielding of our Churches state and gouernance: And againe, when they shall see, howe that notwithstanding all these contentions for our regiment; we doe yet (as I hope hetherto we doe, and shall, the Lorde be praysed for it) continue in the vnion of all the ground-worke and building of our faith, doctrine, and religion; which the aduersaries among them selues (for all their crakes) doe not: they shall or may the easilier perceaue, (euen in the matter and manner of our contentions) both the synceritie of our cause, and the temperature of our dealing. Which may (by the grace of God) turne to their bettering; or at least, (to their shame) they shall or may full well discerne, how farre our verball contentions with our ouer zealous Brethr. differre from their verberall persecutions of them our ouer furious aduersaries; and are indeede no sufficient cause, to confirme or stay them in their errours. Albeit (I graunt) they do so, of the which I am the sorier, if it otherwise pleased God. And would to God, our Brethren with vs, wou'd better thinke hereon, that wee might both of vs being Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, once againe b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>r doctrine, so in the vniformitie of our discipline, against the professed aduersaries of the Gospel and of vs both, either to their conuersion or confusion. And I doubt it nor, but that if our brethren shall yet now at length, enter with vs into a more aduised viewe, and circumspect examination of these matters: either they will remitte their further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; or debate them with more deliberate moderation, to the better stopping of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>duersaries mouthes, and to our owne fuller resolution.</p>
   <p>Which sequele (if it please God) to effect, I haue thus farre hazarded, (in this iust and necessarie defence) to expose my selfe to the hartburning &amp; hard speaking (God knowes) of howe many a one, whome in the Lord (these opinions herein set aside) I loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in all duetie, and glad would I haue beene, that some other had employed their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes in this businesse, wherof many on our side (the Lord be praised for them) had beene able to haue discharged the same a great deale better. And I lingred the longer, expecting if any would preuent me: but when none did it, or did vouchsa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e it, and I was drawen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the action, on the foresaid prouocation; and was afterward of diuers requested, not to withdrawe my selfe from this occasion; considering withall, that I had before opposed my selfe against the publike aduersarie, in the like argument of <hi>the Christian Princes supreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement in Ecclesiasticall causes,</hi> which our brethren here also (though in another manner, but no lesse perillous) call againe in question: that nowe I should likewise beare my selfe on euen hand, yea, were it against mine owne deare brethren in Christ, and her maiesties loyal and louing subiectes, though greatly ouer reached in the heate &amp; preposterous ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnes of their pursuite herein.</p>
   <p>How leuelly I haue borne my selfe, without gaule, or splene, in affection, or stile (my duitie to God, to his trueth, to his church, and to her maiestie reserued) hauing my qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell onely to the matters, not to the persons: I referre me to the equitie of the reader. My purpose (God he knoweth) is not wittingly, to giue iust offence to any of our brethren. Which if notwithstanding any shall take, for that I spare not to discouer the defectes of their arguments; for that I admonish them (albeit I trust, <hi>in spiritu lenitatis,</hi>) of their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered speaches, aswell against our and their most gratious Soueraigne, and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes soueraignetie, as against the authoritie and persons of our prelates, and of vs their fellowe ministers in the Gospell, and against our ministerie, and prescribed forme of prayer and sacraments; or for that I obserue more narrowly now and then, their absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>adictions to them selues, and their dangerous positions to our state; or for that I sende home againe vnto themselues, those foule-mouthed slaunders, wherewith vntruely they burden our church and vs; or for that I dissent from the iudgement or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of those famous late writers, whome our brethren stand so much vppon; or for that I go to the pitche of the controuersies, and so largely prosecute the chiefest of them: If our brethren shall thinke these things too hardly followed, their owne importunitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cause, and their full, at least their further satisfaction being my drift; I hope they will the easilier affoord me their excuse.</p>
   <p>And I humbly beseech all our good meaning Brethr. that are otherwise persuaded herein than we are, to suspend their sentence but for the while, that they shall with indifferencie, and without partialitie, read and ponder these debatings to and fro, betwixt our brethren and vs, and then a gods name, giue their verdict, as God shal moue them, hauing the feare of God before their eyes, and a right zeale of his trueth and glorie in their hearts, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
