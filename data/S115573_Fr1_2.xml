   <p>this Gentleman is a Protestant who did carrie himselfe so worthily in his offices in the time of the late King his Maister, that he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well thought of, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the worth and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiencie of him in his so great and waightie Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. As you may hereafter perceiue in this following discourse of his Letter written vnto the now Queene Regent of <hi>France,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it hath pleased her, and her Councell since, otherwaies to dispose of his offices, and remoue him from those his so waightie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, wherein it doth appeare, the French King his worthie maister, had great reason to hold him well worthie of those high places (wherein it seemes) he hath bene a prouident, painefull, and carefull Treasuror, Officer, and
<pb facs="3"/> Seruant, and a most faithfull, Religious, and worthie Subiect: Howsoeuer it hath pleased God (by his Queen) to worke in him and his Estate, so great an alteration, for the tryall of his faith and patience. All which he in great humilitie doth doubtlesse well applie to his owne Rest, ease, and more diuine Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the content of Charitable minded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the comfort of his owne soule; which comfort of soule, I beseech our good God to impart to all Religious, Vertuous, Charitable, and well minded people: To liue in happines, and die in peace.</p>
