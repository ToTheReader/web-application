      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Canon and Civill Lawes</hi> (Christian Reader) since first K. <hi>Henry</hi> of happy memory the Eight, dismembred their bodies, <note n="a" place="margin">25. He. 8.19</note> and restored to the Diadem of the Land (over the state Ecclesiasticall) the Ancient Iurisdiction of the Crowne, they haue and do lie hidden, such of them as K. <hi>Henry</hi> then continued, and K. <hi>Edward</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">2. Ed. 6.13.</note> that succeeded him, Intituled in his Raigne the Kings, and afterwardes were the late Queenes deceased, and as they bee novv tearmed, <hi>The Kings Ecclesiasticall Lawes,</hi> (the former statutes revived by Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, <note n="c" place="margin">1.

      </note> in the first yeare of her Raigne) they have, these Lawes, and doe lie hidden in manifold, darke, and dangerous corners, in practise onley familiar in Consistories, and their knowledge to the Countries ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure: hence are the manifold vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Customes and Prescriptions that wee have: I inveigh not against them, neither custome nor prescription, that bee perfect now and in their perfect being, I would not be taken, or rather mistaken so: but they be weeds in their growing &amp; all their ingendring time, wherein (only) they give place to prevention: they bee Lawes of themselues (in their ripenesse, inviolable <note n="d" place="margin">Glo. &amp; DD in c. vigilanti de praescrip.</note>. If therefore some insight into these lawes, and knowledge succeeding this long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity, may worke another effect in the time to come, none can say vprightly now that he is, may be, or his posterity after him (if not benefited) damnified thereby: happily I may be charged (in translating) to haue damnified the Lawes, I haue sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed (I confesse) their first and originall grace, such beauty haue they and elegancy too, in the Latine tongue: but I write to English-men; and such as not so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to heare of the beauty, as they be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to vnderstand the benefit of their Lawes: for such I haue framed this <hi>Tything Table,</hi> and replenished (as my slender skill

would serue) the same, with necessary, dispersed, and scattered lawes, not hurtfull, considered as they be delivered, nor preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to the Royall prerogatiue, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Lawes, Statutes, nor Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of this Land.
