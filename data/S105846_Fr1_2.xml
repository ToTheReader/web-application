      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N humane affayres (gentle Reader) of Princes reigne, the yeres wherin thinges fall out, are noted of common necessitie for distinction and certaynety arising by recorde of tyme. But this recorde hath not of ancientie conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to posteritie. For the Lord, who altereth times and seasons, changeth states in such varietie, that the true report of theyr me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory perished with them. For Diuine stories, tymes haue more vse then for humane affayres: no lesse then heauenly thinges ouermatch earthly. And as the worke of God is perfect: so he beginneth and continueth times register, from the Creation to the Redemption. The golden Chayne which <hi>Salomon</hi> drew before the dore of the most holy <hi>Debyr,</hi> hath not so much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as this Chayne: continued from since Paradise was shut to <hi>Adam,</hi> vntyll the Lord opened the heauens vnto the Thiefe, that craued remembrance in his kingdome. The Fathers in the noblest lyne, draw in their age these yeeres, slyding by the Sunnes course, from the promise made to <hi>Eue,</hi> vntyll one of those
<pb facs="3"/>
Fathers fell once away from hope of that promise. <hi>Terah</hi> was he that fell away: after whose death the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is reuiued to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Thence the Lynkes of this holy Chayne are fastened on other poyntes: stately in story, to be soner marked: few in number, to be easely remembred: deepe in signification, to be carefully stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died. These are, the Lambe and the Temple: fit starres to draw out the tymes, vntyll the true Lambe buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Temple, raysing vp the temple of his body. For the distance from the Promise vnto the Lambe, euen the very day is by <hi>Moses</hi> set downe. Likewyse the distance thence, vntyll the buyldyng of the Temple by <hi>Salomon.</hi> Thence the whole yeres of <hi>Salomons</hi> reigne: and from the departure of ten Tribes vnto the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the Temble. <hi>Ezek</hi> 4. How long the Temple lay without any decree of buyldyng it agayne, we may certainely gather by the whole Captiuity which <hi>Iudah</hi> suffered in <hi>Babylon.</hi> For <hi>Nebuchad-nezars</hi> house was to reigne Seuentie yeeres: and <hi>Iudah</hi> so long to be in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie. VVherefore the beginnyng of that Captiuity must needes be, when <hi>Nebuchad-nezar</hi> tooke <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> in the first of his reigne, and brought the noblest to <hi>Babylon.</hi> In the ninteenth yeere of <hi>Nebuchad-nezar</hi> the Temple was brent: and thereupon the thirde Captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie folowed. VVherfore fiftie ful yeres are to finysh the Seuenty, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> came vp, and made a decree to buylde the Temple againe. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was not mooued so to do, vntyll <hi>Daniel</hi> was taught by an Angel, when Christ the true Temple woulde consecrate him selfe. That he was taught: for the very houre, when he prayed, at the tyme of the euenyng offeryng, how long it shoulde be vntyll the Lord did make hymselfe the euenyng Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng, when the vayle of the Temple rented. For this last part, the Lord hath taken speciall care, so long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="3"/>
tellyng the matter playnely: and ceassing further particulers beyonde that age, that men shoulde rest in the playnnes of his worde, as his holy Prophetes then taught of Redemption.</p>
   <p>Holy writynges touching these poyntes, I haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togeather. The playnnes whereof, yf any stryue to ouerthrow, I wyll no more yeelde to him, then <hi>Iob</hi> woulde to <hi>Eliphaz, Zophar,</hi> and <hi>Bildad.</hi> Although many differ in their Chronicles, yet these places onely being noted, all strife ceasseth. One, that after <hi>Terahs</hi> death, <hi>Abraham</hi> at seuentie and fiue yeeres olde, receyued the Promise: whereof I haue disputed at large in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of <hi>Melchisedek.</hi> An other, that three hundreth and ninetie yeeres. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. are from <hi>Ieroboams</hi> drawyng <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> away to the burnyng of the Temple, with the third captiuitie: which time, both in particulers, many haue cast aright: and for the general summe these agree: <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> vpon <hi>Ezek 4. Gerard Mercator, Clement Schu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, Math. Beroald, Ioseph Scaliger, Henry Bunting.</hi> An other is, that <hi>Nebuchad-nezars</hi> house reigned but seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeres: which the <hi>Talmud,</hi> wherin lieth all Countrey-Iewes consent, expressely holdeth: also olde <hi>Tatianus</hi> in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and old <hi>Grecians</hi> commonly, no lesse of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity then the Apostles age: in hym, and in <hi>Clemens,</hi> with late writers very many, from <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. and the common rate of ages, in such as were caried captiue: and saw both the fyrst Temple, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde buylded. The fourth knot is, the Seauens of <hi>Daniel:</hi> wherein the proprietie, as <hi>Daniel</hi> vnderstoode it, and penned it, shoulde suffise.</p>
   <p>These foure places ryghtly holden, ende the endles controuersies. Reade the textes, and vnderstand them. The Lord teach vs so to number our dayes, that we may bring the hart to wysedome.</p>
