   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EING des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gift to bestow vpon your Ladiship, to testifie my thankefulnesse or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance, I present this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Treatise vnto you. It may haue more vse then
<pb facs="3"/> it shewes for: for if things shine more cleerely when their contraries are set by them; then may this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the estate of a wicked man by Signes, serue much to establish the godly in the point of Assurance, when hee seeth himselfe freed from those fearefull &amp; forlorne marks. And if men vse to make much of all those directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by which any gaine or treasure may be certainely compassed: then ought the Directions not to bee despised, that shew how the Spirit of God, and the graces thereof may bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>For by these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, both those that want the true graces of Christ, may here learne how to get them, and such as haue them but in weake measure, may by the same Rules learne how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease them.</p>
   <p>I haue been induced to thinke of your Ladiship in this Dedication, partly in acknowledgement of the great respect due to the Family out of which you came, as it hath beene a principall meanes of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the light of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell for many yeares to shine in those places where
<pb facs="4"/> the people had sitten in darkenesse, and in the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death: And part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawne by the many prayses I haue obserued in your Ladiship, since the time of your soiourning in the noble Family you now liue in: Your great respect of my Ministery, and your constant paines to employ your selfe about Religious duties, deserue from mee more acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement then so meane a gift as this can discharge. Madam, you are happy aboue many, that GOD hath inclined your heart to beare the yoke of
<pb facs="4"/> Christ in your youth, and discerne the glory of the spirituall Kingdome of Iesus Christ. Your meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse assures me liberty to beseech you to goe on in the good way of God, and to cleaue fast with all hearty affection vnto the Truth, as you haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Iesus Christ, It shall be a great increase of your glory, to increase in the knowledge and grace of Christ, and (in sound de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall of your selfe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world) to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion your selfe to all the courses by which you may be pleasing in the eyes of
<pb facs="5"/> God, whiles multitudes in the Gentry of the Land of both Sexes, by following foolish vanities, forsake their owne mercy.</p>
   <p>Now the God of peace sanctifie you throughout, and so prosper his owne worke in you, that your whole spirit, and soule and body may bee preserued blamelesse vnto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Lord Iesus Christ, <hi>March.</hi> 9. 1618.</p>
