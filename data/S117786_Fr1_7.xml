especially for that by instinct of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
(as a wise ethnike writeth) men are more busy to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
other mēs fautes then vertues. And although this
wicked custome hath allwayes from the beginning
ben practised, proceding of the corrupted nature off
man: yet neuer in any age it hath so much bē vsed as
now sence Martin Luther brought out to light the
fifte ghospell, and sent abrode in to the world these
vnhappy and vnghostely ghospellers, which all
Christendom now allmost to their greate lost and
destruction, is stuffed and stifled with all. For where
as this ghospel can neither be proued by any euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of truthe, neither (as the true ghospell was) be cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by operation of miracles, these new preachers
of our dayes haue turned all their force and power an
other waie,<note place="margin">A charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shifte of the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>testants.</note> labouring to the and nayle, by right and
by wronge, and by all meanes possible to bring the
olde Catholike doctours, and al such as folowe them
<pb n="30" facs="32"/>
in infamie, obloquy, and reproche to all the world.
And this lesson our aduersaries haue very perfitly
lerned of their Master Luther, and haue practised
this precepte all waies hauing to do with me or any
other Catholike man. Neither will they by any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
be brought from this their charitable custome
while they liue, perceauing well that by this crafty
meanes they gett more grounde and deceaue more
the people, then euer they were able to do by plaine
and vpright dealing. Truly as for my part, I confesse
before God and his diuine iudgement, my sinnes to
be greate and many, which can reioyse in no other
thing, nor otherwise praie, then that good kinge Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
vsing these wordes.<note place="margin">Psal. 141.</note>
      <hi>Lorde heare my praier: heare me
in thy righteousnes, and entre not in to iudgement with thy
seruaunt, for no lyuing man may be iustified in thy fight,</hi>
to the whiche that notable sentence of S. Austen also
agreeth, saying.<note place="margin">Lib. confes. 9. cap. 13.</note>
      <hi>Wo euen to the commendable life of men, if
thou o Lord doest examin and trie thē without thy mercie.</hi>
And thus must euery man (be he neuer so holy and
perfit) iudge of him selfe, if he respect the terrible
iudgement of almightie God, wherewith no man can
stand without his mercie through Christ Iesus. But
in ciuill policie and trade of this worlde, where the
good a bearing of subiects is required, euery mā ought
so to ordre his life that he maye without groudg of
conscience saye. <hi>I can be charged with nothing, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
I iustifie not myself herein.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.</note> And that saying of the
prophet.<note place="margin">Psalm. 7.</note>
      <hi>Iudge me o lorde according to my righteousnes.</hi>
For <hi>this is our glorie,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.</note> as the Apostle sayth, <hi>the testimonie
<pb facs="33"/>
of our conscience.</hi> Although therefore as I saied before, I
acknowledg my selfe for a greate sinner, yet not with
standing all daies of my life (be it not spoken for
any pride) I haue allwaies endeuoured to haue the
testimonie of an vpright conscience, that I might ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
a counte to such as required it of me, bothe of my
belefe and of my cōuersation. For this is the straight
commaundement of almightie God, and the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of S. Peter the Apostle, saying: <hi>Be ye ready allwaies
to geue an awnswer to all that shall aske you a reason of the
hope that is in you,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note>
      <hi>and that with mekenes and feare, hauinge
a good conscience: that whereas they backebite you as euill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers
they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
in Christ.</hi> The which waighty precepts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
scripture commaunding expresly euery man to be
ready to geueaccompte of his hope and conuersatiō,
I being so bitterly and roughely prouoked of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,
could not but purge and defend my selfe as
reason required: For as S. Hierom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>aieth: <hi>He that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth
his good name, is cruell and vnnaturall toward him
selfe,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lib. de bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no viduita tis. cap. 22.</note> and as S. Austin saieth, <hi>Our life we maintaine for
our owne sakes. our good name for other mens.</hi> The wise
man also saithe. <hi>Better is a good name then much riches,
and to be loued is worth better then gold or siluer.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Prou. 22.</note> And the
common talke telleth vs, who hath lost his good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
is more thē halfe hāged. For these reasons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and diuers other, I haue thought expedient to
write, and set forthe this brief and short <hi>Apologie</hi> to
thētēt that according to the duty of a Christē mā (bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
other ordinary meanes of triall our aduersaries
<pb n="31" facs="33"/>
admit not) I may declare to the world my innocency
herein, and remoue the haynous flawnders of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,
which they laye out continually against me
in pulpits, in grammer scholes, in their writinges and
in famous libels.</p>
   <p>To suspend therefore no longer the Godly and
Christen reader, we will nowe enter our <hi>Apologie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diuided in to thre partes. The first is of the true
and right vnderstanding of the worde of God and
the ghospell which they saie I did before embrace
and folow, but now, I abhorre and persecut. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōd
part is of the trāslation of the holy bible in to the
vulgar German tongue. whereof they bable that I
go about amd deuise to make an inhibition against
the reading of the german bibles. The third part is of
certain articles in controuersie, which the Lutherans
partly for shame denie, partly go about to reconcile
with the rest of their doctrine. To the ende that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby
they may persuade the worlde that I belied thē
hitherto, affirming such to be their articles, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
them with dissension amonge themselues.</p>
   <p>With these thre pointes, by the grace of god, I shal
defend my simple conuersation and geue due infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of my belief, vsing herein a plaine and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
stile of our vulgar tongue: that the simple lay mā
may also vnderstande me, declaring sincerely and
with all modestie, the truth in all pointes, without ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iling,
biting, or any other vnciuill demeanour. For so
it becometh well meaning men to do. Although my
aduersaries to bring me in infamie and reproche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte
<pb facs="34"/>
no such kinde of rethorike, laieng on greate
lode of lies and reproches, whereby they haue cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie
all honest meanes of reconciliation, auoiding al
maner of iudgement and ciuil triall. Being yet frō god
commaunded by Moises, <hi>That all controuersies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
should be tried by the lawfull Magistrat.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Deute. 17.</note> For this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
alwaies ben my only desire and is yet, that my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
which either priuely or in open libels cease
not to backbite me, cōuēt me before my ordinary and
lawfull magistrat, and there make their complainte:
not making them selues the partie plaintif and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,
yea and iudges in their owne cause: as against
all order and lawe, bothe spirituall and temporall thei
haue hitherto most impudently done. Truly as I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueben
allwaies, so am I now ready and desirous to
present my self before my ordinary Magistrat, and to
abide the whole ordre and proces of the lawes aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inst
me. For thanked be God I knowe my life and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
hath ben such (be it not spoken for any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de)
that I am not ashamed nor afeard to showe my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
before any mā a liue.<note place="margin">The cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of the protestāts grief aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inst Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylus.</note> And sure I am that if I had not
laboured with the Emperours Maiestie and other
Catholike princes for the maintenaūce of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like
religion against heretikes, my life shoulde neuer
haue bē touched of thē. But seing that the Catholike
doctrine it self (praised be God) can not by any good,
reason or coulour be impugned, they laie at my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and fight against me, letting the doctrine it selfe
alone. Vsing this argument that I against my owne
conscience only for honour and riches sake, defend
<pb n="32" facs="34"/>
the Catholikes, whereas yet they knowe well them
selues, that I haue sustained the losse of some thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of crownes, and empaired much the helthe of
my body, in the quarell of the Catholike faith. But
howsoeuer the matter goeth,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.</note>
      <hi>Our Lorde knoweth who
are his, and he trieth the hartes of men,</hi>

      <hi>No man is so great but God passeth
him, nor no mā so smal but God espieth him,</hi> and <hi>he shal geue

my conscience herein, wo is vnto me, For on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God knoweth the conscience of man. But if I
do vprightely herein, wo is vnto you that take vpon
you the secret iudgement of God. Aud thus farre off
