   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ith contrarie to my desire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation this tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of horseman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is happened into the Printers hand, I haue thought good to remember the readers, that albeit Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, Grison, Claudio, and others (men most excellent) haue prescribed sundrie rules and meanes how to handle horsses, &amp; ride them with good grace and seemelines; yet if the same be not confirmed by vse and practise, it prooueth vnprofitable &amp; to none auaile at all. I wish therfore that all Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen &amp; others desirous of that knowlege, should not onelie read, but also exercise the rules in this booke prescribed. For as in all
<pb facs="6"/>
other sciences demonstratiue, so heerein vse and experience surmounteth all conceipt &amp; contemplation, which is apparentlie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in those that haue therevnto applied themselues.</p>
   <p>And surelie I suppose (be it spoken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offense of time past) that this art hath neuer beene (I meane within this realme) of that perfection it now is; neither were the horssemen of former ages, equall or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to some now liuing, sith they wanting both demonstrations, and skilfull instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, could not by possible meanes atteine therevnto. For, before M. Blundeuile, I find not anie that haue written in our toong: neither were the teachers of that time of much knowledge. Where now, cheefly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hir Maiesties most prosperous reigne, (incouraged by the valorous disposition of so excellent a Prince) diuers haue aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to write, &amp; many vertuous Gentlemen
<pb facs="6"/>
with singular commendation, atteine to great knowledge.</p>
   <p>Ouerlong it were to reaccount the names of all Noblemen and Gentlemen, that in this age haue aspired to singular skill in horsman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which I impute cheeflie to the imitation of great personages. I wish therfore that they, and al other Gentlemen should (both for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat exercise &amp; publike respect) applie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the studie and practise of this art, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of that honorable person the Earle of Leicester, who among manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertuous qualities both of mind &amp; body, hath indeuored to atteine so great excellencie in this art, as for his iudgment, cunning and cōlines in riding, he meriteth the prise of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Which appeereth not onlie in his owne person, but also in his choise of the esquires &amp; riders of hir Highnes stable, all men of great knowledge: and some of them of such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie as may not be matched. I could also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
<pb facs="7"/>
the names of diuers other Gentlmen very skilfull &amp; commendable, which the rather to auoid enuie I omit. Yet may I not forget the praise due to those that be teachers of this art in the citie of London; for by their industrie and vertue, the number of seruiceable horsses &amp; horssemen is dailie increased: &amp; should be more, if other skilfull men would applie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to teaching in that maner.</p>
   <p>Thus much I haue thought good to saie, as well to excuse my selfe (hauing written this worke onlie to satisfie my priuate friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest) as to admonish the Readers therof, in any wise to accompanie their studie and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with dailie vse and experience, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of assuredlie great knowledge and excellencie will ensue.</p>
