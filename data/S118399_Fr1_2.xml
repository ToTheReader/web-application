      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is most certaine <hi>(Right VVorshipfull)</hi> that Christian knowledge aboundeth in our land, by reason of the manifold plentie and long continuance of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred truth of <hi>Christian veritie</hi> by Gods vnspeakeable mercy, and admirable blessing, setled and taught amongst vs: so can it not be denied, that <hi>Practise,</hi> that is, conuersation according with our knowledge, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to our profession, very much faileth and wanteth among vs. For (besides those, the number or rather swarme whereof is not small,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.8 <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18.</note>
      <hi>that know not God, and obey not the Gospel of our Lord Iesus Christ: who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their cogitations darkened, and being meere strangers from the life of God,</hi> (as the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) <hi>thorough the wilfull ignorance that is in them, haue giuen themselues ouer</hi> Heathen-like, or hellish-like rather, <hi>to worke all manner of vncleannesse</hi> and wickednesse, euen <hi>with greedinesse</hi>) many can say, <hi>Lord,

      <hi>The Royal Law</hi>) to bee verie profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and auaileable to the vse and intent before mentioned, I haue beene willing of a priuate <hi>Sermon</hi> to make it a <hi>publike Treatise,</hi> and to conuey it, the forme somewhat altered, and the matter enlarged, from the <hi>Pulpit</hi> to the <hi>Presse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This little labour of mine, I am desirous (<hi>Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull</hi>)
<pb facs="3"/>
vnder the <hi>Patronage</hi> of your worthy Name, might be shielded and set foorth. First in regard of my dutie vnto your Worship; namely, that thereby I may, lest any note of vnthankefulnesse, or spot of forgetfulnesse be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed vpon mee, somewhat testifie my gratefull minde and mindfull remembrance of your <hi>speciall</hi> fauour and <hi>bountifull</hi> kindnesse vnto me from time to time <hi>shewed</hi> and <hi>continued</hi>: and then in regard of the <hi>Argument</hi> it selfe, which is of <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>conscionable dealing</hi>: which by reason of your <hi>Honourable place,</hi> and worthy employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnder the <hi>Kings</hi> most excellent Maiestie in his <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Requests,</hi> seemeth vnto me <hi>verie fit</hi> to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated vnto your Worship <hi>aboue some others,</hi> as to one that <hi>by his place,</hi> and (I doubt not) <hi>his often practise,</hi> doth see the vse and necessitie, and oft is mooued <hi>to vrge and require</hi> the obseruation and performance thereof: which alone, well <hi>regarded and fulfilled</hi> among men, would <hi>vndoubtedly</hi> cause much more peace and agreement to be in the land, and fewer <hi>Petitions</hi> by many to passe your hand.</p>
   <p>I haue heerein, among other particulars, some-what vrged (an Argument wherein <note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Viz, in my Maintenance of the Minist. and my two-fold Tribute.</hi>
      </note> otherwhere, and in other wise, as vnto your <hi>Worship</hi> it is not vnknowne, I haue more plentifullie laboured) <hi>more equall and consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dealing</hi> toward the Ministers of the Church. That, in some mens opinions, may happely seeme to require <hi>some Cleargie</hi> rather then <hi>any Lay-man</hi> to <hi>patronize</hi> the worke. But partly, since that is but the least and the last part thereof, and partly for that I haue found your <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> as a sincere louer of the Gospell, so a <hi>speciall fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> of the Cleargie, and in <hi>particular</hi> in some of the points vrged, so <hi>conscionable</hi> and <hi>respectiue,</hi> as I haue shewed <hi>others should be,</hi> but I haue knowne none but <hi>your selfe</hi> to be; I suppose that <hi>fitly and iustly</hi> both it, and I for it, may craue <hi>your speciall Protection,</hi> and fauourable accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>Which trusting, according to your accustomed kindnesse, that courteouslie many times reacheth out the hand to many a meaner suite, you will accordingly vouchsafe, I doe with all dutifull affection commend it vnto you, and by you to the godlie and vertuous Reader: Heartily beseeching <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God,</hi> as he hath enriched you with no small mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his graces and blessings, and adorned you with sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry worthy ornaments and endowments both of <hi>bodie and mind,</hi> so to continue and increase the same in and vpon you, as may be best to the furtherance of his <hi>glorie,</hi> the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of <hi>our Countrey,</hi> and <hi>your owne,</hi> both temporall and eternall good. <hi>Amen.</hi>
