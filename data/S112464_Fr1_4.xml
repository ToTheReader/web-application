   <head>¶THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T IS FVLL WELL knowen, that Hieronimus Osorius of Portugal, by the helpe of Shacklocke, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth now as plaine English as we our selues, and thinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to preuayle by course, as much now with the vnlearned, as before with the learned. And so doth he. He deceyueth now his deare frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des on both sides, as well the learned as thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. But it could not otherwise be, and his epistle was not eyther at the first compiled, or at the last translated so much for argumēt as for eloquence. Forsoothe in the vertue of the seuen sciences, they will openly vanquish &amp; confoūde this new founde arte of gospellinge. They fyrst founde out the holly land of Rome by geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Looke in m. Shack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face his nedelesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing of his own parti, with the imba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyng of the contrary.</hi>
      </note> they laide syege vnto the whole worlde by Cosmography, they tyed together their seruice by Arithmetry, fensed it with bulwarkes of logicke. &amp;c. And now in Retorique they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly passe, euen in master Ri. Shacklocks owne iudgement. As for Diuynitie, I wyll tell you what. it is so handled of .ii. men, in .ii. bookes,
<pb facs="7"/>
within these .ii. yeres, that better it had bene the gospel had neuer peped out, so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes of protestantes bookes had neuer bene borne, so many hūdreth martyrs had neuer cast awaye theym selues in Englande, the Byble hadde neuer spoken inglyshe worde, S. Paule had neuer vttered his minde so bluntly, the .x. Cōmaundements had neuer perked in the pix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is place, the communion table had neuer bene so waueringe and moueable, the churche or tē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of god had neuer ben so prophane for lacke of censyng and sparginge. Yea it had ben better for S. Peter to haue ben Pope of Rome, and to haue left good testimonye thereof. For it shal be proued vnto his face,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Vain bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen by Papysts emong the people.</hi>
      </note> yea though it weare neuer so. you will not thincke, you can not y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine what shall bee proued, more then euer was proued, yea x. tymes more then euer was true. And all this shall come <hi>De profundis.</hi> Yet there is more, and that I gesse by mayster Shacklocks nedeles translation. No lattin wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Papyst but shalbe Englished shortlye, no Englishe wryter a protestant but shalbe confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, no proofe but shalbe reproued, no reproofe but shalbe proued. Nothing so sone imprinted
<pb facs="7"/>
but shalbe matched with a contrary printe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wag but it shalbe seasoned on, nothinge so soone set out, but it shall haue an onset. And all in haste, in speede: or elles were all disgraced. Then must the ghospell nedes fall downe, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistry be hoysed vp and restored againe, rowme made for Idolators througheout all Inglande, letters flye in haste from the M. of the Postes, the sincportes all be spread open, shyppes pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,<note place="margin">
         <hi>As had V<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lisses, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaca.</hi>
      </note> and a syde winde knytte fast in a woolsack to be ready at an howre. All this may be. For, I tell you, an impossybylitee with a Papyst is no straunge thinge. That is, is not: and that is not, is. And that cannot be, shalbe. And many things are there, that passe our symple wittes. As for example: the Popishe Byshoppes wear endew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with byshoprikes, and were thereof lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye defeated, and our Byshoppes are nowe in possession, by as good authority royall warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and yet are the Papisticall Byshoppes the dewe owners, yea no man may say, nay: and it hath bene pleaded by the common lawe. For example againe: one Papyst fyndethe deepe faulte with the mouinge and remouinge of the Communion table, and cryeth out vppon thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy
<pb facs="8"/>
of these protestantes: and yet another for the proofe of his Pyx, may without spotte of vnconstancy alleadge, that here it was hanged vppe, there it was harboured in a Chappell, in some place it was clasped vp in a little shyppe of syluer or gold,<note place="margin">
         <hi>M. Shak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lockes idle comparisō in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</hi>
      </note> and otherwhere otherwyse, To the purpose nearer: Osorius hath shaken all Englande, Osorius hath spoken ynough to turn water into wyne, no man goeth from the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Osorius without remorse. D. Haddon he passeth as farre as this passeth that, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing passeth I cā not tell what. And yet doubt I not (by the grace of god and pacience of the reader) streight way to proue a contrarye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion. And for that purpose haue I collected out of Osorius his whole booke many flowers of this his chiualrye, wherewith in M. Shack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockes simple iudgement he hath so tryūphed ouer the truth, and wonne vnto him selfe the lawrell of all eloquence. VVhich I haue seuerally written that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man may take thereof a second vew, &amp; (that done) define me elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
