Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these most of all relish and stand in need of mercy: for when

Wherefore though this messe comes not unto thee set forth in a Lordly dish, not having passed since the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, under the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site hand of the most worthy Author, yet despise it not: for many times though things of greater judgement affect the understanding most, yet things of lesser concisenesse, worke
