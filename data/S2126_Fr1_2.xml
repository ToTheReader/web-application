   <p>Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the long (almost this three yeres) besieging of the Towne of <hi>Ostend;</hi> the Lords States of the vnited Prouinces, haue thought it good, to land an Armie in <hi>Flanders,</hi> hoping by that meanes to withdraw the siege from <hi>Ostend:</hi> and perceiuing that the Enemie for all that leaues not the siege, but daily gets neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same, hoping likewise to get it in, and so perswading himselfe, that nothing shall be able to withstand his might, but all to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his power; to that ende they of <hi>Flanders</hi> haue employed all their forces to bring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the said Towne of <hi>Ostende,</hi> thinking by that meanes to haue all that Countrey so sure vnto them, that none were able to set any more footing in that land, to winne any thing from them; not thinking so much on the Lords strong hand (the other meanes) as of late he hath shewed, and is like to come to

      passe; when alwayes the Enemie thought (if <hi>Ostend</hi> were won) not so much as a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow would be left open thorow which any man might by any meanes preiudice them.
