      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>VR</hi> Gracious <hi>GOD,</hi> who in His rich Mercie (<hi>RIGHT WORSHIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FVLL</hi>) hath in this latter time raised vp manie rare and worthie instruments and faithfull Preachers in other Countreyes about vs, hath not left this our Countrey destitute of the like benefites: for, as amongst them, so amongst vs, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with our ingratitude, Hee hath raised vp from time to time sundrie notable men, indewed with singular gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whose Ministerie Hee made powerfull to ouer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

to acquire a <hi>CHVRCH</hi> vnto Himselfe, in the which Hee might bee glorified in the riches of His mercies: of whome the moste part nowe sleepe in the LORD, and rest from their labours: Amongst whome <hi>MASTER ROBERT ROLLOK,</hi> of blessed memorie, deserueth (for his graces) to bee counted with the first: for who euer preassed more to approoue himselfe to GOD in a good conscience than hee? Who euer was more faithfull and pairfull in his calling than hee? Hee stro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e alwayes to glorifie GOD, and to honour his profession and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by a godlie life and conuersation, so that the verie enemies of the trueth coulde not accuse him, nor Enuie it selfe justlie reprooue him: Hee set himselfe alwayes to doe good to others: for hee thought hee was not his owne man, but deputed for the seruice of others: Hee was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer idle, but hee did either reade, meditate, praye, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, counsell, comfort, preach or write: He was peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Church, patient of wronges, neuer vindictiue, but euer readie to forgiue: Hee sought not the worlde, knowing that hee had heere no continuing, but had his conuersation in the Heauen, from whence hee looked for his Sauiour to come.</p>
   <p>But it is needlesse to praise him, either to you, Syr, who knoweth so well what store of grace the LORD vouchsafed vpon him, or yet to anie others, seeing his workes speake plainlie enough for him: for as hee edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied manie in his life by his Preaching, so also hath hee edified many not onlie in his Countrey, but in manie other partes, by his learned and judicious writinges, lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>And because his Lectures, that haue beene before published by vs, vpon the <hi>COLOSSIANS</hi> and <hi>THESSALONIANS,</hi> as also the first eleuen <hi>SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONS</hi> heere contained, haue beene receiued with good liking and applause of manie: and newe, finding that there are not copies extant, especiallie of these eleuen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to satisfie the desire of such as seeke them, wee haue thought good to cause imprint them ouer againe: as also to adjoyne seuen other Sermons, preached by him vpon diuerse Textes, and receiued by his Schollers from his mouth: which indeede wee must confesse, required the refining hand of the Author, that they might haue shined in their owne beautie: Alwayes, our care haue beene in these, as in all the rest before published, out of some copies offered vnto vs, as neare as wee coulde, to giue out to the publike viewe of the Church, both the matter, stile, and phrase of the godlie Author.</p>
   <p>Nowe, for manie reasons wee are mooued to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende these his Sermons, (and our labours therein) to your patronage, that with them your memorie, with the posteritie, might long endure.</p>
   <p>First, in respect of the entire loue and affection yee carried to Master ROLLOK from the first houre that yee were acquainted with him, euen vnto his death: for no man euer loued him, conuersed with him, respected him, &amp;c, more than your selfe: and manie a time haue you resorted vnto him in his health, and offered him such curtesie and kindnesse, that hee acknowledged himselfe to bee obliged to none so much as to you.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>And finallie, yee not onelie visited him in his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but allured him to come to your house, where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarde of paines and expenses, yee entertained him, and such as visited him, moste liberallie and chearefullie, till the time that the LORD called him to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: Yea, yee counted it a singular blessing of the LORD, that Hee honoured you with suh a guest.</p>
   <p>Next, Master ROLLOK in his Testament ordained, that all his Bookes, which after shoulde bee imprinted, shoulde bee dedicated vnto you: that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer got commoditie thereof, next after GOD, might giue the honour and thankes vnto you.</p>
   <p>Thirdlie, through your care, endeuour, and expenses onelie these whole Sermons were gathered in from them that wrote them, through your procurement onelie they were reuised, corrected, and made fit for the Printing: by your meanes onelie nowe they see the light, which without you had beene buried in darknesse.</p>
   <p>Lastlie, if it were free for vs to make choyse of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone, wee woulde make choyse of none but you, to testifie our thankefulnesse for your great vndeserued kindnesse shewed vnto vs particularlie, yea, and to all these whome the LORD hath set in His seruice.</p>
   <p>So that in all respectes reason requireth, that all these Sermons shoulde bee published vnder your patronage and protection: For whereas your name was not prefixed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the first eleuen, when they were first imprinted: (seeing by your endeuour, charges, and expenses onelie they were first set foorth) nowe this occasion beeing presented, wee
<pb facs="4"/>
might justlie haue beene blamed, if that ouer-sight by vs had not beene amended.</p>
   <p>Finallie, <hi>Syr,</hi> honour the LORD, and Hee will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you, delight in His wayes, and Hee will giue you your hearts desire, weary not to doe good vnto the Saincts, and He will recompense you, &amp; at last, will crowne all your good deedes with glorie.</p>
   <p>The LORD make you to goe on from grace to grace, and in all thinges direct you by His Spirite, that yee may bee long happie in this life, and for euer happie in the life to come, Amen. <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the 22. of <hi>Ianuarie,</hi> Anno Dom. 1616.</p>
