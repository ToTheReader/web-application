      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O recreate my selfe, after some more serious Studies, I tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to exercise my Inuention in the illustration of my <hi>Motto;</hi> which being thus finished, my friends made me beleeue it was worth the preseruing; and grew so importunat for <hi>Coppies</hi> thereof, that I could not deny them. But doubting, lest by often transcribing, it might be much lamed through the <hi>Scribes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency (as many things of this nature are) I thought fitting, rather to exemplyfie the same, by the <hi>Presse,</hi> then by the <hi>Penne.</hi> And to that end, deliuered it ouer to some <hi>Stationers,</hi> to haue onely so many <hi>Copies,</hi> as I intended to bestow.</p>
   <p>Yet considering that other men (to whom I meant them not) might peraduenture, come
<pb facs="4"/>
to the view of those Lines. I thought it not amisse, by way of Preuention, to remooue such Cauills as may be made against mee, by those vnto whom I am vnknowne. Not, that I care to giue euery idle <hi>Reader,</hi> an account of my Intentions: But to shew the <hi>Ingenuous,</hi> that the <hi>Carelesnes</hi> expressed in this <hi>Motto,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeds from an vndistempered <hi>Care,</hi> to make all my Actions, (as neere as I can) such, as may be decent, warrantable, and becomming an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Man: And that those, who shall foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeke (from thence) to picke aduantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me: may know, I am too well aduised to write any thing, which they shall bee iustly able to interpret, either to my hinderance, or disparagement.</p>
   <p>Let me want esteeme among all good men, if I purposed (or haue any secret desire in me) that any part of this, should be applied to any particular man; but so as euery one ought to apply things vnto his own Conscience; and he that beleeues me not, I feare is guilty. My in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was, to draw the true Picture of mine own heart; that my friends, who knew mee out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, might haue some representation of my inside also. And that, if they liked the forme
<pb facs="4"/>
of it, they might (wherein they were defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue) fashion their owne mindes thereunto. But, my principall Intention, was by recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding those thoughts to confirme mine owne Resolution; and to preuent such alterations, as Time and infirmites, may worke vpon mee. And if there bee no more reason inferr ed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, to remoue my opinion, then I am yet apprehensiue of: I am confidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that neither Feare, nor Force shall compell me, to deny any thing which I haue affirmed in this Poem. For, I had rather bee degraded from the greatest <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> that could be giuen me; then constrained to deny this <hi>Motto.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Proud Arrogance (I know) and enough too; will be layd to my charge. But those who both know me, and the necessitie of this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, will excuse me of it. The rest (if they mis-censure me) are part of those things, <hi>I care not for.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The Language is but indifferent; for, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <hi>Matter</hi> more then <hi>Words.</hi> The <hi>Method</hi> is none at all: for, I was loath to make a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, of a recreation. And we know, he that rides abroad for his pleasure, is not tyed so
<pb facs="5"/>
strictly to keepe <hi>High-waies,</hi> as hee that takes a Iourney.</p>
   <p>If the intermixing of sleight and weighty things together, be offensiue to any. Let them vnderstand, that if they well obserue it, they shall finde a seriousnesse, euen in that which they imagine least momentary. And if they had aswell obserued the conditions of men, as I haue done: they would perceiue that the greatest number (like Children which are allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Schoole with points and Aples) must be drawne on with some friuolous expressions, or else will neuer listen to the graue precepts of Virtue; which, when they once heare, doe many times beget a delight in them, before they be aware.</p>
   <p>Many Dishes of meate which we affect not may be so Cookt, that we shall haue a good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit vnto them: So, many men who take no pleasure to seeke <hi>Vertue</hi> in graue Treatises of Morallitie, may (perhaps) finding her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt for, masked vnder the habit of a light <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em,</hi> growenamord on her beauty.</p>
   <p>The foolish <hi>Canterbury</hi> Tale in my <hi>scourge</hi> of <hi>Vanity,</hi> (which I am now almost ashamed to read ouer) euen that, hath bin by some praysed
<pb facs="5"/>
for a witty passage: And I haue heard diuers, seriously protest, that they haue much more feelingly bin informed, &amp; moued to detest the Vanity of the humor there skoffed at, by that rude <hi>Tale,</hi> then they were by the most graue precepts of Phylosophy. And that makes me oftentimes affect some things, in regard of their vsefulnesse: which being considered according to the Method of Art, and rules of Scholler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, would seeme ridiculous.</p>
   <p>But I vse more words for my Apology then needes: If this will not giue you satisfaction, I am sorry I haue said so much; and, if you know which way, satisfie your selues. For, how I am resolued (if you thinke it worth the taking notise of) the booke will tell you. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
