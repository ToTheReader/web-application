   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Booke of <hi>Job</hi> in respect of the dialect of those times, being of quaint expressions, must needs be explained by other and more familiar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: and being also difficult in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence (which is very materiall) many texts or verses besides their proper senses must therefore in their explications carrie their dependant, and coherent meanings in them, else they cannot bee fully ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, nor the discourse by its right joints and ligaments continued, and knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but must needs be imperfect, blind, and lame, which I have laboured the cure of, by perspicuity of phrase and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
   <p>A Paraphrase (and not a commentarie) is the thing that I endeavour, which is a
<pb facs="4"/>
bare rendering of the sense plaine and easy, the better to enable the Reader to be a commentator to himselfe. And if any place seeme to beare another meaning then I have given it, know, that there goes more to the true stating of a text then an overly view or a present consideration of the sense it seemes to hold forth in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it: some places require much pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and many candles to bee lighted at once in the minde of the expositour to give their true intended meaning, else hee may erre in <hi>benè divisis ad malè conjuncta,</hi> and cause a falling out of the text either with its coherence and scope, or else of one text with another.</p>
   <p>The story is well known to be as princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall a pillar to support a Christian in strong trials, by paterne and precept of faith and patience, as any the whole Bible affoords, and so I trust it may prove being well understood and applied to all such as read it with an heart to use it. Besides which there is excellent matter for other graces to worke upon, God being upon
<pb facs="4"/>
the occasion of their dispute admirably set forth with powerfull and spirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legancy, and man abased in like manner, which to a considerate humble-hearted Reader will administer sweet occasions of reducing his graces sutable to such sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by the assistance of the spirit, into fresh acts and lively motions; the way to evidence his truth, and to further their growth.</p>
   <p>And, which I also desire the Reader to take prime notice of, he shal further see for his learning the strong consolation and undaunted courage that singlenesse and sincerity of heart (which in a word is, The animating and giving life to our dead works by doing them in conscience to God through faith and love) brings with it, even to the facing of God in an holy boldnesse (though through temptation <hi>Iob</hi> exceeded) by the faith of his Gospel, when he pleads against us his greatest severity, &amp; highest Majesty, and to the outfacing of all besides God, men or devils.</p>
   <p>Other flowers there are which a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb facs="5"/>
quick sensed Reader, will not lose the savour of, as he spends his time in this garden of God, whereto his spirit will guide him better then I can point him, and to which end I shall pray with the<note place="margin">Cant. 3. 16.</note> spouse for the spouse. Awake ô North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, and come thou South, blow upon my Garden, that the spices thereof may flow forth.</p>
