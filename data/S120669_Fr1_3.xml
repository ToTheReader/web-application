      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>
      <hi>Confused Ropsody of vaine, Idle conceipts:</hi> this is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Appendix Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, wherewith he hath rewarded me, for writing the <hi>Shismatical Puritan.</hi> I aimde at the conformity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Brethren, that Gods name might bee glorified by our Church through the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice of Christian vnity. I assure M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Prinne,</hi> If he bee the Author: that Causidicants, should be better Subiects to God, and to his Immediate Vicegerēt in these Churches, the King, than to be Prime de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of Breaking the peace of Orthodoxe Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But 'tis now, as our B. Lord and Sauiour hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied, <hi>There must be offences. Math.</hi> 18<seg rend="sup">th</seg>, <hi>but woe vnto the man, by whom they Come. Ver.</hi> 7. And <hi>there must be heresies, that they with are approoued; may be knowne.</hi> 1. Cor. 11, 19. <hi>There shalbe false Teachers, which shall priuily bring in damnable Heresies, denying the Lord, that bought them.</hi> 2. Pet. 2. 1. There must be offences, heresies, false Teachers. There must be, and are false Teachers. But yet here is one comfort in so great a misery: The False Teachers are not more learned, than M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Ignoramus, a young scholler, a stranger to Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicall Diuinitie.</p>
   <pb n="2" facs="4"/>
   <p> For his bold Censure of my <hi>Schismatical Puritan,</hi> I shall quickly prooue, that therein he proou'd himselfe to be very vnlearned. Or els without the helpe of a Conventicle he might haue giuen a better Censure. For the Preface, the Identity of a Puritan, that is not <hi>confus'd:</hi> but an infallible, and a perspicuous knowledge concerning the Schismatique so that a man may but read, and know, what kind of Puritan I vnderstand. For the Equivocates; the good, and euill Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, being distinguished, The Equiuocant, the Puritan, hath lost his amazing ambiguity; and then there is noe</p>
   <q>Pulchrum digito monstrari, &amp; dicier Hic est.</q>
   <p>Noe man will admire him for an holy, godly, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Professor. The boyes in the streete may poynt with their finger, which is the Honest, and which is the dissembling Puritan. Secondly, my definition of a <hi>fallacious Puritan</hi> is not confus'd, but so perfect, so distinct, so true, so intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as an Essentiall definition ought to be. There is the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Quid,</hi> What a Puritan is? A Protestant. There is the <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialis differentia Qualis,</hi> what manner a Protestant, a Puritan is? A Non-conformist. Thirdly <hi>the ten kinds of Puritans:</hi> this diuision is essentiall: For there are ten seuerall Puritanieties, by which one kind of Puritan distinctly differs from an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as you may read in my Preface. And my Sermon is not confus'd: 1. The Command: 2. The things Commanded: 3. The obseruing of the things Commanded: 4. The manner How, are without ambiguity, according to the rules of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and confirmation. Thus my booke is not confus'd And <hi>vaine, and Idle it is not,</hi> For the end thereof is necessary: <hi>viz:</hi> The Reformation of non-Conformists to the glory of God, and Preservation of his Church. This I intended though M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Prinne</hi> doth shut his eies, and will not see a truth manifestly visible. And a <hi>Rapsodie</hi> tis none, no song: no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of a song: no singing of a song. And I would to God, that there were noe canting tunes among the Factious. The truth is, that the <hi>Essentialls Essentiats</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>their modali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> haue confoumded the fanatique Professor, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen
<pb n="3" facs="4"/> his Chaire: and therefore he complaines of that confusion; yet being vnwilling to forsake a Bafling Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to the Eie of the world He brags, that my <hi>Schismatical Puritan is vaine, and idle.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It seemes that the Professor will neuer reforme: or els why is a book written against <hi>Bowing at the name of Iesus: an Appendix,</hi> a leane too, a similitude of the Howse buylt vpon the sands: Confus'd, vaine, and Idle stuffe. Ile assure you, that this is very Confus'd. For whereas M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Prinne should first haue distinguish'd the name <hi>Iesus</hi> to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten infallible knowledge in the Reader: He contrarily striues to teach, that the name <hi>Iesus</hi> is so ambiguos that sometimes tis not vnderstood. It is strange that a Pretender to learning should rather teach stumbling at a word, to cause confusion then encourage seekers after actuall knowledg to diue into the profound instructions of the wise: or else the distinction of the Right reverend, and learned Bp. <hi>Andrewes</hi> concerning the name <hi>Iesus</hi> might haue satisfied any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall capacity.</p>
   <p>Secondly M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Prinne</hi> is not confus'd only at handling the name <hi>Iesus,</hi> but in his <hi>materia Circa quam:</hi> in the substance of his booke. For he hath no explication of dutie towards <hi>Iesus,</hi> which he ought to haue had, if he will proue, <hi>ad par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> that Bowing at the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> is no duty of the text, and he hath no explication of the severall kinds of <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> which he ought to haue had for his private friends sake, that they might vnderstand, how that no ceremony is a duty of the text. Certainely a necessary an vniuersall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is a duty of the text; as a thing considered, bowing at the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> is both a dutie, and Ceremony; <hi>sed formaliter,</hi> for seuerall respects: as it tis a ceremony, tis not a duty; as tis a dutie tis non ceremony, as you shall learne hereafter.</p>
   <p>He is not only confus'd in handling the name <hi>Iesus,</hi> and in the <hi>substance</hi> of <hi>Appendix,</hi> but also in his Method. Let an vnderstanding man obserue his manner of dispute, and hee cannot but affirme that he is altogether vnworthy to teach,
<pb n="4" facs="5"/> or to contradict the Learned, and Conforming Professors of of our Church. His method is neither essentiall, nor demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratiue, and then it's not necessary. Ti's fit that it be knowne, what it is. It is a <hi>Delemma,</hi> whose two generall parts are grosse mistaks. First he chargeth <hi>Bishop Andrewes, M</hi>
      <seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Adams,</hi> the <hi>Sorbonists,</hi> and <hi>Rhemists,</hi> that they teach, that bowing at the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> is nothing els but a duty of the text The opposition of the 2 parts doth warrāt me, thus to write. Then He saith that <hi>Zanchius M</hi>
      <seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Hooker, D</hi>
      <seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Boyes,</hi> and <hi>M</hi>
      <seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Widdowes,</hi> defend this assertion, that bowing at the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> is but an indifferent, innocent, harmeles Ceremony: yet all these <hi>Bishop Andrewes</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Zanchius</hi> &amp;c. doe teach, that bowing at the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> is both a duty and Ceremony, which, how this can be, he is not able to vnderstand.</p>
   <p>He is so ignorant that he cannot tell whether all things haue their perculiar times. Hence it is, that he confounds the time of divine seruice with the time of swearing, and blaspheming with any sinfull time, when <hi>Iesus</hi> is named. He hath not learned the difference betweene a categoricall, and an exclusiue sense, and therefoer he is not a sham'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre; because the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Basil</hi> enjoyned Canonicall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to bowe at the name of <hi>Iesus:</hi> therefore only they did bowe at the name of <hi>Iesus.</hi> He is so wilfull in his opinion, that he denies (in the despight of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> and <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that either Primitiue Church; or any Reformed Church ought to bowe at the name of <hi>Iesus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>He perceiues not: that in or at the time, when <hi>Iesus</hi> is named every knee shall <hi>bow,</hi> are promiseuosly read. So it seemes that he is not a Grammarian. Notwithstanding all this ignorāce he so earnestly disputs, as if he would talke him selfe out of breath, or else what meanes his zealous Tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie? The argument of Souereignty is disputed six times at handling the meaneing of the text. The argument of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one name of <hi>Iesus</hi> before another is repeated 8 times six times in the third question twise in the fourth. The Arg of
<pb n="5" facs="5"/> bowing only to the name <hi>Iesus</hi> and not to the persō is dispu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted six times. The argument of preferring one person of the deity before the other is twise disputed. The argument that <hi>Iesus</hi> is the name only of Incarnatiō &amp;c. is disputed 5 times. That <hi>Iesus</hi> is not <hi>Iesus</hi> to the Deuils &amp;c. is disputed at rhe second and third Question. That bowing is only Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call is disputed foure times. That <hi>Lord</hi> is the name aboue every name disputed thrise.</p>
   <p>The metaphoricall sence of bowing he hath separated from the letter of of the text, and makes that to be the only manner of bowing at the name of <hi>Iesus. Philip.</hi> 2. 10. But he must Vnderstand, that there is a reall bowing, and more morall, then to be only metaphoricall, as it appeares at the end of his arguments answear'd concerning the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the text: where he hath confounded an exclusiue, with a compar'd sence. Thus: bowing at the last day &amp;c. is the only principall, and therefore t' is the only bowing at the name of <hi>Iesus:</hi> hence he hath falsified 15. scriptures. many primitiue fathers &amp; others: the nūber of them is but foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score <hi>Istos modos dicēdi: Per se: &amp; per accidēs</hi> those naturall, &amp; accidentall manner of speeches he confounds. Thus: <hi>some doe abuse Bowing at the name of Iesus,</hi> as papists, &amp; Ignorant Protestants: Therefore tis no harmeles ceremony. And he is so decent, so trimme in his arguments cōcerning the decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of bowing, that he confounds, Coordination, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination with contrarie opposition. Thus: <hi>Bowing with the heart, and bowing with the knee</hi> (which are subordinate) <hi>doe differ, therefore they are so contrary, as two contrary mast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. To read, &amp; bow; to heare, and bow &amp;c,</hi> are Coordinate du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: yet these with him are so contrarie, as that they <hi>cannot be done together without confusion.</hi> Now behold the strang learning of a monstrous learned Immethodist. Is he not rare for dispurations being so ignorant of modalities? Is he not excellent to teach our Chutch being so braue a Babe in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding?</p>
   <p>Againe his Appendix is vaine, and Idle. For in what the
<pb n="6" facs="6"/> holy Ghost doth seriously cōmend <hi>Iesus,</hi> that he neglects to remember. <hi>The Holy Ghosts</hi> reason, why all knees shall bow at the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> is: because <hi>Iesus tooke on him our nature, and then did so humbly demeane himselfe, that he died the death of the Crosse to saue his Enemies Ro.</hi> 5. 8. For this cause God honored <hi>Iesus</hi> so much, that he commands every knee to bow at his name. This is the scope of the text: and then is not <hi>M</hi>
      <seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Prinne,</hi> vaine, and idle in his conceipt, to suppose argumenrs, to contradict the good &amp; iust meaning of the Holy Ghost: who is that True teacher, that God is the Iust rewarder of <hi>Iesus</hi> his the greatest Humility? Is it not vaine, and an idle conceipt, for to thinke better of <hi>M</hi>
      <seg rend="sup">r</seg>, <hi>Prinns</hi> arguments, to cause no Bowing at <hi>Iesus</hi> his name. then of the Holy Ghosts dictate, which is <hi>Iesus</hi> his merit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to be, and Gods Exaltation of <hi>Iesus</hi> the causes, why every knee shall bow at the name of <hi>Iesus.</hi> It is vaine and idle to fight against God: this is the opinion of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> a D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. of the law <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 34. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39. yet so vaine: and so idle, the younger Lawier is, that he would rather that his arguments should be beliued then the most credible truth of the Holy Ghost. Here is a strange oppositiō. A Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian may and ought verily to beleiue, that a man should not dare thus to dispute against the Holy Ghost.</p>
   <p>What may be thought to be the cause that a man should grow so bold as to question the Holy Ghost for his doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine? Certainely the <hi>mystery of iniquitie</hi> is working a new worke. Thus. If this name <hi>(Iesus)</hi> were disrespected, not so publiquely magnified as tis by the outward mans Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, or at the time of divine service; then doubtles the Pure, Holy doctrine, and discipline of Elect <hi>Geneua</hi> shall be taught every where, to reforme this Church of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aine.</hi> Doe but dishonour the head of the Church, and then regenerate Geneuaters shall gouerne the church, the King, the Realmes, nay <hi>Iesus</hi> himselfe. If obiection be made, that the most Reuerend <hi>Arch Bishop Cranmer, the Right Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Bishop Ridley, Father Latimer,</hi> and other learned and
<pb n="7" facs="6"/> Holy Martyrs were burned into ashes, for their constant profession of the doctrine and discipline of this reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church. Answeare must be made, that the Holy Mother <hi>Geneua,</hi> hath better doctrine, and discipline, then <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Ridley,</hi> and <hi>Latimer</hi> ever knew. The doctrine and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, of faithfull <hi>Geneua,</hi> are all substance: they are all gold. Oh if that Religion were here administred▪ euery presbyter shall be greater than a Monarch, and euery Iustice of peace aboue the Presbyter. And were not this an Excellent Reformation; when the Children of the Church, her Subordinate Members shalbe made such Transcendent Princes? A daring phantastique superstition! The Honour of <hi>Iesus</hi> exalted farre aboue all Heauens must be nullified, to make Schismaticall Puritans, Kings. Imperious Holines!</p>
   <p>See a strange wonder: here is Lucifer-like pride in deede. The Deuills were cast out of Heauen <hi>Esay.</hi> 14. 14. for their pride, because they would not belieue in the Sonne of God, the Confirming Mediator of Angells: so the Schoolemen. And shall sly Professors then, be spared, seeing they will not Bow at the name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> which is a signe, that they doe not belieue in the Redeeming Sauiour?</p>
   <p>If a Lawie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> shall industriously write against the law, is it credible, that He is a Religious Obseruer, or a lawfull Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of the law? Where is the good Conscience, the Necessary Subiect of the higher Powers mentioned at <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5? This stands at the Barre, and alleageth Gods Heauenly law: <hi>All knees shall bow at the name of Iesus:</hi> and tis baffled with an Outery. <hi>A Reformation. A Reformation. To bow at the name of Iesus is Superstition. To bow at the name of Iesus is Superstition.</hi> The good Conscience desireth a pacificall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, but the violence of aspiring Spirites, will not endure to feare the truth: therefore I desire the Christian Reader to obserue the plea of a good conscience. Thus: The tie of Gods law, and of the Kings lawes deriu'd from Gods, is Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to binde all good Subiects vnto Obedience. First the text binds all Christians in faith to belieue, and in manners
<pb n="8" facs="7"/> to Bow at the name of <hi>Iesus:</hi> which I haue proou'd at handling this Question. <hi>Whether Bowing at the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, be a duty of the text?</hi> To second the text, our dread Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Lord, the King, hath foure lawes, to humble his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects in faith, and manners; to Bow at the name of <hi>Iesus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The first is the 20<seg rend="sup">th</seg> article of our Reformed faith, which <hi>is the Authority of the Church, to ordaine Rites, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> whereof Bowing at the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> is one, though it be commanded by God originally, yet in application to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme Non-conformists, tis the Churches Canon. Then by the Doctrine of our Reformed faith, Tis plaine, that we must bow at the name of <hi>Iesus.</hi> Because our Church-Authority hath decreed this Bowing (as you see) according to scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. The second is the 34 Article, which is the Traditions of the Church, and bowing at the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> being vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal is more necessary then those being particular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd thus; <hi>Whosoeuer through his priuate Iudgment, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and purposely doth openly breake the traditions of the Church &amp;c. ought to be rebuked openly (that others may feare, to doe the like) as he, that offendeth against the Common order of the Church, and woundeth the Conscience of the weake Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> Then tis plaine by the testimony of Orthodoxe faith, that all must bow at the name of <hi>Iesus Sub paenâ publicae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dargutionis</hi> vnder paine of open Rebuke. The third law is the 6<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Canon of our Church. The words are these. <hi>Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall here-after affirme, that the Rites, and Ceremonies of the Church of England by law Established, are wicked, Anti-Christian, or superstitious, or such, as being Commanded by lawfull Authority, men who are Zealously, and godlily affected, may not with any good conscience approue them, vse them, or as occasion requireth, subscribe vnto them, let him be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated ipso sacto, and not restored, vntill he repents, and publiquely revokes such his wicked errors.</hi> Then by vertue of this Canon, he that writes against Bowing at the name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> should be taught better manners. He should be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to Satan by his Diocesan, for to tame his fleshly, and
<pb n="9" facs="7"/> diuision-making faction in the Church, to teach him, and his priuate friends Canonicall obedience. And tis very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so to doe for transgressing the 18<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Canon, which is the 4. law. The words are these. <hi>When in time of Diuine seruice, the Lord Iesus shalbe mentioned, due, and lowly Reverence shalbe done by all persons present, as it hath beene accustomed: Testifying by these outward Ceremonies and Gestures their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Humility, Christian Resolution, and due acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Lord Iesus Christ the True, and Eternall sonne of God, is the only Sauiour of the world, in whom alone all the mercies, Grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> That
<pb n="10" facs="8"/> bowing at the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> is nothing. His suppositious prooffes to defend this Erroneous despightfull Hypothesis, are two. Thus: bowing at the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> is neither a duty of the text, nor an arbitrary, harmelesse, and decent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</p>
   <p>If you will see <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Prinne</hi> in full view of his colours you must obserue these foure questions. First <hi>whether bowing at the name of Iesus be some thing? Secondly whether bowing at the name of Iesus be a duty according to the letter of Phil.</hi> 2. 10? 3<seg rend="sup">ly</seg>. <hi>whether bowing at the name of Iesus be a dutie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Reall meaning of the text? Fourthly whether Bowing at the name of Iesus be an Arbitrary, Harmles, and Decent Ceremony?</hi> This is the substance of the appendix. Here you shall see his Imperious, Daring boldnes against our Church.</p>
   <q>Difficile est Satyram non scribere——</q>
   <p>Who can endure his High looke, and his proud stom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke? although tis true, that neglect had beene answeare good enough for his confus'd matter and method; for his vaine, and idle suppositions: yet the vnlearned may ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value his <hi>Anti-Iesus-Appendix.</hi> But reason there is none, why any one should regard such an irregular non-licet. Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue authoritie he hath none to teach: for he is no publique Ecclesiasticall Priest: and learned Iudicious charitie he hath none: for learned and charitable faith will not breake the peace of established Religion; of Religion established ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Canonicall scripture. I would to God, that he had taken counsell of his Colledg-moderator▪ then friendly Suppression should haue buried this vntimely fruite. But to what purpose is it to wish him good, that wisheth so litle peace to the Church? There is nothing to be done by me for him, but to pray for him, and confute his arguments, that the weake in faith be not shaken, nor troubled, and that he be not in loue with his great sinne committed against the Lord, &amp; his Church. So let the stiffe-necked, &amp; stiffe-kneede be made to know themselues to be but men, but erroneous men: and that <hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Lord,</hi> at whose name their knees
<pb n="11" facs="8"/> must bow, now in the time of grace. I pray God, giue all them, that loue the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> so much pietie, as that they ever worship him, not only inwardly with the heart, but joyntly with soule, and body▪ with heart, and knee that at the last day the whole church may enjoy his Glorious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction. Thus I continue,</p>
