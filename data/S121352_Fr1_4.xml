   <head>TO OVR BELOVED IN THE LORD THE BRETHREN OF ENGLAND, Scotland, Ireland, &amp;c. Grace, mercie and peace, through Christ Iesus.</head>
   <p>BEsides the manifolde and continuall benefites whiche almyghtie God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth vpon vs, bothe corporall and spirituall, we are especially bounde [deare brethren] to giue him thankes without ceasing for hys great grace and vnspeakable mercies, in that it hathe pleased hym to call vs vnto this meruelous lyght of his Gospel, and mercifully to regarde vs after so horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble back esliding and falling away from CHRIST to ANTICHRIST, from lyght to darcknes, from the liuing God to dumme and dead idoles, and that after so cruell murther of Gods Saintes, as alas, hathe bene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, we are not altogether cast of, as were the Israelites, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for the like, or not so manifest wickednes, but receiued againe to gra ce with moste euident signes and tokens of Gods especialloue and fauour. To the intent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we may not be vnmyndefull of these greate merecies, but seke by all meanes [accordyng to ourduetie] to be thank efull for the same, it behoueth vs so to walke in his feare and loue, that all the dayes of our life we maye procure the glorie of his holy name. Now forasmuche as thys th ing chefely is atteyned by the knollage and practising of the worde of God [which is the light to our paths, the keye of the kyngdome of heauen, our comforte in affliction, our shielde and sworde against Satan, the schoole of all wisdome, the glasse wherein we beholde Gods face, the testimonie of his fauour, and the only foode and nourishement of our soules] we thoght that we colde bestowe our labours and studie in nothyng whiche colde be more acceptable to God and comfortable to his Church then in the translating of the holy Scriptures into our natiue tongue: the which thing, albeit that diuers heretofore haue indeuored to atchieue: yet consideryng the infancie of those tymes and imperfect knollage of the tongues, in respect of thys rype age and cleare light whiche God hath now reueiled, the translations required greatly to be perused and reformed. Not that we vendicat anything to our selues aboue the least of our brethren [for God knoweth wyth what feare &amp; tremblyng we haue bene nowe, for the space of two yeres &amp; more daye and nyght occupied herein] but beyng earnestly desired, and by diuers, whose learnyng and godlines we reuerence, exhorted, and also incouraged by the ready willes of suche, whose hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes God lyke wise touched, not to spare any charges for the fortherance of suche a benefite and fauour of God towarde his Churche [thogh the tyme then was moste dangerous and the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution sharpe and furious] we submitted our selues at length to their godly iudgementes, and seing the great oportunitie and occasions, whiche God presented vnto vs in this Church, by rea son of so many godly and learned men: and suche diuersities of translations in diuers tongues, we vnder toke this great and wonderful worke [with all reuerence, as in the presence of God, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating the worde of God, whereunto we thinke ourselues vnsufficient] whiche nowe God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his diuine prouidence and mercie hath directed to a moste prosperous end. <q>And this we may with good conscience protest, that we haue in euery point and worde, accordyng to the, measure of that knollage whiche it pleased almightie God to giue vs, faithfully rendred the text, and in all hard places most syncerely expounded the same</q>. For God is our witnes that we haue, by al meanes indeuored to set forthe the puritie of the worde and right sense of the holy Gost for the edifying of the brethren in faith and charitie.</p>
   <p>Now as we haue chiefely obserued the sense, and laboured alwayes to restore it to all integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: so haue we most reuerently kept the proprietie of the wordes, considering that the Apostles who spake and wrote to the Gentiles in the Greke tongue, rather constrayned them to the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly phrase of the Ebrewe, then entreprised farre by mollifying their langage to speake as the Gen tiles did. And for this and other causes we haue in many places reserued the Ebrewe phrases, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that they may seme somewhat hard in their eares that are not wel practised and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so delite in the swete sounding phrases of the holy Scriptures. Yet lest ether the simple shulde be discouraged, or the malicious haue any occasion of iust cauillation, seing some translations read after one sort, and some after another, whereas all may serue to good purpose and edification, we haue in the margent noted that diuersitie of speache or readyng whiche may also seme agreable to the mynde of the holy Gost and propre for our langage with this marke".</p>
   <p>Againe where as the Ebrewe speache semed hardly to agre with ours, we haue noted it in the margent after thys sorte", vsing that whiche was more intelligible. And albeit that many of the Ebrewe names be altered from the olde texte, and restored to the true writing and first original, whereof they haue their signification, yet in the vsual names litle is changed for feare of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyng the simple readers. Moreouer whereas the necessitie of the sentence required any thyng to be added [for suche is the grace and proprietie of the Ebrewe and Greke tongues, that it can
<pb facs="4"/>
not but ether by circumlocution, or by adding the verbe or some worde be vnderstand of them that are not wel practised therein] we haue put in the text with another kynde of lettre, that it may easely be discerned from the common lettre. As touching the diuision of the verses, we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue followed the Ebrewe examples, which haue so euen from the beginnyng distinct thē. Which thing as it ismoste profitable for memorie: so doeth it agre with the best translations, &amp; is moste easie to finde out both by the best Concordances, and also by the cotations which we haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently herein perused and set forth by this starre*. Besides this the principal matters are noted and distincted by this marke. ¶ Yea and the arguments both for the booke and for the chapters with the nombre of the verse are added, that by all meanes the reader might be holpen. For the which cause also we haue set ouer the head of euery page some notable worde of sentence whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che may greatly further aswel for memorie, as for the chief point of the page And considering how hard a thing it is to vnderstand the holy Scriptures, ād what errors, sectes &amp; heresies growe dailie for lacke of the true knollage thereof, and how many are discouraged [as they pretend] because they can not atteine to the true ād simple meaning of the same, we haue also indeuored bothe by the diligent reading of the best commentaries, and also by the conference with the godly and learned brethren, to gather brief annotations vpon all the hard places, aswel for the vnderstanding of suche wordes as are obscure, and for the declaration of the text, as for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the same as may moste apperteine to Gods glorie and the edification of his Church Forthermore whereas certeyne places in the bookes of Moses, of the Kings and Ezekiell semed so darke that by no description they colde be made easie to the simple reader, we haue so set them forthe with figures and notes for the ful declaration thereof, that they whiche can not by iudgement, being holpen by the annotations noted by the lettres a b c, &amp;c. atteyn thereunto, yet by the perspectiue, and as it were by the eye may sufficiently knowe the true meaning of all suche places. Whereunto also we haue added certeyne mappes of Cosmographie which neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarely serue for the perfect vnderstanding and memorie of diuers places and countreys, partely described, and partely by occasion touched, bothe in the olde and newe Testament. Finally that nothing might lacke which might be boght by labors, for the increase of knowlage and forthe rance of Gods glorie, we haue adioyned two moste profitable tables, the one seruing for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Ebrewe names: and the other conteyning all the chefe and principal matters of the whole Bible: so that nothing [as we trust] that any colde iustely desire, is omitted. Therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, as brethrē that are partakers of the same hope and saluatiō with vs, we beseche you, that this riche perle and inestimable treasure may not be offred in vayne but as sent from God to the people of God, for the increase of his kingdome, the comfort of his Churche, and discharge of our conscience, whome it hath pleased him to raise vp for this purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, so you wolde willingly receyue the worde of God, earnestly studie it and in all your life practise it, that you may now appeare in dede to be the people of God, not walking any more according to this worlde, but in the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the Spirit, that God in vs may be fully glorified through Christ Iesus our Lord, who lyueth and reigneth for euer. Amen.</p>
