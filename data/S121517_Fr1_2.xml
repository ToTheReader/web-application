father Time. All morall
Phylosophie is diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
three parts; Ethicall,
Oeconomicall and Politicall. All Law
is reduced to three heads; to the Law
of Nature, to ancient custome, and to
the ordinances of men. And to insist in
our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>wne state: All our Parliaments
consist of three sorts of people, Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
Cleargie, and Comminaltie. And
all our tryals and iudgements are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
after three formes and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
by Parliament, by Battell, and
by the great Assise: So all the force of
wit may flow within three chanels, and
bee contriued into three heads; into a
Sentence, a Similitude, &amp; an Example.
<hi>Carolus</hi> said, that warres were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with victuals, money and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours:
so Wit is nourished with
<pb facs="3"/>
Sentences▪ Similitudes, and Examples.
And therefore as three things are
necessarie for a Scholler; a Will, a
Wit and a Booke: so I hold that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
Similitudes, and Examples,
are as necessarie to vphold a Wit. <hi>Iulius
Caesar</hi> vsed to carry three things about
with him, when he followed the wars;
his pen to write the whole course of the
Romanes successe in their warres; his
Bookes to find himselfe occupied, and
his Launce to repulse his enemies: so
he that would write or speake pithily,
perspicuously, and persuasiuely must
vse to haue at hand in readinesse, three
kind of orn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ments and effectuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,
Sentences, Similitudes, and
Examples. Wherefore as <hi>Pythagoras</hi>
wished three things for himselfe;
Health, Beautie and Riches: so I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the necessitie and excellency of
these three heads, haue long wished the
accom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ishment &amp; publication of them.
And in truth what can I desire more,
then to see the naked Truth arrayed in
Sentences, fitting the tast of Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers;
inuested in Similitudes, loued
of Oratours; and approued by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb facs="3"/>
the rule and leuell of the vnstayed
and raging multitude? Saint▪ <hi>Augustine</hi>
desired to see three things, <hi>Paulus Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius</hi>
triumphing; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and <hi>Christ</hi> vpon the Crosse; in the
first, hee desired to see the glory of the
earth; in the second the glorie of the
Gospell▪ and in the third, the glorie
of Heauen: so haue I long desired to see
three things; Truthes soundnesse in
Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ences, her elegancie in Similituds,
and approbation by examples. And
now I haue my wished desire. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I may reioyce for three things, as
<hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> reioyced.
Hee ioyed; that hee had wonne the
Games at <hi>Olympus</hi> by the running of
his Chariots; that his Captaine <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio</hi>
had ouerthrowne the <hi>Dardari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
and that his wife <hi>Olympia</hi> had
borne him a Sonne, called <hi>Alexander:</hi>
So I exceedingly reioyce, and am glad
at my heart, that the first part of <hi>Wits
Common-wealth,</hi> contayning Sentences,
hath like a braue Champion gloriously
marched and got such renowned fame
by swift running, equiualent with
<hi>Philips</hi> Chariots, that thrice within
<pb facs="4"/>
one yeare it hath runne thorow the
Presse. If this second part of mine, called
<hi>Wits Common-wealth</hi> contayning Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes,
being a stalke of the same
stemme, shall haue the like footman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and find the same successe, then
with <hi>Parmenio</hi> I shall be the second in
<hi>Philips</hi> ioy. And then <hi>Philips</hi> ioy will
eft-soones be full, for his <hi>Alexander,</hi>
whom not <hi>Olympia,</hi> but a worthy
Scholler is conceiuing, who wil fill the
third part of <hi>Wits Common-wealth</hi> with
moe glorious Examples, then great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
did the world with valiant &amp;
heroicall exploits. <hi>Lampedo</hi> is iudged
happy for euer, as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, for
three causes; for that she was a Kings
Daughter, a Kings Wife, and a Kings
Mother. <hi>Thales</hi> to one that asked him,
who was happy, said; <hi>Quicorpore sanus
est, fortuna diues, animo eruditus:</hi> So
I iudge him of an happy Wit, who is
profound and substantiall in Sentences;
eloquence and ingenious in Similituds;
and rich and copious in Examples.</p>
   <p>The first part being published some
yeares agoe, hath had the worlds fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and furtherance, which hath made
<pb facs="4"/>
him so cranke, young and fresh, that
thrice in one yeare hee hath renued his
age, a spring more then is in fruitfull
<hi>Saba.</hi> If this second part may find as
much fauour and countenance with you
gentle Reader, as <hi>Antimachus</hi> the Poet
found with <hi>Plato,</hi> it shall bee <hi>instar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>omnium</hi>
to me, and therewith conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I shall willingly send this second
with the first, to take what fortune
Wit will send him. Which I hope and
wish may bee as kindly accepted, as I
doe heartily offer them. Which if I
shall perceiue, neuer was <hi>Aristotle</hi>
more gratefull to <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor
<hi>Enuius</hi> to <hi>Scipio,</hi> nor <hi>Virgill</hi> to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi>
nor <hi>Horace</hi> to <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> nor
<hi>Pliny</hi> to <hi>Vespasian,</hi> nor <hi>Plutarch</hi> to
<hi>Traian,</hi> then I shall bee to you gentle
Reader; whom I beseech the Highest
to blesse with increase of vertuous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
in the mind, with augmentation
of dignitie in the world, and with
perpetuitie of e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>erlasting felicitie in
