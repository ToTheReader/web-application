   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, IOHN Lord <hi>Mordant,</hi> Earle of Peterborough.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His little Volume falling into my hands, and finding therein so much ancient cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, liberalitie, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence; and <hi>Phalaris</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in another shape,
<pb facs="3"/>than that, which is given by such Historians as have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him; who (either swayed with the universall hatred, wherwith all men (almost) in those times were possessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as subdued a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Government under the command of one man) painted him for one of the most cruell and bloudie Tyrants of the world; Or the age wherein he lived, being of such antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that few write with truth or certainty his actions, which
<pb facs="3"/>were many and variable, yet obscured by the iniquitie of time, hath appeared unto my fancie, as an ancient Statue found by chance in some rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned place of old <hi>Rome;</hi> which although it bee defective by losse, or breach of some part or member, yet there appeareth in it such a lively expression of shape, strength, or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; that it is esteemed in a farre higher degree, than the most curious peece of the most excellent worke-man of this
<pb facs="4"/>time. And although these are in a plaine stile, savouring of antiquitie; yet doe they so far set forth the condition of the man; that I think no Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, unlesse inwardly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, could so lively character him, as the many expressions herein, of his high magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, fidelity, and other roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vertues: Amongst which, if any curstnesse or rather cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of nature appear; it serves to confirme as a truth: <hi>That attempts against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb facs="4"/>of a Prince, for the most part doe change his nature (though good with the best of men) into suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and cruelties, and never or seldome faile to ruine the attempters.</hi> From hence my desire hath raised my boldnesse; with the best of my endevours, by conference with my great Masters in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall (for I confesse my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute ignorance therein,) and by comparing of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in three severall Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
<pb facs="5"/>to render them in our English tongue, as neere as I can in their ancient and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall plainenesse, without the polishing of these times; and to expose it to a publike view, under your Lordships patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; to whom for your noble favours, freely, aptly, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly done, I doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my selfe uncapable of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repayment: And doe therefore intreat you, my Lord, to accept thereof, as a pledge, that nothing but a
<pb facs="5"/>hard winter, hath diverted into unknowne paths my feet (though never the eye of my affection) from waiting upon your service. And the better to assure your Honour therof; If J may perceive, that this manuel findeth grace in your eyes; I shall be bold, with all convenient speed, to offer to your hands a peece of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other nature, not yet finished, through the constraint of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant interruption; But if otherwayes, I will give stop
<pb facs="6"/>both to the birth and life thereof; The giving you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in any thing I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake in this kinde, being the principall end of</p>
