      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, this Treatise was neither fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
nor polished by the Author: He left it
with mee when hee died, to bee dealt
with as cause should require; vpon perusall,
I found it fit for the time, so full of lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> so sound &amp; cleere
in proofe, that in my conceit it will doe much good: and
here thou hast it, as he left it. The argument is of all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference
betwixt vs and Papists the chiefest, no contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie
more disputed, and lesse agreed vpon then this.
Christ and his bloud is the maine cause of our spirituall
peace; Papists and others diuide with him, and take
something to themselues: the spirituall pride that is in
the heart of man, would faine haue a finger in the work
of saluation, of other controuersies betwixt vs &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
party: some befor the Popes Kitchin, some for the
Popes crowne, but this of our Iustification, toucheth the
life of Grace to the quicke, breeds more in our flesh then
any, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se sicknesses are most dangerous, that come
from within. It is a fundamentall case, wherein to faile,
takes away the essence of a Christian: Wherefore sith
there is now such need to haue the world confirmed in
this truth of God, I thought good to send this booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
wherein this is put out of question to any man of
a single eie; that we are not iustified by any thing wee
any thing we can doe or suffer.</p>
   <p>Many write bookes, and confute them themselues
when they haue done; but this our Author what hee
wrote, he beleeued; for being to die, he confirmed this
Truth, in a discoursefull of life and power, and professed
<pb facs="5"/>
to take his last vpon it, that it was the very truth of
God. Wee reade that some learned Papists, when they
are to giue vp the ghost, disclaime their owne merits,
and would faine finde all in Christ alone: but this our
Author did it before sundry, with that life, and feeling,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> cleare apprehension of the loue of God in his Sonne,
that such is heard him, and loued him well and long,
could not well tel, whether they should weepe, or reioice;
weepe, to see a friend die, reioyce to see him die so. Good
Reader, learne this holy instruction out of this booke:
that we are not to be found in our owne righteousnes at
all, and beleeue it; thou shalt haue as he had, peace pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all vnderstanding, in life, and in death, for being
iustified by saith (not by workes) we haue peace with
God saith Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> If any ingenuous learned Papist
would vndertake to answer this booke, me thinkes I
might prophecy that as <hi>Vergezi{us}</hi> (Bishop of Capo d' Istria,
and Nuncio to <hi>Clement</hi> the seuenth, and <hi>Paul</hi> the
third) reading <hi>Luther,</hi> to answere <hi>Luther,</hi> was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and had his soule saued. And as <hi>Pighius,</hi> tho of a
peeuish Spirit enough, yet reading <hi>Caluin,</hi> to confute
<hi>Caluin,</hi> was in the very doctrine of Iustification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
himselfe, and wrote with vs. So I say, would a
modest Papist read this booke to reply vnto it, he could
not but see the truth, and yeeld vnto it. For tho many
have done excellently in this argument, yet to speake
my opinion freely, at least for perspicuitie, this surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them all. Farewell.</p>
