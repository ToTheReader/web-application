   <head>TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER in God RICHARD, by the grace of God Archbishop of Canterbury, one of his Maiesties most Honorable Privie Councell, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the Vniversitie of Oxford, Primate of all England, and Metropolitane.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AY it please your <hi>Grace</hi> to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that although, being so little knowne to your Grace as I am, it may seem that I make over bold, so to present this Treatise ensuing: yet, as my selfe am persuaded, divers good reasons there be, that doe occasion me, so farre this once to presume on your Graces goodnes therein; both in respect of a former interest, and of the present matter besides.</p>
   <p>The former interest that now I speake of, is, that by the place that then he was in, your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces immediate Predecessor, had this Treatise in
<pb facs="3"/>
his hands a good while together, many yeeres since; and to be his, if so it should stand with his Graces pleasure: and afterward, when hee saw his time, approued of the publishing of it, and so to doe at mine owne discretion. Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing (by occasion) I thought not so good, thē presently to doe, as to awaite a farther opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which then began to offer it selfe vnto mee. In the meane season it hath pleased God▪ to take him of from his labours and travells here, and thus otherwise to furnish the roome that he had. In which alteration, besides that no way I haue any cause to varie: I may not deny, but that now I finde iuster cause so to proceed, then I had in the other before.</p>
   <p>In the present matter besides, it is very plaine, that there is some question of it: &amp; then are such Treatise as are thereof, in bounden duty to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waite the censure of such other approued iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as to whome in such case it doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Wherein it having hitherto orderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to that wherevnto it is come already, it was meetest so to finish the course likewise: &amp; so actually to acknowledge, that arising here, &amp; hence proceeding, it was most to submit it selfe vnto, and to await your Graces censure.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>It may be also, that even in godly pollicie (by our Superiors) it will be thought meete, to take some farther order to prevēt the evill, that so free a passage of that other course may seem to threa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten: &amp; thē, the better opportunity that God hath givē your G. to such purpose, the lesse could I in any duty or reasō haue turn'd aside to any other.</p>
   <p>God long preserue your Grace among vs, to the glorie of God, to the good of his Church, &amp; to your owne comfort withall in him. </p>
