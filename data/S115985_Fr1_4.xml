   <p>THE
TRANSLATOVRS
PREFACE
TO HIS READER.</p>
   <p>AMongst many people
Apostolically conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Fayth of
Christ, the <hi>Britans</hi> or
ancient Inhabitants of England,
are vndoubtedly to be numbred,
as <hi>Origen 4. in Ezechielem, Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
contra Iudaeos, Dorotheus</hi> in his
<hi>Synopsis, Theodoret,</hi> and others
haue expresly affirmed, besides
many home proofes, and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
testimonies of that their so
<pb facs="6"/>
timely conuersion. Which primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Fayth of theirs hauing byn,
by a continuall mixture of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
and other Infidells liuing
amongst them, and persecuting
them for the same, exceedingly
decayed; was againe cultiuated
by <hi>Fugatius,</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall
Preachers, sent for that
purpose by Pope <hi>Elutherius</hi> vnto
them, the very next age after the
Apostles.</p>
   <p>Since which tyme albeit they
lost to the Saxons, the greatest, &amp;
fruitefullest part of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and were enforced to betake
themselues to the mountanous
places of <hi>Wales</hi> (as now it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led)
and <hi>Cornewall;</hi> yet haue they
still vntill this last age, vnalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
maintayned their primitiue
Fayth, and Religion, as in the first
<pb facs="6"/>
two Chapters of the Protestants
Apology for the Roman Church,
written by that learned man <hi>M.
Brerely,</hi> is most cleerly proued, &amp;
demonstrated.</p>
   <p>And to recompence perhaps,
their Constancy therein, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
for it, they were blessed
from tyme to tyme with great
numbers of <hi>Saintes,</hi> flourishing
amongst them; so as many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
in <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Cornewall,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
no other names at this day,
then such as anciently they recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from holy Men and Women
liuing in them. Amongst all
which no one was for sanctity &amp;
miraculous testimonies thereof,
more then <hi>S. Wenefride</hi> famously
renowned; and her Monuments
now after a generall vastation of
Monasteries, and Saintes memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb facs="7"/>
in our Countrey, remayne
vndefaced, and no lesse glorious
in <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> then <hi>S. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therines</hi>
Tombe on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi>
amongst fierce <hi>Mahometans</hi> and
<hi>Paynims,</hi> is straungely, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.</p>
   <p>And as the Sepulcher of that
renowned Saint, is by faithfull
people in those Easterne parts of
the world Religiously visited: so
in like manner do multitudes of
holy Pilgrims frequently now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
vnto the place of <hi>S. Wenefrids</hi>
martyrdome, &amp; wonder to see
such a floud of Cristall pure Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tēr
gushing there at once, out of
the Earth, and a most sumptuous
Chappell standing yet ouer it. So
that the three Fountaynes neere
<hi>Rome,</hi> which issued miraculously
out of the ground, where <hi>S. Paul</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
was martyred, are not by much so
curiously with building couered.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, the waters of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Well, seeme to haue in thē more
then naturall vertues, by giuing
a musky, and most delightfull
sweetnes to the greene mosse
growing on the wals of this sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
inclosure, and colouring all
the stones which lye in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
thereof, with spots, as it
were, of pure bloud, in them
strangly appearing. Many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
also haue ben done heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to manifest the sanctity of
this place; which because they
haue not ben by depositions of
persons sworne, and publique In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
authentically appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
I forbeare heere further to
mention, then as my Authour
doth afterwards recount them;
<pb facs="8"/>
and will only say, that this Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and Costly monument, is
the more to be admired, for that
it standeth in so hilly, poore, and
barten a Countrey, which hath
scarsly any thing, but this fayre
building remarkable in it, exactly
therefore drawne out by <hi>M. Speed</hi>
in his Table of <hi>Flint-shyre,</hi> and in
his Comment historically decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
yet with this tale ridiculously
added, that Catholiques visiting
the <hi>Well,</hi> do really belieue the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the stones to be the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
very bloud, and the Mosse
growing therein her hayre, like
to one of <hi>Ouids</hi> Metamorphosing
Fables.</p>
   <p>The Life of this Noble Virgin
and Martyr, was diligently and
authentically gathered (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in his Prologue professeth)
<pb facs="8"/>
by <hi>Robertus Salopiensis,</hi> a learned
Monke and <hi>Priour</hi> of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi>
of the holy order of S. Benedict,
liuing in King <hi>Stephens</hi> tyme, &amp;
for his great sincerity, by <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Baronius, Surius, Capgraue, Pits,
Posseuinus,</hi> and others, worthily
commended. Whose booke cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
truly out of an old authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Manuscript, I haue heere in
sense faithfully translated, and
done no otherwise in altering the
Authors old phrases, scarsely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
in good English, then as
if I had stripped some body out of
Welsh course frize, and put him
into a suite of English playne
Karesay.</p>
   <p>And if the matter of the Booke,
conteyning in it sundry strange
and miraculous passages, shall
seeme ridiculous to <hi>Protestants</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/>
chancing to read them, it is not
much to be wondred at, sithence
they will be their owne choosers,
euen in the very beliefe of sacred
Verities themselues, diuinely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed;
and sleight, as fabulous
Legends, the Liues of Saintes,
written by <hi>S. Athanasius, S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi>
S. <hi>Hierome, S. Climachus, S.
Gregory,</hi> and other holy Fathers.</p>
   <p>It sufficed my Author, and so it
shall me, that deuout Catholiques
for whose instruction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
he penned first his Historie,
will piously and probably assent
to that, which heere is credibly
proposed vnto them, auoyding
two extremes therein; the one is
of belieuing things ouerlightly, &amp;
the other of belieuing nothing at
all but as fancies, and selfe-opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
do guide them. The which,
<pb facs="9"/>
in Sectaries following commonly
this latter extreme in their iudg-ment
of Catholique writings, is
a kind of Infidelity, and Impiety
mixed togeather: for if God be
wonderfull in his Saintes (as the
Royall Prophet telleth vs, <hi>Psal.</hi>
67.) and Christ in his Ascension
towards heauen did so expresly
promise, that these signes should
follow such as did belieue in him,
<hi>In my name</hi> (said he) <hi>they shall cast
out Diuells, they shall speake with
new tongues &amp;c.</hi> why should we
vpon probable testimonies refuse
to belieue, such wonders to haue
ben done by Saintes, as diuine te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifications
of their true Fayth,
and great graces heere obtayned?</p>
   <p>The sacred body of this Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Blessed Saint, was solemnly
translated to <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> in this
<pb facs="10"/>
Authors tyme in the yeare of our
Lord 1138. and raigne of <hi>K. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi>
and there, in his owne Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
magnificently interred, that
greater honour and veneration,
in so populous, and Religious a
Citty (as that was then) might be
yielded vnto it; where it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
for aboue 400. yeares, till
Heresie preuayled vtterly to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
in our Country the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
profession of Catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and deface the Venerable
monuments thereof euery where
almost then extant. In which cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ruine &amp; calamity hapning,
the shrine of this great Saint with
numbers of others became sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiously
defaced, and her sacred
Reliques lye since dispersed God
knoweth where or how, vntill by
his omnipotency, they shall come
<pb facs="10"/>
to be vnited againe, &amp; most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
raysed, <hi>For God</hi> (sayth the
same holy Prophet <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.) <hi>doth
conserue all the bones of his seruants:</hi>
and it hath increased I doubt not
their ioyes accidentall in heauen,
to haue had heere on earth for his
sake, their Reliques by the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
enemies, and haters of true
Religion contemptuously abused,
after due Reuerence yeilded by
deuout people vnto them, and
singular blessings receaued from
Almighty God by their powerfull
intercession.</p>
   <p>Neither haue moderne Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
shewed in any one act more,
the little Communion, which
they haue in this world, or are
likely to haue in the other, with
the Saintes of Christs Church,
then in contemning, scattering,
<pb facs="11"/>
and destroying their Reliques,
of which in generall <hi>S. Ambrose</hi>
writeth thus, <hi>Serm. 93. de Sanctis
Nazario &amp; Celso. If thou aske me
what I honour in their flesh and bones
now dissolued and consumed? I honour
in the Martyrs flesh, the scarres of
those woundes, which for Christ he
susteyned; I honour the memory of his
vertue still liuing; I honour in his
ashes the seedes of Eternity; I honour
the body that taught me to loue Christ,
and not to feare the cruellest death for
him. Why should not faithfull soules
honour that body, which Diuells trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>quod Christum honorauit
in gladio, quod cum Christo regnabit
in caelo: that body, I say, which hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Christ in the sword, and which
shall reigne with him in Heauen.
These</hi> (sayth <hi>S. Basill</hi> speaking of
the 40. Martyrs Reliques) <hi>are those
<pb facs="11"/>
who protect our Countrey, and like
strong Towers guard vs from our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Wherefore I may vse, of such
as scattered, and destroyed the
holy reliques of <hi>S.Wenefride,</hi> and
many other Saintes in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<hi>S. Gregory Nazianzens</hi> words
in his first Oration against <hi>Iulian</hi>
the Apostata; <hi>Thou hast not reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
the Hoastes slaine for Christ,
whose bodies, yea very drops of their
bloud, or other small signes of their
passions, can worke the same effects
which their soules themselues can doe;</hi>
to wit such sudaine cures of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and diseases, as <hi>S. Austin lib.</hi>
22. <hi>de Ciuitate Dei cap.</hi> 8. affirmeth
by <hi>S. Stephens</hi> Reliques, as they
passed through <hi>Afrique</hi> towards
<hi>Rome,</hi> to haue byn done in his
presence: which Protestants will
<pb facs="12"/>
as little belieue, as they do the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
passages of <hi>S. Wenefride</hi>
recounted in this Historie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
whome there is no one
so straunge, but the like may be
found in other Saintes liues, by
holy &amp; ancient Fathers authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
written; and in some of
them far more straunge: which
piously read, &amp; probably belieued
by faithful soules for 1400. yeares
since, cannot but temerariously be
reiected now, and contemned by
Protestants; whose corrupt Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as I regard not in this my
translation: so I hope good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
will read it with edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and comfort. For it may
well delight them, as it doth me,
to thinke that we haue anciently
had such store of renowned Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
liuing in our Country, as, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb facs="12"/>
this life, <hi>D. Harpsfeld,</hi> the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Martyrologe, Prudentiall
Ballance, <hi>M. Broughton,</hi> and other
ancienter historians do witnesse,
though the Names, and liues of
the greatest part of them are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the booke of life registred,
and will in the generall Iudgmēt
be gloriously reuealed.</p>
   <p>That <hi>S. Wenefride</hi> likewise,
should liue againe, after her head
cut off, and do the things which
heere are written of her in her
Historie (the chiefe blocke which
incredulous Readers perhaps will
stumble at) is no more hard to
be belieued, then that <hi>Lazarus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had ben dead, and stinking
in his graue, should liue agayne,
sit at table with Christ, and be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Marsills in <hi>France</hi> many
yeares after. And if it be obiected
<pb facs="13"/>
that Christ himselfe, did worke
that miracle, able to do all things:
I may well answere, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
his owne power, and far
greater wonders then himselfe
had wrought, to be done by his
seruants, extant now in authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
Histories as certainely since
performed.</p>
   <p>Lastly, I intreat my courteous
Reader, for a Conclusion of this
my Preface, to note &amp; mend with
his penne, these ensuing errours
of my Translation, committed in
the printing by strangers, wholy
ignorant of our English tongue.</p>
