      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the tyme is an inuenter of nouelties, and a register certayne of thynges aunciente, and at the ende tyme gyueth ende to that suffrethe ende: The trouthe all onely amonge all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is priuileged, in suche wyse, that whanne the tyme semethe to haue broken her wynges, than as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall she taketh her force. There is nothynge so entier, but it diminisheth, nor nothynge so hole, but that is wery, nor nothynge so strong, but that it breaketh, nor nothyng so wel kept, but that it corrupteth. Soo all these thynges tyme acheueth and burieth, but onely trouthe, the whiche (of the tyme and of all thynge that is in the tyme) trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth. Neyther to be fauoured of the good, nor to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted of the yll, may be, but that somtyme trouth may be stopped and hydde, but whan it is displeased, and wyl dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please, than at the laste she commeth to a good porte, and taketh londe. The fruites in the spryngyng tyme haue not the vertue to gyue sustenaunce nor perfyte swetenesse to satisfie the taste of them that eatetth therof: but thanne passeth the season of sommer, and haruest comethe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che tyme dothe better rype them, and thanne that that we doo eate dothe profyte vs, the profe therof is ryghte saue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynesse, and gyuethe the more force and vertue, and the greatter is the taste. I wyll in these fyrste wordes saye, that in the fyrste aeges menne were more estemed by theyr meke customes and delycatenes, than they were after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by their grosse and rude vnderstandynges. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynely somme of the aunciente philisophers, I speake of the mooste aunciente, as welle Caldees as Grekes, who fyrste lyfted theym selues to regarde the sterres of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and surmounted the hyghe mounte of Olympius, there to contemplate and regarde the influences of the
<pb facs="6"/>
planettes in the heuen: I dare well saye, that they haue rather merited pardon by theyr ignoraunces, than pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge or grace by their wysedome. These were the fyrste that wolde serch the trouthe of the elementes of the heuen, and yet they were the fyrste that dyd so we errours in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges natural of the erthe. Homere in his Illiade said these wordes in speakynge of philosophers: I prayse nothyng the knowlege of myn auncesters, but I can them greatte thanke and prayse, in that they desyred knowlege. This was welle sayde of Homer. For if amonge the aunciente men had not rayned suche ignoraunce, there had not ben soo many sectes and parcialities in euery schole. He that hath redde the auncient antiquities of the philosophers, shall not denay me, the presumption of the knowledge and ignorance of that they desired to knowe, the whiche is chiefe cause, that science is not all one. There is greatte nombre of parcialities, Cynitiens, Catoniens, Peripati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens, Academyens, and Epicuriens, who were as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their opinions, as dyuers in their naturalities. I wil not that my penne be so dismeasured to reproue soo moche the auncient men, that the glorie all onely shoulde abyde with them that be present. Truely if he merite guardon and prayse, that sheweth me the way, wherby I thynke to passe: yet no lesse meriteth he that sheweth and aduisethe me of the waye, wherby I maye fayle. The ignoraunce of the auncient men hath ben but as a guyde to aduyse and aduertise all other, and bycause they erred, we haue foūd sith the waye, to their great prayse, and to our gret shame. I say that if we that be no we present had benne than, wo had knowen lesse than they dydde. And if they that were than were nowe at this houre, they shoulde surmounte vs in knowlege. And that this is trewe, tt appereth wel. For the auncient sages, with their diligēce to know the trouth,
<pb facs="6"/>
by their close and ferme made the wayes: But we by our slouthe folowe not the open wayes. Than to the purpose that I wyll saye, we that be nowe present, canne not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne of them that haue bene, but that the trouthe (the which accordynge to Aule. Gel. is doughter of the tyme) In this tyme of the worlde declarethe to vs the errours that we oughte to flee, and the trouthe of the doctrine that we ought to folowe. But as nowe the humayne malyce is so experte, and the vnderstandynge of mortall menne is so dulle, that in tyme of nede, in goodnes of wyt we fayle and in all yll we knowe more than we ought to knowe. In suche wyse, that some with one parte of the more, and some with lesse, al presume to wyn the game. And though this be true, yet it is but a smalle thynge to that we abyde fore: There is so moche that we oughte to knowe. For the moste that we knowe, is the least parte of that we be ignorant of, as the thynges natural, accordyng to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of the tyme, lyke maner dothe the operations of the elementes. In semblable wise in thynges mortall, as the ages hath succeded, so are discouered the sciences. For cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne all the fruites cometh not together. Whan one fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth an other begynneth to entre in reason. I wylle saye, that neyther all doctours amonge christen menne, nor all the philosophers amonge the gentylles were concurrante in one tyme, but after the deathe of one good, an other came better. The hygh and supreme wysedome, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che all meane thynges gouerneth by Iustice, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it accordynge to his bountie, wyll not that at oone tyme the worlde shulde want or be destitute of sage men, nor at an other tyme want of symple personnes: some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syringe the fruite, and some the leaues. In such sort that they shulde haue enuy of that other were impeched. This auncient world that ranne in Saturnus dayes, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb facs="7"/>
other wyse was called the golden worlde, the whiche was so estemed of them that sawe it, and soo moche pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of theym that harde the writynge therof, and soo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che desired of them that felt no parte therof, was not gold by the sages that dyd gylte it, but bycause that there was none yll that did vngylt it. This our age nowe is of iron: yet it is not called of yron, for faute of sages, but bycause the malycious people surmounte. I confesse one thynge, and I thynke I shall haue manye wyll fauour me in the same, that there was neuer in the worlde so moche people teachynge vertue, and soo fewe folowynge the same. Aul. Gele sayth in his boke, that the ancient sages were holden in reputation, bycause there were fewe teachers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lerners: &amp; at this houre it is contrary, there be but fewe lerners and many teachers. The small esteme that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be in at this tyme maye be sene by greatte veneration that the philosophers were holden in as than, the whiche thynge was trewe: Homer among the grekes, Salomom amonge the Hebrewes, Lygurge amonge the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyens, Lyuie amonge the Romayns, Cicero amonge the Latines, Apolonius Thianeus amonge all the barbarike nations. I desyre to haue ben in all these ages, whan the worlde was so ryche of sage persons, and so poore of sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple persons, whan they assembled out of ferre countreys, and of dyuers realmes and strange nations: not all one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue hard their doctrines, but also to haue sene their persones. I thynke I am not begyled in the histories, for whan Rome in his moste prosperitie was hyghest in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe, Titus Liuius dothe write it in his histories, and the glorious saynt Ierome affirmethe it in the prologe of the byble, that mo people came to Rome to se the eloquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the bokes, more than to ioy any Romayne trumph. Whan Olympias was delyuered of her chylde the great
<pb facs="7"/>
Alexander, Philip her husbande and father to the yonge chylde wrote a letter to Arestotle, wherin he sayde: I gyue greate graces to the goddes, not all onely that they haue gyuen vnto me a sonne, but bycause they haue gyuen him to me in the tyme that thou mayste be his mayster, and he thy disciple. Marc Aurele the emperour, of whom this pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sente boke entreatethe, he speakynge of hym selfe wrote to Polion these wordes: Frende I wyl thou knowe, that I am not made emperour by reason of the bloude of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours, nor yet for the fauour of my lynage nowe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but it was bycause I haue ben always a frende and louer of the sage people, and enmy to them that haue noo good knowlege. Ryght happy was Rome to chose so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyant an emperour, and ryghte fortunate was that empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to come to suche an empire, not by patrimonye but by sagenes. And if that aege was glorious in ioyinge of his persone, no lesse it is to vs to ioye of his doctrines. I wyll intitle this boke the Golden boke. It maye be called golden, bycause in so high estimation it holdethe the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, discoueringe in theyr tyme this boke with the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, as these princes holdethe their myndes of golde in theyr Indes. But I saye that at this houre there be moo hartes banyshed into the Indes of golde, than to employ them to rede the werkes of this boke. Salust saythe, that there ought great glory be gyuen to them that haue done there hygh and great actes: And that there oughte no les fame and renowme be gyuen to those that in a good style haue written them. In this case I confesse to deserue noo merites for my traduction or any fame, but I demaunde pardon of all them that be sage, for the fawtes that they shall fynde therin. For excepte the diuine letters, there is nothynge soo well written, but that there maye be founde necessitie of correction, lyne, and sensure. Semed this to
<pb facs="8"/>
to be trewe, by that Socrates was reproued of Plato, and Plato of Aristotle, Aristotle of Abenruyz, Scilio of Sulpice, Lelie of Varro, Marin{us} of Tome, Enio of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, Senec of Aule Gele, Estratocles of Strabo, Tesato of Galene, Hermagore of Cicero, Origen of saint Ierom, saynt Ierome of Ruffyn, and Ruffyn of Donate? Sythe that in them and in theyr werkes there hath ben correcty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who were men of hyghe knowlege, it is no reason that I shulde be in their fraternitie, seinge that I knowe so ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel as I do to the examynation of wise and vertuous men. To them I submyt this present warke, and to theym that haue ben suche, I them require to be contente to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and not iuges therof. It were no pacience to suffre, nor lawe to permytte, that a thynge that a sage personne with great maturite and delyberation hath written, to be dispraysed by a symple persone. For ones redynge, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes the auctours and wryters are dyspraysed, not of them that can traduce and compose werkes: but of them that can not vnderstande them, and yet lesse rede theym. I saye further of aduantage, that dyuers haue written of the tyme of the sayde Marke Aureleo emperour, as Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian wrote lyttel, Eutropio lesse, Lampridio yet lesse, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Capitolyn some what more. The writinges of them and of other semeth rather epitomes than histories. There is difference betwene this writynge, and that they wrote by herynge saye: but they by whome I haue composed this present warke, they were wytnesse by syghte, and not by herynge of other, but they wrote what they sawe them selfe: That is to say among the maysters, who lerned the said emperour their sciēces, there were thre, that is to say, Iunto Rastico, Cina Catule, and Sexto Cheronense, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue we to the greatte Plutarke. These bene they that haue written this present historie, Sexto Cheronense in greke,
<pb facs="8"/>
and the other two in latyne. I thinke of this historie is but small notice, bycause vnto this houre it hath not be seene imprinted. Whan I departed from the college of my stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and wente to preache in the palays, where I sawe soo many newe nouelties in the courtes, I delybered my selfe with greatte desyre to knowe thynges, and gaue my selfe to serche and knowe thinges aunciente. And the case for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned on a day, redynge an historie, I founde therin mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be noted in a pistel, and it semed to me so good, that I put all myne humayne forces to serche farther. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in reuoluyng dyuers bokes, serchyng in dyuers libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and also speakynge with diuers sages of dyuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almes, finally I founde this tretise in Florence, amonge the bokes left there by Cosme de Medicis, a man of good memory. I haue vsed in this writinge, the whiche is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, that that dyuers tymes hath ben vsed in diuinitie, that is to reduce, not worde for word, but sentence for sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. We other interpretours are not bounde to gyue for the meane the wordes, it suffiseth to gyue for the weyghte the sentence: As the historiographes, of whom there were dyuers, and the historie that they made was all but one thing. I wyl not deny, but I haue left out some wordes, which were not mete, nor well sittynge, rude, and leaste of valure, and I haue medled it with outher more swete and profitable. I thynke that euery wyse man, after he hathe redde this boke, wyll not saye that I am the principal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of this warke, nor yet to iuge me so ignorant to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude me clene from it, for so hygh sentences are not found at this presente tyme, nor to so hygh a style they of tyme past neuer atteyned.</p>
