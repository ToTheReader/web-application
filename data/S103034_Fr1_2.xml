   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, AFTER that I perceiued that my age ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall sickenesse, would suffer me no more to be profytable too Christes Church and common welth, by my voyce, wordes, and going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode, thought it meete by such mē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and meanes as GOD hath left in
<pb facs="3"/> me as yet vnhurt and vntouched, for that portion of liuing that I haue, to profit the Church of God as much as I coulde. And therefore within these xij. Monethes I haue translated one booke out of Latin into English, and haue writtē one homily against Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonye and Drunkennesse, and other vices annexed thervnto, and haue set them abrode, for the promoting and increasing of the kingdome of GOD. I thought also, seeing that God hath also endued mee with the knowledge of bodilye Phisicke, after that I had sought to promote the kingdome of GOD, to communicate some part of my knowledge that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto me in naturall knowledge, vnto my brethren that had nede ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But when as I perceiued that there was so much vse of Wine in all cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tries of Englande, and so many errors committed in the abusing of it, both of the most part of the Laitie, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of some of the learned that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
<pb facs="3"/> naturall knowledge, I thought I should doe no small benefite vnto the Church and Common welth of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, if that I shoulde set out a booke of the natures of Wines, and confute the errors and ill opinions that all men haue concerning the natures and properties of them. And this booke haue I now ended, and dedicate vnto your Honor for a token of the good will that I beare vnto you, desiring you also to be a Patrone of it against all such babling and vnlearned So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisters, as wyll speake agaynst it, not being armed with learning, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and reason, but onelye with their olde Sophistrie, which they learned in the time of ignoraunce and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. If these will be to busie in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of their errors, and will goe about to defende them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the truth that I haue taught in this booke, if that I can haue by the helpe of God, graunted vnto me any truce betweene me and my disease, I
<pb facs="4"/> entende to put you to small paine in the defending of my Booke, for I haue beene matched with as big men as these bee, I thanke GOD, and well haue escaped without dishonor. But if my sicknesse will not suffer me to doe it that I would otherwise doe, then I must desire you and other of my friendes to defende mee so farre forth as I defende the truth.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, whereas I set out of late a boke, declaring at large the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and properties of the great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle called <hi>Theriaca Andromachi,</hi> and of the Triacle of <hi>Mithridates</hi> called <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatium,</hi> and also of the <hi>Triacle Salt,</hi> and the booke was negligentlye and falselye printed, and diuerse honest men think it necessarie to be printed againe, &amp; I purpose to doe the same, &amp; bicause it were necessary to haue a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone for it, which it hath wanted hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto: I dedicate and giue this boke also vnto your learned Honor, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you also by your learnyng and
<pb facs="4"/> wisedome to be patrone vnto it as I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>aue made you of my other booke. No more at this time, but the Lorde Iesus encrease you with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his holy worde, and with grace to lyue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes according to the same, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
