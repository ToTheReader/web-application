   <head>Iohan Hoper wyshythe grace and the yefftes of the holy Gooste unto my lord of wynchester.</head>
   <p>YOure booke my lorde intytlid à detection of the deuilles Sophistrie &amp;c. Was delyueryd unto me in Zurych the xxx. of Aprell, last past: the why<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che I haue withe leasure and diligence perusid, Markyd youre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencion, and how ye sense à wrong opinion withe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ffere wordes and diuerse reasones, sufficient to confir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me the ignoraunt in his ignorancie, to stablyshe his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and likewyce it may put in dāger the good and sim ple conscience unlernid that is perswadid and seythe the truithe, yet for lacke of knolege cannot, nor is not able to defend the same, when argumentes subtille and crauff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti shal assaulte his simple and playne ffaythe aboue the reche and capacite of his intendemente Therfore Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Idesire souche as know the trewthe to perseuer in the same, and souche as yet be ignoraunt therof to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me unto the trewithe that in Christ they might withe the churche of truithe ffind eternall saluaciō. I haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de this answer unto your booke to succur and warrant the conscience of the reader, ffrom the snares and sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticacions wherwithe all youe or ony other shuld troble and unquiete the peace and tranquillite of him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styth only under the shadow and protection of godes holye word, being deliuerid ffrom the darkenys of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, the detestable doctrine of man. I haue likewyce dedicatyd the same unto youre lordshyppe to declare that it is agaynst youre cause and opinion that I writ and not
<pb facs="3"/>
agaynst youe, to whom I wyshe the same grace and ffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of god, that I would unto my selfe, and the loue that Paule wyshid unto his contre men the Iewes of who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>e ssaluacion he was moost desyrows, thowghe the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re obstinacy and blindenis so meritid the punishement and seuerite of godes Ire, that he was compellyd to wryt the inditement and condemnacion of there infidelite as it aperithe by his moost louing and affectionat hart Ro. 9. before his entre into that lamenta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble and seuere dispu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tacion of there departure and reiection ffrom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>messe of god. Taking god and his conscience to record that he wrot of no Malyce, nor pretensid yle wille, but constraynid there unto to serue the glorie of god and the truithe of his word: Whyche must be preferrid befo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re all other loues of the worold. Therefore wrote he as I do in the defense of the uerite to gaynesouche as he wrote unto untogod, and to defend them that knew the truithe ffrom the subtiltie and crauffte of souche as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendyd, the subuersion of the truithe by crafftye and subtill argumētacion. It is not ignorant unto youe what may be donne by the uerteue of a fere and well orderyd oracion. How mouche it auaylythe whether it persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de à trewthe or à falsite. No nede to syke examples the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rof in Demosthenes Cicero or ony other prophane wry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter the scripture is playne that it hathe souche uehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and effect in it selfe with the helpe of the deuyll, that it persuadithe the falsyst lye of the worold to be trewe, make the man to belyue not only that godd is yle, the treuthe falshod, but that god, his word, and all that spea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ky the his word befalse, as we may se, Nu. 13. by the oracyon
<pb facs="3"/>
of those 10. that were sent by the churche of the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites with Iehosua and Caleb to inquire and sarche the condicione and nature of the land of coenaan: at the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re Returne as treatoures of the commune wealthe, and not as faythe full inquisitoures as it was commaundid them in there embassayge and cōmission made this ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and aduertismēt of there expedicion: Venimus ad terram ad quam nos misisti, &amp; uti{que} fluit lacte &amp; melle, &amp; hicest fructus eius. Nisi quod populus est fortis qui habitat in terra, &amp; ciuitates munite &amp; grandes ualde: quin &amp; filios Anac uidimus ibi. Amalec autem habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatin terra meridionali &amp;c. This bryue oracion so preua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyd among the Israelitis, that it browght the hole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and congregacion of the churche into desperacion into à contempt of god and there lawfull apoyntid Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peroure Moses, And highe prist Aron. Confer theffect of this oracion whyche ye may see in the begynning of the xiiij. chapiter of Num. with god and all the miracles that euer he wrowght for them, and yet more aualyd this false oration to persuade à false effect, then god, his word, Moses, or Aron. God Among all the people of the worold, Chose this people to be peculier unto hym selfe and byd Moses say unto Pharo that he shuld di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse his people to do sacrifice unto hym Exod. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

This singuler fauor and priuilayge aualyd nothing, they wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld returne into Egypt Num. 14. agayne and serue Pha rao there mortall Ennymie and leaue the lyuing god. He that deuidid the red see, kyllid all the ffyrst begoten of Egypt Exod. 12. fed them with mete from heauen: Wonderfully preseruid boothe there ffathers and them

      </gap> lyffe eternall, but also à pleasaunt, ryche and moost commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious realme, and kyngdon, in this worold. Now hathe this ffalse oracion of the 10. treatures wrowght souche an opinion in there heddes that they denye god, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the no more trust nor confidence in hym, nor will not hy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re him spoken of: in so mouche that all the hole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion agreyd to stone Iehosua and Caleb to deathe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they contraryd there wyckyd pretence: yet was it not the ffere of stones, ffyre, nother swerd that could fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re these too godly men ffrom preaching the truthe of god: they had wordes agaynste wordes, and an oracion agaynst an oracion and sayd if it pleace the lord he can bring us into this land, and trewly because he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the promysid it, unto us, he will yeue it, be not ye Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious agaynst hym. Nether fere ye not the people of the land, they shall be our breade we shall deuore thē for zilam there protection is departid from them. And the lord is withe us. Litle à uaylyd this godly oration it persuadyd nothyng at all, yet dyd these too there dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys to shewe the truythe: whiche is an Example that we shuld do the same, all wayes confesse the the truythe, and defend the word of god, thowghe there belitle ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, or none that it shall take effectt, yet it is oure dewtys whether we be lernyd or unlernyd euery man to confes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se his faythe, for he that say<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the in thy hart thow shalt haue nomore Godes but one, the same god saythe thow shalt not take my name in uayne, Exo. 20. and in forbyd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyng the negatyue, he commaundythe the affyrmatiue it is not sufficient to refrayne the tong ffrom swering
<pb facs="4"/>
and speking of yle, but that it must confesse the treuth of god and speake well, as Dauid saythe declina à malo &amp; fac bonum. It is not sufficient to leaue yle undon, but that we must do the godd commaundid by god and his lawe. As Dauid saythe Psal. 1. blessid is he that walky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the not in the concell of the yle &amp;c. but hathe his meditacions in the law of god day and nyght. Wyste I that my laboure shuld neuer do good, ner healpe the cōscience of one manne: yet for the cōmaundementes sake would I haue wroten, to set one oracion agaynst the other, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause I se the Name of god blasphemid by the opinion that ye defend. But I haue hope that it shall somwhat auayle to confound the falshode, and bring the truithe the soner to light. I know it is the condicion of god to permit unto euery oracion his nature and condicion, as we se som tymes by preaching of the trew word of god people ar conuertyd unto faythe, some tyme, by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the doctrine of men people ar seducid and caryd ffrom the faythe. It is not the nature of god to make the false oratour domme when he would perswade à false opinion, Nether to make his auditours deffe, but as Isay he suffrethe the oracion to work his uertewe, and leaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the ffre election unto the audience to imbrace whiche part they lyst, by grace, and à consenting will, the good, by the deuill and there awne malyce the yle. Now the oratour of god must persuade withe none othere argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes or wordes then the master of the scole Christ ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the tawght. The Prophetes and aposteles wrotē: It is no orator of Christes, that contrarie unto his Canones, Ru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les and preceptes, would perswade in the churche ony
<pb facs="5"/>
thing more thē is prescribid in the sccipture the whiche is moost perfete and sufficiēt to persuade in causes of Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligiō all thinges. That law must nedes be moost perfete, that can haue nothing addid unto it, nor nothing taken from it, of this cōdition is the scripture as ye know by the wordes of Moses and the reuelacion of Iohan. Luc. in his later booke saythe: Superiore uolumine diximus Theophile, de omnibus quae cepit Iesus facere &amp; doce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. The whych wordes Ioan. Chrysost. thus interpretith, de omnibus, &amp; non omnia: de omnibus ad salutem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarijs. Consernyng doctrine and how to lede oure lif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe it is sufficiently tawght in the scripture. Those that will stablishe the Masse as ye do my lord and defend I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrye: Must proue the thyng ye speke by the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and playnly satisfie the places of the scripture browg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te agaynst youe. ye must not darken the places with glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses of your ymagyon. But dissolue the places and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent boothe the scripture whyche ys youre mortall En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymie in this mater, and likewyce satisfye the reason of man whyche ye neglect in this cause of the sacrament other wyshe then ye shuld do, and for à good reason ye bryng an inuisible miracle. God that can resuscitat the Chyldren of Abraham out of the hard stones, send yo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of his mercyfull grace, to take away the uele of blyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denys and yeue youe his light, Amen.</p>
