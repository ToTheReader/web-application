   <head>This Whole Treatise is divided into three Parts.</head>
   <p>The first concerning the Student: And that also divided into three distinct Sections.</p>
   <p>THE first Section containeth a disquisition with what Naturall gifts and faculties the Student of the Law ought to be furnished withall.</p>
   <p>The second Section containeth what acquired Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are required in the Student as well touching the Vertues intellectuall, and the liberall Sciences, wherein the Student should be informed; and other Knowledges necessary for the rectifying of his understanding, as also touching the Morall vertues for direction of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.</p>
   <p>The third Section containeth the best manner and Methode that may be used for the most delightfull and most usefull study of Law, and whereby most profit may be gotten in profoundnesse of Iudgement in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our English Lawes.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>The second Treatise touching the Counseller or Practizer of the Lawes, is also subdivided into three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Parts or Sections.</p>
   <p>THe First concerneth his Private Counsell given at home in his Chamber to his Client, which is one part of his duty <hi>Consulendo,</hi> by way of Counsell.</p>
   <p>The Second Part or Section concerneth the drawing of Assurances and Conveiances, which are of sundry sorts; which is his dutie <hi>Cavendo,</hi> by way of Caution.</p>
   <p>The Third Part or Section concerneth his Pleadings for his Client; And that is threefold: In point of Law: In Argument of Demurrers: In matter of fact, as in giving or delivering of Evidence. And the Patronage of Causes in Courts of equitie: all which are his duties <hi>Agendo,</hi> by way of publike Action.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>In the Third Treatise concerning a <hi>Iudge,</hi> are contained these particulars, in two generall parts divided: first, his Preparation in his person, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, his Practice.</p>
   <p>IN his Preparation, or consideration of his Person, the qualities required in an upright Iudge are these: first, that hee bee Religious, according to the Counsell of <hi>Iethro</hi> unto <hi>Moses,</hi> Provide men fearing God. <hi>2 Chron. 19.7. Exodus 18.21.22.23.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Secondly, They ought to bee men of Courage. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide thee among all the People men of Courage. <hi>Deut. 1.17.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, They ought to be men of Integrity, Iust men, dealing truly: They shall be iust, if first they hate Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse, so will they not be corrupted, For rewards and gifts doe blinde the eyes of the wise; <hi>Exod. 23.8. Deut. 16.19. Ecclus. 20.28. 2 Chron. 19.7.</hi> Secondly, if they have no respect of persons. <hi>Lev. 19.15. Deut. 1.17. 2 Chron. 19.7.</hi> Thirdly, if they be free from passions and perturbations of the minde, as anger, favour, desire of revenge, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, Iudges ought to be wife, men able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne circumstances, and to foreknow the mischiefes and inconveniences that may ensue of inconsiderate Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Deut. 1.13.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Fiftly, Iudges ought to be learned, especially in the Lawes, Be ye learned that judge the earth.</p>
   <p>The Second Part, which is the Practice of the Iudge, generally considered is twofold, first either Sedentary, in the Court wherein he sitteth: or Itinerate, in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite wherein he rideth.</p>
