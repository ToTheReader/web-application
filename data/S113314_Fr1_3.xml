<pb facs="4"/>
kind or other to maintaine his estate here. Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of fame began it. <hi>Adam</hi> digged the Earth, and manured it. <hi>Tubal</hi> wrought in Mettals. <hi>Noah</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Vineyard. <hi>Abraham, Lot, Moses, Dauid, Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeus, Amos,</hi> and many other godly and great men were Shepheards. <hi>Gydeon</hi> was a Thresher of Corne. <hi>Iacob</hi> and his sonnes the Patriarkes, were Herdes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <hi>Ioseph</hi> a Purueyor of Corne in <hi>Egypt. Paul</hi> made Tents. <hi>Mathew</hi> was a Customer, or Toll-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer. <hi>Peter, Andrew</hi> and others were Fishermen. And <hi>Saul</hi> a keeper of Asses. If these men began the way of labour in so many kinds, who may say he is free in one kind or other? And hee that in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of his greatnes of birth or wealth, will pretend a priuiledge of idlenes, or vaine and vnprofitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, doth discouer his forgetfulnes, or neglect of the dutie in earth, which euery man, euen the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est oweth vnto the Common-wealth, his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and posteritie. And hee is censured euen by the mouth of God, <hi>Worse then an Infidell,</hi> that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth these duties. And none is excused, or exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of this <hi>Law of prouision for his familie,</hi> be hee neuer so high or meane; not that such men as are honorable by byrth, office or aduancement, should till the earth, or be Shepheards or Herdsmen. But that they should, according to their greatnes, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute great place in the Common-wealth, whereof (after the care of Diuine things, in respect of God that gaue them their greatnes) they should haue care to performe some seruice, in respect of the King, vnder whome they enioy their greatnes: To shew loue and diligent regard, to ayd their inferiours, in respect of whome they haue the imputation of their greatnesse. To bee prouident in prouiding things necessarie for their Families, that haue an interest to partake of their greatnes. And lastly, in respect
<pb facs="5"/>
of their posterities, that are to becom the more great by their greatnesse. And how can they do thus, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they looke into, and vse the meanes of the increase and preseruation of their greatnesse? And for as much as the same consisteth, for the most part, in the reuenewes of land: what greater care ought they to haue, then to maintaine and lawfully to augment the same? which decaying, their Honor and honorable reputation diminisheth. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue or augment Reuenues, there must be meanes: the meanes are wrought by Knowledge; Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge had by Experience; Experience by view, and due obseruation of the particulars, by which Reuenues doe, or may arise. Wherein are to bee considered the Quantities, and Qualities of Land, with the present Rents, and estimate values, by a reasonable improouement: which duly found, to haue a due regard to proportion yeerely distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and expendings, with the annuall Incoms, in such sort, as alwayes the present yeere may rather adde vnto the next, then the next to bee charged with the yeere past. For when the present yeere shall expend more then the Reuenues of the same may beare, the yeere following cannot but be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged: and so will it surcharge the future so long, that either he shall be forced to strike the topsayle of his improuident wasting, in time; or at length, through the furious blasts of excessiue prodigalitie, be blown vnder the water of disability, by ouerswel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the sayles of his vainglory. I speake not this in the way of attachment, but of preuention. And so I trust, all men will take it, and accept of my poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour in this kind, considering that necessary it is, that al mē should know what it is to haue reuenewes, namely, first to know them, &amp; then to vse thē to their own aduancement, and to the good of others▪ And because it is not the worke of the Honorable, &amp; of
<pb facs="5"/>
such as haue high &amp; serious common-wealth imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to bee personal actors of their owne affaires in this kind, they are to vse the seruice of such as are fit in knowledge, and iust in dealing, to trauel in this kind of busines, by whose faithfull and sincere infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, they may know what is iust and right to be done and demanded: And in al fauour and clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to deale with such, as are in this manner within the compasse of their commands, and by whom and by whose labours they maintaine their greatnes: for (no doubt) there is none but well considereth, that how great or powerful soeuer he be in lād reuenues, it is brought in vnto him by the labours of inferiour tenants: yea, <hi>the King consisteth by the field that is tilled.</hi> And there is none of these inferiours,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5.8.</note> of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary discretion, but well knoweth, that what hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth, is by the fauour of his Lord in a sort: And therefore ought there to bee such a mutuall concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of loue and obedience in the one, and of ayd and protection in the other, as no hard measure offered by the superiour, should make a iust breach of the loyaltie of the inferiour: which kind of vnion is no waies better preserued and continued between the Lord and tenants, then by the Lords true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the particulars that euery tenant holdeth, &amp; a fauorable course in fines and rents: and by the tenants loue and thankfulnes in al readie seruice and dutie towards the Lord. And to that end, it is (no doubt) expedient, that Lords of tenants haue due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their owne estates, namely of the particulars of all their tenants landes, and that by a due, true, and exact view and suruey of the same, to the end the Lord be not abused, nor the tenants wronged &amp; grieued by false informations, which cōmonly grow by priuat Inteligencers, &amp; neuer by iust Surueyors. And because the office of a Surueior (duly waid) is an
<pb facs="6"/>
office both necessary, expedient, &amp; of trust. It beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him to be first honestly and vprightly minded, and next, skilfull and iudicious in the facultie. Then can he not, but by industrie and diligence, produce an exact discouerie and performance of the worke he vndertaketh, to the true information of the Lord, whose benefite and vttermost lawfull profite he is to seeke, in a good conscience, disswading him yet from distastefull Auarice, the greatest blemish that can befall a man, seeking true reputation and renowne, by his reuenues. For too much seueritie afflicteth the hearts of poore Tenants, who (by common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) are found to be more firmely knit in the band of true dutie, loyall affection, and readie seruice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Lords, by their Lords frugalitie, sweetened sometimes with the chearefull drops of true liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then by the extreames of austeritie, vaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie, or compulsiue exactions. And yet not so, as Lords of Tenants should be so ouerswayed with abused lenitie, or carelesse looking into their owne, as may breed contempt in Tenants: but rather that they should keepe such an eeuen, and equall hand ouer their Tenants, as may continue mutuall loue, and in them a louing feare: And not to seeke the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of reuenues so much for vaine glories, as for vertues maintenance. Which will appeare by doing good to deseruers, by their vertuous life. A worke of true vertue, when contrarily, vaineglorie seeketh idle and vaine reputation, by vniustly atchieuing, and either prodigally consuming, or too miserably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing Reuenewes, which I must leaue to euerie mans owne fancie, wishing all to fashion their waies in this kind, to Gods glory, the Kings seruice, the good of the Common-wealth, and to other such ends, for which God hath giuen them greatest earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blessings; recōmending vnto you this simple
<pb facs="6"/>
rude lumpe, of which, if some more skilfull, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow the re-licking, &amp; bring it to his true shape, my selfe with many others, should thankfully imbrace it. In the meane time friendly accept it, and in kindnes afford sparing reproofe.</p>
