   <p>HAveing long desired to publish our Faith vnto this nation and in perticuler vnto those congregations wherof you are, (as wee have formerly done to our owne Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion): and also to make knowne the thinges wherein you, and wee differ, and are opposite. VVee have now through the mercie of God, thus farr, brought our desires to passe, being onely vnsatisfied for our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency that wee are no better able to manifest your errors unto you wee have divers causes from good grounds to do this wee have done. First because we are bound to discover the misterie of iniquitie, by all good meanes that wee can and in the cupp that she hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to vs, to fill hir the duble. Secondly that wee might through the grace of God (if your willing minds be thereunto) be instrumentes of good, vnto you herein &amp; the rather, because you haue bene instrumēts of good in discovering divers of our erors unto us, which wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg to the praise of God, &amp; with thāk full harts to you. Now in that wee do this by way of opposition and reproofe publiquely, wch you did by instruction priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely: for our defence herein, wee answere: you came publiquely amongst us, and advanced your error of Succession and order, From the proportion of the scriptures, and have destroyed the faith of manie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bye, who for sinister respect were willinge to followe you: wee have d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
