   <p>VVHereas there is promised thee about the latter end of the booke a Treatise of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and scripture in the vulgar tongue: know thou that by reason of the continuall warres in this Countrey and the manifolde difficulties which all those that liue here-about doe feele: I haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to finish this worke, without ful accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my promise and purpose. But thou in the meane time enioy this my present which I make thee: &amp; if I shall perceiue that this my labour is grateful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee: then shalt thou in the next edition receiue a perfect recompence for this my defaulte. I haue also set down a Catalogue of the Fathers and Doctours w<seg rend="sup">c</seg> are in this Booke alleaged, that thou maiest see how auncient defendours we haue of the Catholike truth: which in deede neither could be Catholicke if it had not antiquitie with it: neither can want antiquitie if it be Catholicke. So that in my iudgement two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall thinges thou shalt finde in this Booke, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues sufficient to confirme thy owne Faith, and to confound the negatiue Religion of al aduersaries. The first is the very naked &amp; sincere truth very plainly &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>presly set downe. The second is the multitude of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of her sinceritie. For the innocency of truth is such, that it presently cōmendeth it selfe vnto the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder and discouereth all malicious slaunders; which when they growe vnto most intollerable impudency, cannot yet abide the force and maiesty of so vnspotted testimonies, against which there cannot be taken any exception. This whereas I my selfe haue founde in the perusing of this worke, I could not but imparte vnto thee my minde and iudgemente. Fare-well.</p>
