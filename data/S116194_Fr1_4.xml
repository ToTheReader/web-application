      <hi>TO THE GENTLE REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> P. B. wisheth health in the Lorde.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey that earnestly consider the state, &amp; condition of the Churche of Christe vvhile it is a straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in this world, &amp; doe diligently marke the course, and proceeding thereof: doe easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue, howe truely, and aptly it is commonly compared to a ship<note place="margin">The Church of Christ like a ship in the sea.</note> tossed with diuers windes in the midst of the troublesome sea, and shaken with many tempestes follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing one the other: &amp; how right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also it is called of some the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, or warfaring Church. For it is, as it were an army which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the field, and is alwayes besieged of the enemy: and is often<note place="margin">The Church of Christ euer as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted by satan.</note> times assaulted, and continually set vpon with newe policies, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes. For it neuer enioyeth sure peace, no not so muche as safe truce: but if there seeme to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the same is full of treachery.
<pb facs="11"/>
For that perpetuall enemye of Christ, is neuer quiet, is neuer wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, doth alwayes enuy his dignitie, glorie, and power: and hee neuer ceaseth to lye in waite for the life, and saluation of the godly, and is neuer satisfied with their blood. And although he may seeme some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to abate, and slake a litle of the fiercenes of his endeuour, yet hee still remaineth one, nothing ceasing his hatred, and desire to worke mischiefe. Therefore he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth vp euer nevv souldiors against the host of Christe, and sendeth thē forth furnished with new wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,<note place="margin">Satan raiseth enemies out of the Church, against the Church.</note> &amp; deceits. And that which is more to be maruelled at, this ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and wonderfull practiser, euen from the beginning hath craftily sought out of the verie bosome, and as it were the verie bowels of the Church, those by whome hee might vnder the pretence of truth, and godlines, trouble, shake, and labour to ouerthrow the kingdom of Christ, to wit, his church. Which thing they that are readers of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, and skilfull in the Church
<pb facs="11"/>
histories, doe well knowe. Yea, and our age is full of plaine, testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and examples thereof: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that there is nothing to bee wished, but that we diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of these thinges. Neither<note place="margin">Christ for good cause exhorteth vs to watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, especially the shephcards of the flocke.</note> ought any man to maruel that our best guide Christ, doeth so often and so earnestlye exhorte his vnto continuall watchfulnes: especially those, whose duetie it is to watch, and to haue charge ouer the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people. Vnto the which care euen their Captaines conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall presence, and defence ought to edge them, and to sturre them vp. For as he is neuer absent, so he neuer either sleepeth, or ceaseth, beeing much more readier, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler to giue saluation promised vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those that beleeue in him: then the enemy is to bereaue them of the same. Wherefore if any thing be wanting in this behalfe to them that fight vnder his banner, the fault is altogether in them selues: neither haue they to blame any thing, but their owne either perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnes,
<pb facs="12"/>
either slouthfulnes. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely it were a shamefull thing, and worthie grieuous punishment in this case, to bee ouercome, or yeld to the enemy. For what can bee more blame woorthie, then that there should bee more endeuour, diligence, &amp; paines taken in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining of falshood, then in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the trueth, in establishing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines, thē in vpholding of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines: in procuring an others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, then in preseruing our owne saluation? Many examples we haue old, and newe of the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and faithfulnes, that as well all Christians, as chiefly they that susteine the persons of teachers, ought in this behalfe to render vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ. That some are ignorant of the old, I easily doe beleeue: but that any almost should not knowe the newe, I can not bee persuaded.<note place="margin">The attempts of the ministers of satan, and Antichrist to put out the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell lately by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

God, was restored vnto the world: so soone as it began to appeare, &amp; to cast foorth some small beames, that therewithall came foorth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Ministers of Satan, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist: who as Owles, and Battes accustomed to darknes, laboured by all meanes, &amp; force they could, to let it, that it shoulde not spread foorth his beames, and to put cleane out the shining sparkles thereof? But on the other side ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">The great zeale and godly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels of the true Ministers of Christ in the defence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of against them.</note> notable men, for godlines, and learning, kindled with the zeale of the glorie of Christ, forced with the loue of the trueth, and moued with the desire of their owne, and other mens saluation: withstoode stoutly, and constantly their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked attemptes: and so brake with strength, and courage their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons bēt against them: that maw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre the enemies, though neuer so many, mightie, and eger: that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly light issued out, and spread foorth his beames both farre and wide, as it is at this day to be seene. Wherefore the faithfull seruantes
<pb facs="13"/>
of Christ, following the zeale, and industrie of the olde Iewes, which the historie of Nehemiah doth set<note place="margin">Neb. 4. vers. 17.</note> out to all posteritie to be folowed: did so represle with the one hande the violence of them that set them selues against them, that with the other they ceased not to build the Temple: to wit, to gather a church vnto Christ. And God our best fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did so assist, fauour, and blesle their continuall labours, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible constancie: that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my might seeme to haue thought that his kingdome had bene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. Wherefore as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth<note place="margin">The Iesuites a new supply of satan to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his decai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed kingdome.</note> to passe in sodaine chaunces, and extreame dangers: hee hath sodenly prouided a newe supply of aide, whiche hee hath secretely brought into the chiefest tower of his kingdome. For it was so sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and battered, that he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it neare ouerthrowne. But while we which haue succeeded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the places and seats of those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, doe pitifully striue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Certaine spurnes, and byters

amongst vs raising vp new brawls, &amp; troubles,) by the policie, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, and industry of this newe aide: the enemy hath so restored<note place="margin">The course of the Gospell hindered by dissentions ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by some professours thereof.</note> within these fewe yeares that same his tower: that it may appeare, that the whole crue of Antichrist stande in great hope, shortly to recouer their former authoritie, dignitie, and power. And I persuade my selfe, that not only the authours, fauourers, and Patrons of this so great euill: but all that giue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereunto, by what colour, or pretence so euer they doe it, shall at length bee punished of God the most iust iudge, &amp; most vehement defendour, and mainteiner of the kingdome of his Sonne.

         </gap>ing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to write.</note> to put away the shame ioyned with manifest destructiō of the Church: which I perceiue to be laide vpon Christ, by this vpstart host of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. For seeing these galants stand before our doores, and builde v{per} fortresses, aduauncing their Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines engines into our Schooles and Churches neare about vs: if wee shoulde any longer forbeare, might we not worthily be thought willingly, and wittingly to betray the cause of Christ, and his church: and to withholde in vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the trueth of God, which wee heare, and see to bee by these men turned into falshood? But as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the first ofspring, to wit, the true father of this deuillishe broode, which haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ayned vnto them selues, and vsurped no lesse arrogantly, then strangely a name from Iesu: and in what place, and time, it first sprang vp, although it be lately begotten: yet I perceiue diuers reportes to be made: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles I thought not good to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell

in the searching out, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining thereof. It is well knowne, to be an inuention of man. And if I must at once speake my minde hereof, I will doe it in fewe words. If the iudgement of that great Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sile be true, that parentes are kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen by the likenes appearing in their children: &amp; if by duetie, and obediéce vnto their parentes, true, and naturall children are wont to bee knowne from bastardes: this newe impe can haue no other true parentes, then the Romishe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and whore of Babylon. For that is most plainly prooued both by the resemblaunce which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and the good will, that the one beareth the other. My<note place="margin">The Authours purpose in this booke.</note> purpose is at this time, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe the visor from this monster counterfaited both by the name, which it proudly chalengeth vnto itselfe: as by the thing, which that goodly title beareth the worlde in hand. <hi>I</hi> will only touch the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine whiche these newe maisters mainteine, so farre foorth as my
<pb facs="15"/>
purpose suffereth me▪ or els craueth of me▪ <hi>I</hi> vndertake not at this time, purposely to refuse it: knowing that it is all one with the Popishe doctrine, which nowe alreadie is sufficiently confuted. Some also of our men hath euen namely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the same neither slenderly, nor vnluckely. <hi>I</hi> promise such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie as the matter can beare. To reproue errours, and to rebuke vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the loue of trueth, and vertue enforceth: as for the desire to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, much more to slander, who so loueth godlines, doeth hate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, and abhorre it, <hi>I</hi> will deale faithfully. <hi>I</hi> likewise craue of the readers, that they bring with them to the reading hereof, aloue and zeale of the trueth, ioyned with godlines, and desire of their owne saluation.</p>
