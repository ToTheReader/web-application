   <head>THE PREFACE OF D. MARTIN LVTHER VPPON the fifteene Psalmes, called Psalmes of degrees.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E haue heard me before many times declare in the beginning of my Lectures, for vvhat cause I haue taken in hand to expound the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: not for any desire I haue to teach nevve and straunge thinges vvhich haue not beene knovvne or heard before (for our diuinitie is so vvel knovvn both in the Latine tongue and also in our ovvne Language, that vve may seeme novv to haue more neede of exhortation then instruction): but because the diligent teaching and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of the vvorde of God is a kinde of Gods seruice or vvorship properly belonging to the nevve Testament, being much more acceptable vnto God, more holy &amp; excellent then vvere all the vvorshippings and sacrifices of the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore euen vvhen the lavv vvas yet in his ful strength, the holy Prophets of God, vtterly reiecting the burnt offerings and other sacrifices of the lavv, did commend, aboue all other, the sacrifice of praise. In like maner also ought vve so much the more earnestly &amp; diligently to set forth this kind of vvorship, because that, after so great blindnes vvherein vv haue liued, the vvisedom of God hath (as the Sunne in the mid day) appeared and shined vnto vs againe. Therefore, like as it hath bene counted a maner of seruitude in times past, to heare a godly sermon (vvhich men vvere vvont to doe euen as they did their seruile labors): so must vve novv other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise thinke, that they vvhich teach, reade, vvrite or heare
<pb facs="5"/>
the holy Scriptures, are Gods true Priestes, vvhich serue their God vvith a vvorthy and thankful kind of vvorship.</p>
   <p>Albeit true it is also that vve can not here attaine to such full knovvledge of spirituall matters,<note place="margin">
         <hi>The word must be continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations whereof we are in daunger.</hi>
      </note> but that dayly vve haue neede to learne them again, to be exercised &amp; confirmed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, because of the continuall vexations and assaultes of Satan, that as vve are neuer vvithout occasions of declining &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from God: so likevvise vve should not cease to exercise our selues in the continuall meditation of the vvord of God, to the edifying both of our selues and of the Church. For there is nothing so pernitious as the opinion of many at this day, vvho as soone as they haue gotten neuer so litle knovvledge of this heauenly vvisedom, thinke them selues by and by to be greate doctors. For seeing that these thinges doe not consist in fine and eloquent talke, in reasoning and disputing, but in practise and experience, directed, not by mans reason, but by the spirite of God: they are miserably deceiued that rest in bare and naked knovvledge, vvhich is but vnprofitable vvithout experience and practise. In the olde Testament God appoynted but onely the ten commaundements, vvherin he vvould haue his people to be exercised and occupyed. But vvho vvas there euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the Sainctes of God vvhich could say that he vvas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to atteyne to the vvisedom of the holy Ghost sette forth in those commaundements? And shall vve vvhich in the nevv Testament haue the vvhole Scripture set forth vnto vs, glory in the fulnes and perfection of our knovvledge? Let vs not thinke therefore so highly of our selues, but let vs humble our selues before the holy Ghoste and confesse this vvisedom to be infinite, and such as vve could neuer fully attayne vnto, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though vve should spende our vvhole life in the study of the Scriptures. For although by the grace of God vve are not vvithout some knovvledge, yet because vve are continually oppressed vvith cloudes of tentations, vve must haue recourse to this fountaine, yea to this fire, that our hartes may be kindled
<pb facs="6"/>
therevvith, and that vve may giue no place to Satan or our ovvne flesh, vvhereby the first fruites of the spirit might be quenched in vs. This lothing of Gods vvord, vvhich riseth of a false opinion of knovvledge, is (alas) to common at this day.<note place="margin">
         <hi>The lothīg and fulnes of Gods worde.</hi>
      </note> For a remedy therefore against this euill, Moses commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that the lavv of God should be diligently set forth to the posteritie, that is to say, should continually be taught and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised though it vvere neuer so vvel knovvne before.</p>
   <p>For this cause therefore I haue taken in hand to expounde the Psalmes, that vve might learne to abhorre this damnable lothing of the vvord of God, and also to confirme, and (as it vvere) to nourish the good spirite of God in vs by the exercise and practise of the same. But the chiefest cause that moued me hereunto is, for that vve knovv this kind of vvorship, aboue all other to please God, vvhen vve set forth his vvord in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, in reading, in vvriting, in hearing, &amp;c. And this one thing ought to keep vs in the continual exercise of the vvord of God. For, to teach, to exercise and to set forth the vvorde, vvhat is it else, but continually to offer sacrifice vnto God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to vvorship God, continually to be exercised in the three first commaundements. Lamentable it is to see vvhat a multitude there is of such as cōtinually blaspheme God, either in teaching false doctrine, or in persecuting the truth. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very necessary it is that vve, vvhiche in comparison of them are so small a number, should serue the Lord our God, &amp; praise his holy name, vvhich both hath giuen vs this life, and promised the life to come. Moreouer, our ovvne daunger gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs good vvarning to take heede,<note place="margin">
         <hi>After the lothing of the word, commeth contempt, and then Gods plague.</hi>
      </note> that vvhiles vve thus neglect &amp; loth the vvord, vve feele not his heauy vvrath &amp; plage vpon vs before vve be vvare. For vvhen vve are once vveery of the vvorde, then follovveth the contempt of the same: vvhich contēpt the Lord so punisheth, that he taketh his vvord cleane avvay. Hereof the Papacie may be an example for all posteritie, in the vvhich vve see it is so come to passe.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>I haue declared the causes vvhich moued me to take in hand the opening &amp; expounding of the Psalmes, namely that vve might cōsecrate this hovver to our redemer, &amp; offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto him, and by setting forth the mercies of God, vve might, according to the grace giuen vnto vs, exercise our selues in the three first cōmaundements, vvhen as yet all the vvorld in blaspheming of God, most horribly sinneth against these commaundements. Great cause also hath moued me to exhort and earnestly to vvarne you, to bevvare that ye fal not to the lothing or neglecting of the vvord. For if our doctrine be in any daunger, it commeth of this euill. The Papistes and Sectaries, albeit they anoy &amp; trouble vs very much, yet by this occasion they driue vs the more diligently to seeke for the knovvledge of the Scriptures. But this enormitie, the lothing of the vvord I meane, riseth of our selues, and is so much the more perilous and pernicious, for that vve can not perceiue the daunger thereof. And then maketh Satan sure account of his victorie, vvhen vve vvaxe negligent and loth the vvorde.</p>
