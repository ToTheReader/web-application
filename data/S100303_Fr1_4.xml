      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or such a one, I hope this booke will make thee. I am forced for want of paper, to turne an Epistle into an excuse. If thou here missest the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; know, that the swelling of the volum shut it out. This Translation I began for the exercise of my Let<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ten Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but I quickly found it to exercise more then my Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it exercised my skill, (all I had:) it exercised my Patience, it exercised my Friends too (for tis incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the hardest taske that euer I yet vndertooke) the Presse wrought, as fast as I wrote, and I could not recall what was past. Some things therefore may be ouerslipt;

If finding himselfe aggrieued, hee shall in Print discouer himselfe against me; I hope this of mine will one day come to a second Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.

Reader, to bee a Courteous Censurer: &amp; I promise to send any man as many Thanks, as he shall fairely send me word of Faults, escaped in my booke. God blesse the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and send them all to make confession vnto Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
