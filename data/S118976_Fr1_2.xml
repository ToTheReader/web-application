   <head>A Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR truth of this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ensuing, besides cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of place, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
time, occasion, so exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;
I referre my selfe to the
Relation of those Godly men, who
in severall languages have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
to the world the severall pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
thereof: and although I am
not ignorant, that at the first they
were not only not credited, but also
discredited and slandered, by such
as found them to bee a Blur to the
Romane Profession, yet they lost not
their lustre thereby, but being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
by many Compurgators of
severall Nations, and some of the
Romish Religion, being all of them
spectators of this Tragedie. It oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
<pb facs="3"/>
not only a further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
and confirmation of the
truth, but also a large &amp; more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
confluence, to see that which
they had formerly only heard of.
This partly appeareth out of the
succeeding Story; but more fully
out of an Apology written by <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerius</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Iustinople,</hi> who
was accused for dispersing the fame
of this Example to the staine of
Popery, in which Apology to <hi>N.
Rottan,</hi> Suffragen of <hi>Padua,</hi> is
shortly and plainly declared, what
was said, what was done, and who
were present. If that it be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
what mooved mee to compile
this Treatise; <hi>Spira</hi>—tell them that
it should teach feare and reverence,
and indeed among all those that
come to see him, few or none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
unshaken. <hi>Vergerius</hi> in his
first Epistle saith; I would faine
goe see him again, but I exceedingly
<pb facs="3"/>
feare and tremble, and in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie
saith, it is such a rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
as I would willingly goe to
the furthest parts of the world to
heare or see the like. The Lady
<hi>Iane</hi> to her Fathers Chaplaine
(that had falne into <hi>Spira's</hi> sinne)
saith, remember the lamentable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of <hi>Spira.</hi> I acknowledge that
there hath beene formerly a Booke
published in our Mother tongue,
concerning this subject, but as farre
as I can learne (for I could never
yet obtaine to see any one of them)
it was nothing so large and various
as this present Treatise, and as I
have heard, a translation of onely
one of the Tractates, from whence I
have gathered this present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in part. Concerning my care
and fidelitie in this businesse, it is
such as I may truely say without
changing of colour, that there is not
one sentence of all this Worke attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb facs="4"/>
unto the person of <hi>Spira,</hi> but
it hath it warrant, either from the
Epistles of <hi>Vergerius</hi> and <hi>Gribal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
Professours of the Law in
<hi>Padua,</hi> or from the Discourses of
<hi>Henry Scringer</hi> a <hi>Scotish</hi> man,
<hi>Sigismund Gelons</hi> a <hi>Transilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
and <hi>Martin Bocha</hi> a Divine
of <hi>Basill:</hi> neither have I taken any
other Libertie then as a Relation to
weave the aforesaid Discourses one
within another, so as those which
under severall Writers, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
counted severall, are now by
my indeavours reduced into one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
History, connexed by due suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of time and occasion, as
punctually as could be aimed at, by
the circumstances noted in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of those holy and learned men
before named.</p>
