For I remember the saying of D. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolus,</hi> a principall Author in the Ciuill lawe, that these things, which are not very well inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet may bee profitable in this respect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they may perhaps prouoke others to the inuestigatiō of the truth <note n="c" place="margin">Prosunt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nùs recte ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitata, cum alios incitent▪ saltem ad ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis inuesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationem. Bartol. in tract. test.</note>. Great &amp; forcible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons haue mooued me to haue in speciall regard the knowledge of the lawe, considering that by the good constitution, establishment, &amp; obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="5"/> therof, al cōmon weales, which are growne to hight and preheminēce, haue had their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous rising, their abundant increase, and their fortunate continuance, but by the want, breach, or chaunge of good lawes, nothing hath ensued but the desolation, downefal, &amp; ineuitable ruine of many dominions, and estates. Not to trouble your patiēce with instances of pettie prouinces, and inferior regiments, by your fauours let the foure most eminent cōmon weales of the world be tried by this touchstone, &amp; let my assertion by their destinated courses be measured and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; The foure common weales I speake of, were the <hi>Cretensian, Athenian, Lacedemonian,</hi> and <hi>Romane</hi> estates: the first was of all these the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most and most auncient, famosed by the Lawes of <hi>Minos,</hi> who so studiously employed his paynes in the making and amending of Lawes for the space of nine yeares together, that this Common weale being well setled, was well fenced against future mishaps, and continued in great prosperitie till the Romanes grewe too strong: The <hi>Athenian</hi> Common weale was first guyded by <hi>Dracoes</hi> Lawes, written not with inke, but with bloud, rather terrors then rules of estate: wherfore these for their too great asperitie being cancelled, and antiquated, <hi>Solon</hi> that sage Father, beyng (contrarie to the foolish Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe or rather by-woord) both a great Clarke, and an excellent wiseman, and hauing the whole administration of that estate committed to his handes did enact, and establishe Lawes
<pb facs="6"/> with such moderation, and equitie, that the greatest parte of the Lawe called the Lawes of the xij. Tables, that absolute president, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy platforme of all Iustice (to the full opening and cleare expoūding, of which it might be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed that some very learned man would put to his painefull hand) are said to be the fruite and issue of his deepe, and peereles iudgement. The Lacedemonian common weale was established by <hi>Lycurgus</hi> that famous lawmaker, by whose profitable directions and ordinances that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale did for the space of sixe hundred yeeres exceedingly florishe in equitie and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: but when the neglect of these Lawes had entred and pearced into the body of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, and wantonnes, licentiousnes and desire of monie had encroched into the place of these commodious orders, they lost their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme with their libertie, and the deformitie of mens manners did wholy disfigure the bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and decent proportion of that goodly Common weale. Now I come by your fauour to the Romane estate, that is, to the miracle of miracles (if any humane thing may beare so gorgious a title) surpassing farre her predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours in greatnes, happines, and continuance of time: the cause of which rare felicitie is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in truth, then the prescript of good Lawes, made by <hi>Numa,</hi> and others, howsoeuer some partially affected, doe as their seuerall fansies led thē, ascribe &amp; attribute the same to seueral causes, whose censures &amp; opiniōs giue me leaue by your
<pb facs="6"/> patience, and permission in humblenes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie to examine. That saying of <hi>Cicero</hi> seemeth not true vnto me, <hi>that militarie vertue hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the people of Rome credit, and to the Citie eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory, and hath made the whole world obedient to that Empyre:</hi>
