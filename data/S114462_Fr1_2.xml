   <head>TO THE READER</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Author of this Poem, knowing how hardly the best things protect themselves from censure, had no ambition to make it this way publique. Holding workes of this light nature to be things which need an Apologie for being written at all. Nor estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming otherwise of them, whose abilities in this kinde are most passable, then of Masquers, who spangle, &amp; glitter for the time, but tis through tinsell. As it was meerly out of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that he first wrote it, so when it was made, had it not been commanded from him, it had died upon the place, where it took life. Himselfe being so averse from raysing fame from the stage, that at the prefentment, he was one of the severest spectators there; nor ever show'd other signe whereby it might be knowne to be his, but his liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise it. Yet he hath at length consented it should passe the Presse; not with an Ayme to purchase a new Reputation, but to keep that which he hath already from growing worse. For understanding that some at <hi>London,</hi> without his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or allowance, were ready to print a false, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Coppy, he was loth to be libell'd by his owne worke; or that his Play should appeare to the world with more then its own faults. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
