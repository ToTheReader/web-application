presumptuously agaynste the lorde god
and his chosen people. Here mayst thou
see, howe vaynely and falsely the Pope
and his membres boast theimselues, of
that whyche in deede he neuer had, that
is to were, his pretenced primacye and
vsurped power ouer the vniuersall con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gregation.
Here also mayst thou plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceaue, that the Romishe byshoppe
hathe no preeminence geuen hym by
goddes holy woorde, but by the fathers
and Emperoures, and that none suche
as the Pope moste arrogantely, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste
all right, nowe taketh on hym:
but only a certayne prerogatiue in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
such as we vse of voluntacy accord
to geue to our elders. Here maist thou
beholde, the Pope caught and snared in
the nette which he layeth for other, and
ouercome with his owne argumentes,
<pb facs="5"/>
I meane the generall Counselles and
olde Doctours (which he and his mayn
tayners affirme to bee all togyther on
their part.) The author of this Treatise
a man of great antiquitie was archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Thessalonia, and successour to
the holy apostle Saint Paule, who first
traded the Thessalonians in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
fayth, and to the confirmation ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of, wrote an epistle to them, whiche we
haue at this tymered in our churches,
as a parcell of holy scripture. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
archybshop lyued not longe after
the dayes of Charles the great, aboute
whose tyme the seuenth Synode was
helde at Nice: whereof the authour in
this boke eft soones maketh mencion.
He wrote (as we may gather by conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures)
about the yere of our lord. 787.
His stile and maner of writynge is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
playne and easy, and sauereth much
of that reuerent antiquitie: as the ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the tongue maye well perceaue.
This booke of his is but breefe, yet it
conteyneth many graue sentences and
weighty reasons: it hath strong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
and piththy cōclusions, against
that loftye and arrogante authoritie of
<pb facs="5"/>
the Romishe bishop. Al the Popes lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
may blushe and be abashed, if their
faces were not harder than brasse, to
say that the byshop of Rome hath had
that authoritie and power, whyche he
now vsurpeth, in quiete possession sens
the Apostles tyme, sithe it is proued by
the most ancient doctours and holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that that whiche in dede he had,
was gyuen hym long after the apostles
tyme, and that which he nowe boasteth
hym selfe of, hath ben at all tymes, and
in all ages, denied hym by suche godly
and lerned pastors as this Nilus was.
Whose boke, as thou seest, I haue tran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>slated
into englisshe, to thende that my
countreymen, whiche are not experte
in the toungues, may be ware of them,
whiche to the mayntenance of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
authoritie, haue alwayes in their
mouthes antiquitie, antiquitie: And<note place="margin">The Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as olde as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell him selfe</note>
that they may perceyue howe lyttell ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
is ioyned with the aniquitie they
speake of, the fyrst founder wherof was
auncient Sathanas, their great grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
the old forger and father of lies,
from whom procedeth all presumption
vanitie, and vntruthe, whom the Pope
<pb facs="6"/>
and his secte, so lyuely expresse in theyr
doynges, that a mā may behold in their
hypocriticall faces replenished with all
dissimulation, a perfect patern and liue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly image of their holy father Belzebub.
In translatyng, I haue endeuoured my
self, to speake playnly that the rude and
ignorant myght rede it, to the encrease
of their knowledge in the true religion,
and to the auoidyng of such forged rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as the Pope and his complices
falsely alledge for the vpholdynge and
maynteynyng of theyr tyrannicall and
beastly kyngdome. If I wold haue stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed
for fynenesse of speche, or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
my priuate commoditie before the
profite that maye redounde to manne,
I myghte easyly in lesse tyme, more to
myne owne furtheraunce, haue fyny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
greatter thynges, and with more
fauour, yea and thankes to, at somme
mennes handes, haue abstayned from
this payneful and daungerous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.
But I rather chuse to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte
to the glorye of Christe, and his
holy churche, then to myne owne ease
and estimation. Euery weapon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we may beate downe errours and
<pb facs="6"/>
lies must be takē in hand to the defence
of the truth, neither ought we to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how fine &amp; eloquent it is, but rather
what strength, force &amp; efficacy it hath to
ouerthrow the enemies of gods veritie.
I beseche thee therfore, (good christē Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der,)
to accept what soeuer I haue done
to thy furtherance in the knowledge of
goddes eternall truth and most holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
And where as my doinges may
peraduenture seme scarce thanke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:
yet for my trauayle in thy behalfe,
suffer me not, if any thynge haue esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in translatyng, in that I minded the
good, to mysse of thy gentyll pardon.</p>
   <p>Whiche if thou graunt me, I shall not
onely thynke my self sufficiently recom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pensed
for my trauaile, but also thereby
I shalbe encoraged to attempt greater
things to thy cōmoditie. Now I protest
afore god, who knoweth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> secretes of al
hartes, that in translating herof I haue
had respecte chiefly to the commoditie
of such as for lacke of instruction, haue
ben to muche deceyued and seduced, by
the craftye sophistications and subtyll
gloses of the Pope and his impes, who
to the stuffyng of their gredy paunche
<pb facs="7"/>
and maintenance of their beastly ydle
lyfe, are not ashamed to paint their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
with fayned gloses and feble di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions.
But almyghty god hath and
wyl reuele to his elect their falsehode &amp;
subtilie, to their opē shame &amp; cōfusion.
Wherin as all true christians ought to
refuse no paynes, but to do y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vttermost
of their endeuors: so I by gods grace,
wyll neuer ceasse to doo all that I may,
eyther in translatyng, or otherwyse, to
the ende that all men may perceyue, on
howe weake a ground,<note place="margin">The papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
         <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>tes best ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes.</note> they haue gone
about by fyre and fagotte and all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
to compell men to laye the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of theyr faith. And also how that
all that they teache, as well in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as in other poyntes of religion, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teineth not one iote of sounde doctrine,
if it bee tried by the holye scriptures. I
speake not this, that I malyce the pope
or his adherentes any thing, whose per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sons, as God knoweth, I hate not, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I abho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re their detestable and
erronius doctrine: but that I myghte
drawe out of that stinckynge puddle of
wylful ignorance, as many as I could.
I hate the errour, and not the menne.
<pb facs="7"/>
Whiche if they forsake, I shall gladly
yelde them all christen loue and due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence.
Therfore I lytle esteme what
any man either of malice or ignorance,
shall report of these my doynges: kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng
that whatsoeuer the one saythe,
procedeth of a peruerse iudgement: and
what so euer the other reporteth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
of rashues, rather then of reason,
in iudgyng that which he knoweth not,
Wherfore as I regarde nat what they
saye of me in this behalfe, so I submyt
bothe this and all my dooynges to the
iudgement of the true christian reder,
whose hart god hath opened to acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge
and receaue the veritie of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wyll, besechyng almighty god of his
great goodnes and infinite mercye, to
bryng to the knowledge of his truthe,
all those whom the god of this worlde,
yet holdeth in captiuitie: that they can
not perceyue the power of saythe, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowe the Lorde aright in his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sonne Iesus Christ, our alone aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and true head of the congregation
to whome with the father and the holye
ghoste bee all honour and glorye
euerlastyng. Amen.</p>
