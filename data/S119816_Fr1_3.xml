      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ad that worthie <hi>Knight</hi> the Authour lived to haue seene this his Treatise published: he would perhaps himselfe haue giuen the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof: For by his owne directions it was put to the Presse, though it pleased God to take him to his mercy during the time of the Impression. His purpose was to haue recommended both it and himselfe vnto our most Excellent Prince <hi>CHARLES,</hi> and himselfe wrote the Dedication, which being impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto me, I conceited that it stood not with my dutie to suppresse it.</p>
   <p>Touching the discourse it selfe, as it is out of my element to iudge, so it is out of my purpose to say much of it. This onely I may boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that you shall heere find an expert Sea man, in his owne Dialect deliver a true relation of an vnfortunat Voyage: which howsoever it proved lamentable and fatall to the Actors, may yet proue pleasing to the Readers: it being an itch in our natures to delight in newnes and varietie, be the subiect never so grievous. This (if there were no more) were yet worthy your perusall: and is as much as others haue with good acceptance, afforded in relations of this nature. Howbeit besides the bare series and Context of the storie, you shall heere finde interweaved, sundry exact descriptions of Countries, Townes, Capes, Promontories, Rivers, Creekes, Harbors, and the like, not vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Navigators: besides many notable observations, the fruites of a long experience, that may giue light touching Marine accidents, even to the best Captaines and Commaunders: who if they desire to learne by precepts shall here finde store: but if examples prevaile more with them, here are also <hi>aliena pericula,</hi> if you believe mee not, reade and iudge. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
