   <head>Answer to T. W. P. his Epistle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatorie to the most Celebrious and famous Vniuersitie of Cambridge.</head>
   <q>
      <p>
         <bibl>T. W. P.</bibl>
         <hi>
            <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ngenious and learned Academians, I do not present this my labour vnto you, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hereby your patronage thereof. For how can I expect so great a fauour, since most of you dissent from me in that Religion which is here maintained? Neither as holding this poore worke, for any art therein, worthy your iudicious view. For I am not onely conscious to my selfe of mine owne weaknesse, but do also greatly admire your piercing and cleare eyed iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. To you then I exhibite it, as appealing to the Mother (such is my confidence in your impartiall and euen censures) as iudge betweene her sonne and my selfe.</hi>
      </p>
   </q>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> Saint Augustine truly said<note n="a" place="margin">Sup. Psal. 103.</note>: <hi>Paries dealbatus hypocrisis, foris tectorium, intus lutum.</hi> As in a mud wall which is whited ouer, the outward crust is faire and the inside dirt, so is hypocrisie and faigning. If this Romist had dealt plainly, he should haue dedicated his booke to the <hi>septem Dormients</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">Antonin sum. hist. p. 2. tit. 16. §. 20.</note> seauen sleepers, (for fansies are fittest for dreamers) and not to the waking and iudicious
<pb facs="14"/> Academians: their spectacles are too true for his false eies. But as Bargemen looke one way, and make their stroke another: so this Cretusian intending to gull his owne superstitious fautors, placeth the Academians in the front of his booke. But it is scarce credible, that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer which vttereth onely counterfeit coine, hath an intention to come to the touchstone. And the piercing and cleare eyed iudgment of learned Academians, is too euen and sincere a modell for a Romist to be measured by.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Poeta cum primùm ad scribendum appulit animum,</l>
      <l>Id sibi negotium credidit solùm dari</l>
      <l>Populo vt placerent quas fecisset fabulas.</l>
   </q>
   <q>
      <p>
         <bibl>T.W.</bibl>
         <hi>For whereas my designed Aduersarie at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent (to whom your Vniuersitie hath first giuen his education for literature, and since hath graced him with the inuestiture of Doctorship) in answer to a Catholike Treatis (first penned by one of my fellow laborers in the vineyard of Christ) hath written a most virulent and scandalous booke, intituling it the Way to the true Church. The which booke was found so full of corruptions, vntruths, and other such base matter, that it was holden in the opinion of many great and learned Priests, rather worthy of contempt then answer.</hi>
      </p>
   </q>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> Gregorie Nazianzene<note n="*" place="margin">Orat. 35. ad 150. episc.</note> aptly compareth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers to the fish Sepia, which muddeth the waters with a certaine blacke matter like vnto inke, that so it may escape the sight of the fisher. T. W. P. doth imitate this fish, and endeuoureth to make that muddie and blacke which is transparent.</p>
   <p>D. White by his literature and paines, and by veritie of a good cause, discouered the weaknesse and falshood of the Romish superstition. The blow which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb facs="14"/> the Popish cause, offendeth and grieueth the fautors thereof: and they hauing vnluckily succeeded in their reply about the matter, T. W. P. doth now assay to salue, and colour things with brauerie and boldnesse of words, and will make the world beleeue, if they please to hearken to him, that light is darknesse, and white is blacke. But now to the matter.</p>
   <q>
      <p>
         <bibl>T. W.</bibl>
         <hi>By one of my fellow laborers in the vineyard of Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
      </p>
   </q>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> Your fellow and you labor in the vineyard of Christ like those workmen of which Salomon speaketh: Cant. 2.15. <hi>The foxes, the little foxes, which spoile the vineyard.</hi> And whereas you reproch the Doctors booke, instyling it virulent and scandalous, I say with S. Basil, that <hi>things wholesome and good, appeare contrary to corrupt iudgments</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">Basil. Epist. 75.</note>: <hi>Et quibus os putet, omnia quae offeruntur pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida fiunt, oris non elementi vitio</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">Espenc. com. in Tit. 1.</note>: To such as haue a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mouth, each thing which is offered seemes to haue a rotten taste, &amp;c.</p>
   <q>
      <p>
         <bibl>T. W.</bibl>
         <hi>It was holden in the opinion of many great and learned Priests, &amp;c.</hi>
      </p>
   </q>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ. Mulus mulum scabit,</hi> and <hi>they which forsake the law praise the wicked.</hi> Pro. 28.4. And you receiue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor one of another, which God giueth you not. Ioh. 5.44. But howsoeuer you iudge of your selues, you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed like the <hi>Cantharides,</hi> wherof Epiphanius speaketh<note n="c" place="margin">Lib. 3. haeres. 79.</note>, <hi>Forma auricolores, venenum eiaculantes,</hi> Of a colour like gold, but casting forth mortiferous poyson. <hi>Quibus verbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa lingua est, cor verò obtenebratum</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Cyril. lib. 7. cont. Iulian.</note>: Which haue a gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die tongue full of words, but a blacke and darkened heart.</p>
   <q>
      <p>
         <bibl>T. W.</bibl>
         <hi>The Doctors booke was holden worthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb facs="15"/> &amp;c.</hi>
      </p>
   </q>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> Hucksters who intend to vtter deceitfull wares, will not sticke to disgrace better merchandise. But if the Doctors booke be so meane and contemptible, how happeneth it that it putteth you to your shifts? and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth you to flie to the <hi>blacke art</hi> for weapons against it? And yet you haue still the worst, &amp; must sit downe with losse: <hi>Et dum vis esse praedo, factus es praeda</hi>
      <note n="e" place="margin">Aug. sup. Psal. 38.</note>, Whiles you seeke to rob another of his credite, your selfe are made a prey.</p>
   <q>
      <p>
         <bibl>T. W.</bibl>
         <hi>Master White not onely in the preface of his booke, but also in diuers places of his second worke, vaunteth much of his sincere dealing: saying, my Aduersarie cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Reader with one conclusion, one doctrine, one quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one line or letter, to make him really see wherein I haue failed. This idle venditation of ingenuitie and vpright dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, hath awakened my sleepie pen, and giuen birth to this Treatise: wherein I vndertake to make good that</hi> the very ground and burden of <hi>his first booke is meere corruptions and vntruths, and other such impostures, in the euicting whereof I am so secure, that I willingly make you Iudges, &amp;c.</hi>
      </p>
   </q>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> D. White being conscious to himselfe of his vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right meaning, professeth accordingly, that he witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained nothing but the truth. Yet he neither assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to himselfe, nor any man else presumeth of him, that he failed in no sentence, quotation, line or letter. This is ouer swelling to be spoken of a greater man then D. White. Saint Augustine himselfe saith<note n="a" place="margin">Proem. l. 3. de Trinit.</note>: <hi>In omnibus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris meis, &amp;c. In all my writings I do not onely desire a pious Reader, but an ingenuous corrector.</hi> And the Doctor in the preface of his second worke vttereth this confession: I acknowledge my selfe to be a man which may erre, &amp;c.
<pb facs="15"/> They may finde in such a multitude, possibly, some to proue that the diligentest writer may be ouerseene; but the substance they cannot discredit. And in that place which you obiect, page 129. my Brother speaketh onely of the Reply against his first booke, compiled by <hi>A.D.</hi> and saith that this Iesuite was not able in that Reply to present the Reader, with any line, conclusion, &amp;c. And whereas you affirme that the ground and burden of the Doctors booke, is corruptions, &amp;c. and in euicting thereof you are so secure, &amp;c. 1. I maruell that you leaue the substance, ground and burden of the booke vntou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and do onely carpe and snatch here and there at certaine parcels. 2. Your grand securitie of euicting, &amp;c. is either in words onely, and you are compelled accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the saying of Tacitus, to succour your cause with audacious protestation, or else that is verified of you which Nazianzene saith<note n="*" place="margin">Orat. 7. p. 149.</note>: <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, Audacity is the of-spring of ignorance. But if your securitie be so firme, I intreate you that we may vnderstand the bases and principles thereof. Sure I and you are hitherto well dusted, and setting words aside, you haue performed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which may hold you from plaine running out of the field.</p>
   <q>
      <p>
         <bibl>T.W.</bibl>
         <hi>It is certainly reported, that desire of praise a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Meteor, &amp;c. first inuited Master White to support for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth with his learned hand, the threatning and falling pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of his new Church, &amp;c.</hi>
      </p>
   </q>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> This report was not hastily to haue bene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued or published, <hi>Solet enim fama mentiri</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">August. Epist. 106.</note>: Fame vseth to ouerreach (like vnto you.) The true motiue of D. White his entring into opposition with you is deliuered by him selfe<note n="a" place="margin">Epist. de did of his second booke.</note>, in these words: <hi>The condition of the place
<pb facs="16"/> where sometimes I liued, transported with much supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and being importuned with Romish Priests and their bookes, and sometimes their libels set vpon the Church dores, drew vpon me a necessitie of doing what I was able.</hi> This was the impulsiue cause of my Brothers writing, which you should rather haue taken notice of, then despiteful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue forged a fabulous motiue out of your nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery of Tales. But say what you please: Doctor White entring into the number of writers, furnished with three languages, with much reading and variety of learning, gained good respect and won reputation: your selfe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding your delamatorie and verball papers vpon the world, must expect after a while to haue the same conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to Vulcane, or spent in baser vse.</p>
   <p>And whereas you prophesie the fall of our Church, as many of your brood haue done before you<note n="b" place="margin">Harding. Greg. Val. 3. d. 1. q. 1. punct. 7. §. 23. Saunder. de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sib. Monarch. Epist. ad Pium 5. Nec parua spe ducor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediem fore, &amp;c</note>: assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly you wil be deceiued (as your Progenitors the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles<note n="c" place="margin">Aug. Psal. 70. Ad certum tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus sunt Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani, postea redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt idola, &amp;c.</note> were in the like.) And although we doubt not, but that your good will and machinations shall euer be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to further and contriue the ruine of our Church and State: (for, <hi>Cui poterit vester animus conferri, cui viperae, cui aspidi</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Chrys. hom. 7. Rom.</note>? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To what monster can we fitly compare your malicious minds<note n="e" place="margin">Maldonat. cō. Ioh. cap. 4 Qui Catholici sunt, maiore odio Caluinistas cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teros{que} omnes hereticos prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur, quam gentiles, &amp;c.</note>? to what viper? to what aspe? &amp;c.) Yet it is well with vs, that <hi>malitia non habet tantas vires, quantos conatus</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">Aug. cont. Don.</note>: Your malice is sundry waies bounded and controlled; and our Church is like to endure, <hi>ad senectam, &amp; senium &amp; vsque in finem seculi:</hi> to elder daies and old age, and the very end of the world: as S. Augustine<note n="g" place="margin">Sup. Psal. 70.</note> in the like case prophesied against the Gentiles.</p>
   <q>
      <p>
         <bibl>T.W.</bibl>
         <hi>I doubt not but by the assistance of him;</hi> Qui in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate educet iudicium, <hi>Esa.</hi> 42. <hi>and by the ensuing disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb facs="16"/> of his calumnious forgeries, so to prick the swolne blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his pride, as that all his frothy ostentation shall resolue to nothing, and that his writings like new found wels, being commonly in account onely for a yeare or two, shall for euer afterwards remaine neglected and contemned.</hi>
      </p>
   </q>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> Your presumption hath deceiued you, and your hope is proued like the spiders web. For since the time that the terrible noise of your paper shot was heard, the Doctors booke hath receiued a new impression: and euen as white when it is compared with blacke, becomes more amiable; so your blacke mouth hath added esteeme to your Aduersary. Yea like as perfume being bruised is more odoriferous, so the Orthodox way to the Church being more exactly tried and examined by meanes of your opposition, is become more acceptable and of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter report.</p>
   <q>
      <p>
         <bibl>T. W.</bibl>
         <hi>I hold it not inconuenient to giue some touch of that opprobrious tongue of his, &amp;c.</hi>
      </p>
   </q>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> The Adage is well knowne, <hi>Clodius de pudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia:</hi> A horrell declaiming of chastitie. No people vnder the Sun may worse complaine of opprobrious tongues then Romists. You spare no state, no age, no sexe: Your tongues are your owne, and are set on fire from hell. Yet your selues cannot endure to be reprooued for your most palpable wickednesse. D. White liued in those parts where you dayly exercised your trade of deceiuing, and he beheld and felt your deportment, which (howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you glory) was scarce such as can endure the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall whither you appeale.</p>
   <q>
      <p>
         <bibl>T.W.</bibl>
         <hi>And now illustrious Academians, &amp;c. make particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar triall of the chiefe grounds of our Catholike Religion, and looke backe into the continuall practise of Christs Church
<pb facs="17"/> since it first being; and assure your selues we shal not be found superstitious and blind, &amp;c. For how can they be blind who behold the articles of their faith with the eies of all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? &amp;c.</hi>
      </p>
   </q>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> The Academians haue alwaies done as you require, and thereby find you guiltie of Nouellisme. But with what face do you call the Academians to antiquity, when you daily corrupt their ancient monuments? and both forge and bring in counterfeits; and reiect and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure authenticke records, and dally with the Fathers as children do with their toyes?</p>

How many spurious and degenerous impes hath Bignaeus patched into his new tomes of old Fathers? And because Gelasius condemneth the heresie of Transubstantiation, you will suffer his workes to haue no being<note n="c" place="margin">Vid. Posseuin. Apparat. verb. Gelasius.</note>. And in like sort you deale with Epiphanius Epistle about images: and with Basils lesser questions, and with sundry other. Neither will you endure any generall Councell if it make against you; as appeareth by the Councel of Chalcedon, session 16. and by the Councell of Constance, which although it were confirmed by the Pope (as Caietan affirmeth<note n="d" place="margin">Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

   <p>And because you say that you behold all the articles of faith with the eyes of Antiquitie; let vs intreate you to shew vs these articles in Antiquitie: <hi>The authoritie of the Pope is greater then the authoritie of a Councell: and the last resolution of faith is into the Popes sentence: and his defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
