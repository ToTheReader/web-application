   <p>God hauing taken your Father out of this vale of teares, to his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting mercy in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> my selfe not onely knowing what a care hee had in his life time, that you should be
<pb facs="7"/>
brought vp godlily, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so at his death being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his will by the loue and duty which I bare him, to see you well instructed and brought vp in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I could not chuse but seeke (according as I was by duty bound) to fulfill his will in all things, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no greater comfort in the World, then to see you grow in godlinesse, that so you might meet your Father in heauen, where I am sure hee is, my selfe being a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his Faith in Christ. And seeing my selfe going out of the world, and you but comming in, I know not
<pb facs="7"/>
how to performe this duty so well, as to leaue you these few lines, which will shew you as well the great desire your Father had both of your spirituall and temporal good, as the care I had to fulfill his will in this, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was the last duty I should performe vnto him. But when I had written these things vnto you, and had (as I thought) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fulfilled your Fathers request, yet I could not see to what purpose it should tend, vnlesse it were sent abroad to you: for should it be left with the eldest, it is likely the youngest should
<pb facs="8"/>
haue but little part in it. Wherefore setting aside all feare, I haue aduentured to shew my imperfections to the view of the World, not regarding what censure shall for this bee laid vpon mee, so that heerein I may shew my selfe a louing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a dutifull Wife: and thus I leaue you to the protection of him that made you, And rest till death,</p>
