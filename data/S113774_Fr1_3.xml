      </gap>oken and wounded hart: &amp; that in such sort, as that they may not only take away dispaire, but also by the blessing of God security it self, &amp; that liberty of sinning, that some think perthance will ensue, by the setting abroch the full &amp; vndoubted assurāce of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of sin, to thē that commit sin. For howsoeuer the knowledg of the free grace of God offered in Iesus Christ in the word of peace and truth, through the corruptiō of mans hart, that turneth (as the Spider) hony into poison, may, wheras it should cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the conscience, corrupt the affections:
<pb facs="8"/> whereas it should take away dispaire, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas senselesnes: &amp; so while it should cure one disease, procure another: yet such shold be, &amp; such is the power a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For the same word of grace, that containeth the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, is not only hidden Manna to feed vs, but immortal seed to regenerate &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get vs anew. This preaching therefore of the kingdom of God, &amp; the riches of the mercy of God offred vnto sinners, should breed in thē repentance as well as saith, &amp; newnes of life as well as peace in cōsci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. According as the holy Ghost beareth witnes, saying; dispisest thou the riches of this kindnes &amp; patience, &amp; long suffering, not knowing that the boūtifulnes of God leadeth thee to repentance? The end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of all the gra es of God, giuē, offered, and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e reconciled by the body of the flesh of Christ, that we should

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>so your sins. For Christ by his own death, &amp; once offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp himselfe vpon the Altar of his crosse, hath destroyed the body as well as the soule: the being aswel as the guiltines: the power as wel as the merit of sin: be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well to sin, as for sin: to destroy the old man, as wel as to make thee a new mā: as well to make thee liue purely, as in thy life to be purified. And therefore if thou art partaker of the death of Chrst, thou must both attaine the forgiuenesse of thy sinne, which is one fruit, and part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and also the mortification and aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the bodie of thy sinne, which is the othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> part and fruit thereof. As ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is true, that there is no cōdemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thē that are in Christ: so this also is as true, that no man is in Christ, but hee that walketh not af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>er the flesh, but af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> be in
<pb facs="10"/> Christ he is a new creature. In vaine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dost thou perswade thy self to be par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taker of the forgiuenesse of thy sin, if also thou doest not denie sin, with the power therof. For assure thy selfe that the sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> spirit that washeth thee sactifieth thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: that clenseth thee renueth thee, that taketh away thy sin, destroyeth sin in thee. And learn this, that thy faith that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth the forgiuenes of sins, worketh alwaies by loue, which is the keeping of the cōmandements of the Lord, &amp; the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the law. If faith therefore puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thy heart from sin, thou wilt sease to sin. For the hart being clean, the hands wil not be vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lean: a good tree wil not bring forth euill fruit: a sweet fountain, sowre water: a good man, an euil life: a man clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed frō sin, a life stained &amp; corrupted with sin. I adde hereunto that there is no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of sin, where there is not a true repentance for sin: &amp; therefore the Lord lyeth alwaies his turning frō his wrath, to our turning from our sins: and telleth vs plainly, that except we do repēt, we shal all perish. So that except thou leaue sinne, thou art left in thy sin: except thou fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> goe sin, God w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ll not forgiue sin: except thou forsake thine offēces, thou forsakest Gods
<pb facs="10"/> mercy. How canst thou looke that the lord shuld forbeare his punishments, whē thou wilt not forbear thy sin? &amp; how dost thou looke, that the Lord should repent him of his wrath, when thou wilt not repent thee of thine offences? Moreouer know this, if thou mean not to surcease to sin, that the promises of grace, &amp; benefits of Christ appertaines not vnto thee. For as ther are 2. parts of the word of God, I meane the law &amp; the Gospel: so there are 2. kinds of men, to whom these 2. parts especially appertaine. The law belongeth to thē that are contemners of the law, &amp; to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, to the vvicked, &amp; sinners, to the vngodly &amp; prophāe, to the killers of their father, &amp; of their mother, to manslayers, te vvhoremongers, to buggerers, to theeus &amp; lyers, to periured persons, &amp; if there be any thing else that bee contrary vnto holesome doctrin. But the Gospel with the promises of graue appertaineth vnto thē that are heauy loden, that mourn, &amp; are oppressed with their sins, which being tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled, are by the law as by a school-master brought vnto, &amp; so into Christ: in whō whosoeuer is, he is not vnder the law but vnder grace. If therefore thou he not in some regard of the number of this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="11"/> sort, assure thy selfe, that the promise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> of mercie appertaine not vnto thee. An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> therefore, if thou being an obstinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, appropriate them vnto thy selfe, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> those things that are proper vnto thee First therfore clense thy hands thou hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crit, &amp; thy hart thou doble minded man, &amp; then come &amp; talke with the Lord, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fortable, &amp; that, that which I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten may be profitable. The framing of thy self to the obediēce of faith, together with the right vse of these, &amp; other the cōforts of the Lord, may both stop the mouths o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> those that inueigh against ouermuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb facs="11"/> as that which wil lay opē, as they say, a gap to al sin &amp; Epicurisme: &amp; also cause me not to repent my selfe of my labor, whē I shall see thee bettered, &amp; the weak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted: thee cast downe, &amp; the humble lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp: thee to be full of obedience, &amp; the mourners ful of comfort: when God shall be glorified, &amp; man shal haue cause to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the liuing Lord. For these causes, good brother, haue I entred into this actiō, &amp; contriued &amp; cōpiled this discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the forgiuenes of thy sins. A mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (though plentifull, &amp; full of comfort: insomuch, that it might in either regard haue excited many to haue handled the same) yet either with such breuity, or with so light a hand passed ouer, as that I feared not, least I should, as they say, wash a tile, sow of another mans seed, if I wrote any thing therof. I therefore, (although I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my selfe to be thē most vnfit of many or rather any other to wade in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of so great importance, yet not at the least experiēced perchāce of all other) haue vndertaken this, whether labor or losse, &amp; haue committed to the presse, that which I haue writte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
