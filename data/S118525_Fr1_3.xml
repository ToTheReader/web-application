   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
   <argument>
      <p>In which the occasions of the penning and publishing this Treatise, as also the argument of the same are briefly deliuered. Moreouer, to free the Protestant readers minde before hand from obstinacy, three points are proued euen out of writers of the newe religion: first, that more of the said religion condemne euery particular persons beliefe of that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, then approue it; secondly, that manifest truthes are denied and falshoods mainetained by the chiefe sectaries; lastly, that according to the confession of the same Authours, our religion and faith is true, theirs false.</p>
   </argument>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F justly he be judged by our Lord and Sauiour vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of reproach (CHRISTIAN READER,) vvho <hi>minding to build a towre,</hi>

      <hi>doth not first sit downe and reckon the charges that are necessary, whether he haue to finish it,</hi> but <hi>after that he hath laid the foundation,</hi> for want of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is constrained to leaue his worke imperfect; I knowe not howe diuers of this our vnhappy time can be excused from blame, vvho spend al the daies of their liues in laying the foundation of a towre, and neuer come so far as to place one stone there-vpon. Our principal endeauour in this vvorld ought to be, to erect in our soules a towre or spiritual edifice of vertue, the ground of vvhich edifice is faith; and such is the misery of these our daies,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 12.</note> that diuers persons are so farre from building <hi>vpon this foundation gold, siluer, or pretious stones,</hi> that they doe nothing else but alwaies busie themselues about the said foundation: my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that they so occupy or rather vexe themselues continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in discussing matters concerning their beliefe, that they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="4"/>
remaine alwaies wauering without any sure ground of faith, or at the least if not altogether, verily for the most part wholy neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their spiritual progresse in vertues of higher perfection. In which their manner of proceeding I say, they cannot be censured lesse faulty then he, who consumeth the whole course of his life in laying the foundation of a house or sumptuous pallace, and neuer goeth or seeketh to goe so farre as to build the walles or any other part of the same. Nay, the first must needs be deemed much more faulty then this fond builder, because their edifice is of greater importance, then the setting vp of any such material house or pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>
   <p>I intend not hereto shew by the authority of the holy Scripture, and the testimonies of the auncient Fathers (both which yeeld me most plentiful proofes in this matter) that faith is only the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not the whole cause of our justification; neither is there any great neede in this place of entering into any such discourse. For besides that no man according to the rules of reason, can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme him a perfect Christian, vvho doth only beleeue rightly without proceeding any further (because certaine it is that faith of it selfe doth only perfect the vnderstanding and not the vvil, and that a right vnderstanding profiteth litle except the wil be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable it is euen as apparant;) moreouer, this assertion as far forth as it conduceth to my purpose, seemeth to be granted euen by our aduersaries the followers of the newe religion. For they distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish especially two sorts of faith,<note place="margin">See part <hi>2.</hi> of this Treatise chap. <hi>2.</hi>
      </note> the one they cal a <hi>faith histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> the other <hi>a faith justifying:</hi> the first they confound vvith that which we hold being joyned with hope and charity to justifie vs, and this they deny not to be the ground, not the vvhole cause of our justification (for this effect and prerogatiue they attribute to the second of vvhich hereafter:) vvherefore, euen according to their doctrine the truth of that vvhich I haue auerred must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding, it may be objected against it, that the misteries and articles of our faith are diuers, &amp; aboue the reach of our natural reason; and therefore that a great time is requisite to this, that the truth of euery one of them be throughly searched, &amp; a certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution concerning euery point setled. I answere, that this in very deede (if al be true which is taught by the said followers of the new
<pb n="3" facs="4"/>
religion) cannot be denied: for they making the bare letter of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, the only rule and guide of their faith, must conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in like sort affirme, that no man can euer come to a certaine knowledge what is to be beleeued touching the articles of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except by diligent discussion he plainely and infallibly drawe the truth from the said letter of holy Scripture; which if he could by any meanes compasse, yet he cannot doe, vnlesse among other thinges he reade ouer the whole Bible, conferre one place vvith another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so in this study consume almost al the daies of his life.</p>
   <p>But according to the truth, God who is goodnesse it selfe, hath farre otherwise and better prouided for those that are desirous to serue him, and more richly to adorne their soules with vertue. For he hath ordained a visible guide indued vvith life and reason, and therefore apt to instruct and judge, vvhose doctrine and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath warranted from errour and falsehood; of whome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery person vvith diuine assurance of truth, in a very short time may perfectly be taught what he is to beleeue. For the better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of this, he hath also left in her sacred bosome other more particuler but diuine and infallible grounds, besides his holy writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, whereby we are to be directed in faith. And this guide is our holy mother the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church, the sacred spouse of Christ and his mistical body.</p>
   <p>Now therefore to proceed in mine intended discourse, because it behoueth euery man (as appeareth by that which hath bin alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy said) with al speed to order that his beliefe be right, and likewise because this may soone be learned of the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church; hence it proceedeth, that no treatises touching controuersies of religion are commonly more necessary, then such as declare what congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or company of Christians are the said one, holy, <hi>Catholike</hi> and Apostolike Church, proue her diuine authority, or shew what particuler groundes are found in her, by which euery person is to be guided in his beliefe. The reason of this is plaine, because who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer recurreth to this Church and these groundes, may soone and with great ease be resolued concerning al articles vvhatsoeuer to him seeming doubtful; whereas if neglecting these he betake him to the study of particular controuersies, as of justification, free wil, merit of good workes, the real presence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he may spend
<pb n="4" facs="5"/>
many daies and nights, and be nothing the nearer to a setled and sure resolution. Nay, some of these and other points are so high and difficult, that without recourse to some general groundes, and the authority of the Church directing al Christians, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that by other meanes, a man should euer assure himselfe that he is in the truth.</p>
   <p>Neither is this the opinion only of <hi>Catholikes,</hi> but also of some learned <hi>Protestants.</hi> And among others <hi>M. Field,</hi> esteemed by some one of the greatest schollars of their company,<note place="margin">Richard Field in the beginning of his Epistle Dedicatory before his fiue bookes of the Church.</note> writeth thus: <hi>The consideration of the vnhappy diuisions of the Christian world, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite distractions of mens mindes, not knowing in so great variety of opinions, what to thinke, or to whome to joine themselues (euery faction boasting of the pure and sincere profession of heauenly truth, challenging to it selfe alone the name of the Church, and fastning vpon al that dissent, or are otherwise minded, the hateful note of schisme and heresie) hath made me euer thinke, that there is no part of heauenly knowledge more necessary, then that which concerneth the Church. For seing that controuersies of religion in our time are growen in number so many, and in nature so intricate, that few haue time and leasure, fewer strength and vnderstanding to examine them; what remaineth for men desirous of satisfaction in thinges of such conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but diligently to search out, which amongst al the societies of men in the world, is that blessed company of holy ones, that house-hold of faith, that spouse of Christ, and Church of the liuing God, which is the pillar and ground of truth? that so they may embrace her communion, followe her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and rest in her judgement. Hence it commeth that al wise and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious men, doe more esteeme bookes of doctrinal principles, then those that are written of any other argument; and that there was neuer any treasure holden more rich and pretious by al them that knewe howe to price and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue thinges aright, thou bookes of prescriptions against</hi> Heretikes: <hi>for that thereby, men that are not willing or not able to examine the infinite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that arise among men concerning the faith, haue general directions what to followe, and what to auoide:</hi> Hitherto are <hi>M. Fields</hi> vvordes. And like as this <hi>Protestant</hi> Doctor yeeldeth this reason among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for the publication of his bookes of the Church: so in very truth, the same motiue hath partly moued me to publish some of my labours to the viewe of the world. We <hi>Catholikes</hi> haue a long time wished and endeauoured, to bring the controuersies of these times to certaine <hi>general groundes</hi> and <hi>doctrinal principles,</hi> and haue
<pb n="5" facs="5"/>
fought by al meanes to drawe our aduersaries to this issue to which <hi>M. Fields</hi> vvordes seeme to tend: I meane, to perswade them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a judicial &amp; infallible authority in the <hi>Catholike</hi> church, which euery Christian may securely followe and is bound to obey; and then by most sure notes of the same Church deliuered by God in the holy Scripture (which be so pregnant in the old testament it selfe,<note place="margin">August. in psalm. <hi>30.</hi> Conc. <hi>2.</hi>
      </note> that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> feareth not to affirme that <hi>the Prophets haue spoken more plainely of the Church, then of Christ</hi>) to search forth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ours, or any other congregation of them be the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church: but those of our side could neuer hitherto obtaine so much at their handes. And although this man doth so gloriously here extol the judgement of the Church, as it seemeth touching al controuersies which may arise, in so much as he telleth vs that <hi>men desirous of satisfaction may followe her directions and rest in her judgement</hi> (vvhich they could not safely and securely doe if her <hi>direction</hi> and <hi>judgement</hi> could be erroneous) yet in his fourth booke following, he bereaueth her of almost al such prerogatiues, (for he saith that <hi>general Councels</hi> which be the highest courts of the Church,<note place="margin">Field booke <hi>4</hi> chap. <hi>5.</hi> §. thus touching</note>
      <hi>may erre in matters of greatest consequence</hi>) and freeth the Church her selfe from errour,<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. and cha. <hi>2.</hi> before.</note> only in certaine principal articles of Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: But of these matters more hereafter. Only this nowe suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth for my purpose, that according to his testimony; <hi>al wise and juditious men, doe more esteeme bookes of doctrinal principles, then those that are written of any other argument:</hi> vvhich if it be true, I hope the argument both of this my Treatise following, and also of an other which I haue lying by me, wil not be vngrateful, but pleasing and acceptable to al vvise and juditious persons. Moreouer, an other writer of the <hi>English</hi> Church auoucheth, that <hi>in this our last age,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Parkes in the Preface to the reader before his Apologie of three testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pture, &amp;c. printed anno <hi>1607.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie and Infidelity joining their desperate forces together, labour mightily to subuert and ouerthrowe al the groundes of Christian religion:</hi> vvhich if it be likewise truly affirmed, a discourse discouering the fountaine of this euil, and establishing such groundes as <hi>Heretikes</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> seeke to impugne, cannot be thought vnprofitable.</p>
   <p>Only my rashnesse in vndertaking such great matters, and my want of wit and learning shewed in performing them, may seeme worthy of blame. But pardon me <hi>gentle Reader</hi> it was (as I may say) by chance, both that I entered into discussing such thinges, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that my writings euer came to light. Some fewe yeares since a
<pb n="6" facs="6"/>
      <hi>Catholike</hi> gentleman being entred into some communication with a <hi>Protestant</hi> minister, requested me to set him downe some briefe reasons for the <hi>Catholike</hi> part, vpon vvhich he might stand: I did so, and I comprehended some twelue reasons in some three sheets of paper, vvhich al vvere drawne from general groundes and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal principles. Not very long after, I giuing my selfe alwaies to the study of controuersies, and hauing no learned friend at hand with whome I might conferre, the more to perfect my selfe in such kinde of arguments (vvhich vvithout conference or vvriting can hardly be done) it came into my minde to enlarge my selfe much more vpon the said reasons. And truly, so much matter occurred vnto me being busied in these exercises, that I thought it meete to deuide my twelue reasons into two treatises: of vvhich, the one I called a treatise of the groundes of the old and newe religion, the other a treatise of the definition and notes of the Church. Hauing finished the first, I communicated it to some one or two of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friends, who were desirous to see it; and so by some meanes it came to the sight of some persons esteemed learned and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who thought it might profit many if it were more common, and therefore were desirous to haue it printed. This was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of my writing in this kinde, and thus the one of these trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises besides my first intention or expectation, is nowe passed the print; I trust without any rash presumption or boldnes in me, seing that I rather haue yeelded to the desire and aduise of men thought to be of mature judgement, discretion, and learning, then for any other respect haue followed my owne fancy or inclination.</p>
   <p>Nowe, to giue my reader here a certaine taste of the contents of that which I intend here to publish, as also of my manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeeding, I thinke it meete to aduertise him, that in it I haue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by apparant arguments proued two thinges: the one, that we <hi>Catholikes</hi> ground our faith and religion vpon the diuine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, the other that our aduersaries (I meane the newe se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries) build their faith and religion (I take these vvordes in an ample signification) vpon their owne judgments. The first is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the first part, in which I haue shewed such groundes as the <hi>Catholikes</hi> build on, to be of diuine authority: The second in like sort is conuinced to be true in the second part, vvhere I haue declared euen to the eie, that the followers of the newe religion
<pb n="7" facs="6"/>
reject al other such groundes besides the holy Scripture: vvhich also I haue proued them to reject and receiue, translate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound not according to any diuine ground, but as it liketh their owne fancies; &amp; consequently I haue demonstrated, that in summe they haue no other foundation whereon they build, but this, that their beliefes seeme true to their owne natural reason.</p>
   <p>It may be demanded what proofes I vse in these my discourses. I answere in fewe vvordes, that I bring forth proofes out of the holy Scripture, I alleage the auncient Fathers and vvriters, such as liued and wrote within the first sixe hundred yeares after Christ, which some <hi>Protestants</hi> challenge to haue beene of their faith and religion, and therefore allowe of their testimonies: I cite moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the sentences of diuers Sectaries of these our daies, vvho con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that to be true which I endeauour to proue, not the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> Libertines, <hi>Tritheists,</hi> Trinitarians, or of any others commonly by <hi>Protestants</hi> censured to be <hi>Heretikes;</hi> but of such as are vsually by al sorts accknowledged to be writers of their <hi>Protestant</hi> family, and members (as they say) of their reformed Churches. In alleaging of which sentences of our aduersaries, for the benefit of those that vnderstand not the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, I haue obserued this as much as I could, that I haue taken them out of bookes either written in <hi>English,</hi> or translated into <hi>English,</hi> that so euery person might easily turne vnto them. Neither ought the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of such sectaries to be thought by any man a weake argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for what proofe almost, being not diuine, can be of greater force then the confession of an aduersary or enemy, touching the truth of that which is censured false by his doctors, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of him whome he hateth and impugneth; or the falsehood of his owne chiefemasters doctrine, and the guiltinesse of himselfe, or such as he loueth, or are of his owne brotherhood? And hence it is, that <hi>M. Whitakers</hi> a <hi>Protestant</hi> of no meane fame,<note place="margin">Whitaker de Eccles. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouers. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>14.</hi> pag. <hi>366.</hi>
      </note> graunteth that argument to be strong, which is drawne from the confession of aduersaries. Finally, sometimes I bring forth some natural reasons and congruences, prouing the conueniency of that which is auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. For we may wel assure our selues (so if I doe not forget my selfe saith <hi>S. Augustine</hi>) that God hath done vvhatsoeuer in right reason vve shal finde to be best. These be the proofes of mine as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions, and others then these I seldome or neuer vse.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="8" facs="7"/>But the better to declare my sincere dealing herein, and also to shew the force of such testimonies of auncient Authors as I alleage, I haue added before this treatise a table of al such Councels extant as I finde celebrated within the said first sixe ages; as likewise of al the writers of those times, which I finde to haue left any workes commonly alleaged in schooles to their posterity. I haue moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer noted out of good and approued authors, the yeare in vvhich such Councels were celebrated, and in which such writers either flourished or departed out of this world. Al these things I haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with as great sincerity as the want of bookes hath suffered me. And in very deede I may truly protest, that willingly and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly I haue wronged no one writer in misalleaging his wordes or meaning, be he <hi>Catholike,</hi> or be he <hi>Protestant;</hi> be he Auncient, or be he Moderne. It may be some faults haue escaped me, but against my wil. Neither doth our <hi>Catholike</hi> cause neede any such jugling or false dealing, the truth is so manifest on our side, and the proofes of the same so many and pregnant.</p>
   <p>But before my reader enter into the viewing of these my discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that he may reape the greater profit of his labour, I must ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly craue one thing at his handes, to wit: that if he be of an other religion then is here defended, before hand he doe not harden his hart, and vvith obstinacy determine not to change his opinion or practise, whatsoeuer he heare, reade, or vnderstand said against it, or in proofe of an other way. It behoueth euery Christian to be of <hi>a right hart</hi> and <hi>a good wil.</hi> Much is said in the holy Scripture, both in commendation of the one and of the other. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Psalmes, often commendeth them that are <hi>recti corde, right in hart,</hi> and in particular inuiteth them to the praise of almighty God. The Angels at the birth of our Lord did sing this Hymne:<note place="margin">
         <hi>Luke</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 14.</note>
      <hi>Gloria in altissimis Deo, &amp; in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis: Glory in the highest to God, and in earth peace to men of good wil.</hi> And who hath <hi>a right hart</hi> and is of <hi>good wil?</hi> Verily, he that doth not obdurate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe against God, but is desirous and by al meanes seeketh to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his wil to Gods wil, vvhich is the right and straite rule, by vvhich al our thoughts and actions are to be squared and tried. Of my reader therefore if he be a <hi>Protestant</hi> I desire no more, but that he bring his hart and wil to this disposition, if it be not so disposed already; that he be desirous to serue God in his true Church, and
<pb n="9" facs="7"/>
casting off al obstinacy he be indifferent either to this or that, so that he might be throughly informed of the truth. Lastly, that he humbly craue of God, that if his beliefe be not right, he wil merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vouchsafe to giue him grace and meanes vvhereby he may finde out the truth.</p>
   <p>And because I esteeme this disposition in that <hi>Protestant</hi> vvhich intendeth to reade this Treatise, to be a matter of great moment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his conuersion, I thinke it conuenient briefly here to touch among diuers others which occurre, some two motiues, which in my judgement are very sufficient to drawe any man from obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the newe religion, yea be he of what sect soeuer, to make him doubtful of the sincerity of that faith and religion which he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. Of these the first shal be, that as many (I may say more) and as vertuous, and as learned euen of the <hi>Protestant</hi> side, condemne his said faith and religion as erroneous, as there doe approue it as true. For if he be a <hi>Zwinglian,</hi> a <hi>Caluinist,</hi> or an <hi>English Protestant,</hi> although his temporal Magistrates and his learned Masters tel him that he is of a sound beliefe, and a true member of Christs Church, yet <hi>Luther</hi> and al the <hi>Lutherans</hi> affirme in plaine tearmes and that vvith great vehemency, neuerthelesse deliberately and aduisedly, that he is an <hi>Heretike;</hi> and consequently, is guilty of that crime which the<note n="*" place="margin">Apologie of the Church of Englād part. <hi>1.</hi> pa. <hi>28. 29.</hi>

      <hi>Caluin</hi> with al his <hi>Caluinists, English Protestants</hi> and <hi>Puritans</hi> tel him the like. So that be he of what <hi>Sacramentary</hi> sect soeuer he please, his faith and religion receiueth a three-fold censure that it is false, and that from his owne bretheren. For first it is condemned by the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> then by the <hi>Zwinglians</hi> and <hi>English Protestants</hi> if he be a <hi>Puritan,</hi> or <hi>Caluinist;</hi> or by the <hi>Zwinglians</hi> and <hi>Puritans</hi> or <hi>Caluinists</hi> if he be an <hi>English Protestant;</hi> or finally by the <hi>English Protestants</hi> and <hi>Caluinists</hi> (among vvhome I number the <hi>Puritans</hi>) if he be a <hi>Zwinglian.</hi> And what wise man wil be obstinate in the defence of such a faith?

      <hi>Conradus Schlusselburge</hi> placeth six sects of his owne <hi>Lutherans</hi> in the Catalogue of <hi>Heretikes,</hi> of vvhich the one condemneth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and he giueth the same sentence against them al. But because fewe or no <hi>Lutherans</hi> as is probable, wil euer come to the reading of this Treatise, I wil not stand to discusse and proue these thinges at large and in particular: And therefore concerning this motiue let this suffice.</p>
   <p>A second reason or motiue, which is sufficient to exclude obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy from the hart of any one of the followers of the newe religion, is; that al the learned and principal sectaries as <hi>Luther,</hi> Zwinglius, <hi>Caluin</hi> &amp; others, haue notoriously and grosly erred in some points or other touching religious matters. The short limits of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face wil not suffer me to declare the truth of this in them al, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wil exemplifie only in the three named, which be the heades of the rest. And to beginne with <hi>Luther;</hi> did not this great Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke
<pb n="13" facs="9"/>
and father of al <hi>Protestants</hi> teach and obstinately hold, that Christ suffered on the crosse and died according to his diuinity? thus he writeth:<note n="a" place="margin">Luth. in cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. majori de coena Domini &amp; lib. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilijs. part. <hi>2.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>If I beleeue that only the humane nature of Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for me, Christ is a base Sauiour, not of any great price, or value, yea be himselfe needeth a Sauiour.</hi> Hence <hi>Zwinglius</hi> exclaimeth:<note n="b" place="margin">Zwingl. to. <hi>2.</hi> in respons. ad Lutheri cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fess. fol. <hi>458. 469. 470.</hi> &amp; in respons. ad Luther. lib. de Sacra. f. <hi>411. 401. 337.</hi> &amp;c.</note>
      <hi>This can by no reasons be explaned or excused.

Neuerthelesse it being oppugned and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by some <hi>Caluinists,</hi> the same author replied vvith an other booke vnto which he gaue this title; <hi>Absurda, absurdorum absurdissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Caluinistica absurda,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The absurde, the most absurde of absurde, Caluinistical absurde thinges, that is, an inuincible demonstration, logical, philosophical, theological, of some horrible paradoxes of the</hi> Caluinian <hi>doctrine in the article of the person of Christ, the supper of the Lord, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and predestination of the children of God, written by</hi> M.

Lord and Sauiour. I neede not alleage any <hi>Protestant</hi> authours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing him of this impiety, for his wordes be plaine, and his bookes are in euery mans handes.

Let this then be the first proposition made of <hi>Caluins</hi> vvordes: If Christ <hi>feared not the curse and wrath of God he was more tender and more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then the most part of the rascal sort of men:</hi> for <hi>theeues and other euil doers doe obstinately hast to death, many doe with haughty courage despise it, some other doe mildly suffer it;</hi> whereas Christ <hi>was astonished and in manner stroken dead with feare of it.

proue after this sort: The <hi>Puritans</hi> in their <hi>Christian and modest offer</hi> (so they tearme it) <hi>of a most indifferent conference tendered</hi> not long since to the <hi>Protestant Arch-bishops, Bishops, and al their adherents,</hi> plainely affirme; that if their <hi>Puritan</hi> propositions be denied, and the <hi>Protestants</hi> haue the truth on their side, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the true Church of Christ.

      <hi>Diuers of the aforesaid propositions are such</hi> (say they) <hi>that if the Ministers should not constantly hold and maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the same against al men, they cannot see howe possibly (by the rules of diuinity) the seperation of our Churches from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and from the</hi> Pope <hi>the supreame head thereof; can be justified.</hi> And againe in the <hi>eight</hi> consideration, hauing yeelded an other reason, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>they cannot but make opposition to the Prelates, in approuing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions aboue specified,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. <hi>16.</hi>
      </note> they adde: <hi>wherein if they</hi> (the <hi>Puritan</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters who make this offer) <hi>be in errour, and the Prelates on the contrary haue the truth, they protest to al the world, that the</hi> Pope <hi>and the Church of</hi> Rome (<hi>and in them God and Christ</hi> IESVS <hi>himselfe) haue great wrong and indignity offered vnto them, in that they are rejected, and that al the</hi> Protestant <hi>Churches are</hi> Schismatical <hi>in forsaking vnity and communion with them:</hi> Hitherto are the <hi>Puritans</hi> vvordes. Hence (vvhich is a point vvorthy to be noted) they promise their reconciliation vnto vs, if we can proue the falshood of their assertions, which promise they make not to the <hi>English Protestants.</hi> For thus they goe on in the first place alleaged: <hi>And therefore for as much as in these controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, the</hi> Papists <hi>and the Prelates goe hand in hand, the said Ministers doe in like manner make the like offer to the</hi> Priestes <hi>and</hi> Iesuites, <hi>promising their reconcilement vnto that See</hi> (of Rome) <hi>if they can either by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pul them from the aforesaid propositions, or can answere such argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they shal propound in the defence of them, in manner and forme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore specified in the offer. And therefore it both stands the Ministers vpon to make the aforesaid offer, and the Prelates (except they wil haue al the world to judge them to be friendes in hart to</hi> Popery) <hi>to accept of the same:</hi> Thus the <hi>Puritan</hi> Ministers, and no such offer that I finde through the whole booke is made to the <hi>Protestants.</hi> This then is affirmed by these men, that if the <hi>Protestant</hi> doctrine mainetained against them be true, and their assertions be false, the separation of the newe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries
<pb n="21" facs="13"/>
Churches from ours, cannot be justified; yea they auouch that if this be so, that their said Churches are schismatical. Vnto which if we adde, that in very deede the <hi>propositions</hi> which the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans offer</hi> to <hi>mainetaine against the Prelates,</hi> are false and erroneous (the truth of which assertion is confessed &amp; with great vehemency defended by al the <hi>English Protestants,</hi> and further concerning some of the said propositions very vvel proued by <hi>Hooker,</hi> Whitgift, Bilson, <hi>Couel,</hi> and others of their company) we shal haue our desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red conclusion, that according to the doctrine of the <hi>English</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries the <hi>Puritans</hi> and the <hi>Protestants,</hi> our aduersaries Churches are Schismatical, and that ours is the true Spouse of Christ.</p>
   <p>But I must not here omitte by the way to aduertise my reader, that in the judgement of any wise and judicious person, this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment yeelded vs by our aduersaries, cannot but also be a very strong proofe of the truth of our <hi>Catholike</hi> cause. For vvhosoeuer maturely considereth the matter, shal finde that the <hi>Protestants</hi> in rejecting the <hi>Puritan propositions,</hi> followe the prescript and rule of holy Scriptures, the decrees of Councels, and the tradition of the Church and Fathers. He shal also perceiue, that the <hi>Puritans</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouching that which I haue related, build vpon very good reasons flowing out of the very nature of the <hi>Protestant</hi> religion, and taken from the proceedings of the vpholders of the same in defending it: because out of the doctrine and practise defended by the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> against the <hi>Puritans,</hi> as also out of the proofes and reasons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged for themselues, very strong arguments may be drawne to confirme the truth of our whole <hi>Catholike</hi> religion, as wil sometimes appeare in my treatise following. And to giue here one instance, the <hi>Protestants</hi> for the authority of Arch-bishops bring diuers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and among others this one, that peace and vnity can other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hardly be maintained in the Church.

I haue already demonstrated, that if they al say true our Church is the true Church of Christ: so it is also euident, that if it be so that they al say true, it is also needful there be one supreame head of the vvhole Church militant;<note place="margin">Suruay, &amp;c. chap. <hi>29.</hi> pag. <hi>372.</hi>
      </note> for thus I argue. <hi>Cartwright</hi> a principal <hi>Puritan,</hi> esteemed by those of his owne sect (as the aforesaid author noteth) one of the only worthies of the world, telleth vs that the <hi>Popes</hi> authority is more necessary ouer al Churches, then the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of an Arch-bishop ouer a prouince: but the authority of an Arch-bishop as al our <hi>Protestants</hi> defend, is necessary ouer a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince; therefore the <hi>Popes</hi> authority is necessary ouer al Churches.</p>
   <p>It may be objected, that these arguments are taken from persons of sundry sectes, of which the one confesseth the other to erre. I grant it, but this notwithstanding they proue, that either some <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> sectaries erre, or otherwise that our religion by them rejected is true, which sufficeth my purpose. Neuerthelesse, the <hi>Protestants</hi> themselues doe afford vs no such reasons? Truly, if I were not here restrained to the vvriting only of a preface, I could assigne diuers: one I wil set downe for an example.<note place="margin">

      <hi>M. Field</hi> in his <hi>third booke of the Church</hi> plainly confesseth, that <hi>in sundry Churches of the world</hi> (being of the newe religion) <hi>diuers worthy Ministers of God were ordained by Presbiters</hi> (or Priestes sometime of our Church) and had no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from any Bishop. Nay he seemeth apparantly to graunt, that <hi>none but Presbiters did impose handes in ordaining Ministers or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents, in many of the pretended reformed Churches; as namely in those of</hi> France <hi>and others,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Morton in Apolog. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thol. part. <hi>1.</hi> lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>21.</hi>
      </note> which is also insinuated by <hi>D. Morton.</hi> And therefore both these Doctors teach, that in time of necessity a Priest or Minister may impose handes and consecrate a Priest, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently also a Bishop or a Superintēdent Out of this their doctrine I frame this argument: seing that diuers Superintendents and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the newe religion, I may say al at the least of some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries (for <hi>Field</hi> himselfe excepteth only those of <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Denmarke and of some other places,</hi> which places he nameth not) haue had their ordination or orders only from Priests, it followeth, that if Priests haue no power of ordination, that is of giuing orders, that such Ministers and Superintendents are no true Ministers and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents: But Priests according to the assertion of a principal <hi>English Protestant,</hi> haue no power of ordination, and can giue no orders; therefore such Superintendents and Ministers are no true
<pb n="23" facs="14"/>
Superintendents and Ministers. Of which I also inferre, that such Churches are no true Churches, for they want a true ministery and clergy, without which as<note n="*" place="margin">Field ibid. pag. <hi>154.</hi> and booke <hi>2.</hi> chap. <hi>6.</hi> pag. <hi>51.</hi>

      <hi>Field</hi> confesseth there can be no Church. And this <hi>English Protestant</hi> is<note n="a" place="margin">William L.

      <hi>not one is to be shewed through the whole story Ecclesiastical, that any besides a Bishop did it; and that if some of the inferiour ranke presumed to doe it, his act was reuersed by the Church for vnlawful,</hi> which he proued by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. As for scripture he auoucheth there is <hi>none either of holy men, or of the holy Ghost,</hi> which doth giue such authority to Presbiters: <hi>for al the fathers</hi> (saith he) <hi>with one consent doe contradict it.</hi> And among others he alleageth <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> affirming that <hi>it is consonant neither with Gods nor mans lawe, that any besides a Bishop should doe it.</hi> Of the scriptures he writeth thus: <hi>No scripture of the holy Ghost, either anago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically by consequent, or directly by precept</hi> doth justifie it. <hi>For analogie, none but the Apostles did it,</hi> or <hi>might doe it (as before you heard) not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for to what Presbiter was the authority committed as a Presbiter,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> plainely contradicteth the other two <hi>English Protestant</hi> doctors. And hence it manifestly appeareth, that either the said Bishop erreth in denying this power to Priests, or that the said Doctors are false in yeelding it vnto them: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it is plaine, that some <hi>English</hi> sectaries fal into error. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, seeing that the Bishop conuinceth by such good proofes the truth of his assertion, and the said two Doctors confesse some of their Churches to haue no other Pastors, but such as were ordered by Priests or Presbiters, it is euen as apparant, that such their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are in very truth no true Church.</p>
   <p>But it is nowe high time that I end my discourse touching this point, yea that I conclude this my preface. Being therefore the truth of mine accusation that the learned sectaries, as <hi>Luther,</hi> Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius,
<pb n="24" facs="15"/>
      <hi>Caluin,</hi> and others haue notoriously and grosly erred, is so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently demonstrated by a fewe instances which I haue related a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong diuers others which I haue omitted; let me nowe demand of my christian reader, what reason he hath to ground the euerlasting estate of his soule, either vpon the judgment of his learned masters, or vpon his owne? And first concerning his learned masters he can not deny, but they haue al erred in some point or other; and doth not an errour in one thing proue a possibilitie of erring in others of like sort? But haue his captaines any further vvarrant concerning one article, then touching an other? They haue not vvithout al doubt. Howe doth he then knowe that they haue not erred in al points in which they dissent from the ancient beliefe of al Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans their predecessours? He vvil perhaps answere, that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wel they erre not touching this and that, although their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be neuer so erroneous touching other points. Loe nowe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth al to his owne judgement; I joine therefore here with him, and first I aske vvhat more strong vvarrant he hath that he cannot erre, then had his learned masters? Is he comparable to them either in wit, learning, piety, or dignity of vocation? If he be not, then he is much more subject to errour then they, vvho notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding haue grosly and palpably erred. I adde also, that he taketh vpon him ouer-much in judging of such high matters, and in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring his learned Doctors when they say true and when they erre. Moreouer, I thinke there is no man liuing which hath not in some thinges or others, altered his judgement and varied from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; insomuch as he hath deemed false some thinges vvhich once seemed to him true, and judged others true which once he thought false; vvhich if it be so, vvhat wiseman in matters of so great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as are his faith and religion, vvil trust his owne judgement? For vvherefore may not he erre in one point as vvel as in an other? Nowe if he doe erre in matters pertaining to faith and religion, vvhat wil be come of his soule euerlastingly if he doth not alter his course? But howsoeuer it be, euery follower of the newe religion for the reasons assigned, hath just cause to mistrust the truth of his owne beliefe, or vvhich is yet lesse, not to be so peremptory and obstinate in his faith, that he vvil not vvith indifferency heare or reade any thing that maketh against it; which is as much as I nowe craue of my <hi>curteous Reader.</hi>
