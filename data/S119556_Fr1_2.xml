   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Shall not neede to
vse many words ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this small
Treatise, seeing the
bare name of him
that was the cheife
Author therof, I suppose may be enough
to obtaine sufficient esteeme for it, with
those that haue knowne him, either by
his learned writings, or powerfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.
Nor of Apologie for my selfe in
aduenturing to cast this little mite into
the Lords Treasury from him that
hath beene able to giue such abundance
in greater Volumes, seeing it pleased
<pb facs="3"/>
him to commit vnto my care both this
and other of his labours, earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that if there were any thing found
among his writings, that might bee
thought profitable for the publike good,
I should vse my best endeauour to haue
it published; I haue therefore thought
it my duty to the liuing if not to the
dead, that the end aymed at by him
might not be frustrated: Some of his
workes haue beene published since his
death, and more haue beene long since
ready for the Presse; which I hope shall
ere long come forth. I know it was the
Authors purpose to haue made a more
compleate and exact Catechisme if the
Lord had prolonged his life; but he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
finished his allotted taske, God
tooke him home to rest from all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
howeuer it was his desire in the
meane time to publish these short
grounds, for the benefit of the younger
sort, which are very briefely propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the helpe of memory, and
<pb facs="3"/>
most easie and plaine for vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the most simple; and yet if wee
marke them, wee may perceiue very
much matter comprehended in a few
words. It comes vnto thine hands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
for the most part as it was left
by him, very little being added or
altered; the whole frame I haue cast
into a short Table at the beginning,
to the end the learner may first see
and learne the whole methode and
substance in a few words; as also I haue
set downe the substance (at least) of
those speciall proofes that confirme
these Principles; to the end thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
saue thy labour for searching the
places of Scripture quoted, as also
that such as learne the Answeres, they
may by degrees learne also, and know
the words of the chiefe proofes; for
by this meanes they may profit more
soundly, when their faith shall bee
grounded not vpon the weake founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of humane Authoritie; but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="4"/>
the most perfect and sure words of
God; learne them therefore diligently,
and the Lord giue thee vnderstanding
in all things.</p>
