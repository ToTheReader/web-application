   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL SIR Iohn Rooper knight, of Lynstead parke in Kent, pencioner <hi>to the Queenes most excellent Maiestie, and one of the</hi> Prothonotaries to her Maiesties highnesse honourable court of the Bench at Westminster W. C. wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth long life, increase of worship and continual health.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue vvell regarded manie out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward testimonies (right worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) from your invvarde desire, freely addressed tovvardes lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and vertue. And for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall exercise of those indovve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in you, am mooued the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to iudge, that God blesseth you in Iacob, and the vvorld loueth you vvith Solon For as you haue attained high preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in this life, you do not possesse nor inioy thē, vvith <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> the Philosopher, otherwaies then gods vvill and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure hath allotted you, preferring a contēplatiue care, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the transitorie reach thereof. Therefore I might the more boldly vtter your Heroycall life to be matched and performed vvith the good indeuours of that noble knight Scipio Affricanus, for vvhose behalfe Lelius, in the best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree dischargeth his dutie, and in three respectes aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth before the senat, the chiualrie of his noble knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, As chiefly his loue to the senat, with deare fauour, and manie hard aduentures, for his countrey, and firme heart to the oppressed: so likewise, you are nothing infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to <hi>Scipio</hi> in faithfull heart towardes your prince and countrey, haue purchased an endlesse solace to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward soule thereby. And therewithall doe extend your readie benignity, and familiar friendship for incoraging of the better sorte, so your good aduise neuer faileth to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishe
<pb facs="3"/> the worser sorte. And as the tree of vertue hath sprong vp vvith you and your house, so there is a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired hope amongst all good men, that it may floorish and bring forth fruits for the benefite of the Common wealth, to the end of the worlde. Then lastly, touching the true simpathie of my heart, which in double duetie, I and mine doe owe vnto you and your house, may not vvithout some due knovvledge, and sincere seruice, pretermit to expresse in the course of this my life, by executing some thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full action for the same. Hauing therefore at this present presented and preferred vnto your worshipfull discretion, all the whole counsels and high iudgementes of Phisicke, written by those monarche Phisitions of the world, Galen, Hypocrates, Auycen, and Dyoscorides, with three bookes of Philosophie, comprehending the admirable workes of nature in the frame of all liuing things: In reading hereof you shall find most rich treasures, discouered from a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full soile, A pure vvater running from a cleare fountaine, And most sweet flowers, from the pleasant garden of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine and liberall arts. The condignitie thereof hath had a right vse and free permission for many hundred yeares before, although I haue at this present, broke the yee, and smoothed the path from the greeke and Latine, so that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie reasonable practicioner may make safe enteraunce into the bodilie health of man thereby. Beseeching your worshippe to make acceptation thereof, and pardon my boldnesse▪ committing your health, long life and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to bee continued and blessed by him that gouerneth all thinges by the instinct order of diuine power.</p>
