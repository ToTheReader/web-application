   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Yr, with my last letters of the first of Iune, I sent vnto you in writing the arraignemēt of <hi>Francis Throckmorton</hi> penned by a gētle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of good skill and credite, being present at the same and because it hath seemed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me that there is some scruple in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite touching the sufficiencie of the euidece produced against him, I haue for your better satisfaction endeuoured to attaine to more particular knowledge thereof, and by the meanes of a secret friend, there is come vnto my hands, a verse perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, of the whole proceedings helde by such as were in commission for the examining of him before his triall coutal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the materiall pointes of the treasons by him confessed, where unto there is annexed a submission written by <hi>Francis Throckmorton</hi> to the Queenes Maiestie, the fourth of Iune, whereby he acknowledgeth that he hath vntruely and vnduetifully denied his former confessions, &amp; vnder his hand writing hath eftsoones repeated and confessed the same confessions to be true (some fewe things onely detracted, but of no moment:) which may in mine opinion remooue all matter of doubt or scruple conceiued by you or by any other of his iust condemnation. You know howe well I haue alwayes loued the man, and delighted to conuerse with him in respect of the good partes wherewith he was indued, and of the pleasant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that for the most part did possesse him when hee came in companie of friendes, yeelding at no time (to my seeing) any shew or suspitiō, to haue bene a dealer in matters of that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litte: &amp; therefore I cannot but pitie his misfortune the more, wishing all men to make profite of his fal, and to note, that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie and calamitie of this kinde, doeth for the most part fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe such as forget God, to whose protection I committe you. From Lyons Inne, the 15 of Iune. 1584.</p>
