his courses <gap reason="foreign">

      </gap>, by way of counterfait and
imitation, not of the actions and dealings of
men, but of the order of Gods owne procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with his Church; holding it a sure princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in policie, That actions will be much more
effectuall, when they be framed vnto the best
presidents, then when they are suted to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of meaner examples. To this purpose,
as God hath made a Couenant with his
Church, binding himselfe by promise to be
their God, and requiring of them the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of faith and obedience; so doth Satan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
with his Subiects by mutuall confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
either solemnly or secretly; whereby they
bind themselues on the one part to obserue his
Rules, and he on the other to accomplish their
desires. Againe, God giues his Word, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of his will, and his Sacraments, the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eales of his promises, to which beeing rightly
administred and receiued, he hath tied his own
presence, and the worke of his grace in them
that beleeue. Answerably to this, the Deuill
giues a word of direction to his Instruments,
<pb facs="4"/>
and addeth vnto it, Charmes, Figures, Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
and other outward Ceremonies, at the
vse whereof he hath bound himselfe to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and to manifest his power in effecting the
thing desired. Furthermore, God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
his will to the Patriarchs, Prophets, and
Apostles, by familiar<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 18. 17.</note> conference, by<note n="b" place="margin">Num. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>s, his Sibylles, to
whome he maketh knowne things to come, by
familiar presence, by dreames, &amp;c. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
God had in the Old Testament his
Temple at Ierusalem, yea his<note n="e" place="margin">Exod 25. 22. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

of the superstitio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s Heathen. Yea, and at
this day, as the Ministers of God doe giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to the conscience in matters doubtfull
and difficult: so the ministers of Satan, vnder
the name of Wise-men, and Wise-women, are
at hand, by his appointment, to resolue, direct,
and helpe ignorant and vnsetled persons, in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of distraction, losse, or other outward cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
   <p>Now the Grounds whereupon he buildeth
his proceedings for certentie, are cunningly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from the disposition of mans heart, by
naturall all corruption, and that in three speciall
instances. First, he knowes that Man naturally

out of the light of grace, hath but<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 14. <gap reason="foreign">

      <hi>a meere
Saule,</hi> indued onely with some generall and
confused notions; and as for matters of deeper
apprehension touching God and heauenly
things, there is a vaile of ignorance and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
drawne ouer the eyes of his mind. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
though he be apt to know and worship
a God, and learne his will, yet for want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
by the word, he is prone to erre in
the practise of his notion. Here Satan applies
himselfe to mans measure, and at his owne will,
drawes the minde into error, by his delusions,
and impostures. This made the<note n="g" place="margin">2. king. 17. 29. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

Distemper in the minde of man, shewing
it selfe in these particulars, That he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to stand in feare of imminent daunger;
<pb facs="5"/>
That he swells in an high conceit of his owne
deserts, specially when he is in lower estate,
then he would be; That he will not beare a
wrong done, without reuenge; That he rests
not satisfied, with the measure of knowledge
receiued, but affecteth the searching of things
secret, and not reuealed. When the minde is
possessed with these troubled passions, with
care to helpe it selfe; then comes the Deuill,
and ministreth occasion to vse vnlawf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ll means
in the generall, and forceth the minde by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall

vpon his owne crafts. It was the case
of<note n="k" place="margin">1. Sam 28.</note> Saul, and of<note n="l" place="margin">Dan. 2. 1, 2.</note> Nebuchadnetsar. It caused
many of the Heathen Philosophers, to go from
Athens to Memphis, from Grecia to Syria, from
men on earth to wicked Spirits in hell, to get
more illumination at the hands of the Prince of
darkenesse. It mooued sundrie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">

who bewitched the people of Samaria, and
professed to doe that by the great power of
God, which he wrought by the ayde and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

   <p>If any doe thinke it strange, that Satan

   <p>Now from the consideration of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses,
we conclude it a necessarie thing for the
Church and people of God, to be acquainted
with the dealing of Satan in this kinde, that
knowing his subtill deuises, they may learne to
auoyd them. For which purpose this Treatise
was first framed, and now exhibited to your
Lordship. The iust commendation whereof,
aboue others formerly divulged touching this
Argument, appeareth herein, that it serueth to
the full opening and declaration of Satans Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode
in the ground and practises of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft.
Wherein among many other remarkable
points, it may please you to take speciall notice
of these particulars. I. That they doe grossely
erre, who either in expresse tearmes denie that
there be Witches, or in effect, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;
auouching that there is no league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them and the Deuill; or affirming they
<pb facs="6"/>
can doe no such miraculous workes, as are
ascribed to them. The former issueth plainly
our of the bodie of the Discourse. And for the
latter; That there is a Couenant betweene
them, either explicite in manner and forme, or
implicite by degrees of superstitious procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the vse of meanes insufficient in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
is plainely taught and confirmed in the
same. That Witches may and doe worke won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
is euidently prooued; howbeit not by an
omnipotent power,<note place="margin">

of wonder,</hi> because they exceede the ordinarie
power and capacitie of men, especially such as
are ignorant of Satans habilitie, and the hidden
causes in nature, whereby things are brought to
passe. II. That the Witch truely conuicted,
is to be punished with death, the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of punishment; and that by the Lawe of
Moses, the equitie whereof is perpetuall. Yea
euen the better Witch of the two in common
reputation, because both are equally enemies
to God, and all true religion; and it is well
knowne by true experience, that all professed
Sorc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>rers, are guiltie of many most monstrous
impieties. III. That the Miracles of the
Popish Church at this day, are indeed either no

corporall presence in the Sacrament, which
they affirme to be by miracle; If it were true,
then miracles were not yet ceased, but should
still be as ordinarie in the Church, as are the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.
A point not onely confuted in the
latter part of this Treatise,<note place="margin">Lib. de civ. Dei. 22. c. 8.</note> but also by the
testimonie of purer Antiquitie. Augustine
saith, <hi>That miracles were once necessarie to
make the world beleeue the Gospel; but he that
now seekes a signe that he may beleeue, is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
yea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> monster in nature.</hi> Chrysostome
conclude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> on the same grounds,<note place="margin">Homil. 19. ope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</note> that <hi>there
is now in the Church, no necessitie of working
Miracles; and calles him a false Prophet that
now takes in hand to worke them.</hi> Againe, if
there be a miracle in the Sacrament, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the nature of all those that were
wrought, either by Moses and the Prophets, or
by Christ, and his Apostles. For they were
apparent to the eye, but this is insensible; and
therfore neither of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>orce to mooue admiration,
nor to conuince the minde of man, and make
him to beleeue. As for those, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be wrought by Saints in that church;
if we make recourse to the Primitiue times,
wherein God gaue the gift, to breede faith in
the Gentiles; we shall finde that the power of
producing such workes, was neuer actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in the Apostles,<note place="margin">Act. 3. 12. 16.</note> but dispensed by their▪
<hi>in the Name of Christ:</hi> Neither was it in their
libertie, to worke miracles, when they would,
but when it pleased God, vpon speciall cause▪
<pb facs="7"/>
to ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> neither the
power nor the will was in them, much lesse
is it likely to be sound in any of the Saints.
And for their Reliques, of what name so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
so greatly magnified and resorted vnto;
we denie there is any such vertue in them. For
they may not be thought to be more effectuall
then the hem of Christs garment, from which
the power of healing the woman did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede,
but <hi>from himself<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>y commend to your Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
patronage, that vnder your protection

      </gap> part,
I haue beene hereunto induced many waies.
First, vpon a reuerent opinion of those rare gifts
of knowledge and pietie; wherewith God hath
beautified your person, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nd thereby aduanced
you to high place, and estimation in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
Whereof those your graue and
indicious speeches, euen in the weightiest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
touching God and Cesar, as also those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
learned writings, haue giuen large testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.
Frō which hath issued the greatnes of your
Name, both in the present iudgement of the
world, and in future expectation. Next out
of a resolued perswasion of your Honourable
disposition, as in generall to the whole house of
Leui, so particularly to those, whose labours
haue fruitfully flowed out of the Schooles of
the Prophets, amongst whome the Author of
this booke, in his time, was none of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest.
Lastly, by the consideration of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
arising out of a Law Iudiciall, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the calling and qualitie of a Iudge. A
Law penall in regard of the offence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sutable to his proceedings, whose office is
to heare with fauour, to determine with equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to execute iustice with moderation. A law
of the highest, and greatest weight, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
concerning God and his Honour, and
therefore appertaining to him,<note place="margin">De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

By such Motiues, I haue incouraged my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">

vnder assurance of your Lordships pardon, to
present you with that, wherein you are most

fauourable interpretation and acceptance, both
of the qualitie of the Worke, and of the paines
of the Publisher. And thus heartily wishing
to your Lordship increase of grace and honour,
with a daily influence of blessing and direction
from heauen, vpon your graue consultations
and employments, I humbly take my leaue, and
commend you to the grace of God, <hi>by whome
