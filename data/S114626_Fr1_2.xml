   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Ebtes, of what antiquitye soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, are not by delay dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, neither promises, by long protracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, impeached from performance. How iustly both these (right worshipfull) appertaine to me, though happilie out of date in your too long expectation: I may be sory for no sooner compassing, and you in fauour wil I hope receiue what comes at last, excusing all errors with
<pb facs="3"/>the common addage, better late then neuer. When your worship was high sheriffe of <hi>Stafford-shire,</hi> as some-way to expresse thankfulnesse, for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours then founde, I promised you, that in such forte as this I would ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long salute ye. But being hindred by a long sicknesse, as also conuenient meanes to discharge my promise: I could neuer till this instant be so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, as to greete you with any thing woorthie your viwe, or sufficient to plead the least parte of performance. And though my conceite heerof may be greate, yet how you shall thinke therof may well be doubted, because oppinions are as varyous, as mens hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are diuers: yet the sound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe I haue in your euer-affable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, makes mee hope, that the meannes of my gift, shall be shaddow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="3"/>with the intire depth of great good will, and what wantes in this, in some other heerafter will be better suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
   <p>Nor seek I to be free from my former bond of promise, by this sillie trifle, in respect of so great deseruing: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that your worship would take this onward, to arme ye with some hope of attayning to the rest, and that withal to expresse, I am willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue yours in dutie, till the very vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost be discharged.</p>
   <p>Both this, my selfe and what else remaynes in me, I intreat your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship kindely to conster on, for you shal finde them readie on the least oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to vse them. In meane while, praying for all happie blessings to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and follow you, as also the most vertuous Gentle-woman your wife, whom heauen enritch with blessed
<pb facs="4"/>sight of her hopes ioy: I humbly commend ye both to his protection, who hath hitherto had care of you, and will euermore comfort you.</p>
