      <l>The limits of this iust circumference,</l>
      <l>Kept with a faire and iust obedience:</l>
      <l>The Store-house of Gods treasure open stands,</l>
      <l>And with his goods fils our vnworthy hands.</l>
      <l>These riches iointly striue to satisfie;</l>
      <l>Some our delight. some our necessity.</l>

      <l>To which wise Nature inclination gaue:</l>
      <l>Art made the Die, an instrument of chaunce;</l>
      <l>Art painted papers, that made purses daunce:</l>
      <l>But to the Hound or Spanniell Nature sends,</l>
      <l>A diff'rent vigour; that the one intends:</l>
      <l>To hunt the light-foote beast; the other striues</l>
      <l>To spring the winged fowle: and them retriues.</l>

      <l>Is strangely artfull; and if pleasure bee</l>
      <l>In these inferiour things it's here to see.</l>
      <l>Goe then thou little volume, that reports</l>
      <l>The documents of reason to these sports;</l>
      <l>And spread thy selfe before the generall eye,</l>
      <l>That some may reade them with delight; some trie</l>
      <l>The rules thou giuest, and by experience raise,</l>
      <l>Their owne content with the iust Authors praise.</l>
      <l>This life be to the labours of his pen:</l>
      <l>They are well iudg'd of, by well iudging men.</l>
