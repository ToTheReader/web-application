   <head>¶ To the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>VPon vewe of these our demaunds, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian reader, if thou further demaunde some question of the boke, of the towne for which it is, of the Author, and of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no answere I suppose so fully iust (be it that the question double it self twice and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine) as to adiudge the one both in name and deede holy, the other in life godly, the third in his worke learned, the last in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent carefull for them, and not vnmindefull of thee. For in whatsoeuer true religion, christian example, godly inuention, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious enterprise coulde be beneficiall, in that haue they all ioyntly, and seuerally eche, by doctrine, practise, wit, with paynfull and no lesse chargeable endeuour, serued, if not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied thy godly contentation. And for that in doctrine, all thinges are written for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, rightly to vnderstande, faithfully to beleeue, and readily to confesse that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of hope which we haue, demaunde who will frende or aduersarie, aunswere who shall skilfull or vnlearned: to eche of these Christian dueties, with respect of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb facs="53"/>
and eche capacitie, this little Pamphlet ministreth, readilye sufficient furniture by playne explication of the principall grounds of our religion, worthy of thy diligence, thou if not vnworthy of the knowledge. But I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with alas. What is it to talke rightly or smothly, and to walke crookedly? Is not the sweete Christian harmonie in consent of saying and doing? For what discorde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth eyther of these by it selfe, or what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement? To apply or pleade very olde and almost deade example, hath some force to vice or vertue, in priuate talke, or publike sermon. And the late allegations of Fraunce or Flaunders, purporting noueltie, doe spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily quicken our dull sense of hearing: but the home made mention of our familiars, whose affection doth it not moue to eyther side? What can you more greedily heare, or I long, as with child, to tel. The great grace and gift of God on Sandwich towne, by the sound of the Gospel, hath it wrought in vain with the townesmen? are they taught wel, &amp; not wel gouerned? shew thei forth gods prais with mouth, and plucke it down with hand? or rather they expresse their fayth by their works, and their works by faith, in brotherly
<pb facs="54"/>
loue eche to other, in liberalitie to the poore, in hospitalitie to the Straunger, in erection and maintenance of schooles, in most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouision that no one among them lyue ydle. Which godly proceedings, when the father of this booke, that painfull and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instrument of Christ his church, maister Thomas Becon did with priuate comforte beholde, be coulde not with safe dutie but acknowledge &amp; soūd out the same publikly, to the great prayse of God, the increase of their beginnings, and example of all others, who by reason of decay through sande and shelf albeit they cannot so happily ēter their welnere stopped hauen, yet by view of their race in Iesus Christ, maye finishe the same course by repayred lyfe to their hoped hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And therefore this worke he tooke in hande, in order and matter excellent, edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by question, playne for capacitie, and briefe for memorie, not as the Seraphicall and Sorbonicall Doctors of the schole, who giue sucklings in religion vinegar for milk, the stronger hard stones for hartie meat: but following the precept of Saint Paule, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth and confirmeth them in such as bee good and profitable. But least the author of
<pb facs="54"/>
his intent, the Senate and towne of Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich of their benefite shoulde be frustrate, and the commendation of their godly exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hidden from such as contende to followe, wee haue thought it good nowe first sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and alone to print the same, whiche before, without greater charge in buying the whole workes of Thomas Becon, coulde not be bad. This our labour if thou shalte accept, it cannot be otherwise, God giuing grace, but that in all profitable maner wee shall be further carefull and diligent for thy Christian vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Farewell in Christ.</p>
