      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE goeth a pretty Fable of the Moone: On a time she earnestly besought her mother to prouide her a garment, comely and fit for her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: how can that be sweet daughter (quoth the mother) sith that your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy nether keeps it self at any one stay, nor at one certaine estate, but chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth euery day in the month, nay euery houre? The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hereof needs no interpretation: Fantasie and foolery who can please? and desire who can humour? no Camelion changeth his colour as affection, nor any thing so variable as <hi>Populus, Chorus, Fluuius.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I would with all my heart, euery Author that had done no better then I haue, had done no worse: and it were to be wished that some capricious Coxecombes, with their des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate wits, were not so forward to disbowell the entrails of their own ouerweening, singular, infectious, and pestiferous thoughts, as I know some.</p>
   <p>But I cannot stand all day nosing of Candlesticks: meane time beare with a plaine man: whatsoeuer I haue now done, I hope no exception can be taken, it is for your mirth and recreation (and I pray you so take it:) let such as will needs barke at the Moone, yell till their hearts ake: Gentle and Gentlemens spirits, will take all kindely that is kindely presented.</p>
