                 <title>An answere to ten friuolous and foolish reasons, set downe by the Rhemish Iesuits and papists in their preface before the new Testament by them lately translated into English, which haue mooued them to forsake the originall fountaine of the Greeke, wherein the Spirit of God did indite the Gospell, and the holie Apostles did write it, to follow the streame of the Latin translation, translated we know not when nor by whom : With a discouerie of many great corruptions and faults in the said English translation set out at Rhemes.

   <p>WHereas I did not purpose to make a full answeare to the <hi>Rhemists</hi> whole preface, which I hope hereafter will be performed by some other: I haue thought good to set downe here a few places out of the holy scriptures, and ancient godly fathers, partly to oppose for an answeare to the first part of their said preface, wherein they goe about to shew, that it is neither necessarie nor profitable to haue the holy Scriptures in Vulgar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages to be read and heard of all people: and partly to stir vp them that be godly and faithfull, to the dayly diligent and reuerent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, that they may thereby dayly more and more increase in the true knowledge and feare of God. If thou good Christian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der receiue any benefite and comfort by these my poore and simple labors, commend me to God in thy faithfull praiers.</p>
