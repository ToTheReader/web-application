      <note place="margin">Ecclesi. 4.</note>
      <hi>than both handes full with labour and traueyle.</hi> Yet the same <hi>Salomon</hi> also sayeth, that <hi>the slothfull bodie that will not go to the Plough in Winter for colde, shall begge in the Sommer for neede,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Prou. 20.</note> giuing vs to vnderstande thereby, that <hi>a simple man that worketh,</hi>

      <note place="margin">Prou. 22.</note>
      <hi>and not in common places,</hi> and therefore. <hi>Salomon</hi> meant not to impeach a paynefull hande, but to controule a couetous mynde, in witnesse whereof he sendeth the Idle sluggard <hi>that sleepeth at home, to the busie Emmet that worketh abroade,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Prou. 6.</note> and <hi>the sturdie runnagate that hath none aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> to the séeble <hi>Conye that buyldeth among the rocks,</hi>

      <pb facs="5"/> euen to be taught by those sielye wormes to correct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and thus is the couetous man condemned, bicause he setteth good conscience behinde his gréedie desires, and placeth his priuate profite before common humanitie, to erect vnto himselfe and his posteritie, a kingdome of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and ydlenesse. The slothfull man is confounded, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he abuseth the tyme lent vnto him, as though he onely among all the Creatures of God, had a speciall priuiledge to be ydle and carelesse: and therefore I am bolde to commende this worke vnto you, euen so farre forth as the right vse and purpose thereof deserueth (that is to saye) as a recompence to the labourer, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie to the housekéeper, as a comfort to the poore, and as a benefite to the Countrie or Common wealth, adding thus much herevnto, that there cannot lightly be employed grounde to more profitable vse, nor labour to more certayne gaynes: howbeit, with this note, that no mysterie is so perfect, no floure so swéete, no Scripture so holy, but by abuse a corrupt body, according to his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous nature, may drawe poyson out of the same, and therefore blame not this poore trade for that it maketh men riche in yéelding double profite, neyther reprooue me bicause by these presents I giue notice therof, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing this order, but condemne the man, or rather the mynde, that wresteth it to serue his miserable affection, or couetous humour. Truely it gréeueth me daylye to sée time yll spent, labour lost, cost cast awaye, much good grounde naughtily applyed, and many good men shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abused, through ignorance and ignorant workemen that vndertake to deale herin; I sée almost euery man set his hand to work, or his head to deuise hervpon. Finally, I sée the Flemmings enuie our practise herein, who alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither tende their owne profite, séeking to impownde vs in the ignoraunce of our commodities, to cramme vs with the wares and fruites of their Countrie, and to doe anye thing that might put impediment to this purpose,
<pb facs="5"/> dazeling vs with the discommendation of our soyle, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuring and falsifying the order of this mysterie, sending vs into Flaunders as farre as Poppering, for that which we may finde at home in our owne backsides. But it were better (in my iudgement) to vnlearne that whych is conceyued amisse, and to vndoe that which is vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably done, than to procéede with losse, and to ende with derision, it were better also that Straungers shoulde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye our prosperities, than our friendes shoulde pittie our pouerties, or that we our selues shoulde lament and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle our owne necessities, procéeding from our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in this behalfe. Nowe therefore let this suffyce to entreate you to consider herevppon, and then let your owne consideration preuayle to mooue you to take the worke in hande, and so are you made an arbitrer of your owne commodity, as being desired to measure your char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by your profite: I saye therefore to you that shall be hereby perswaded to be dooing herin, giue eare to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, giue diligence to the woorking, and doubtlesse you shall giue credite and good report to the sequele hereof. Howbeit, I for my part can better vse my hande in doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than my penne in descrybing this mysterie. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, hoping hereby to stande my friendes and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie in some profitable steade; I rather choose to incurre the daunger of derision in speaking homelye, than the fault of ingratitude in saying nothing, the respect of dutie vanquishing in me the feare of yll report, mine ignorance crauing pardon, mine affection, good will, and let them that are so daungerous of their cunning go for mée wyth <hi>Tymon</hi> into the Desert, there solitarilye to enioye their daintie wysedome. And to saye the troth, to vse eloquent schoole phrases in a homely rustical matter, were to bring the Countrie people to a newe forme of hearing, wherin they shoulde be longer in learning to vnderstande the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositie of the style, than the knowledge of the Arte, for such menne (such men I meane whose hope is in their
<pb facs="6"/> handes) haue not bene brought vppe in a cloase studie to discipher the Arte of Rhetoricke with their wittes, but haue bene trayned in the open fieldes to practyse the Arte of Husbandrie with their Lymmes, as being placed in the frontiers of pouertie, to beare the brunt of traueyle and labour, and therefore it suffyceth, if in a rude Caske I exhibite wholesome fruite, and write plainly to playne men of the Countrie, and yet <hi>Saepe etiam est holitor valde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuna locutus.</hi> In this sort I shall teach I trust without great error or tediousnesse, and you shall learne (I hope) without great payne or charges, the manner howe, the tyme when, and the place where to plant Hoppes wyth effect: God giue you encrease according to his holy will, and to your good desire. In the meane time I desire of the learned, pacience in reading, of the vnlearned, diligence in hearing, of the rich, some expences toward their great commoditie, of the poore, some payne for much profite, and of them all, good wyll for myne endeuour. Finallye, I hartily desire you that when you haue once conformed your selfe to the right order, you procéede accordinglye, otherwise neyther of vs shall be any thing the neare, you of your purpose, nor I of my desire, and if there be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned herein any note of profitable instruction, applye the same to your owne commoditie. If the Lorde blesse your indeuour with encrease, yéelde vnto him (as vnto whome the same appertayneth) all prayse and thankes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
