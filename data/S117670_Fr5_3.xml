   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the Athenians erected an altar to an vnknowne god, supposing he would be pleased with their deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though they were ignorant of his name: better may I presume that my labour may be gratefull, being deuoted to such men, whose names I know, and whose fame I haue heard, though vnacquainted with their persons. I intended this comfort to him whom a lamenting sort hath left most comfortlesse, by him to his friends, who haue equall portions in this sorrow. But I think the Philosophers rule will be heere verified, that it shall be last in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, which was first designed, and
<pb facs="196"/> he shall last enioy the effect, which was first owner of the cause. Thus let Chance be our rule since Choice may not, and into which of your hands it shall fortune, much honour and happinesse may it carry with it, and leaue in their hearts as much ioy, as it found sorrow. Where I borrow the person of an Historie, as well touching the dead, as the yet suruiuing, I build vpon report of of such Authours, whose hoarie heades challenge credit, and whose eyes and eares were witnesses of their words. To craue pardon for my paine were to slander a friendly office, and to wrong their curtesies, whom Nobilitie neuer taught to answer affection with anger, or to wage dutie with dislike: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I humbly present vnto them with as many good wishes, as good will can measure from the best mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mind, that hath a willingnesse rather to offoord, then to offer due seruice, were not the meane as worthlesse as the mind is willing.</p>
