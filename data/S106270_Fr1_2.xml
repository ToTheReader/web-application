   <p>FOr as much as impertial Reader, it is not vnknowne vnto us that the Lord Christ geve vnto &amp; left with his Apostells a Comanndemente and ordinance to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served which is Baptisme to those that beleeve, as apeareth Math. 28. VVhere he sayth. Goe and teache al nations Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe them in the name of the Father te Sonne and the Holie Ghost, teachinge them to observe all thinges what soever I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve comannded you. And Marke, 16. Goe yee into all the world and preach the Gospel to everie Creature, he that shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be beleeve and be baptised shalbe saved. The which Comann<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement they obsērved vsed and taught as apeareth Act. 2. 8 9. 10, 16. 19. 22. Rom. 6. Gal. 3. And was by the Anncient Fathers in the primative Church for a time vnviolablye kept and vsed, as the wrytinges of divers both of the Anncyent &amp; latter tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers aleaged in this treatise do manifestlie schowe.</p>
   <p>VVe will therefore first shewe by testimonies out of holie Scripture that Christ comannded his Apostells and Servantes of the holie Ghost first of all to preache the Gospell and make Discyples, and then afterwardes to Baptise those that weare instructed in the fayth in Callinge vpon and Confessinge the name of God. The which we will illustrate and Confirme by the wittnes of the Anncyent and latter teachers.</p>
   <p>Secondlie shalbe proved out of holie Scripture that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

   <p>Thirdlie in this treatise it is suffyc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>entlie shewed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that after the Apostells time by the primative Church &amp; Anncyent Fathers who observed &amp; followed the ordinance of Christ and Example of the Apostells, the people weare co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie first instructed in the Misteries of fayth, and after that they weare taught they weare Baptised vpon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the same.</p>
   <p>Fow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>thlye it is proved that in the primative Church the Children both of the faythfull &amp; others weare comonlye first instructed in the fayth and afterwardes vpon acknowledginge and Confession of the same they weare Baptised.</p>
   <p>Fiftlie it is in briefe demonstrated by testimonies out of the holie Scripture that accordinge to the institution of the Lorde Christ and the Apostells and Anncyent Fathers right vse. The teachers required fayth with baptisme and that he that was baptised must himselfe acknowledge and Confesse the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and call vpon the name of the Lorde with both the Ann<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyent and latter wryters approbation &amp; Confirmation of the saide testimonie.</p>
   <p>Sixtlie it is proved out of their owne wrytinges, whith vse Childrens baptisme, that Christ neyther gave Comannde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for baptisme of younge Children, nor instituted the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and that the Apostells never baptised any infantes.</p>
   <p>Seventlye it is proved out of the wrytinges both of the Anncyent and latter teachers that the baptisme of infantes is an ordinance of man &amp; à selfe received opinion, brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church by teachers after the Apostells and instituted and comannded by Counsells Popes and Emperors.</p>
   <p>Eyghtlie and lastelie, it is both proved by scripture, and ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> that none ought to be brought drawne or compelled therto.</p>
