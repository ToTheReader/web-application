      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloued Sonne, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
religious and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
vertues inherent
in your matchlesse
Mother, vnder the
winges of whose pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and godly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
your infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
hath beene trayned
and guided vp, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with your educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
vnder so zealous and learned a Tutor, put
me rather in assurance than hope (as <hi>Tullie</hi> some
time exacted from his Sonne, from the onelie
hearing of <hi>Cratippus</hi> his Master) that you are not
ignorant of that summary bond, wherein you
stand oblieged to your Creator and Redeemer;
which is onely able to make you happy, both
here and hereafter, in life and death: In mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
whereof, I meane not only a bare and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall
knowledge, but with a reall and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
vse adjoyned, without which, though with
a seemely assumption, you could expresse to the
World in a former habite and liuing portray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
all <hi>Aristotles</hi> Morall Vertues, and walke
that whole Booke in <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Action,</hi> yet are you
but a vaine and wretched Creature, the fayrest
out-side of the miserablest in side, that euer
was concealed by Tombe, or shadowing. And
although I nothing doubt, your youth beeing
guided, and your greene vessell seasoned by such
wholsome documents and instructions, deriued
from so all-sufficient Teachers, that you are not
vnfurnished of such needefull helpes, as may bee
furtherers to your life and conuersation: Yet
that I may the better retaine and expresse the
zealous affection, beseeming a Father to his
Sonne, or that you should bee forced to deriue
your stay and aduise, rather from the rule of
Strangers, than from him from whom you are
produced, and brought foorth.</p>
   <p>Out of these fore-going Considerations
therefore, thinking it not vnmeete, I haue es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayed,
from the affection of a Father, to giue
you such good aduertisements and rules for the
fitting and squaring of your life, as are gayned
rather by my lōg experience &amp; obseruatiō, than
by much reading or Study: beeing such (in my
hope) with that good assistance, as shall <hi>Season
your Youth like the draw of Age:</hi> to the end, that you
entering into this exorbitant and intangling
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
Worlde, may be the better furnished to auoyde
those harmefull courses, whereinto these daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
times, and your inexperience may easily
insnare you. And because I woulde not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
your memory, I haue reduced them into
tenne Preceptes: which, if next to <hi>MOSES</hi>
Tables, you imprint in your minde, you shall
reape the benefite, and I the ende of my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
and content. And thus they follow.</p>
