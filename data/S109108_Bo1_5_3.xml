   <head>THE PREFACE TO
the Reader.</head>
   <p>THE cause why (docile Reader) I haue not dedicat
this short treatise to any particular personis, (as cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounly
workis vsis to be) is, that I esteme all thais
quha hes already some beginning of knawledge,
with ane earnest desyre to atteyne to farther, alyke meit
for the reading of this worke, or any vther, quhilk may
help thame to the atteining to thair foirsaid desyre. Bot
as to this work, quhilk is intitulit, <hi>The Reulis and caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
to be obseruit &amp; eschevvit in Scottis Poesie,</hi> ʒe may mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uell
paraventure, quhairfore I sould haue writtin in that
mater, sen sa mony learnit men, baith of auld and of late
hes already written thairof in dyuers and sindry langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
I answer, That nochtwithstanding, I haue lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayis
writtin of it, for twa caussis: The ane is, As for thē
that wrait of auld, lyke as the tyme is changeit sensyne, sa
is the ordour of Poesie changeit. For then they obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit
not <hi>Flovving,</hi> nor eschewit not <hi>Ryming in termes,</hi>
besydes sindrie vther thingis, quhilk now we obserue, &amp;
eschew, and dois weil in sa doing: because that now, quhē
the warld is waxit auld, we haue all their opinionis in
writ, quhilk were learned before our tyme, besydes our
awin ingynis, quhair as they then did it onelie be thair
<pb facs="43"/>
awin ingynis, but help of any vther. Thairfore,
quhat I speik of Poesie now, I speik of it, as being
come to mannis age and perfectioun, quhair as then,
it was bot in the infancie and chyldheid. The vther
cause is, That as for thame that hes written in it of late,
there hes neuer ane of thame written in our language.
For albeit sindrie hes written of it in English, quhilk is
lykest to our language, ʒit we differ from thame in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
reulis of Poesie, as ʒe will find be experience I haue
lykewayis omittit dyuers figures, quhilkis are necessare
to be vsit in verse, for twa causis. The ane is, because
they are vsit in all languages, and thairfore are spokin of
be <hi>Du Bellay,</hi> and sindrie vtheris, quha hes writtē in this
airt. Quhairfore gif I wrait of thame also, it sould seme
that I did bot repete that, quhilk thay haue written, and
ʒit not sa weil, as thay haue done already. The vther
cause is, that they are figures of Rhetorique and Diale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctique,
quhilkis airtis I professe nocht, and thairfore will
apply to my selfe the counsale, quhilk <hi>Apelles</hi> gaue to
the shoomaker, quhē he said to him, seing him find falt
with the shankis of the Image of <hi>Venus,</hi> efter that he had
found falt with the pantoun, <hi>Ne sutor vltra crepidam.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I will also wish ʒow (docile Reidar) that or ʒe cūmer
ʒow with reiding thir reulis, ʒe may find in ʒour self sie
a beginning of Nature, as ʒe may put in practise in ʒour
verse many of thir foirsaidis preceptis, or euer ʒe sie them
as they are heir set doun. For gif Nature be nocht the
cheif worker in this airt, Reulis wilbe bot a band to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="43"/>
and will mak ʒow within short space weary of the
haill airt: quhair as, gif Nature be cheif, and bent to it,
reulis will be ane help and staff to Nature. I will end
heir, lest my preface be langer nor my purpose and haill
mater following: wishing ʒow, docile Reidar, als gude
succes and great proffeit by reiding this short treatise, as
I tuke earnist and willing panis to blok it, as ʒe sie, for
ʒour cause. Fare weill.</p>
   <p>I Haue insert in the hinder end of this Treatise, maist
kyndis of versis quhilks are not cuttit or brokin, bot
alyke many feit in euerie lyne of the verse, and how they
are commounly namit, with my opinioun for quhat
subiectis ilk kynde of thir verse is meitest to be vsit.</p>
   <p>TO knaw the quantitie of ʒour lang or short fete in
they lynes, quhilk I haue put in the reule, quhilk
teachis ʒow to knaw quhat is <hi>Flovving,</hi> I haue markit
the lang fute with this mark,—and abone
the heid of the shorte fute, I
haue put this mark <hi>v.</hi>
