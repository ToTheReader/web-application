      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit the lawes of Englande right singuler frinde are worthye no lesse honour, praise and commendacion, then Iustice <hi>Fortescue</hi> in his booke written of the praises thereof dooth attribute and geue vnto them, yet forasmuch as the knowledge of the said lawes is placed so farre of, the iourney thereunto so exceading long and painefull, &amp; the waies and pathes so rugged and vnpleasant: I would wish that amonges such plenty of learned men as be at this day some thing were deuised to help the studēts of their lōg ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that they (being led a more nere &amp; plesant way) might both as they went and after they came to theire iorneis end gather some other knowledge, not onely therewith to gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish theire owne science, but also the better to serue in such honorable rome as they be called to serue the kinge and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne lord in, which thing might well come to passe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my poore mynde, if such titles as be in the great abrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Iustice <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> were by the Iudges or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned men labored &amp; studied, that is to say, euery title by it selfe by speciall diuisions digested, orderd and disposed in suche sort as that all the iudiciall actes and cases in the same might be brought &amp; appere vnder certeine principles, rules and groundes of the saide lawes. As for example, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of <hi>Briefe</hi> might come these titles, Fourm, Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naming of the persō, Mysnaming of the town, One thing
<pb facs="5"/> twise demaunded, death of the plaintifes side, death of the defendauntes syde, chaunginge of the name of the plein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife or defendaunt hanginge the sute, with manye suche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lyke which nowe as thinges scatered abroade and out of orderlye hidden wythin the saide longe tytle that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires muche more learninge, paynes and Studye well to order and dispose the matter in the same, then (after order made) to learne and beare it awaye. And yet surelye there cannot bee to muche praise and commendacion geuen vnto that greate learned man the Auctour of the saide great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement, which by his greate learninge, exact iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and intollerable paynes, brought suche an infinite nomber of volumes (to the readynge whereof A mans lyfe woulde scant haue suffised) to a muche more lesse and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower cōpasse, whereupon nowe these learned men wyth lesse paynes might compile the thing that should be so easy so profitable and fruitfull to the studentes thereof, that in halfe those yeares they now lye sleping in, they might come to a ryper and more certeine knowledge and better iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For which cause I haue drawen as it were a patern of the thinge I so muche desire takinge vppon mee such ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles as appertaine vnto the kinges prerogatiue, not as one in anye parte woorthy to treat of a thynge so high &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouse as that is or in learnynge sufficient or hable therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (for of myne owne here is nothinge more then onelye a colleccion and disposition of that that is alreadye contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the saide tytles) but rather because I haue alwayes meant this my deuyse vnto you, which I coulde not doe or practise so well vppon anye tytle as vppon this that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth vnto your office of Attourneyshippe of the wardes and liueries, partly for that I knowe your selfe to haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued the like order in your owne Study, whiche in fewe yeres hath gotten you aboue other the greate learnynge you haue, partlye also for that I couet your Iudgement in
<pb facs="5"/> these matters wherewith you be daylye in vre and exersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, knowinge that I haue to doe herein with one so muche my frynde that if there be any thinge worthie the readinge he will take it thankfullye, and if not so, well, yet will hee take it in good part, the rest that is amisse he wil beare it with me. This therefore what soeuer it bee I dedicate vnto you, read it, peruse it and make of it what you will. Fare you well, from Greis Inne the sixt of Nouember. Anno. 1548.</p>
