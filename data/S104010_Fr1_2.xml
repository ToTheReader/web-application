abroad amongst all
your Subjects; and they
were ill Proficients in

much under such a Master. Your Royall
and religious care, that all things in your
Regall Chappels be done according to the
prescript of the publick Liturgie, and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

motive unto all your people, not to be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in conformity to such an eminent part
of your Princely vertues. Such a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
patterne would soone finde an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
entertainment in the hearts of men;
were there not some, the enemies as well of
piety, as publick Order, that disswade from
both. None in this kind more faulty than
an obscure and namelesse <hi>Minister</hi> of

being so inclinable (by your most sacred
Ma<hi>
         <seg rend="sup">ties</seg>

uniformity in Gods publick service. Nay,
whereas in the Primitive times, the holy
Altars, as they then used to call the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

were not) were esteemed so sacred, that

as if no termes were vile enough to
bestow upon them. Nor deales hee

I thought it was my bounden duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
unto your Majesties faithfull

of the businesse so by him calumniated:
together with the doctrine and continuall
usage both of the Primitive Church of
Christ, in the world abroad, and the
Reformed Church of Christ in this your
Majesties Realme of England. Which
worke, as it was principally intended to
settle and confirme the mindes of your
Majesties people, whom some have
laboured to possesse with preiudicate feares:
so to the end it may receive amongst them
a more faire admittance, I have presumed
