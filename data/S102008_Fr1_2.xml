   <head>A preface to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> ENTRED no sooner
into meditation of some
preface vnto the present
booke, but forthwith Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Dudley Fenner,</hi> of
most happy and worthie memorie, stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me. In whose remēbrance, as his death
renued my grief: so it cōforted me, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
three yeares, as it were the third day, in
one of the same coūtrie of Kent, in the same
argument of laying down the whole body of
the holy doctrine of God, in the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode
and memorielike handling of it, God
had as it were, raised him vp againe from
the dead, for supply of some of that worthy
seruice, vnto his Church, which he, if the
Lord had added yeares vnto his life, would
manifoldly haue performed. For cōsidering
the forrestlike largenesse of matter it hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
and smal rowme the same is imparked,
and the good order euery doctrine standeth
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
in before the reader, ranged with others ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
going before &amp; cōming after, as supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
and inferiours, or siding it and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
hand in hand, as sisters &amp; cōpanions:
it seemed to me, that this treatise was like to
be a seed, that by the hand of the printer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cast vpon the field of our coūtrie, might
in good time bring vs home an haruest,
that might yeeld honor to God, and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his Church, which is the principall:
and in the second place some honest credit,
not altogether to be despised, vnto this our
countrie of Kent, whilst it going before the
most of other the Shires &amp; Counties of the
Land in blessings of outward fruitefulnesse
and wealth, should not be found behinde all
others, in the fruits of the Spirit, wherwith
mens hearts, yea the Lord himself (after a
sort) is reioyced.<note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>. 9.</note> And in it me thought I
sawe some gratious blush and good resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of the wisdome, which Solomon spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of. For as by writing shee <hi>lifteth vp
her voice,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Prov. 8.</note> so by conuenient, orderly &amp; easie
maner of hādling the doctrines of God, she
<hi>standeth in the toppe of the highest
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
places,</hi> where all wayfaring men that are
strangers in our countrie, taking their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
towards mount Sion, may vnderstande
what is said vnto them. From thence shee
<hi>steppeth to set her self in the place or
mother of wayes:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ezech. 2▪</note> wher one way cutting
it selfe into many, greatly hazardeth the
wayfaring man, vnlesse there be one, as it
were, with the finger to point vnto him,
which is the right and ready way. Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
vnto the citie of the heauenlie Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
from whence soeuer he cometh East,
West, North or South, and to whatsoeuer of
the twelue gates of the twelue tribes of our
Land: she is there also ready <hi>at the gate,
in the mouth of the Citie,</hi> to tell him,
what streat he shall enter, on what hande to
turne, what lane to goe down. That done she
taketh the winges of the morning, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the frailty of men, least they should not
see their happinesse, when it is before them,
or that they should not discerne of it, when
they touch it, or stumble vpon it: she setteth
her selfe euen <hi>at the very dore</hi> that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to the full and perfect possession of the
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
promised felicity, saying, heere is the place
you seeke after, enter it. This cōmendation,
notwithstanding that incōparably it doeth
agree to the eternall sonne of God, in his
own, and in his Propheticall, and Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ministerie, as that which is the perfect
Iethro of our voyage from Th'aegipt of this
world vnto the Lande of the heauenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan:
yet may it also not vnfitlie, in some
measure, more or lesse, be spoken of the holy
labours in this kinde: which by description
of the whole doctrine of God, frō the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
vnto the loouer thereof, take vs by
hande, and entring vs into the way of God,
lead vs as it were to all the standinges and
Camping places of the children of God, in
the wildernesse of this world, vntill hauing
cast away, either weapons or walking staues,
we shall set vs downe in th'endles peace and
rest of our God. A labour as at no time vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable,
and in no place vnworthy of a
good welcome: so in these dayes, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in our countrie, it is worthy, of all good
entertainment. For beside that there are to
many sectes and schismes: there are also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>
of iudgments, in one and the same
sort, both which be in danger, the former of
schismes to grow to heresies, the latter from
some difference of iudgement, to bee sorted
and sected altogether, if by such treatises as
this, which shortlie, and, as it were vnder
one sight, lay forth the sound doctrine of all
the maine, &amp; meane, principall, and secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie
pointes of our most holy faith, the
iudgment of men be not either called home,
where it is broken out, or stayed where a
breach is begun. And albeit th'excellent vse
hereof may clearly appeare to euery one that
hath but halfe an eye to looke with: yet is
there that opposition in the world against
all good endeuours of the seruauntes of the
God of heauen, that this also is not vnlike to
fall into some riflers hands, which will doe
the vttermost of his wretched endeuour, to
despoile it of the garmentes of comelines,
whereby the Lorde would set it in the good
grace &amp; well liking of his children. If (hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelie)
it be said, that it is therefore fruitles,
because it is a doing of a thing that is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
done, by a worthy, workeman of the Lord
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>
Maister <hi>Dudley Fenner,</hi> it were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
answere, that the same is made English,
which before was Latine, and brought into
the artificers shop, which was before in the
studies &amp; closets of the learned alone, which
deserueth praise at the handes of a thankful
Reader. It is more then sufficient aunswere,
that he hath brought M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Fenners</hi> booke,
for helpe of memorie, into a great deale
smaller rowme. But I am and haue bene of
that acquaintāce &amp; priuitie with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
these many years, that I am able be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and in trueth to professe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he euer sawe M. <hi>Fenners</hi> booke, he had
written &amp; finished this; with such grace, as
I, louing him before, did euer sithence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
him, for the graces of God bestowed
vpon him. And therefore as the Lord gaue
Maister <hi>Fenner</hi> the honour to be first; so he
would not let him haue it so farre, as to be
alone. And notwithstāding th'authors both
modestie, and wisedome is such, as he would
not haue passed by the aduantage of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
garnishment of his worke, by M. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
labours: yet whosoeuer shall peruse
<pb n="9" facs="5"/>
the booke diligentlie, shall easilie perceaue,
that hee hath for the matter, a stock of his
own, and for the forme &amp; maner of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of it, art and cunning of his own, to haue
finished some commendable worke in this
kind, if he had had no such paterne before
his eyes. Which beeing well considered, will
stop the mouth of some others, which snat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
vp the wise Prouerbs, as of a man not
<hi>medling beyond his slipper:</hi> and a
<hi>Carpenter not dealing but with his
chippes:</hi> will bee ready, foolishlie to throw
them, they know not where, nor at whome.
And for my parte, I am of that iudgement,
that it is so farre from beeing vnmeet for a
Gentleman of the Innes of the Court, to
deale thus in these holy studies; that I could
wish of the Lorde, that the Noble men of
the Court it selfe, and all others whose wits
are either by nature, or education more
pregnant, would fine &amp; file them vpon such
endeuours as these are. So should they fitt
themselues not only to passe frō the Princes
Court into the Lordes owne Court, there to
raigne for euermore; but should able them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="10" facs="6"/>
ten thousand times better to all hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
seruices of their Prince, &amp; Countrie,
in a wiser and more politique gouernment
of the comon wealth, then <hi>Machiauel</hi> that
cursed helhound can furnish thē of. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
many notable draughts of policie, here
and there scattered throughout the whole
Scripture, especially the storie: that one
booke of the Prouerbes, as it were the Lords
owne Politickes, is able to yeelde more sound
precepts of sure &amp; safe gouernement, then,
I will not saye <hi>Machiauell,</hi> but then all
the <hi>Machiauels</hi> in the worlde, when they
shall haue met vpon their bench, and shall
haue beaten out their braines about that
consultation. And if it be here asked, what
are you, or who are you, whose iudgment in
this behalfe the reader should so greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.
Peraduenture the reader may be such
a one, as if I were a mā of some marke, with
my word I should carie him away, although
I brought no reason: if of no note at all, hee
would not beleeue mee, although I should
come vpon him with neuer so good reason.
Therefore concealing my name, in a word I
<pb n="11" facs="6"/>
answere first out of Moses, for whom, when
Ioshua was ielous least the gift of Prophesie,
&amp; of the declaratiō of the will of God being
common, Moses his Maister should be lesse
estemed: he answered, <hi>would to God that
all the Lords people were Prophets,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Num. 11.</note>
      <hi>why lest the Lorde should bestow his
Spirit vpon them.</hi> Example hereof we
haue in Ezechias raigne, one of the godliest
and most renowned Kings that euer raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
whose gouernement was also accōpani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with as much glorie and good successe,
both at home, and abroad during the whole
time of his raigne, as any king whatsoeuer,
Dauid only excepted. Nay I needed not, in
euery respect, to haue excepted <hi>Dauid,</hi> who
met with more crosse handes of the Lord in
his Sonnes and subiects, then euer did <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias.</hi>
And of him to his cōmendation that
shall neuer die, it is written, that his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
gathered,<note place="margin">Pro. 25. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> and suted diuers of: <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
Prouerbs, in that Prophetical order
wherein nowe they are left vnto vs by the
holy Ghost. And vnles Courtiers will iudge
thēselues vnworthy of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb n="12" facs="7"/>
there is no cause, why they should esteme
it to base or to vnworthie a thing for them
to be occupied in: seeing <hi>Dauid, Solomō</hi>
and <hi>Ezechias,</hi> the most famous Kinges
that euer liued, haue no one thing so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
to garnishe and set foorth their Royall
Crowne with, as that their handes beeing
taught of God to write some thing to his
praise, &amp; edification of his people, the same
as a diamond in their princelie Diademes
remaineth to all posteritie. <hi>Saul</hi> also, albeit
a wicked man, yet beeing purposed of God
to the Kingdome, had this as a principall
meanes, to hide from the eyes of the people,
the basenesse of his birth, and homelines of
his education: that hee was for some small
time graced of the Lord with a gift of Pro
phetie, wherewith beeing ennobled, he was
so prepared for the kingdome. But I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of the iniquitie of these times, that
should driue to the proofe of that, whiche
prophane and heathnish mē, in the dim &amp;
darke sight of their naturall reason, haue
both seene and professed, that these cōmon
wealthes were most happie, where either
<pb n="13" facs="7"/>
Philosophers were Kinges, or Kinges Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers.
And if Scepters were wel guided,
when men stoode at the sterne of common
wealthes, that stirred them by direction of
that shadowe and carcase of Philosophie,
that was to be had in their bookes: O howe
happilie should they bee menaged, if their
course were set at the prescript and cōmand
of the word of God, which is the ladie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres
of all true wisedome or philosophie. But
I see there would be no end if I should set my
self to answere whatsoeuer the crooked wits
of wrangling companions might obiect.
And therfore assured of the fruitfulnesse
of the booke in it selfe, I commend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
and succes therof to the blessing of God:
who only can direct the heartes and handes
of men to lay houlde, and make vse of it, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
for th'increase of their knowledge, as
for the prouoking of them to like ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours.
