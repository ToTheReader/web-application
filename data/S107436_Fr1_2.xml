   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen as (Right Honorable) a</hi> certaine Citizen of Rome in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting a Booke into the handes of that renowned and noble Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Augustus Caesar, being fearefull and bashfull of nature, seemed oftentimes to put forth and to drawe backe againe his hand, as one willing and yet timerous, the good Emperour who aboue all things ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred and detested, to be thought terrible or fearefull towardes his subiectes, hauing espied the bashfulnesse of the man, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously receiuing the present frō out his hand asked him whether he had thought with himself, that he had byn about to giue foode to an Elephant, signifying that Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and Rulers should not onely so behaue
<pb facs="3"/>
themselues in the gouernment and ruling of such as are subiect vnto them, that they may rather appeare fathers then maisters, but also that no man bee he neuer so simple shoulde at any time be bashfull or fearefull to present vnto the greatest Emperour, the least or smallest gifte proceeding from a faithfull and willing minde, as declared the worthie Artaxerxes in receyuing so cheerefully the droppes of water offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by a simple sot of his owne Countrie, especially the gift beyng so excellent as was that Booke giuen into the handes of Caesar. For from them onely as from the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest counsellers, both Princes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats without all fawning or flattering may learne those thinges which are most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sariest to the knowledge of duetie and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life. Let it not therefore seeme any thing straunge vnto your honour in that J
<pb facs="3"/>
haue presumed so much as to offer into your handes with this Citizen of Rome, this small and simple pamphlet, in that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as is manifested vnto the whole worlde, your courtesie and clemencie is nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour vnto him in whom may be reputed the greatest affabilitie and gentlenesse, but also in respect of that feruent seale and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which you haue alwayes borne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all those that are studious in good lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratures, being as it were of one and the self same minde with that good Emperour Gordianus esteeming more a godly Booke thē the precioust Gold: wherby I haue byn perswaded to thinke that though this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, may seeme (as it is in deede) to to base to bee presented vnto so learned a Iudge, that you woulde rather reprooue me if J shoulde haue shewed my selfe bashefull in proffering then at all to blame mee
<pb facs="4"/>
so boldly presuming, and that so much the rather if withdrawing your eyes from mee as pardoning my slendernes and imbisilitie of skill, you referre your selfe wholy to the worthinesse of the Author, as one more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the profitable and graue aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes specified by him, then the rudenesse and plainenesse of so simple a Translatour: Wherefore as distrusting nothing through so great an incourragement giuen, and yet as one not arrogantly presuming, but hoping the best in humble and duetifull wise J of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vnto your Lordship these fewe leaues containing in them, three Orations apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Morall instruction and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, both of Princes and Magistrates as well touching the gouernment of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues as of their Cities and Countries, as also of all other meaner and inferiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, being a parsell of the workes of that learned and famous Oratour Jsocrates, the
<pb facs="4"/>
fountaine of Eloquence, and the onely ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of all those renowned Oratours of Greece written at the first, by the Author himselfe in the Greeke tongue, the one as a friendly exhortation sent vnto a priuate person called Demonicus, the other two as dedicated vnto Nicocles the Prince and gouernour of Salamis a part of Cypres, here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tofore also interpreted by diuers and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry writers, and last of all in this our age Translated into Latine by that graue and learned Clearke Hieronimus Wolfius, and by him presented into the handes of that Noble and mightie Emperour Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian the second, and nowe vnto your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, turned out of Latine into this our vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and naturall tongue by him, who stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it were vppon thornes, fearing the pursute of many aduersaries and carping Momusses, desirous of refuge craueth of your Lordship, according to your accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="5"/>
goodnesse to be defenced and munited vnder the shadowe of your winges, that thereby the grauer and learned sorte may with a more fauourabler eye graūt a frind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and luckie successe vnto this my first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, as also the shamelesse faces of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous find faults be made somewhat the bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller through yours so honorable a protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although I can not hope so clearely to escape their handes by whom the wisest and learnedst haue byn attainted, may it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore please your honor to receiue vnder your tuition, your poore &amp; hūble Oratour as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourably accepting this small mite at his handes as it is willingly offered by him who euen of dutie is boūd to gratifie your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with as great treasure as euer Aemili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us brought into the Romane cofers if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it were, that poore Telemanus mate should hap to enioye such wealth: for as at Welforde by the benefite of that good and
<pb facs="5"/>
vertuous Lady your mother in lawe (whose life J beseech the Lord of his great mercie long to continue) I first obtained &amp; inioyed the taste and sauour of those sweete waters issuing from the pure fountain of learning and knowledge, so is it requisite that her Ladiship and all hers, among whom J haue chosen your Lordship as principall, should reape and possesse afore all others the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of their charges, not doubting though as yet they be nothing correspondent to the lest part of their desertes, but that your honour and the rest will in the meane time in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent wise accept the same, vntil the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time haue brought all thinges to a better perfection. And thus least J may seeme by vsing of many words to abuse your patience in detaining your honour from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, your most waightie and graue affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in transgressing the boundes of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle I will at this time vse silence, that so the
<pb facs="6"/>
graue and famous Oratour Isocrates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and your Lordship hauing talked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, you may haue as good cause to say as much of him as did Alexander the great of <hi>Homers</hi> Illiaddes terming them as the chiefest furniture and prouision of all his warres during the which time of which your priuate conference with this Painim J as duetie willeth absenting my selfe, shall remaine a dayly peticioner vnto the Lorde our God that mightie Jehoua for your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours perpetuall preseruatiō and safegard both in this worlde with the increase and continuance of honour, as also in the life to come with euerlasting felicitie and eternall happinesse.</p>
