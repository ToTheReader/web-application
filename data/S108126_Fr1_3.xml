   <head>¶ THE PREFACE OF THE <hi>TRANSLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours to the Reader.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I first tooke</hi> in hande this Booke, (gentle Reader) &amp; was determined to translate it into English: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the great iudgement, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the Author, &amp; mine owne sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, and vnskilfulnesse. By confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence wherof: I was eftsoones driuen from my determination. For I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued how dangerous a thyng it was for me, who, God knoweth, am but a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple antiquarie, and but slenderly prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised in the antiquities of this Ilande: to geue foorth my absolute sentence in suche matters as are in controuersie, not only amongst the moste approued, and best learned auntient writers in this behalfe: but also between suche as haue been very well seen therin in our time, wherof some be dead, and some be yet liuyng. Which I saw y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> of necessity I must doo. As for this one example, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many. Although it be not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="6"/>
agreed vpon, what towne in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande the auntient name of <hi>Caleua</hi> doth signifie, and the place therof, be also as vncerteine, as vpon whiche side of the <hi>Thames</hi> it should lie: yet followynge myne author so neare as I may: I am enforced to determine some way, I am sure not without mislikynge of many. The like reprehension I haue incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in the Englishyng of names of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse places moe, some <hi>English,</hi> some <hi>Scottish,</hi> but especially, <hi>VVelsh,</hi> or <hi>Britysh.</hi> In so much y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to haue set them downe, as I had founde them in <hi>M. Lhuyds</hi> Latin booke which he, for that he wroate in <hi>Latine:</hi> had, so nigh as he coulde, made them al <hi>Latin</hi> words in sounde, &amp; termination. But beyng therin much lightned espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the helpe of the rightworship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>M. Doct. Yale</hi> of London: I trust I haue deserued lesse blame in y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>, then in any other one parte of my translation, how be it, for my litle skill in y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> tongue: I am the more I hope, to be borne with all. And where as the authour in the Latine copie, recitynge the peculiar
<pb facs="6"/>
Letters, &amp; the pronunciation of them, with the proprietie of the British ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, in stéede of a double letter, as <hi>DD,</hi> or a lettre with an aspiration, as <hi>LH,</hi> would, for breuety sake, haue them wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the same letter &amp; a pricke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the foote: for want of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> like letters: wée haue throughout the whole worke, expressed y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same to that very effect in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> double letter, or with aspiration, from place to place, wher he hath vsed y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same vnder pricked letter. So that hereby, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing; for his conceit of writing: there is no errour committed at al. And herein I thought it needeful to admonish thée.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, if there shall haply ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare any fault, by vs now committed, either in misnamynge any person, Towne, or other thynge, wronge pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of wordes, euell allegation of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, altering of the authours meaning by false poynting, one woord put for an other, or such like, the truth wherof I coulde not exactly try out, by diligent animaduersion, or due conferrence in so short time: I most hartely craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and must néedes impute the most
<pb facs="7"/>
parte therof vnto the falsenesse, an dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordre of the Latine copie, printed at <hi>Colone.</hi> Whose <hi>errata,</hi> are moe then I haue commonly seene in a booke of no greater quantitie, &amp; yet if the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter woulde haue noted all: he shoulde haue noted twise so many as he did, besides that there are many <hi>errata</hi> in <hi>erratis.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But perhappes some wil merueile, what is my reason that I haue termed this worke in English, the <hi>Breuiary</hi> of <hi>Britayne,</hi> since it is not intitled so in <hi>Latine?</hi> To them I answere, that if they deeme of the <hi>Latine</hi> title a right: they shal perceaue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I haue not strayed one iote from the authours meanyng. For, where he calleth this booke <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mētarioli Britannicae descriptionis frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> that is to say, a fragment of a litle treatise, or discourse of the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Britayne:</hi> waygh, and iudge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently (good Reader) how muche I haue gone byside the purpose.</p>
   <p>And here peraduenture, it may be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, accordyng vnto the custome of some translatours, I should fine; and
<pb facs="7"/>
picke my penne, to set foorth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of mine authour, as in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deede, some of them had neede to do. But I feare me much, least in myne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer rash attempt, in takyng so worthy a writer in hand, not beyng furnished with any greater skyll, and learnynge in this his kinde, then I am knowne to be: I haue deserued iust blame, and <hi>M. Lhuyd,</hi> if he were liuynge: woulde haue desired me of lesse acquaintance.</p>
   <p>Whose passyng earnest traueile, in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynyng skil, and knowledge: hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruedly purchased vnto him immortal fame, and so much the rather, for that he hath therin endeuoured him selfe to doo his countrie good, wherevnto all men are naturally bounden. And not only contented to take the paynes for his owne knowledge sake, but willing to pleasure other therby: hath commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the same vnto the worlde.</p>
   <p>Which commendable example of his, I trust shalbe a prouocation vnto some other in this Realme, that haue trauei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led longe time, and taken much paines in the searching out of antiquities, and
<pb facs="8"/>
