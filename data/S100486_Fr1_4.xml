   <head>¶Mayster Alexis of Piemont
vnto the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath béene a very auncient opinion of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
(worthy Readers) that there is giuen
vnto man of nature, a desire to vnderstand, for they
supposed, that oure soules in taking imperfection,
through the vniting with y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> substance, by the meane
of vnderstanding, should approch the neerer to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
their winges alreadie lost, and to returne vnto
their pristinate perfection: but forasmuch as diuers
of them, were inclined to sundrie wayes of vnderstanding, some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the occasion vnto the starres, other vnto the predomination in
our bodyes, more of one humor then of an other. Aristotle distinctly
notwithstanding, seemeth to attribute euery thing in this, vnto our
election, which through the pretext of some felicitie, or profite, doth
dispose vs to practise rather one thing then an other. But verilye
which of them soeuer is true, the inclination of my natiuitie, I haue
alwayes knowne to haue beene giuen to the vnderstanding of diuers
things, and especially of those, which apperteyne vnto the cure of
mens bodies. And to put it in executiō, I disposed my selfe to trauaile
diuers Countries, and to be conuersaunt with diuers sortes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
not omitting with all industrie thorowly to search out the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the secretes of many nations, and with them likewise to
make experience, by putting them into practise, by reason whereof in
short space, through the recouery of helth, which the people did feele,
I became so famous, that I obscured the names of the most expert
Phisitions that were, through which occasion I haue beene resorted
vnto as it were with infinite kinds of Nations, with exceeding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
vnto my great credit. And although for all things, I rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thankes vnto the diuine bountie, yet my iuuenile minde was not
voyde of euerie sparkle of ambition and glorie. I wrote them in the
yeares passed, certaine tryfling things, part whereof were of my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes
(although weake) belonging vnto phisick, part vnto the bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
of women, and part vnto other practises, to manifest vnto
the worlde that I had knowledge in misticall thinges, whereby I
conceyued to obtaine greater glorie, then much to helpe, hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
reserued in the priuiest partes of my heart as a most precious
treasure, the profound secrets of the Art of healing, and the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the same, for the which I haue bene alwayes had in es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall
veneration. Neyther was their any (although a most deare
friend) that might get of me any small intelligence of my secretes, so
much I desired not to haue any part of my glorie or reputation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished.
And bicause euerye mans operations, are directed vnto
<pb facs="4"/>
some laudable ende, or that we accompt worthie of commendation,
I being incited long since, and of my deare friendes requested, that
I woulde for a vniuersall benefite vnto all the worlde, reduce into
lyght, these my secretes, to the ende they might profite the absent,
and those which are farre distant from the Region where I inhabit.
I refused to accept anye one part of their perswasions, accounting
him vnwise, which to benefit other, would depriue himselfe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and dignitie, so much was I blinded in worldly glorie. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nowe come to that age, in the which it is necessarie by the course
of nature, to yeelde my soule vnto God, being nowe impotent, and
thinking it the duetie of one man to doe good vnto another, and most
of all in matters of phisick, which are communicated vnto vs of God
for a vniuersall commoditie: I haue esteemed it not my part or dutye
to preferre my peculier profite, before that of all the worlde, for in so
doing I must haue supposed and beleeued to haue committed a great
error, if I had not yeelded my selfe culpaple, and repented mee, to
haue hidden from the whole worlde, such a benefite vnto this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
And therefore calling vnto memorie the perswasions once made
vnto me, of the noble and worthie knight maister Francuccio Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio,
touching this matter, and also examming mine owne conscience,
I coulde no longer absteyne from wryting and publishing them to
adorne therewith the worlde, bicause otherwise dying, I shoulde
worthily haue beene accompted not inferiour vnto an homicide: as
also to eschue the crymes of auaritious persons, who hauing hidden
their treasures in the grounde, and Death surprising them, remayne
buried togither with their substaunce, and depart out of the world, in
the displeasure both of God and man. Therefore if my first conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and purpose to write, was of ambition and vaine glorie, as is
the propertie of yong minds, little regarding y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which they are bound
vnto: This other shall not dissent from the duetie of a christian, &amp; one
full of compassion towards mankind: that is to publish &amp; dispoyle my
self of all those secrets, vnto an vniuersal cōmodity which hither vnto
I haue kept with my self as most dere and precious, &amp; being desirous
to accomplish the said decree, hauing gathered al my experienced me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
I haue thought good to ioyne them togither, with those
whych were printed in time passed, which although they were not
of such importaunce, neuerthelesse they are things both of skill, and
credit, whereof hauing gotten a volume, and read it sundrie times,
I haue found them so altered and corrupted, that with difficultie I
might be perswaded to beleeue that they were mine, they were so
wholy altered, except only in name. And hauing in part corrected the
volume of the superfluous, and thinges of little account added vnto
it, being well pervsed, I haue ioyned therewith this my last labor
of the fourth and finall Booke of my secretes, which all, are things
apperteyning vnto sundrie and dyuers diseases of mans bodye, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
reserued it as a treasure vnto thys present, wherein maye
<pb facs="5"/>
be read sixe hundred foure score and odde, very excellent and most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
experiences, all true, and euery of them proued as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
times, with infinite sortes of people, and haue alwayes beene
found effectuall. Neyther looke you for any other thing of me in time
to come: First, bicause in these my trauayles (as I haue alreadie
sayde, I haue spoyled my selfe of all that euer I experienced: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in that I am so olde, as within short space, you maye suppose to
vnderstande rather of my departure out of lyfe, then to receyue of me
any other thing, if their be not written somewhat vnder my name, of
some malicious person to deceaue you withall, and to encrease the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
without any profite. I will not omit to aduertise the Readers,
that they deceaue not themselues through my examples, working
these medicines wythout the counsell &amp; wholesome aduertisements
of some expert Phisition, for I neuer wrote them to that ende, since
from my tender age, contynually I haue applied the studie of good
letters, in such sort that the secretes of sciences are not hidden vnto
me, neyther is there any Cannon of Phisick that I haue not verie
well vnderstood: and therefore haue knowne with the age, with the
seasons, and with conuenient time to applie and vse them: Besides
the knowledge to aduertise one if neede were to be let bloud, and an
other to be purged, and hauing proceeded in this manner, there was
neuer any Pacient of mine, that hath not obtayned his due remedie.
You therfore (vnto those I speake which vnderstand not the cannons
of Phisicke) when occasion happeneth to vse my secretes, take the
counsell of some expert Phisition, to the ende you may attayne the
benefite. Bicause in not knowing to compound, applye, and minister
them as you ought to doe, you may slaunder the Phisition that hath
healed many. Accustome therefore to take counsell of such Phisitions
as are honest, and that practise the Art without fraude: for there are
seene of that profession many, which being giuen to prattle, and tell fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to deceaue the people, doe vitupcrate the experiences, with say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they are wicked, and such lyke. Not considering that sicke
persons are not cured with trifles, as affirmeth the worthy Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Celsus, but with experimented medicines, not newly found out
(if well they vnderstoode the Art.) And assure your selues, that by
practising these secrets which I set openly foorth (as is conuenient)
and preparing them with diligence, and with chosen simples, alwaies
they will worke according to your intent, for in this booke there
is nothing mencioned, which hath not beene many times
practised, and founde true, through the grace of
Almightie God, vnto whome be giuen
all praise, and glorie, worlde
without ende.</p>
