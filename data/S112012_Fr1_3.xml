Should wee not take notice of what the Church our Mother delivereth unto us out of the said fundamentall bookes of hers? They are counted gracelesse children, which will not heare their naturall Mother speake, which will scorne or set light of their grave naturall mothers teaching and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing unto them: and may those people be justly reputed gracious Christians, which despise, or nothing, or very little regard the Divine Service doctrine of their Spirituall mother?

<pb facs="6"/>and the licentious Libertines of these times, scoffe at sentences in the afore-mentioned fundamentall bookes of the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Church of England, or at all the said bookes, or at any of them; and when wee heare the malignant Pharisees scoffe at the fundamentall most sacred Order in the Christian Clergie, let us not mervaile: for they dared to scoffe at Jesus Christ the eternall God, as Saint<note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 16.14.</note>
      <hi>Luke</hi> recordeth.

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, The Church of the living God is the pillar and ground (or<note n="e" place="margin">1.

For (saith the Scripture there) <hi>Ezra</hi> had prepared his heart to<note n="g" place="margin">Verse 10.</note> seeke the Law of the Lord, and to doe it, and to teach in Israel, statutes and judgements. It is said in the Epistle unto the Hebrewes, That <hi>Abraham</hi> looked for a Citie which hath<note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 11.10.</note> foundations, whose builder and maker is God. And saith Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> That the holy Citie new Jerusalem, which commeth<note n="i" place="margin">Rev. 3.12. and 21.2.3.10.14.

Whether this holy Citie be not <hi>the beloved Citie</hi> spoken of in the Chapter next afore, where it is said, That Satan being loosed out of prison, would gather <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi>
      <note n="k" place="margin">Rev. 20.9.</note> against it, &amp;c. Let those judge, whom

      </note> determine on such sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred matters. But the said spirituall Citie of God, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription whereof the holy Apostle ended his writing, hath in the spirituall wall thereof twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lambe. Whereby we are given to understand, that the Apostolical order in the Christian Ministerie, is also a certaine foundation in divers respects, the which it concerneth you to know, and whereof to make use in the due<note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 13.17.

It is come to that passe among many, as to have no consideration at all on that most holy Order of the Clergie<note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.28 Eph. 4.11.12.</note> constituted by Jesus Christ: and hence it is that so much atheisme, heathenishnesse, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnesse is in some people.

And concerning eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Pastour and Curate it is to be knowne, that it is their parts and duties not onely to put people in remembrance, what are the expresse words of holy Scripture; but also to make known unto them more and more (as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith) the <hi>Mothers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctine and law,</hi> the interpretations and applications of the sacred texts by the Church in her<note n="*" place="margin">It is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth unto <hi>Titus</hi> then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the Cretians, that an Elder or a Priest <hi>must hold fast the faithfull word, as hee hath beene taught.</hi> Tit. 1.9.

Yee shal by Gods grace plainely see, that all new doctrine cōtrary to the old do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the divine Service of the Church, is utter untruth, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, unprofitable, unwholsome, hurtful to minde and life; yea, &amp; that which hath beene cause of a very great part of the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmnesse in Religion, which is in some; and of the licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of life, which is in many others.

      <hi>To the law, and to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie: if they speake not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.</hi> So likewise it may be with a safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science before God affirmed, if any one<note n="*" place="margin">There are that could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly condis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend unto it, but having a long time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed with some difference from it, they are more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over their owne honour among men, then of Gods glory. See of such in Iohn 12 42 43. &amp; 5.44.</note> speake not according to the Communion booke doctrine of the Church of England, but preach or teach contrary unto the same, it is because there is no<note n="c" place="margin">Math. 18.17.</note> light of Gods holy spirit within him. And whereas so long as I am your watchman, it is my bounden duty to speake unto you Gods words, and the words of his holy Church,<note n="d" place="margin">Ezech. 2.3.4.5.6.7.8.</note> whether yee will heare, or whether yee will forbeare, as the Lord commanded his Minister <hi>Ezechiel;</hi> and to warne such as hold any errour in Religion for to depart from the same, and such as have any viciousnesse in their life, for to forsake it all; because I so doing have delivered mine owne soule, and the<note n="e" place="margin">Ezech. 33.7.8.9.</note> bloud of every unrepentant one will be upon his owne head, I have for the further discharge of mine owne conscience, and for the more edification of every one of you in the Catholique and Apostolike faith, and in the true Christian life, manners, and conversation,<note n="f" place="margin">See Acts 8 30. Neh. 8.8. 1 Cor. 14 20.15.</note> explaned the most sacred Catechisme of the Church, namely that which is in the booke of Common prayer, wherein all the chiefe principles of the true Christian Religion are comprised, and in most divine manner for every capacity expressed. When the faithfull Ministers of Jesus Christ taught Christianity unto people, they first taught them the word of the<note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 5.12.13. 1 Cor. 3.2.</note> beginning of Christ, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> signifieth; They first<note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 6.1.</note> laid the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God, and of the doctrine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismes, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternall judgement. And when people were
<pb facs="8"/>sixe fundamentall matters in the great mysterie of godlinesse, then were they led on unto perfection, as the Holy Ghost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly delivereth. Then were they taught the high points about the Priesthood of <hi>Melchisedech.</hi> But as the Apostle saith speaking thereof, <hi>Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing</hi>

      <hi>When for the time yee ought to be teachers, yee have need that one teach you againe, which be the first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milke, and not of strong meat.</hi> Such meane proficients there were among the professed members of the Church of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> unto whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> said:<note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.2.3.</note>
      <hi>I have fed you with milke, and not with meat: for hitherto yee were not able to beare it, neither yet now are yee able. For yee are yet earnall: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions,</hi> are yee not carnall, and walke as men? Now the benefits which every one shall reape, that will diligently and unpartially reade all in this worke contained,<note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 103.18.</note> for to conforme his heart, spirit and conversation, according to all the doctrine of God, and of his holy Church herein mentioned (for it is impossible for any one of a contrary affection,<note n="n" place="margin">Math. 13.11.

      </note> to understand aright any of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian mysteries, how learned soever hee be in languages, arts, or any other humane literature, as it is most plainely declared in the end of this worke) the benefits which every truly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious one may make, are; first, to understand more and more the Divine Service Catechisme, the true grounds of Christs Religion. Secondly, it will be an<note n="o" place="margin">Luk. 11.52.</note> introduction, how the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to understand &amp; to profit by reading the rest of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer, the Homilies, and other fundamentall bookes of the Church.

Fourthly, whereas also there are in this worke some of the highest points in Divinity expounded, every one that desireth to be led on unto Evangelicall perfection of minde and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, shall by Gods helpe finde here in such a light and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection thereunto, as whereby he in reading the harder places
<pb facs="8"/>of the booke of God, shall be able to perceive out of many of them more and more unto his edification and great consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Fifthly, youth and other ignorant persons (if they will take so much paines as to read or heare read all this worke) they will hereby understand the meaning more and more of the Catechisme, which they learne by heart, and also of the Divine Service which they heare in the Church; and become the more able to<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 15.10.

Sixtly, the most sacred doctrine of the Divine Service of the Church will become more honoured, more attended unto, more meditated on, more beleeved and obeyed.
