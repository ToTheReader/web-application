      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is lately come forth a <hi>Coale</hi> from the <hi>Altar,</hi> and behinde it a Letter to the Vicar of Grantham: The Author of either of these is to me utterly unknowne. My speech therefore must needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and my personall reflections none at all.</p>
   <p>Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> is marked by the <hi>Coale</hi> to bee the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that Epistle: This man I knew well in <hi>Cambridge</hi> to have humanity-learning of his owne: And if I may know him by this Letter, then I am sure, hee hath taken his Divinity upon trust. Hereby he hath made a double forfeiture, of the Merchants faith, and of his owne, and laboured to his owne losse, and theirs that beleeve in him, if he make not both good.</p>
   <p>It is twenty yeares and upward, since he was translated from the body of <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge, to be made a member of a new bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy severed from the ancient Clergy of <hi>England</hi> (as King <hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory in his Directions speakes) to become neither Parson, Vicar, nor Curat; but Lecturer of <hi>Boston.</hi> It is therfore hard to determine, which of his Diocesans he doth personate in that Letter.</p>
   <p>Wherefore this <hi>Quaere</hi> we must leave, as the servants did the inquirie after him that had sowen tares, and was stept aside, to their Masters detection. Their Master told them it was the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious man that had done it, but named him not, whereby they perceived, that the apprehension of the malefactor concerned not them so much, as the plucking up of the tares.</p>
   <p>The case is ours; The tares which the pen-man hath brought out of his treasures of late writers misunderstood, the Authour of the <hi>Coale</hi> hath pluckt up. What he hath fetcht from their Elders, my endeavour, by Gods assistance, may in some part weede out. Thus having brought you acquainted with my scope, I betake my selfe, and you both, to God, and the working of his grace, <hi>farewell.</hi>
