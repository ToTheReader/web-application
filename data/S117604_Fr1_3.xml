   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which most men alleage (courteous Reader) as a cause of publishing vnto the world their commendable endeuours; as commaundement of superiours, intreatie of friends, or such like: causes yeelding some excuse, if things well done by them needed any; that can I no way pretend: though no man hath iuster cause to inuent somewhat to excuse that, which (well knowing and confessing my owne insufficiencie) I should by no inducements haue beene drawen vnto. For I wanted not iudgement to know, that to performe this I vndertooke as I ought, was a matter beyond the compasse of my skill: yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse my will ouercomming my owne iudgement and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in vndertaking, I haue ventured my credit to the wide sea of common opinion, and dangerous censure; and knowing the best haue followed the woorst. A fault perhaps pardonlesse, in the rigoroust censure, and which bred in my selfe a long time distrust and feare: yet at last, incouraged by hope to find some milder iudges for my boldnes, I ventured this labour, and performed it thus meanely as thou seest: trusting the courteous Reader, if in ought I haue pleasured him, will affoord me his good woord for my good will, and in that I haue done amisse pardon, and a fauourable construction for my paines. And although in reason it seemeth, I should most of all feare the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the learned (if any such vouchsafe to read this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation) in regard they best can, and with quickest insight pearce into my want of skill, iudgement, and vnderstanding;
<pb facs="4"/>
yet in those is my greatest hope, because they be learned. Cause sufficient to feare no captious or carping constructions, as a propertie ill beseeming their good qualitie and education. I was well assured that he who best might, would take no further paines in this kind: nor hearing of any other which would, I thought some could be contented to haue it rather il done, than not at all. Friendly Reader, I craue pardon for my faults, and desire thou wouldest fauourably beare with my ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights.</p>
   <closer>Farewell.</closer>
