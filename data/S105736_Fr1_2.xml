   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, here is a liuely description of the mercifulnesse of our God, wherin thou mayest behold his Fatherly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, shewed vnto vs Christians, in that he forewarneth vs to flie from the wrath to come, as it appeareth by this picture here before thine eyes; the matter declareth vnto thee, the most horrible and strangest birth of a child, that euer was heard or seene to bee borne of any Christian woman in our dayes: which wonderfull strange newes, God the Almighty doth send, to declare vnto vs his wrath, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy displeasure to be at hand, except wee speedily repent, and be heartily sorrie for our former wicked life. But let our hope bee fully reposed in the comfortable, and most sweet promises of the holy Ghost, who pronounceth by the mouth of his seruants the Prophets and Apostles, these words to our comfort, At what time soeuer a sinner repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from the bottome of his heart, I will put all his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse out of my remembrance, sayth the Lord.</p>
   <p>Let not these fearefull and terrible examples terrifie or feare thee, gentle Reader; for all these things, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Math.</hi> 24. must needes come to passe, but the end is not yet: For Nation shall rise against Nation, and Realme against Realme, and there shall bee Famines, Pestilences, Thunders, and Earth-quakes in all places, before the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble day of the Lord do come, in which day all things, as it is written, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. That he shall come as a Theefe in the night: yet of his meere mercy doth hee vse these terrible sights as a messenger, and fore-teller of his wrath to come:
<pb facs="4"/> For as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, When they shal say, Peace and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then sodaine destruction commeth vpon them, as sorrow vpon a woman with childe, and they shall not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape in any wise. Therefore let vs not sleepe in security, as others doe, but let vs watch and be sober, for the day of the Lord is at hand, lest sodainly his wrath will come, and in the time of vengeance, he shall destroy vs: From the which, God the Father, for his Sonne Christs sake, deliuer vs. AMEN.</p>
