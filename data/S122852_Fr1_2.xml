   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee be taught by many and sundry examples of holy Scriptures, that vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of particular punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, afflictions and perils, which God of his most iust iudgement hath sometimes sent among his people, to shew his wrath against sin, and to call them to repentance, and to the redresse of their liues, all men ought to bee provoked and stirred vp to more feruencie and diligence in Prayer, Fasting and Almes-deeds, to a more
<pb facs="4"/> deepe consideration of their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to ponder their vnthankefulnesse and forgetfulnesse of Gods mercifull benefits towards them, with crauing of pardon for the time past, and to aske his assistance for the time to come, to live more godly, and so to be defended and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from all further perils and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 24.14.</note> So King <hi>David</hi> in the time of Plague and Pestilence which ensued up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his vaine numbring of the people, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto God with wonderfull feruency, confessing his fault, desiring God to spare the people, and rather to turne his ire to himward, who had chiefly offended in that transgression. The like was done by the vertuous Kings,<note place="margin">2. Chr. 20.5 2. Reg. 19.1. Ionah 3.</note>
      <hi>Iosaphat</hi> and <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,</hi> in their distresse of warres and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne invasions. So did the King and
<pb facs="4"/> people of <hi>Nineue,</hi> and <hi>Hester,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ester 14.13 Dan. 9.4.</note> fall to humble prayers in like perils of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So did <hi>Daniel</hi> in his captiuity, and many other moe in their troubles. Now therefore calling to minde, that God hath beene prouoked by vs to visit vs at this present with the Plague and other grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous diseases: It hath beene thought meet to excite and stirre vp all godly people within this Realme, to pray earnestly and heartily to God to forgiue vs our sinnes, and consequently to turne away his deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued wrath from vs, and to restore vs to his gracious fauour, and to our bodily health. And although it is euery Christian mans duty, of his owne deuotion to pray at all times: yet for that the corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man is so slothfull and negligent herein, he hath need by often and sundry
<pb facs="5"/> meanes to be stirred vp and put in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his duty. For the effectuall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment whereof, it is thought meet that this order of Prayer following should at this time bee published, being such as shall be vsed by the Minister in the Church, and may by euery man in his priuate family.</p>
