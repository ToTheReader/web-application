   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Eace be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you and
loue, with
faith from
God the father, and the
Lord Iesus Christ. The
<pb facs="3"/>
impertunitie, of diuerse
of my hearers, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of many of all
sorts, together with my de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sire
to yeeld some account
of my long vndelightfull
leasure, haue inclined me
to prepare some of my
publike and priuate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
for the common
view: hoping that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
respect of my
friends will couer the
wants, and weakenesses
which other men will soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
espie. Howsoeuer I
haue long meditated, a
worke of greater labour,
then this ensuing treatise
yet in the meane time I
<pb facs="3"/>
haue beene willing to tast
the approbation of good
men, and make my best
aduauntage of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the many minded
multitude, by aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to send foorth these
first fruites, as a handfull
gathered out of the rest.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Worthie Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,</hi>
there are manie
reasons induce me to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
these signes vnder
your name, your singular
loue and liking of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie,
together vvith
your reuerent and willing
entertainement, of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Ministers (receiuing
them as the messengers of
<pb facs="4"/>
the Churches, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of Christ as partners
and fellow helpers, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the same spirit)
challengeth from vs some
publike testimonie of our
acknowledgemēt of Gods
grace, and of the ioy,
vvherewith vve reioyced
for your sake; besides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
indeauour to make
vse of all opportunities
for your resolution, and
direction, in the seuerall
conflicts, and cases of
your conscience. I haue
had occasion fully to know
your order, and manner
of life, your desires, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
teares, &amp; vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb facs="4"/>
your faith, your loue,
your obedience: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being assured, that
you are marked euen
with euerie one of these
signes; vvhy should I not
say vnto you, as somtimes
<hi>Iob</hi> said of himselfe.<note place="margin">Iob 31. 35</note>

      </q> And I am
vvell assured, that this
treatise vvill finde good
accesse vnto the hands
and hearts of diuers in
these parts, euen for the
loue they beare to you, and
for the good they novv
heare you haue by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
reaped from
<pb facs="5"/>
these. Neither had I beene
easily drawne to publish
these, but that hauing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
in conference with
many to make vse of thē,
I could hardly satisfie
them vvith coppies. I
spare to alleadge other
reasons.</p>
   <p>Novv vvhat remains
but that I should beseech
you, and all those vvho
finde by these signes the
assurance of Gods eternal
loue, euen to honour the
Lord vvith the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
sacrifices of praise, the
fruite of your lips,<note place="margin">Heb. 13</note> vvith
confession to his name, oh
loue the Lord vvith your

whole heart, and make
his praise glorious, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
more and more, in
the fruites of sincere life,
and in all holy, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conuersation, liue by
faith, and in nothing be
carefull,<note place="margin">Phil. 4, 6</note> but in all things,
let your requests he made
knowne to God, vvith
thanksgiuing: and as you
haue receiued mercy faint
not, neither be descoraged
vnder the sence of your
infirmities and vvants,<note place="margin">2, Cor, 4, 1</note>
for they that vvaite vpon
the Lord,<note place="margin">Esa. 40, 31</note> shall renevv
their strength, the Lord

of God is made knowne
in vveakenesse,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12</note> and his

   <p>Gracious gentlewoman

And the same

that hath directed, your

as you haue professed, a

<pb facs="7"/>
how vnblameably you
