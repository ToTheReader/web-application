   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE SIR THOMAS COVENTREY KNIGHT, L. KEEPER OF THE Great <hi>Seale of England,</hi> One of his <hi>Maiesties</hi> most Honourable <hi>Priuie Counsell.</hi>

   <opener>
      <salute>My most Honoured Lord,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Author of this Excellent <hi>Historie</hi> was the same wise and worthy <hi>Frier,</hi> who of late with so great iudgement and fidelitie hath reuealed vnto the
<pb facs="3"/> World that piece of the <hi>Mystery</hi> of
<hi>Iniquity,</hi> those <hi>Arcana Imperij Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficij,</hi> in the
<hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Trent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi> which shall bee a lasting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of his memorie, and Fame to all Posterity. His owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men knew well how to value and reward his Vertues, iudging him a Person capable to assist in their Highest <hi>Counsels</hi> of <hi>State:</hi> But at
<hi>Rome</hi> his goodnesse easily merited the extreme hatred of the
<hi>Courtiers</hi> (though hee liued and died in the outward Cōmunion of that
<hi>Church,)</hi> so farre, that they sentenced and martyred him in his Picture (being defeated in their reall attempt vpon his Person) as a
<hi>Mezzo Lutherano,</hi> an <hi>Heretique,</hi> such as are, in their account, all those that cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb facs="3"/> that thirteenth Article of the <hi>Roman Creed, Subesse Romano Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fici &amp;c. est de necessitate salutis.</hi> In these <hi>Annals</hi> Your <hi>Lordship</hi> may see the naturall Power of all Soueraigne <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Law-giuers,</hi> first rudely assaulted by Him who will needs bee Perpetuall <hi>Dictator</hi> at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and giue <hi>Lawes</hi> at his pleasure to all the World; then generously asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and vindicated by that most Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and
<hi>Illustrious Common-wealth,</hi> which though one of the most aged in
<hi>Europe,</hi> hath still maintained it selfe fresh and flourishing, amidst all the Confusions and Alterations of <hi>Italy;</hi> an indubitable argument that it is a <hi>Body</hi> well complexion'd, and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon sollide Rules of good Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. The <hi>Translator</hi> presumes to
<pb facs="4"/> put this Piece into Your <hi>Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Hands, not as prizing so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his owne performance (which is but weake like Himselfe, then whom none is more conscious of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:) but encouraged hereto both by Your Benignity, and by the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the Worke it selfe, from which hee knowes Your <hi>Lordships</hi> Wisedome will draw many serious and important Considerations. Also his priuate
<hi>Interests</hi> binde him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely and vpon all occasions to professe his very very deepe obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to Your <hi>Honour,</hi> such as He can neuer satisfie. He could speake largely in Your Praise, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Voice</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit him from suspition of flatterie (which naturally Hee abhorres,)
<pb facs="4"/> the <hi>Kingdome</hi> generally being much comforted to obserue the great Iudgement of our most Gracious Soueraigne, and his loue to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique in his choice of so Able and worthy an
<hi>Officer:</hi> But hee forbears, lest He should offer violence to Your Modesty, and refers Your Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to <hi>God,</hi> and Your owne good Conscience to bee more really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced. Finally, Hee euery day heartily blesses <hi>God</hi> to see this <hi>Church</hi> so happy in so great a <hi>Friend,</hi> and an Example of Religion, and this <hi>State</hi> in so great a <hi>Patrone</hi> and Patterne of <hi>Equity.</hi> The same
<hi>God</hi> of Grace continue long Your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> an Instrument of his Glory, and multiply all his Mercies vpon Your owne Person, Your most Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Ladie,</hi> and Your Hopefull Children. This is the Prayer of</p>

      <signed>Your Lordships sincerely and thankefully deuoted C. P.</signed>
