   <head>To the Christian Reader, that needs Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Physicke from the Word, against Griefe, or Feare, by reason of the Plague.</head>
   <p>IN the beginning of the Creation,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.2.</note>
      <hi>when dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was vpon the deepe,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6.</note>
      <hi>the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the light to shine out of darknesse.</hi> As vnlikely effect of such a cause as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one see, that was
<pb facs="7"/> borne blind,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.11.</note> by <hi>anointing his eyes with clay and spittle;</hi> which was more likely to put them out, if euer hee had any sight.</p>
   <p>Not long since, there was darknesse and heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vpon the face of my Family, by reason of Gods Visitation, and (behold) out of the darknes of that sorrow, Almightie GOD hath brought forth this Light of Spirituall cōfort.</p>
   <p>After a sort, I may truly say, GOD hath commaunded it to shine
<pb facs="7"/> forth, partly by his speciall assistance, when J was (in my selfe) very vnfyt for study, and partly by his prouidence in stirring vp many to bee very inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue to seeke after it, and to bee very importunate for the publishing thereof.</p>
   <p>J neuer intended to <hi>put this Light vnder a Bushell</hi> wholly to couer it:<note place="margin">
         <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.15</note> for J did <hi>set it vpon a Candlesticke</hi> to giue light in one roome (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to my Parishioners, kindred, and friends to
<pb facs="8"/> whom J gaue some Copies: But now at the instance of many, J haue put it into a Lanthorne &amp; hung it out, in the open streets for the benefit of all passengers.</p>
   <p>J confesse the light is but small it giues, but J hope it will burne cleere, and sweet: the Treatise (J trust) wil be free from errour, and offence.</p>
   <p>J acknowledge also, that it is hung out somewhat late in the Euening, when many are at rest in their graues by the Visitation:
<pb facs="8"/> but (the truth is) my tynder was wet, J could not strike fyer to light it sooner, and when it was lighted, J could not get it hung vp any sooner.</p>
   <p>My meaning is, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse of my heart for Gods visytation, on the Citie, my Congregation, and my Family was some let to the penning of it: and the difficultie of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Work men to print it, was a great hinderance to the publishing thereof any sooner.</p>
   <pb facs="9"/>
   <p>Now that it is fyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and published my request is to the Christian Reader, that hee vvould not <hi>close his eyes,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19</note> that hee cannot see the light, but open them to <hi>walke by it,</hi> to the end hee may not stumble and fal, at im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Griefe or Feare by reason of his own, or his friendes Visytation by the Plague.</p>
   <p>And my humble Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is: That hee, who <hi>is the true Light,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.9</note>
      <hi>that lighteneth euery one

      </gap>eading &amp; perusing of my Treatise, for the glory of God, and the good of his Church; and let all that read it for their comfort, say with me, <hi>Amen.</hi> Euen as J will say with all that find comfort by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, <hi>The Lord bee praised</hi>
