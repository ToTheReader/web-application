   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Traueller
(Right graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
SOVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAIGN)
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some time
in surueying
&amp; obseruing
the people,
maners, and
state of foraine countries, vpon returne ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
a reckoning of his time spent by report
of the fruite and effect receiued by his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
whereby he gaineth vnto himselfe the
credite of knowledge, and giueth vnto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
direction and comfort of trauell. My selfe
<pb facs="3"/>
hauing passed the morning tide of my Time
(wherein I should haue conuersed with the
learned for my better instruction) onely in the
vaine disports and pleasures of the field: And
now at the Sunne setting looking back to view
the benefit receiued thereby, do finde the seed
of pleasures to render no fruit, &amp; so by defect
of learning, insueth the effect of Idlenes, being
meerly nothing. The profite of which experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
bestowed as a remembrance for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort in their yoonger yeeres, to mingle with
their pleasures some exercise of knowledge &amp;
learning, may happily produce in them an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in future time, wherby to conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
answerable to their degrees &amp; callings,
both for the better performance of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
vnto the State, as also for the administring
of Iustice in the weale publike. For a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
without learning is like vnto an vnskilful
physition, who maketh the whole sick, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
seldome the diseased: or rather more fitly
compared with an vnlearned schoolemaister,
who in steed of instruction giueth correction.
For as he seldome well ruleth, who hath not
first duly obeied: euen so faileth he right to
<pb facs="3"/>
censure, who hath not in him to discerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
right and wrong; the offended, and the
offence giuer. As Idlenes is the mother of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
so is it the nurse of aspiring and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loiall
minds. Neither do I infer heerupon the
vnlearned to be ill affected, but onely the idle
to be woorst disposed. And as the qualities of
Idlenes are diuers, so are the effects accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly;
some end in mischief, som others waste
Time without profit, other some giue good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of reformatiō: which last of the three,
is the whole summe of my trauel. For finding in
my self the want of those ornaments and good
partes of learning which are requisite for the
honorable, could wish others not to feed the
flower of their yeeres with the vanities of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
but to recompence the benefit of time with
some effect of knowledge, to the good of thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
as example of theirs. For in the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or type of mans life, the most that we know
is the least part of the rest wherof we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
My deceased Grandfather (most gracious
Soueraign) your Maiesties late officer and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
being a President vnto his to shun Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and to performe their duties with all loial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="4"/>
&amp; obedience passed many yeeres in Court,
as well to manifest the humble desire of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
mind towards his Princesse, as also for the
instruction of his posteritie to hold nothing
(next vnto the true knowledge and feare of
God) of like price, as the inestimable comfort
of the good opinion and fauour of their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne:
wherof hoping, and by sundry assured
experiments finding no lesse from your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
towardes me, as onely proceeding from
your Highnes gracious inclination &amp; clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and not of any desert or my part giuing
cause thereof; am thereby the rather embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
most humbly to craue pardon, as one by
reason of many defects vnable to perform that
seruice which in desire I wish, and in duetie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth,
as chiefly acknowledging my selfe
greatly bound vnto your Highnes, in that your
Maiestie most graciously tendring my long
sicknes &amp; weake estate of body, would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to licence my late absence frō so speciall a
cause of importāce concerning the proceding
against those vnnaturall and traiterous parts
&amp; practises, tending to the destruction of your
Maiesties sacred and royall person: sorowing
<pb facs="4"/>
the aduerse euent of my health at the instant,
especially such, as vpon so firme an argument
or token of your Maiesties most gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
and good opinion conceiued, not to be in
case by seruice to performe any thing answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in desert to the least part of so honorable a
credite &amp; fidelitie reposed. But (right mightie
and Soueraigne Lady) like as your Maiestie of
speciall grace hath hitherto accepted my wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and dutifull mind in lieu of action: Euen so
on my knee I humbly beseech the continuance
of so gracious fauor, vntil my state of body wil
permit the accomplishment (by seruice) of my
humble good will and willingnes. And albeit
my time spent hath wrought no condigne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
whereupon I should presume to make this
humble petition, neither doth there proceed
therof any effect of gratuitie worthie the view
or acceptance of your Maiestie: And though
discretion forbiddeth me to present your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
with the fruit of my time passed, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
by many degrees inferior and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to be offered to so learned and prudent a
Princesse: yet dutifull good will, not hauing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
to manifest it selfe vpon experience of
<pb facs="5"/>
your Maiesties former graces, comforteth me
of your highnes fauourable acceptance. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might I with modestie presume to present
your Maiestie with so meere a trifle as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Idlenes (for other title or terme I may
not woorthily giue it, though in truth it be the
fruit of my time best spent, in respect of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue
more vainly passed) were it so that vpon
returne of my trauell an iourney taken in the
vanities of pleasures I had to report of better
choise of commoditie receiued. And bicause
Time requireth me to render an account, (as
whose Idlenes hath been greater than of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
others) and least my euill example might
withdraw the better disposed from the studie
and exercise of knowledge, I do confesse my
errour therein accordingly as the title of this
Pamphlet giueth testimonie, which appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
your Maiesties presence in so simple an
habite, craueth pardon for so bold an attempt,
as also becommeth an humble petitioner to
be admitted to supplie the place of his absent
and diseased master, who in all humilitie and
loialtie of hart prostrateth himself at your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
feete, most humbly beseeching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
<pb facs="5"/>
of your Highnes former fauors and
clemencie, without which, neither he nor his
shall be in case to performe such offices as in
dutie and honor appertaineth. And thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledging
my selfe most bounden vnto
your right gracious and excellent Maiestie,
do according to duetie beseech the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
for the long continuance
of your Maiesties prosperous
Estate and raigne in all
happinesse and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie.</p>
