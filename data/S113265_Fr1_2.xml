      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E had great hope (deare friend) that you would haue beene a stay and comforte to vs all, and an ornament to your kinred and Countrie, and therefore no costes nor charges were spared in bringing you vp in learning, but all was thought well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, not doubting but if God spared you life, you woulde in time be able, not onlie to prouide well for your owne selfe, but also
<pb facs="3"/>
to pleasure the best of your friendes. But wee see all to fall out quite contrarie, to our great griefe &amp; endlesse anguish: for the blinde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and selfe-willed conceites which you haue taken, haue ouerthrowne the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which otherwise lay before you, they haue discredited you with your kinred, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced you in your countrey, caused you to haue your natiue soile, and to leade a poore life in a strainge lande. And yet all these might in some sort be borne, were they not accompanied with the endlesse mone of your Parents. If you well remember, you were long since told, that if you perseuered to take, &amp; to holde such opinions as you then began to doe, your burning woulde stande you in small steede, and consequently your kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes and friendes should haue little ioy, or comfort of you. And so we see it is come to passe. Your aged Parentes neuer cease to vrge vs to write to you, to mooue you yet at the length to remember your selfe, and either by returning to amende all which is amisse, or else by shewing some Reasons to purge your selfe, and so to yeelde them some satisfaction. We therefore praye you in all kindnesse to write vnto vs, &amp; if by no meanes
<pb facs="3"/>
you will be drawen backe from this dolefull course, yet vouchsafe to set down some reasons of your Religion, to the ende you may cleare and purge your selfe of the suspition of sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishnesse, and selfe-wilfulnesse. For you are mightily condemned, and of your kinsfolkes heere, thought to bee,<note place="margin">Bud. ex Cicer.</note>
      <hi>Opinator vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi> one very opinatiue, for that you sticke so stifly to the olde, which heere in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of all sorts is vtterlye condemned as a grosse and a palpable errour. Yet haue not wee your louing friendes so base conceit of you, but wee rather thinke that you haue great and weightie Reasons (at the least in your owne iudgement) to mooue you to take so harde a course as you doe. Our desire therefore is, that wee may haue them written, and sent vs in as briefe manner as you possibly maye, (for to returne wee will not mooue you, except we thought you would conforme your selfe to the Lawes and Religion of your Countrey) thereby to shew and to declare to them who wishe you well, that you are no such opinions companion, as some woulde haue you to be. Thus hoping you haue a care to accomplishe our request, and not to reiecte our Letters, and neglecte

the aunswering of them, as your woonte and custome hath beene heretofore, with our most hartie commendations, wee commit you to God Almightie. London this <hi>13.</hi> of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember. <hi>1599.</hi>
