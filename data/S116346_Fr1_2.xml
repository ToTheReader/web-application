   <p>RIght worthy and beloued
in our Lord Iesus Christ:
It is the wonderfull mercy
and exceeding patience of
our gratious God towards vs of this
<hi>sinfull Nation</hi> that in the middest of
such fearfull stormes and bloody
garboyles deuouring our <hi>neighbors</hi>
round about vs, wee of this <hi>Iland</hi>
though, as it were, enuironed round
about with such tempestuous seas,
do yet notwithstanding enioy such
<pb facs="3"/>
temperate seasons, as not onely to
eate the fruite of our owne labours,
but to be enabled moreouer out of
our aboundance to entertaine and
releeue our distressed neighbours.
And is not the <hi>wisedome of God</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
herein to <hi>warne</hi> vs to <hi>looke
home,</hi> when our <hi>neighbours house</hi> is
on fire, and to make it our owne
case, what is common to vs with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Is not his mercy vnspeakeable
that seeing <hi>charitie couereth a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of sinnes,</hi> and <hi>much is forgiuen to
those that loue much,</hi> therefore wee
may haue hope of <hi>Gods</hi> longer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
&amp; indulgence towards vs,
so long as we regard the afflictions
of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> &amp; by our brotherly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<hi>beare one anothers burthen.</hi>
Surely though the <hi>sickle must be put
in when the haruest is ripe,</hi> and there
are too many signes among vs that
the <hi>regions are white vnto the haruest,</hi>
yea that the <hi>Deere</hi> is gone out to
go through the land, yet euen here
I haue obserued these meanes to stay
the <hi>execution.</hi> First, when there are
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>some</hi> remaining to <hi>stand in the gap</hi> to
turne away the wrath. Secondly,
when the Lord is <hi>iustified</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
by his word. And thirdly,
when by our <hi>compassion</hi> and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
wee doe communicate with
the afflictions of our <hi>brethren,</hi> and
so voluntarily suffer with them in
their distresses. Wherein as we haue
speciall cause to blesse our gratious
God for his good hand with our
worthy <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in this holy
worke, so are wee wisely to secure
our selues in succouring others, and
doing good while wee haue time
to the houshold of faith. Shall not
Sathan and his <hi>instruments</hi> herein
otherwise condemne vs, who if euer
heretore, do speedily combine them
selues against the Lord and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted,
whose maine policy it is
in these latter dayes to <hi>disunite</hi> the
hearts of Christians and to weaken
their hands that they may more
speedily and easily make prey of
them. Doe not his <hi>croaking frogges</hi>
those infernall <hi>Iebusites</hi> compasse
<pb facs="4"/>
land and sea to this end, creeping
into the chambers, yea into the harts
of <hi>Princes,</hi> both to exasperate such as
are auerse against the poore mēbers
of Christ, and also alienate euen the
well affected from the maintenance
of the <hi>common faith.</hi> And doe wee
thinke that they haue left any stone
vnrowled to compasse the same,
can we imagine but that these <hi>spirits
of diuels</hi> haue waded into the depth
of their <hi>fathers</hi> methods, and as she
in the Poet:</p>
   <p>
      <hi>When heauen will affoord no helpe,
shee'le moue the infernall powers,</hi> so in
despite of heauen these <hi>limbs of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
haue now failed to employ the
powers of darkenesse for the more
effectuall deluding of the children
of disobedience? And are not these
the <hi>times</hi> wherein if it were possible
the <hi>very elect</hi> may bee <hi>seduced</hi> and
ensnared hereby. Is not the <hi>wisdome</hi>
and <hi>iustice of God</hi> admirable herein
that when the <hi>Foole saith in his heart
there is no God,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Atheist</hi> dreams
of no other hell but to bee in <hi>debt,</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
and affliction, and so plots by all
meanes to build his heauen on earth
by wallowing in all excesse of riot
and vanitie, as hereby he reapes <hi>such
wages of his error as is meet,</hi> euen to
be giuen vp to a <hi>reprobate sense,</hi> and
so not onely to all monstrous and
desperate wickednesse, but euen to
maintaine and secure the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all future reckonings, as if he
had <hi>made a couenent with hell, and
were at an agreement with death▪</hi> so
is he iustly taken in his owne <hi>crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
and most wonderfully arrested
by the power of <hi>hell,</hi> to the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
confusion of his imagined hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
and while hee dreames of
no other heauen but <hi>to doe what hee
list in earth,</hi> hee is not onely therein
<hi>restrained</hi> by the power of heauen
to the confusiō of his present hopes
for the good of the Saints, but also
iustly caught in the snares of his
owne wickednesse by the <hi>power of
hell,</hi> as to beginne and seale hereby
vnto him <hi>eternall vengeance,</hi> and to
hasten him thereto; so that the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
may more wonderfully <hi>escape
of our trouble,</hi> when the <hi>wicked are
falne into the pit they digged for them.</hi>
Surely as it is a righteous thing with
<hi>God,</hi> that <hi>they that doe not receiue the
loue of the truth, shall be giuen vp to
strong delusions to beleeue lies:</hi> so if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<hi>satan were transformed into an
Angell of light,</hi> and so more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by his <hi>lies</hi> and subtilties did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
vnstable soules: If euer the
<hi>sure word</hi> and <hi>wonderfull workes of
God</hi> were outfaced and suppressed
by the sleights and forgeries of the
<hi>God of this world,</hi> the experience here
of is most notorious in our times: to
instance in this <hi>particular</hi> being the
subiect of our experience how
mightily the <hi>Lord</hi> hath iustified his
<hi>word,</hi> both auouching in these dayes
the <hi>truth of this doctrine of Witchcraft</hi>
as also euidencing the <hi>power</hi> thereof
in <hi>dissoluing the workes of Satan,</hi> as
experience hath made it manifest,
so we haue had not onely the <hi>great
Patrones</hi> and <hi>friends</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
confirming the same, but euen the
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Churches verie enemies</hi> haue beene
enforced to acknowledge no lesse.
And yet such hath been the <hi>efficacy
of delusion,</hi> that this very same <hi>most
glorious truth</hi> vpon other respects as
it hath found hard measure among
fained <hi>friends,</hi> so it hath also there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
beene <hi>traduced</hi> and <hi>peruerted</hi> by
it <hi>enemies.</hi> And surely we may the
lesse wonder hereat, if we consider
wisely, that as <hi>commodities</hi> are in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi>
with many according to their
<hi>diuers humours,</hi> and <hi>different</hi> seasons,
so doth it befall the <hi>sacred truth.</hi>
which though it be sometimes in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,</hi>
when it may serue to <hi>aduance
the pride of the flesh and infancie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
yet doth it easily <hi>grow out of
date,</hi> when either it tends to <hi>humble
the flesh,</hi> or iustly <hi>challengeth luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmnesse
and hypocrisie.</hi> Which as it
was the portion of the <hi>Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Church,</hi> sometimes to bee
<hi>cryed vp with Hosanna,</hi> eftsoones
to bee <hi>cryed downe with crucifige</hi> so
hath it beene the lot of the <hi>scepter of
this kingdome, the budding rod of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
sometimes to be <hi>turned into a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi>
in the opinion of man, as if it
onely entended to destruction and
not to edification, no better then a
<hi>doctrine of licentiousnesse</hi> or <hi>sedition</hi>
and <hi>despaire,</hi> which eftoones was
in esteeme as <hi>Angels foode,</hi> sweeter
then <hi>honey,</hi> pretious aboue <hi>rubies,</hi>
most orient <hi>gems.</hi> Which seeing it
hath beene also the <hi>portion</hi> of this
<hi>truth</hi> concerning <hi>witchcraft,</hi> is it
any maruell if what man opposeth
and seeketh to suppresse, the <hi>Lord
himselfe</hi> hath powerfully maintaind
and iustified, as prouing vnto it
<hi>gainesayers a sauour of death,</hi> that
haue refused to embrace the same
as a sauour of life vnto life. Surely
when I discerne the efficacy of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion
preuailing in these dayes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vpon such that haue <hi>tested</hi> of
the <hi>good word of God,</hi> and beene <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takens</hi>
of the <hi>enlightning spirit:</hi> and so
haue had some <hi>kenning of the power
of the life to come,</hi> and yet are so
<hi>falue away</hi> from <hi>conscience,</hi> yea from
<hi>science</hi> it selfe, that they are very
<pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>strangers from the life of God through</hi>
their <hi>affected ignorance,</hi> and being
<hi>willingly ignorant</hi> of what they haue
formerly beene conuinced of, are
growne to bee <hi>starke-mockers</hi> of all
powers; yet all forme of Religion,
and so in this their Atheisme,
sing a Requiem to their soules, <hi>fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
no other <hi>hell,</hi> then to be <hi>mooued
in their slippery state,</hi> and <hi>dreaming</hi> of
no <hi>other heauen</hi> then to <hi>build their
foundation in the sands:</hi> Mee thinkes
I see the <hi>foolish worldling</hi> on the
pinnacle of his confidence, and so in
his <hi>greatest security,</hi> lying open to
confusion. And do I not see the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God</hi> working wonderfully
herein, in besotting the foole in his
owne wisedome. Euen giuing him
vp to rest vpon such broken reedes,
for the securing of his Babel, which
are the onely meanes to confound
the same. And hath not the <hi>God of
the world</hi> by diuine permission a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
stroke in this <hi>delusion,</hi> not only
to proue a <hi>lying spirit</hi> in the mouth
of <hi>our false Prophets,</hi> bidding to go
