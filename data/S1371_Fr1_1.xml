   <p>Some few yeares since, I rode to my Lords Mannour of <hi>Haleing</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> where I presented his Lordship with a Manuscript, or written Booke of the names and degrees of all the Knights of the Noble Order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, since the first institution by King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, which was of mine owne collections out of <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle, and some authentique Histories: His Lordship re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it gratefully, and rewarded me honourably: in the which Booke was an Anagram of his Name and Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> which I hold very fitting to bee hereunder Printed, because it fals correspondent to the reuerence of his age, and the happinesse which the words import.</p>
