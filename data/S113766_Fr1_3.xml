   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He troubles of the Church must affect thee. A child pitieth the miserie of his mother, &amp; mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for that which he cannot amend. Hee that in such a case is carelesse, is growne vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and deuoid of grace. In times heretofore we reade, that the Church of God was in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie high degree vexed: first, with bloodie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution: then by Antichristian superstition and idolatry. This caused by Antichrist, who with Egyptian darkenesse obscured the veritie of God, and obtruded a false word and worship vpon the Church. The other by the stumbling Iewes, and foolish Grecians, in the first plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Gospell; but both of the diuell. The first was to keep out the truth at y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> beginning, by afflicting bodily death: the latter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<pb facs="6"/> it, being brought in by mens deuices, to soules damnation. The extreme rage of both is abated. Enemies yet must be, to keepe men watchfull; trials also, to see our own soundnes: but Satan is chained from rising heereafter to the former measure of his malice; and Anti-Christs power shall neuer so preuaile as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore: thereof perswade thy selfe. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God is established; let men consult and intend what they please; in spight of man the purpose of God shall be permanent.</p>
   <p>There remaineth neuerthelesse an other mischiefe, nothing lesse dangerous; which is, Atheisticall securitie, carnall liuing vnder a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall profession in an euill peace. This the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle foresaw, (1. Tim. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) and said, it should be: the same Christ himselfe foretold by the example of the old world and Sodome in the daies of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> that scarce faith should be found on the earth. This euill cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vpon the world; pleasures with peace doe nourish it, (English people the instance) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in religion breed it. Vpon occasion whereof, Satan suggesteth, mans corrupt heart intertaineth, and so becommeth the worse: one offendeth, and another there at stumbleth; but wo is vnto both, and a mischiefe ensueth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by vnto many.</p>
   <p>Other nations are full of examples: and of this miserie may we also lament: much sin, and thereupon fearefull iudgement; but little sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and lesse amending without greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement. Dreadfull daies! Behold our secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in the middest of miserie; vnderstand and pray.</p>
   <pb facs="6"/>
   <p>Papists on the one hand increase, though their cause bee cursed. The practise of their bloody intendments might make them odious, and teach vs to walk more warily in vnitie: but we amongst our selues do work our owne woe, by vncomfortable contentions; neither side yeelding, the euill groweth by partiall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. Oh that our <hi>Abrahams</hi> would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what yeeld a little in the smallest things, and know themselues; &amp; <hi>Lots</hi> also hearken to hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some counsell, that both may bee vnited in peace: for the Cananites are in the land. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest the victory is striuen for, the generall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie doth win ground, and Satan hath sent a new companie on the right hand, lest this his contentious worke should cease to be. The one sort is iustly feared, and therefore as the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall enemie of many resisted: the other held contemptible, and therefore as base negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or for the fewnesse despised: but the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Foxes eat grapes. These must also be seene vnto, and said to; but without rigor and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Through our silence, they proclaime themselues Conquerours: they challenge all, and still bid battell to the whole host of Israel, as if they were inuincible, and had ouercome all: and yer Master <hi>Gyshops</hi> booke, Master <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shawes</hi> challenge, Doctor <hi>Allisons</hi> consutation, certaine Ministers reioynder to Master <hi>Smith,</hi> with other moe are not answered. They doe offer encounter vpon certaine questions, as if therein were their owne cause propounded; when Brownisme is a thing differing from both Papist, Protestant, and Puritan, so called: for, saith the Papist, Christs ruling power is in
<pb facs="7"/> the Pope; nay, saith the Protestant, it is in the Ecclesiasticall gouernours, Bishops: nay, saith the Puritan, it is in the Presbyterie: nay, saith the Brownist, it is in the body of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the multitude, called the Church. And in this beginneth Brownisme: the first stone of that schismaticall building, vpon which are laid those other errors mentioned in this booke. This (Reader) take notice of, to discerne where Brownisme beginneth. They propound the reformed Churches gouernment to allure thee, and our state so, as they may make thee forsake it: when neither this is the simple rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why they depart, nor the other their cause properly, wherein they stand. By these they doe onely make way for such as know not their way, which they haue by thēselues, to come to them: but the gouernement of the reformed Churches doe not they maintaine.</p>
   <p>For this cause (Reader) that thou maiest not be deceiued hereafter, either with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending of such trueths as be not their owne, or yet with their equiuocating renunciation of Brownisme, I, a little one amongst others, and in the presence of my Brethren; not with <hi>Sauls</hi> armour, but with a stone in a sling▪ euen with my meane mediocritie, haue nakedly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered vnto thee this way. If thou dost affect it, before thou runne, vncase it; take from the Iay, other birds fethers: set it before thee as it differeth from all other Churches, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it with both eyes, iudge by deliberate consultation, and take as thou by the word hast warrant.</p>
   <p>I haue sought out and found, and after my
<pb facs="7"/> iudgement leading will I goe, and not runne after affection: as I am perswaded, so would I haue other, if I be found in the trueth: if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, I promise not to contend for any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie. Confidence in our cause, (that here is a true Church of God, from which wee may not make separation) hath made me aduenturous: and the spirituall iniurie which some of late haue done to mee, more then to many, hath called me hereunto. They haue taken away part of the seale of my ministerie. Mine owne with them may haue Instructors, but no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for in Christ Iesus I haue begotten them through the Gospell. I wil claime them, though vnnaturally and vnkindly they disclaime me; in loue doe I follow, and so will, albeit they flee from me with hatred. Friendly Reader, when thou hast read this <hi>huc and crie,</hi> send it away by thy approbation thereto, and report the cause to other for discouerie thereof, as thou shalt thinke fit. If thou happily dost find any meeke ones of them in thy way, rebuke them louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, intreating the Younglings gently for the Lords sake, and send them backe againe. For in a schisme many may be, who are not therof: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny affect that where of they cannot iudge, &amp; so are mislead; yet without any intendmēt of euil. The humble that are of a tender conscience, are very reclaimable: but the <hi>strait hearted</hi> opinionate are not so recouerable; yet I hope of both: for it is the Lord that worketh the will and the deed, both when and as he will.</p>
   <p>Thus (louing Reader) thou seest what I only intend: how men will take it, I well know not; how they should, I know. If any thing be set
<pb facs="8"/> downe which may any way giue offence, as not seeming to be without some gall of bitternesse in the manner of handling, and nothing doth touch the matter of the argument; I professe, as I looke for a blessing, I haue not intended to abuse any mans person, but to open the cause. I leaue men to iudge, the wise as they find, the peruerse as they please. This I onely craue, that no man take ill any thing without iust cause, and that euery one expound well a mans meaning, as charitie shall leade him, and right reason perswade him. And so I commend thee to God. Iune 18.</p>
