   <head>A short recapittulaciō vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the Reader.</head>
   <p>Here haste thou harde (moste Iēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Reader) how beninge / how lovinge / how myndfull owre moste mercifull father is / and ever hat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the ben / ouer his electe and chosyn chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren / namely euē now. And for an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample haue we this poore and simple creture sett before owre iees / to calle vs to remembrance that he is ny vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all them that / in tyme of tribulaciō or persecucion will calle / a pon hym in treweth and verite. Se we not here how mercifully. He stirechith owte his hande / he spredith a broude his wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to hyde and cover this his tender birde frome the gleyde or bosarde. And in conclusion he mollifieth and movith the harte of this verteouse prince and by hym as by an enstrumēt of his one / doeth he not only defende this poore mans cause / or rather the trewthyt sel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe: but also delyueryth him frome the cruell hādes of all his emnies / no other<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wise / thē evin as it were frome death to lyfe soche is his godly nature / soche is his properte an a customed maner / 
<pb facs="39"/> that in the mydist of aduersytes tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacion &amp; persecucion / where men thinck him moste furthist of / ther is he moste nyest and present / with soche cōsolacion and comforth as canne not be expressid wyth / tonge. What more Ioye cāne ther come to them whiche be afflicted persecuted and vnder the swete crosse of Iesu Christ / then to calle to ther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance the confortable storyes of the scripture acording to the sayeng of sent Paul. What so euer thyng is wrytten / it is wrytton for owre doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne and lernyng / that throwgh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience and the consolaciō of godes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de / we may haue sewre hope &amp; truste.</p>
   <p>Hou lycke a loving lorde / saued he / Isaac / frome the mortall and deadly strock of the swerde / with howe petiful aneye lokyd he on Noe the precher of ryghteousnesse / restoryng hym frome the rough ragyng wawes of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull see / he deliuerid Loth at an enstant frome the conuersacion and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of they vngodly Sodomytes &amp; Gomorrians / keppt he not Ionas sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue and sownde / after he was devoured and swaloed vp of that houge and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struus fishe: Sydrach / Misach / and Ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>denago / preserued he frome the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
<pb facs="39"/> fornace of burnyng fyrd Daniel be deliueryd frō the devouryng mow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thes / of the hongry liōs. Moises amōge the reedes and flages hydde &amp; hangyd by the water syde in a baskyd / whas re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stored agayne to his naturall mother to be norsed of her. Paul was left dow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne in a baskyt / and so escaped the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of his persecuters / Susanna / whas preserued and defended pure and vnde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>filed / frome the lecherus lustes of the false prestes and Iudges / Iudith / with moche Ioye and victorye whas dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueryd frome the feyrce violence / and myghty power of all they emnies of god. These / and many mo godly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samples be lefftt in the holy scripture to the great comforth and consolation of them that suffer persecuciō for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes sake / acording to the saieng of Christ hym selfe. Blessed are all they which suffer persecucion for ryghteous<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes sake: for theyr is the kyngdome of heauen. Agayne / as many as will lyue godly in Christe Iesu muste suffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution / it is the blessyng of god &amp; the swete rodde of correctiō / where wyth all the feathe of the feathfull must ther wyth betryed. For evyn as owre lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de and god / doeth all wayes and at all tymes
<pb facs="40"/> preserue / kepe / and defende his poore persecuted &amp; afflicte in al extremites: so doeth he caste downe / and neuer rayse vp agayne / all soche that so obstinatly and wilfully resistyth his eternall testa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment and worde / oppressyng his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers / and persecutyng Christ / the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sone of god in his members. Seyeng now that soche trowble and persecuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on chansith all wayes apon the simple and pore afflicte / specially now / in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se dangerus &amp; perelus seyson: let not therfore the wordes of Paul be owte of they remēbrāce of thē that be at liber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te / where he sayeth Remēbre them that are in bandes / evyn as though ye were in bandes wich thē: and be myndfull off them whiche are in aduersite: Lett this shorte an bresse lesson / be suffycient at this tyme to put the / (moste Christen reader) in remēbrance of some paerte of thy dewty: and to render thanckes vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the lorde for the great strength and power he gaue vnto this Christē pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to confesse his lord &amp; god / before all men hym shalle the lorde cōfesse agay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne before the father of heven / the lorde sende vs many soche prynces that wil wyth so redy a mynd defende the lyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worde of god / deliuer the innocent / 
<pb facs="40"/> cōfute the false accuser / and to conclude to be prest &amp; redy to gyue his lyffe for his pore brother. To the great discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth of that hongry horse leche / and bloude thyrsti Romanyst the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (of wome) ys never satisfied tyl yt hathe bloud. God defende all thē that beleue in hys worde frome ther cruelite / and ylluminate they hertes of all prynces that they maye onest spye and perceyue what kynde of people they be that cause thys great dissenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on discorde and warres / now in this trowbelous tyme / and thou I put no dowte but that kyngdome of antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste / whyche now hangyth by a twyne threde / shall shortly take a falle / &amp; the kyngdome of Christe magnyfied amō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge all nacyons to the great honor and lawde of god: to the consolacion and confort of the wolle Christen congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiō of Iesu Christe / to whome be prai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se both now &amp; euer.
