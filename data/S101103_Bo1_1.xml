      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>IKE AS in time paste, oure aduersaries haue alwayes frō the beginning pickte quarrels against our cause, with intente to procure a greater mislike thereof in all mennes mindes, and to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte haue framed many fayned slaunders, in layinge to our charge, that wee are not onely fallen awaye from the fayth, but also become rebells against the Maiestie of the Kinge of <hi>Spaine</hi> oure soueraigne and naturall Prince, to thende that vnder the shadowe of such fine coulours, they mighte both blemishe the eyes of the simple sorte which are altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norante of the cause, and also seeme closely to couer their owne disordinate greedines of gaine, euen to the face of the wysest, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they bee the better acquainted wyth those affayres: Euen so wee ascertaine oure selues, that they will not sticke (by all meanes they maye) hereafter likewyse to practise the drowninge and vtter suppressinge of all such true dealing, as doth nowe but begin by litle and litle to come to lighte. They publishe and proclaime, (althoughe moste vntrulye) that wee are the persōs that will giue no eare to any agreemente, be it neuer so reasonable:
<pb n="2" facs="20"/>and that we endeuour our selues to seeke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but how we may maintayn this ciuil dissention and dangerous warres within oure owne boosome, although it procure the vtter destruction of this our poore Country: and all for oure pleasure (they say,) because wee are minded to bend our wills &amp; appetits to crosse his Maiestie. Thus do they still cauil. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to thend that none may hereafter by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to light credit to their false reports, so much abuse themselues, as to condēne those that are innocentes, and to iustifie such as bee most cruell enemies to iustice: VVee thought it most necessary (after many supplications at diuers &amp; sōdry times exhibited vnto his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie) yet once againe to publish this our last request made vnto him, &amp; therwithall to lay before your eyes, all such meanes as haue bin made on our parte for the appeasinge of this warre, as ye may most plainly perceiue by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such letters, as haue bin written on ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part to that effect, without adding or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing any thing therin, to thēd that euery man may iudge without any suspicion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truth of the matter. Meaning thereby most manifestly to show forth, both in whō lyeth the originall cause &amp; beginning of
<pb n="3" facs="20"/>this warre, &amp; also who is most to be blamed, for that we attaine not vnto a perfecte peace and vnity. Moreouer, that we haue alwayes acknowledged the kinge of Spaine to be oure Soueraigne Prince and liege Lord, as one gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto vs of God to rule and gouerne vs with all iustice and equity, according to such contractes as we weare both bound vnto, and according to such aunciente Rights, Vsages, Liberties, and Priuiledges, as hee hath bin most solemply sworne vnto: and that we haue alwayes had our recourse vnto him most hū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and with al due reuerence. For albeit that some pretending a fayned desire of quietnes and vnity in our Country, haue priuately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded vs, that in oure treaty of peace, wee must looke especially to the obseruing of two points, that is to witte, that respect of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Maiesty of the King be kept moste inuiolable, and that in anye wyse no mention be made of the alteringe of Religion: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we haue had most euident proofes to perswade vs, that this is not the way to mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the mortall hatred of oure enemies, but rather to encrease and sharpen it: Yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse wee haue in all pointes behaued oure selues so reasonably, and wyth so great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
<pb n="4" facs="21"/>as euen our enemies them selues cannot accuse vs (and say truly) but that we haue in all pointes obserued a dutifull order, as moste plainly shall appeare by the discourse followīg. Considering that wee haue franckly remitted the whole iustice of our cause, vnto the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt of his Maiestie, &amp; the generall estates of our Countrie. Hoping that they, both beinge better acquainted with our estate, &amp; also bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter affectioned, both to the King and countrye then Straungers can bee: mighte the rather haue both the meanes &amp; the will, to giue such counsell vnto the king, as may be most expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the seruice of his Maiestie, for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishīg of a perfect peace &amp; vnitie amōgst vs, and last of all, for setting our coūtry in her auncient prosperitie. Hereuppon our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries (contrary to our expectacion) haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued themselues with suche parcialitie, as they woulde not once so much as haue any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde or respecte vnto our request made vnto his Maiestie, but vsurpīg the soueraigne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniō of our Country, they haue cleane depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his Maiestie from all libertie of Iudgmēt, and according to their owne appetite &amp; will, cleane barred oure cause frō all knowledge of Iustice, of set purpose to hinder all concorde.
<pb n="5" facs="21"/>And that haue they done principally (as they themselues confesse) for because we haue vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the generall assembly of the Estates, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch beyonde all memorie of man, hath alwayes ben vsed heretofore amongst our auncitours and Predecessours. Besides this, to make their malice more manifeste, they haue euer since committed greater cruelties in burning and scorchīg such as were of our Religiō, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they did before. Moreouer, they haue sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght to brīg in all the rest of the Estates of our coūtry with threatnings &amp; force, of purpose to make thē serue their turne towards thexe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutiō of their tyrānical appetites. VVherby it appeareth most plainly, that they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with hauing once raised this great blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy warre to the preiudice of his Maiestie, &amp; vtter destructiō of his Country: but do shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour themselues to procede with their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rānous deuises, to thend they may subdue the Countrie at their owne pleasure, and bring it into perpetuall seruitude &amp; bondage. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer wheras they make shew at some times, of a desire to entre into some treaty with vs of agreement: they do not pretend that to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but onely to deceaue vs, and by such a fayned dissimulatiō, to hold the other Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="6" facs="22"/>and Villages in some good hope, that they may not ioyne themselues with vs to resiste their tirāny, hoping that by this meanes they may come to their purpose, Like as they haue already procured in Fraūce by their vndirect and priuie practises. But such is our trust in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bountifull mercy of our good God, by whō we haue bin so myraculously defended hitherto frō their wicked enterprises, as wee not onely hope to escape frō the daunger of their diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish deuises, but also that all people &amp; nations of Christendome, all Kings &amp; Potētates, and especially the Maiesty imperiall with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectours &amp; Princes of the Empire, seing here by most clerely our faithfull and sincere hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, &amp; our most sure and certaine equity, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with our feruēt desire to attaine to peac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> and vnity, &amp; cōparing the same with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful pride &amp; cruell tirāny of our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: will yeld vnto vs their indifferēt fauour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and maintaine the iustice of oure cause by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōuenient meanes they may. And if peradui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it fall out hereaster, that we be forced by the vniust &amp; vnreasonable procedings of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> aduersaries, euē against our willes to seeke &amp; serch for som other relief more to our assurāce &amp; safety, thā we haue don heretofore: we hope
<pb n="7" facs="22"/>that euen then they will not impute the fault thereof vnto vs, but vnto oure enemies, who haue forced vs therunto. VVherof we require all and euery person by maner of protestacion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o be aduertised herein, that we only haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vnto the Iustice, equity, &amp; wisedom of the most high, and renowmed Maiesty of the Emperour, &amp; to all the most noble and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Electours and Princes of the Empyre of Almaigne, together with all the potentates of Christēdome, that they may take some care of our cause, &amp; not giue credit or hearing vnto the slanderous reports of our aduersaries, but cōsider somwhat neerer the indifferēcy of our cause &amp; mainteigne the same, so farre forth, as duty to God &amp; the world doth require. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so wee do aduise all the Estates of these Lowe Coūtries, to cōsider herein as it were in a glass what estimaciō our enemies make of them, &amp; withall to imagine how they determine to hā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle them, if their deuises take such effecte as they do desire. VVherefore let them beware that for wāt of courage or other occasiō they suffer not thēselues to be abused by their fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and double dealinges, Altho they make shewe of a feruente affection for the perfecte peace &amp; quietnes of oure Conutry. But rather hauinge regarde vnto their tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="8" facs="23"/>call euill meaninges, which they beare in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall vnto the Estates of our Country. Let them resolue thēselues, couragiously to resiste such insolencies, and call to minde both their othe and dutie that they owe to their Coūtry and by all industrie seeke the maintenance of the good and lawfull rights, contracts aend li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of their foresaide country. In the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherof, they shall not only do a good deede in their life time, but also leaue vnto their posterity a good report to their immortal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Now then to thende you may the better vnderstād theffect of the letters folowing, and the ground of all the matter: You must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised, that at suche time as <hi>Mounsieur Philip</hi> of <hi>Marnix,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mounsieur</hi> of <hi>Mont Saīt Aldegōdy,</hi> being prisoners at <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> had (by the licence and commaundement of <hi>Mounsieur</hi> of <hi>Noircarmes</hi>) written diuers &amp; sondry times vnto the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> as touchinge the meanes to enter into some communication for finishing of these present warres: the matter was brought to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as that after the death of the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Seig.</hi> of <hi>Noircarmes,</hi> the persons were nominated, which were to be imployed in this matter. But in the meane time happened the
<pb n="9" facs="23"/>ouerthrow of <hi>Mounsieur</hi> the <hi>Coūte Ludovvyk,</hi> and for that cause it seemed not good vnto the great Cōmaundador, to proceede any further herein: alledging that thereby, the aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of the King shoulde be somewhat dymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. Neuertheles the said Cōmaundador wished and aduised all the townes of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland</hi> to addresse them selues vnto the King by maner of supplicatiō, to this end, that the effect of the agreement which mighte en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue thereof, mighte be attributed rather vnto the bountye, and liberalitye of the Kinge, than to any righte or equitye that we mighte looke for of dutye. This Kinde of dealing was cause sufficient, why this treaty ceassed, vntill suche tyme as <hi>Mounsieur de Champaign,</hi> sent a letter vnto <hi>Mounsieur Charles de Boisot</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Mydleburch,</hi> the tenure whereof follweth her-afterword forword, with an anuswere the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof made by his Brother <hi>Moūsieur Lois de Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sot,</hi> being marked with. A. and. B. But vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that he was absent by reason that he was sent of a message into <hi>England</hi> from his excellency, he thought best, him self to make a voyage vnto <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> whether it were to assist his brother in lawe <hi>Mounsieur</hi> the Coente <hi>de la Roche</hi> towardes the obteyning of a pardō then
<pb n="10" facs="24"/>published as him self sayd, or for some other pryuate affayres of his owne, I know not. But this I am sure of, that when he cāme thither, he talked at landge of the matters aforesayd with <hi>Moūsieur de Sainct Aldegond</hi> who remayned then prisoner, as with one whome he fownd yet still so affected to the furthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce of our peace, as that he requested moste earnestly, that notwythstanding the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before rehersed, yet the pursute of a thinge so necessary for our publique weal might not be left of vpō suche a soden. Herein, he made promise on the behalf of the Prince of <hi>Orēge</hi> and of the Estates of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> that they would rather be cōtēt to leese sōme parte of their owne right, than seek to vsurpe any thing vpon the Kings Maiestie, for the which cause it was thought good to ymploy the forenamed prisoner, who presently was sent to <hi>Roterdā</hi> towards his excellency, to treat vpō exchaunge of prisoners, to thend that ther with all he might woorke somme good effect in the matters before rehersed. Prouided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes that he tooke great regard to the auct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hority of the King, and that no poynts of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion weare in any wise mencioned It hapned also that <hi>Signeor Ian de Mattenes, Moū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="11" facs="24"/>de la Rinicre</hi> and the <hi>Aduocat Treslōg</hi> cāme a litle befor this, by lycēce also vnto <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terdā</hi> for certē particuler affaires, as thei said &amp; had by &amp; by cōmitted vnto them a special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chdarge to deale with his excellēcy, &amp; with the foresaid Estates, touching sōme good meane of pacification. The aunswere that theis estates gaue vnto thē followeth hereafter, woord by woord, and is marked with the. C. But as it appeareth, this aunsuere pleased not <hi>Moū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire de Chāpagni.</hi> Wherefore during the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode of <hi>Moūsier de S. Aldegonde</hi> as yet in <hi>Rotterdā</hi> he wrote a letter vnto him to the sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me effect, declaring therein his minde more at large This letter likewise followeth in order, and is marked with D. hereupō yt followed that <hi>Moūsier de. S. Aldegōd</hi> treated yet sō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what furtherwith the foresayd Estates in such ernest sorte, as that they weare cōtent to make their cōplaīt vnto the Kings Ma. in forme of supplicatiō with owt attributīg the name of the Estats there vnto, which of duti belōged vn to thē, and also with owt making any meciō of any point of religiō, but only requesting most hūbly that it wold please his Ma. to set order in al things by his owne anothoriti and by the general aduice of the estates, but first that it would please
<pb n="12" facs="25"/>him to cause all the straūgers which troubled the conutrye to auoyde from thence: submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thēselues in all things besids to any suche order as his Maitstie, and the Estates generall shoulde thinck moste meete for them (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by ther request) which is marked with the letter. E. the which request the forenamed <hi>Mounsieur de S. Aldegond</hi> caried him self vnto <hi>Mounsieur de Champagini</hi> to <hi>Moūt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort,</hi> yelding him self agayne in to his prison at <hi>Vtrecht.</hi> But with in a while after, <hi>Moū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Chāpagni</hi> hauing bene at the court in <hi>Bruxels,</hi> sent backe the foresayd request vnto <hi>Mounsieur Iunius</hi> Gouernour of the <hi>Vere,</hi> who together with <hi>Moūsieur de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> had remayned in hostage at <hi>Mountsort</hi> for <hi>Mounsiur de S. Aldegond</hi> during his absence, and by that meanes also were admyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Moūsieur de Champagni</hi> to treat of this matter, as may well appeare by a letter he sent to <hi>Mounsire Iuni{us}</hi> which followeth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewise marked with. F. wherupon the sayd <hi>Iunius</hi> made him an aunswere by writing agayne, as appeareth with the markes of G. and H. We leaue the rest vnto the good reader to cōsider of, desyring God te geue vs the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce that all may redoūd vnto his glorye, and the
<pb n="13" facs="25"/>edifying of his Churche.</p>
