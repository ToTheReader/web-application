   <p>THou true vnderstander, my inuention doth wander with the quill of a Gander, to shield me from slander, to thy good protection, I yeeld in subiection, my poore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, with friendly correction, and as thou dost like me, or stroake me or strike me, Reproue me or proue mee, or mooue me, or loue me, or quite me, or spight me, friend me, or mend mee, or else not offend me: If in ought that is written thy humors are bitten, seem not to espy it, and none will descry it. But if thou dost kick, the spurre sure will prick, and if thou doe fling, the waspe then will sting. My verses are made, to ride euery Iade, but they are forbidden, of Iades to be ridden, they shall not be snaffeled, nor bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nor bafflled, weart thou <hi>George</hi> with thy Naggon, that fought'st with the dragon, or were you great <hi>Pōpey,</hi> my verse should be thumpe ye, if you like a Iauel against me dare ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. I doe not entend, it as now to commend it, or yet to defend it. But to thee I doe send it, to like it, or mend it, and when thou hast end it, applaud it or rend it. My wits I could bristle, for a better Epistle, but yet at this time, this <hi>Skeltonicall</hi> Rime, I send to thy veiw, because it is new, So Reader adue.</p>
