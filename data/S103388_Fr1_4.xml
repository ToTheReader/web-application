   <head>The Author, to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ven as from our swathing bands wee carrie with vs (as it were) an vnbridled desire of knowledge: So afterwardes, hauing attained to the perfection ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there groweth in vs a certaine laudable and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent affection to teach others: The which, if it were not so, the world happily should not be seene so replenished with Artes and Sciences.</p>
   <p>For if men generally were not apt to contemplation and sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out of things: Or if God had not bestowed vpon euery man the grace, to be able to lift vp his minde from the earth, and by searching to finde out the causes thereof, and to imparte them to those who are lesse willing to take any paines therein: it would come to passe, that the one parte of men, as Lordes and Masters, should beare rule, and the other parte as vyle slaues, wrapped in perpetuall darknesse, should suffer and lead a life vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie the condition of man. Wherefore, in mine opinion it standes with great reason that a man participate that vnto others which he hath searched and found out by his great studie &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. And therefore, I being euen from my childhood greatly delighted in the handling of weapons: after I had spent much time in the exercise thereof, was desyrous to see and beholde the most excellent and expert masters of this Arte, whome I haue ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally marked, to teach after diuers wayes, much differing one from another, as though this misterie were destitute of order &amp; rule, or depended onely vpon imagination, or on the deuise of him who professeth the same: Or as though it were a matter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to find out in this honourable exercise (as well as in all other Artes and Sciences) one onely good and true way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man may attaine to the intire knowledge of as much as may be practised with the weapon, not depending altogether vpon his owne head, or learning one blowe to day of one master, on the morowe of another, thereby busying himselfe about per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, the knowledge whereof is infinite, therefore impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Whereupon being forced, through a certaine honest desire which I beare to helpe others, I gaue my selfe wholy to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
<pb facs="4"/>
thereof: hoping that at the length, I shoulde finde out the true principles and groundes of this Arte, and reduce the confused and infinite number of blowes into a compendious summe and certaine order: The which principles being but fewe, and therefore easie to be knowen and borne away, without doubt in small time, and little trauaile, will open a most large en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to the vnderstanding of all that which is contained in this Arte. Neither was I in this frustrate at all of my expectation: For in conclusion after much deliberation, I haue found out this Arte, from the which onely dependeth the knowledge of all that which a man may performe with a weapon in his hand, and not onely with those weapons which are found out in these our dayes, but also with those that shall be inuented in time to come: Considering this Arte is grounded vpon Offence and Defence, both the which are practised in the straight and circuler lynes, for that a man may not otherwise either strike or defend.</p>
   <p>And because I purpose to teach how to handle the Weapon, as orderly and plainly as is possible: I haue first of all layd down the principles or groundes of all the Arte, calling them <hi>Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements,</hi> the which, being of their owne nature verie well kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to all those that are in their perfect wittes: I haue done no other then barely declared them, vvithout rendring any further reason, as being a thing superfluous.</p>
   <p>These principles being declared, I haue next handled those things, vvhich are, and be, of themselues, <hi>Simple,</hi> then (ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp to those that are <hi>Compound)</hi> I shewe that vvhich may be generally done in the handling of all Weapons. And because, in teaching of Artes and Sciences, <hi>Things</hi> are more to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of than <hi>VVordes,</hi> therefore I vvould not choose in the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling hereof a copious and sounding kinde of speach, but rather that vvhich is more briefe and familiar. Which maner of speach as in a small bundle, it containeth diuers weightie things, so it craueth a slowe and discreete Reader, who will soft and faire pearce into the verie Marrowe thereof.</p>
   <p>For this cause I beseech the gentle Reader to shewe himselfe such a one in the reading of this my present worke, assuring him selfe by so reading it, to reape great profite and honour thereby. 
<pb facs="5"/>
Not doubting but that he (who is sufficientlie furnished with this knowledge, and hath his bodie proporcionably exercised there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) shall far surmount anie other although he be indewed with equal force and swiftnes.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, because this art is a principal member of the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarte profession,</hi> vvhich alltogether (vvith learning) is the ornament of all the World, Therefore it ought not to be exercised in Braules and Fraies, as men commonlie practise in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie shire, but as honorable Knights, ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue themselues, &amp; exercise it for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of their Cuntry, the honour of vveomen, and conqueringe of Hostes and armies.</p>
