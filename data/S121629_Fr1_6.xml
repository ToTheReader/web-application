   <head>TO THE GENERALL READER</head>
   <p>IN publishing this Essay of my Poeme, there is this great disaduantage against me; that it commeth out at this time, when Verses are wholly deduc't to Chambers, and nothing esteem'd in this lunatique Age, but what is kept in Cabinets, and must only passe by Transcription; In such a season, when the Idle Humerous world must heare of nothing, that either sauors of Antiquity, or may awake it to secke after more, then dull and slothfull ignorance may easily reach vnto: These, I say, make much against me; and especially in a Poeme, from any example, either of Ancient, or Modern, that haue proued in this kind: whose vnusuall tract may perhaps seeme difficult, to the female Sex; yea, and I feare, to some that think themselues not meanly learned, being not rightly inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Muses: such I meane, as had rather read the fantasies of forraine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, then to see the Rarities &amp; Historie of their owne Country deliuered by a true natiue Muse. Then, whosoeuer thou be, possest with such stupidity &amp; dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that, rather then thou wilt take paines to search into ancient and noble things, choosest to remaine in the thicke fogges and mists of ignorance, as neere the common Lay-stall of a Citie; refusing to walke forth into the <hi>Tempe</hi> and Feelds of the Muses, where through most delightfull Groues the Angellique harmony of Birds shall steale thee to the top of an easie hill, where in artificiall caues, cut out of the most naturall Rock, thou shalt see the ancient people of this Ile deliuered thee in their liuely images: from whose height thou mai'st behold both the old and later times, as in thy prospect, lying farre vnder thee; then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaying thee downe by a soule-pleasing Descent through delicate embrodered Meadowes, often veined with gentle gliding Brooks; in which thou maist fully view the dainty Nymphes in their simple naked bewties, bathing them in Crystalline streames; which shall lead thee, to most pleasant Downes, where harmlesse Shepheards are, some exercising their pipes, some singing rounde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies, to their gazing flocks: If as, I say, thou hadst rather, (because it asks thy labour) remaine, where thou wert, then straine thy selfe to walke forth with the Muses; the fault proceeds from thy idlenesse, not from any want in my industrie. And to any that shall demand wherfore hauing promised this Poeme of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Iland so many yeeres, I now publish only this part of it; I plainly answere, that many times I had determined with my selfe, to haue left it off, and haue neglected my papers sometimes two yeeres together, finding the times since his Maiesties happy comming in, to fall so heauily vpon my distressed fortunes, after my zealous soule had labored so long in that, which with the general happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the kingdom, seem'd not then impossible somewhat also to haue aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me. But I instantly saw all my long nourisht hopes euen buried aliue before my face: so vncertaine (in this world) be the ends of our cleerest endeuors. And what euer is herein that tastes of a free spirit, I thankfully confesse it to proceed frō the continuall bounty of my truly Noble friend Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi>; which hath
<pb facs="5"/>
giuen me the best of those howres, whose leasure hath effected this which I now publish. Sundry other Songs I haue also, though yet not so perfect that I dare cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to publique censure; and the rest I determine to go forward with, God enabling me, may I find means to assist my endeuour. Now Reader, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnderstanding of my Poeme, thou hast three especiall helps; First the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to direct thee still, where thou art, and through what Shires the Muse makes her iourney, and what she chiefly handles in the Song thereto belonging. Next, the Map, liuely delinearing to thee, euery Mountaine, Forrest, Riuer, and Valley; expressing in their sundry postures; their loues, delights, and naturall si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations. Then hast thou the Illustration of this learned Gentleman, my friend, to explaine euery hard matter of history, that, lying farre from the way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reading, may (without question) seem difficult vnto thee. Thus wishing thee thy hearts desire, and committing my Poeme to thy charitable censure, I take my leaue.</p>
