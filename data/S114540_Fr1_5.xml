But now rising up in our Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall <hi>Horizon,</hi> it feares the Eclipse of Envie, and therefore desires your worthy and learned Patronage, that being free'd from such interposing shaddowes, it may shine forth as the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sunne. Your great, and good Fame, inviting and encouraging strangers to boldnesse, is my Apologie for this Dedication.

But modest ingenuitie permits not a larger Character of himselfe, and the Brevitie of few words is most intelligible to the judicious.

Pardon this double Ambition, and be pleased to accept this Sacrifice, from the hand of the most humble Sacrificer,</p>
