   <p>FOrasmuch as there hath beene lately signification made, of diuers of M. <hi>Perkins</hi> his workes hereafter to bee printed, in an Epistle to the Reader prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised before the Treatise of <hi>Callings,</hi> and that signification being but generall, might peraduenture giue occasion to some, to set out some particulars (without the consent of M. <hi>Perkins</hi> his assignes) as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly as are these two bookes, intituled <hi>The reformation of Couetousnesse,</hi> and <hi>The practise of Faith,</hi> iustly and truly (for ought that I see) censured in the aforesaide Epistle: It is therefore nowe thought good, to mention the particular Treatises, and workes of his, which shall hereafter (if God wil) be published, for the benefite of Gods Church: I doe therefore
<pb facs="12"/>
hereby make knowne to all, whome it any way may concerne, that there were found in the studie of the deceased, and are in the hands of his Executors, or assignes, and preparing for the Presse.</p>

   <p>All these he had perused himselfe, and made them ready for the Presse, according to which Coppies by himselfe so corrected, some of them already are, and the rest will be published in due time: And hereupon we desire all men who haue Coppies of them, not to offer that wrong to that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man of God, as to publish any of their own, seeing the coppies hereof which are to be printed, are of his own correcting: but rather if they can helpe to make any of

   <p>Besides many other particular <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and short discourses made vpon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall, and speciall occasions: of al which, some are already published by others, and some by my selfe: and all the rest that remaine, as they bee the Iewels of Gods Church, so did I willingly dedicate them to the publique and general good: Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it were a foule sinne in mee, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to <hi>impropriate</hi> to our selues, or our owne priuate vse, the labours of <hi>This,</hi> or any other learned man, which are in my opinion, parts of the <hi>Treasurie</hi> of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Church: And as it were wrong <hi>to the Church,</hi> if I should conceale them, so doubtlesse were it <hi>to him</hi> &amp; his children: If I should publish them for mine owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb facs="13"/>
and not for their benefit. If I doe, I thinke it may be iustly sayde vnto mee, or whosoeuer doth so, <hi>Thy monie perish with thee.</hi> And what herein I haue sayd for my selfe: I know I may boldly &amp; safely say, for his Executors or assignes, which haue or had in their hands, any of those which were found in his Studie: In the publishing of alwhich, as we do intend to deale truly with the Christian Reader, and not to commit any thing to the Presse, which hath not either beene <hi>written</hi> or <hi>corrected,</hi> by the <hi>Authour</hi> himselfe, or faithfully <hi>penned</hi> according to the truest Coppies taken from his owne mouth, and since by others of sufficiencie and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, dilligently perused: so we purpose to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them to the benefit of the <hi>Authours</hi> wife and children, as much as may bee, wishing that vpon this <hi>Caueat,</hi> men would not be so hastie (as some haue been) to commend to the world, their <hi>vnprefect notes,</hi> vpon a base desire of a little gaine, both to hinder the common good of the
<pb facs="14"/>
Church, and to defraude the said parties of their priuate benefit, to whom in all equitie and conscience, it doth principally appertaine: And desiring all who haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>perfect</hi> Coppies of such as are in my <hi>owne handes,</hi> that they would either helpe <hi>me</hi> with theirs, or rather take <hi>mine</hi> to helpe them. That by our ioynt powers and our forces layd together: the walles of this worthy building, may goe vp the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer &amp; the faster. And so I commend them all to Gods blessing, who endeuor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themselues, and their labours to God and to his Church.</p>
