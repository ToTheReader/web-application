                 <title>An avncient historie and exquisite chronicle of the Romanes warres, both ciuile and foren : Written in Greeke by the noble orator and historiographer, Appian of Alexandria, one of the learned counsell to the most mightie emperoures, Traiane and Adriane. In which is declared: their greedy desire to conquere others. Their mortall malice to destroy themselues. Their seeking of matters to make warre abroade. Their picking of quarels to fall out at home. All the degrees of sedition, and all the effects of ambition. A firme determination of fate, thorowe all the changes of fortune. And finally, an euident demonstration, that peoples rule must give place, and princes power preuayle. With a continuarion [sic], bicause that parte of Appian is not extant, from the death of Sextus Pompeius, second sonne to Pompey the Great, till the ouerthrow of Antonie and Cleopatra, after the vvhich time, Octauianus Cæsar, had the lordship of all, alone</title>
