      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the name of the iust might be had in remembrance, it is the laudable custome of our Church, at funerall meetings to recite the vertues of the deceased, as the <hi>widdowes shewed the coats and garments which Dorcas made whiles she was with them:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 9.89.</note> yet are there two things which will make mee very sparing at this time, in the performance of this duty: first, least our consanguinity, and nearenesse in blood and kinred should make any thinke I speake more out of partiality, then out of iudgement. Secondly, because how neere so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer I was vnto her in blood, yet in respect of conuersation, I was a stranger. Yet thus much may I truely say, that she is generally reported to haue beene towards her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
