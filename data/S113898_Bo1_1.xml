   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His brief treatise (courteous reader) being at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of à friend speedely compiled, may serue to conuince them of
<pb n="2" facs="7"/>
manifest calumnie, who no lesse vntruly then boldly, doe affirme the Doctrine of the Catholique Roman Church, to be ether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst holy scriptures, or at least to haue no ground or proofe frō them: And it maie also giue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction vnto such, as more v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the confident boldness of them that affirme the Roman Religion to be destitute of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, then vpon anie other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, are drawne, ether to think this to be true, or at least to doubt of the truth of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But before thou proceede to vieue the thinge it selfe, I desire thee to consider well these fewe pointes followinge.</p>
   <p>First that no proofe of anie one point of Christiā beliefe, can be so direct and full out of holy scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that may not be deluded by false interpretation. For the damned Arrianes, and most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="7"/>
heretiques, could interpret all places of holy scripture bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ught by the Catholiques against theire heresie in such sense, as beinge so vnderstood, they made nothinge against it: yea, that, as seely, as peruers heretique Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te (burned in smithfield not long since for Arrianisme) could not be conuinced of heresie by one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie scripture. Such proofes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Catholique Doctrine, as cannot be deluded by anie inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, are not to be expected out of holy scripture.</p>
   <p>Secondly that though Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stātes maie alledg textes of holy scripture for the proofe of some pointes of theire Doctrine, yet that alone is not sufficiēt to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke it true. Both because the same pointes are proued false by other places of scripture: and also for that all heretiques, haue euer brought scripture for their here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
<pb n="4" facs="8"/>
and none more apparant, or frequent then the blasphemous Arrianes: to say nothinge of the Deuill his citinge of scripture e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen against oure blessed sauiour. By all which it is more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, that the sense of holy scripture, besides the wordes, is necessarely required to make suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofe of true doctrine. For which reason I oftē bringe the vncorrupt testimonie of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me holy father for the sense of the place alledged by me, who haueinge liued at least on thow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sand yeares before these contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies began, cannot be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med partiall on our side.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, that I expect and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act of him, or them that shal goe about to answer this treatise, the same roūde sincere, and direct dealinge, which I haue here vsed. Remembringe before all things that he first set doune his faith
<pb n="5" facs="8"/>
in direct positions, and then proceed inlike methode as I haue done for the rest. To whom I willingly graunt this large liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie aboue that which I haue vsed that he tye not himself vnto the first 500. yeares for the fathers interpretations, but that he take boldly 1500. yeares so that he bringe not condemned hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques for his auctours, and with all obserue the point follow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inge.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, that it shall not be to anie purpose in waye of answer, that anie aduersarie bring ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpretation of some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the places of scripture alledged by me, besides that which I haue brought. For it is not denied, that one &amp; the same place of scripture maie be, and is often diuersly understoode, not onely of diuers fathers, but of one and the same father. But
<pb n="6" facs="9"/>
if he will saye anie thinge to the purpose in this kinde, he must bring an interpretation contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting that which I haue brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght: and withall labour rather to proue his owne Doctrine thē to impugne that of the Catoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques. For seeinge it is (as all men Knowe) à far more easie thīge to impugne anie doctrine, though neuer so true, then to proue the same: no truth (espetially of faith) being so euidentlie clere but that some thing with shew of probabillitie maie be obiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against it: it is not now expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that anie aduersarie should stand to answer those auctorities of scripture and fathers wich I haue alledged for proofe of the Catholique Doctrine, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the same: but rather to bring others in proofe of his owne: that the iudicions reader maie compare our groundes in
<pb n="7" facs="9"/>
scripture both together; and by the uieu of his owne eie, trie whether of them be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Gods sacred worde. And when anie one shall haue produced his proofes for Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantisme, in the like maner as I haue done in the behalfe of the Catholique religion; (if he can so doe) yet shall he gaine no more therby, but an euident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration against the cheef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est ground of the Protestātes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that ether, to the true and full decision of controuersies in matter of faith, is necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired<note place="margin">Note.</note> some other iudgment or triall, then the only wordes of holy Scripture, or ells that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is no meanes at all to end cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies of faithe; which later neuertheless to affirme, is no less iniuriouse to gods wisdome, goodness, or power, then to saye that he hath prouided noe
<pb n="8" facs="10"/>
sufficient meanes for men to know the way to saue their soules. For both parties bringing scripture for them selues whoe shall finallie determine whether of them, doth applie the said Scriptures more sincerlie and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to their true meaninge?</p>
   <p>Fifthly that wheras, before I can proue anie point of Christian beliefe by scripture I should first by good order, proue that there is a holy Scripture, and secondly in what bookes of the Bible it is contained: yet because nether of these two pointes can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by scripture, vnless wee first beleeue some scripture wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout proofe: therfore that, I may proue those pointes of faith wherin the Catholique Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne church doth differ from the Protestantes by holy scripture (which our aduersaries vrge me ūto) I must necessarilie to satisfie
<pb n="9" facs="10"/>
their disordered desire, proceede disorderlie, and suppose that for truth without proofe, which requireth most to be proued: I say without proofe, if no proofe be good, but that which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de out of scripture.</p>
   <p>And here occurr by the way two things worthie of note, Thone that the scripture cannot be an vniuersall rule of our faith, seeinge some thinges are to be beleeued with out proofe of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as are (for example) that there is a holy scripture contayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge gods word and reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that these and these bookes be suche: therfore must there of necessitie be some other rule of our faith more vniuersall then the scriptures, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently before the scriptures. And this cannot be but the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthoritie of godes church: which is clerly S. Augustins Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="10" facs="11"/>
who was not afearde to saye. <hi>I would not beleeue the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Contra epistolā funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti cap. 5.</note>
      <hi>but that the auctoritie of the church doth moue mee.</hi> Seeinge therfore the authoritie of the church is a sufficient motiue for vs to beleeue what is scripture, why should it not haue the like aucthoritie with vs in other pointes of faith? which is also S. Augustins argument in the same place: but I will notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing satisfie our aduersaries in their owne humoure.</p>
   <p>The Secund thing to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is, that they that beleeue nothing, but that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Scripture, are euidently conuinced to beleeue nothinge at all. For they that cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that there is à holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or what bookes be holy Scripture, cannot beleeue anie thinge, because it is proued by scripture. For it is euident,
<pb n="11" facs="11"/>
that before they beleeue anie thing because it is proued by scripture, they must beleeue that there is a Scripture, and what bookes are scripture: but they that beleeue not anie thing but that which is proued by Scripture, cannot beleeue that there is a scripture, nor what bookes are holy scripture: for nether of these two, can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Scripture. Thefore they that beleeue not anie thinge but that which is proued by scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, cannot beleene anié thing at all. This Argument is a plaine demonstration, and compelleth the Protestantes ether to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that they haue no faith at all: or to acknowledge this their positione, to witt [that nothinge ought or can rightly be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but that which may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Scripture] to be false: which notwithstandinge is the
<pb n="12" facs="12"/>
maine ground of all their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. But now haueing shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the absurditie of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in this point, I will ioyne with them in the Scriptures, as they themselues do desire, obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe this method. First I sett downe the Catholique Roman belief in direct and playne posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: then I bringe in proofe of it, one, two, or moe places of holy Scripture, citing the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient vulgar translation, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times I ad the testimonie of some auncient father of the frist 500. yeares vnderstandinge such Scriptures as I cite, in the same sense and meaninge that I cite them for: Furthermore those fewe places of Scripture, which seeme to sounde directly against the Catholique faith I shewe in brief how they are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. And last of all I put do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne the position contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="13" facs="12"/>
to the Catholique doctrine, to the end that the indifferent reader (be he Catholique or otherwaies) may more easely iudge whether Doctrine hath better ground in holy Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. And further that he that will impugne this treatise may see, what he hath to proue if he wil proue anie thinge to purpose.</p>
   <p>who is to vnderstand, that though the Protestantes doe maintayn the negatiue part, in almost all the positions cotro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted betwixte them and the Catholiques, yet is he not for all that, to be excused from the proofe of those pointes, vnless he will withall confess, that in them the Protestantes haue no faith at all, but onely a mere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of faith. For, faith beinge not a simple denying or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing, but a possitiue assent and belief of such articles as are
<pb n="14" facs="13"/>
reueled vnto vs by God; it hath possitiue groundes, wherby it may and ought to be proued, euen in those pointes which are negatiue. And therfore as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques doe proue theire faith, in these negatiue pointes: that onely faith doth not iustifie: that we are not certayn of our iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or saluation and the like: so likewise are the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantes to proue theyr faith in these: that there is no Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: no reall presence: no sacrifice of the Mass, and the rest. Vnless as is sayd before, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that they haue no faith in these pointes, but onely a mere deniall of faith.</p>
   <p>Haueinge thus aduertised thee good Reader of these fewe things I leaue thee to peruse the treatise it self, desiringe thee to expect onely the bare positiones proued with the self text, of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="15" facs="13"/>
Scripture, and some fewe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, without anie florishe of wordes at all: The worke being such as doth rather resemble the bare bones of a great bodye tied together with dried Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, then a bodie throughly furnished with flesh, and orher habiliments of friendly narure. For which cause, though to such as rather respect fashion then substance, it may happ to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare hideous, yet to others of contrarie appetite (for whose contentment it is speciallie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) it will not paraduenture be iudged altogether without forme.</p>
