      </gap>erse errors touching the generation, corruption and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things in their matter and forme. After, breathing a while, he enters a discourse of the Aire, shewing how it is deuided, what the temperature of each region is, with the causes of the same: and how
<pb n="2" facs="6"/>
the mists, the blasts, the clouds, the deaw, the yee and other waterie meteors are ingendred: and consequently intreateth of the falling starres, and comets, with the rest of the fiery impressions which are often seene in the two extreme regions of the aire. Hereunto he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyneth a philosophicall narration of the thunder and lightning, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in briefe their strange yet certaine effects; not omitting, for the more absolute complement of his discourse, to assigne probable reasons of the raine-bow, the circles about the Sunne and Moone, and the many Sunnes and Moones, which affright the ignorant with their appearance. But albeit he shewes himself a Philosopher in producing these naturall reasons, yet he would haue euery man to shew himselfe a Christian, in not wholy resting satisfied with these second causes; but euer so to acknowledge the wisedome of the Almighty, that he rather admire the creator, then adore the creature: adding thereunto the religious vse, which Christians should make of these impressions and prodigious signes. And that he may clip the wings of mans pride, which is wont to soare beyond it selfe in self-conceits, he demonstrates how it is impossible for the most cunning naturalist, to render sound reasons of all accidents. Then leauing the aire, he ouerthrowes their opinion which hold but three elements, and shewes the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that elementarie and our compounded fire; adioyning therunto a briefe treatise of the matter, the motion and number of the celestial spheares. And answering those which are of opinion, that there are no waters aboue the firmament, he assumes a fit occasion to mention the generall floud; with an elegant description whereof he ends this second dayes worke. All which excellent points he adornes with such pleasant illustrations, that
