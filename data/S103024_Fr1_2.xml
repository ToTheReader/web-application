      <hi>TO THE RIGHT</hi> WORSHIPFVLL, SIR RICHARD LEVVKNOR Knight, Chiefe Iustice both of <hi>Chester, and of his Maiesties</hi> Councell in the Principality, <hi>and Marches of Wales,</hi> Grace and Glory in Christ IESVS.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING finished (Right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,) the Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Logicall, and Theologicall Treatise; I thought good, both for the patronizing of the Booke, and the Testimony of
<pb facs="3"/> my duety, to offer the Dedication of the same vnto your Worshippe: for the former cause, that as the Author himselfe, dedicated this Booke at first to such persons, as were for authority able, and for Religion zealous to protect the same; so I the <hi>vnworthy</hi> Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>of so worthy an Author,</hi> made bold to make choyce of your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe, being for authority in your place, no lesse eminent, and for zeale to Religion no worse affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, To the end it may be shiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by your Patronage, from the mouthes of the malignant; not in regard of my labor herein, (which as it is but small, if eyther the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Booke, or the Authors owne Industry be considered; so it is not without imperfectiōs, which notwithstanding, I hope the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
<pb facs="3"/> with favourable Conniven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will passe over, considering the difficulty of Translation in this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct and Logicall kinde of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the penury of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Language in the Termes of Art;) but in respect of the matter it selfe, which being so worthy, for Gods cause deserveth, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the Churches sake, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth your favourable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. For the latter Cause, that as your Worshippe, is my best, and chiefest favourer, and that for the best and chiefest cause, the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of godlinesse; so meet it were I should declare, whome first, and best I should remember in this the first fruite of my labour, and best token of my loue: best I say, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the matter, which is here contained, though least to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="4"/> in respect of the maner, how it is by me delivered; which (though being offered in a homely stile, as a golden Treasure in an earthen vessell, or a rich Pearle in a poluted hand) I trust your worshippe will not reiect. And so I commend the same, such as it is, to your Worship, in your Christian favour to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, your selfe to the Lord in his continuall mercy to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and all that I am, and haue to your selfe, at your godly pleasure to bee commaunded,</p>
