   <head>THE AVTHOVRS
Preface to the
Reader,</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T falls out often, that the effects of mens
actions comes cleane contrary to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Authour. The same find I by
experiēce (beloued Reader) in my Poeme
of <hi>Lepanto:</hi> For although till now, it
haue not bene imprinted, yet being set out to the publike
view of many, by a great sort of stoln copies, purchast (in
truth) without my knowledge or consent, it hath for lack
of a Preface, bene in some things misconstrued by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
which I of very purpose thinking to haue omitted,
for that the writing thereof might haue tended, in my
opinion, to some reproch of the skilful learnednes of the
Reader, as if his braynes could not haue conceyued so
vncurious a work, without some maner of commentary,
&amp; so haue made the worke more displeasant vnto him:
it hath by the contrary falne out, that the lack thereof
hath made it the more displeasāt to some, through their
mistaking a part of the meaning thereof. And for that I
know the special thing misliked in it, is, that I should
seeme far contrary to my degree &amp; Religion, like a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenarie
Poet, to pen a worke, <hi>ex professo,</hi> in praise of a
forraine Papist hastard; I will, by setting downe the
<pb facs="3"/>
nature and order of the Poeme, resclue the ignorant of
their error, and make the other sort inexcusable of their
captiousnes. The nature then of this Poeme, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>a minore ad maius,</hi> largely intreated by a Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike
comparison, being to the writing hereof moued, by
the stirring vp of the league &amp; cruell persecution of the
Protestants in al coūtries, at the very first raging wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I compiled this Poeme, as the exhortation to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
in the hinmost eight lines thereof doth plainely
testify, being both begun and ended in the same Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
wherin the league was published in Fraunce. The
order of the Cantique is this: First, a Poetike preface,
declaring the matter I treat of, wherein, I▪ name not
<hi>Don-Iohn,</hi> neither literally nor any wayes by descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which I behoued to haue done, if I had penned the
whole Poeme in his praise, as <hi>Virgil, Arma virum{que}
cano: &amp; Homer, Dic mihi musa virum:</hi> of whose
imitation I had not bene ashamed, if so my purpose had
bene framed. Next followes my inuocation to the true
God onely, and not to all the Hee and Shee Saints, for
whose vaine honors, <hi>Don-Iohn</hi> fought in al his wars.
Next after my inuocation, followes the poetike History
of my comparison, wherein following forth the ground
of a true history, (as <hi>Virgil</hi> or <hi>Homer</hi> did) like a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shadowing with vmbers a portrait els drawne in
grosse, for giuing it greater viuenes, so I eike or paire to
the circumstances of the actions, as the rules of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etike
arte will permit: which historike comparison con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
till the song of the Angels: in the which I
compare and apply the former comparison to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
estate, taking occasion thereupon to speak somewhat
<pb facs="3"/>
of our religion. Lastly, the Epilogue of the whole, in the
last eight lines, declares fully my intention in the whole,
and explaines so fully my comparison and argument,
from the more to the lesse, as I cannot without shameful
repetition speak any more thereof. And in a word, what
soeuer praise I haue giuen to <hi>Don-Iohn</hi> in this Poem,
it is neither in accounting him as first or second cause of
that victorie, but onely as a particular man, when hee
falles in my way, to speake the truth of him. For as it
becomes not the honour of my estate, like an hireling,
to pen the praise of any man: So becomes it far lesse the
highnesse of my ranke and calling, to spare for the feare
or fauour of whomsoeuer liuing, to speake or write the
truth of any. And thus crauing pardon, beloued Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for this long some Apologie (being driuen thereto,
not by nature, but by necessitie) I bid you hartily fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
