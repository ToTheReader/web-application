   <head>TO THE RIGHT
HONOVRABLE ANNE, LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DY
WAINTVVORTH, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of all true honour and
happinesse, &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honourable, may it please
you to take in good worth my
bold attempt, in presuming to
recommend vnto your fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
patronage these Sermōs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
Your honours vndeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
respect of me, made me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to testifie my vnfained thankfulnesse: which
I could not imagine how with greater conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
to expresse and manifest, then by taking
hold of this present occasion; especially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that your constant and more then ordinarie
pains-taking to heare such holy instructions, is a
sufficient argument to euince your loue and liking
of the matter therein comprised: and your good
regard of the authors (well knowne vnto me)
gaue me occasion to thinke that their labours, in
this sort offering themselues vnto your eye, would
<pb facs="3"/>
be no lesse welcome than formerly they haue
beene, being in another manner presented vnto
your eare.</p>
   <p>Concerning the Tract of Zeale annexed to
these Sermons, it is a collection of diuers rules
which I heard &amp; read touching that subiect, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
of such as were scattered heere and there
in Maister R. <hi>Greenhams</hi> Workes: which being
exceeding vsefull, I thought good to gather them
into one (with an addition of sundrie proofes of
Scripture) for the ease and helpe of those that are
well affected, especially of such whose abilitie will
not reach to the price of that great volume of M.
<hi>Greenhams</hi> labours.</p>
   <p>And thus humbly beseeching your Honour to
pardon my boldnesse, and to beare with my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
defects which shall be found in the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of these Sermons, I recommend you to the
gratious protection of the Almightie.</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your Honours
according to my poore abilitie
readie to be commanded,
IOHN WINSTON.</signed>
