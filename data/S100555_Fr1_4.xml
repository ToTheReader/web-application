   <head>❧A BRIEFE MEMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
of sundry vnfortunate
Englishmen.

   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN the Printer had purposed</hi>
with himself to Print Lidgates
translation of Bochas, of the fal
of Princes, hauinge made priuy
thereto, many both honourable
and Worshippefull: hee was
coūsayled by dyuers of them to
procure a continuance of the Storye from where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Bochas left, vnto this presēt time, chiefly of such
as Fortune had abused here in this Island: which
might bee as a Myrrour for men of all estates and
degrees aswell Nobles as other, to behold the slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
deceiptes of the wauering Lady, &amp; the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of all kinde of vices. Which aduice liked him
so well, that he required mee to take paynes therein:
but because it was a matter passing my wit &amp; skill,
and more thancklesse than gaynefull to enterprise. I
refused vtterly alone to vndertake it without the
helpe of sutch, as in wit were apt, in learninge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and in iudgemente and estimation able to
wield and discharge the weight of sutch a burden,
thinkinge so to shift my handes. But hee earnest
and diligent in hys affayres, procure me an Athlas
<pb facs="6"/>
to laye the burden vppon my shoulders, which I
would not haue undertaken, but that shortly after
diuers learned men (whose many giftes nede few
prayses) consented to take vpon them part of the
trauaile. And when certayne of them to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
seuen, were through a generall assent at an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyncted
time and place, gathered together to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
thereuppon: I resorted vnto them, bringinge
with mee the booke of Bochas translated by Dan
Lidgate, for the better obseruation of his order:
which although wee did not mislyke, yet would it
not conueniently serue, seing that both Bochas, &amp;
Lidgate were dead, neither were there any alyue
that had medled w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> like argumēt, to whom the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
might make their moane. To make ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a state meete for the matter, they al agreed that
I shoulde vsurpe Bochas rome, and the wretched
Princes complaine vnto me: and toke vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
euery man for his part to be sundry persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and in their behalfes to bewaile vnto me their
sundry chaunces, heauy destenies, and wofull mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.
This done, wee opened sutch Bookes of
Chronicles as wee had there present, and Maister
Ferrers after hee had founde where Bochas left,
which was about the ende of Kinge Edward the
thirdes raigne, to begin the matter, sayd thus.</p>
   <p>I maruayle ({quod} hee) what Bochas meaneth to
forget among his myserable Princes, such as were
of our Nation, whose number is as great as theyr
<pb facs="6"/>
Aduentures wonderfull. For to let passe all, both
<hi>Britaynes, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> and to come to the last
Conquest, what a sort are they, and some also in the
time of Bochas himselfe, or not much before. As for
example William Rufus the second kinge of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande
after the Cōquest, eyther by malice or misad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
slayne hunting in the new forest, by Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Tirrell with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> shot of an arrow. Robert Duke
of <hi>Normandy</hi> eldest sonne to William Conquerour
depriued of his inheritaunce of England, by Henry
his youngest brother hauing both his eyes put out,
and after, myserably imprisoned in Cardiffe Castel,
whereas hee died. The most Lamentable case of
William, Rychard, and Mary, children of the sayde
Henry the first called Beauclerke, drowned vpon y<seg rend="sup">•</seg>
Sea by the negligence of drunken Mariners, and
Kynge Rychard the fyrst slaine with a quarel in his
chiefe prosperity. The most vnnaturall murther of
Artur Duke of <hi>Britayne</hi> right Heyre of Englande,
by king Ihon his vncle, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the death of Isabell his
Sister by Famyne. The myserable ende of the sayd
king Ihon their vncle by Surfet, or as some write
poysoned by a Monke of the Abbey of <hi>Swinsted</hi> in
Lyncolneshrye. Are not their Histories ruful, and of
rare Example? But as it should appeare, Bochas
being an <hi>Italian,</hi> minded most the <hi>Romayne,</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talike</hi>
Story, or els perhaps hee wanted the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of ours. It were therefore a goodly and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb facs="7"/>
matter, to search and discourse our whole sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
from the first beginninge of the inhabiting of the
<hi>Isle.</hi> But seeinge the Printers mynde is to haue vs
supply where Lidgate left, we wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> leaue that great
labour to other y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> may intende it, and (as one being
bold fyrst to breake the Ise) I will begin at y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> reigne
of Rychard y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> secōd, a time as troublesome to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as vnlucky to y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Prince. And for asmutch frende
Baldwin, as it shall be your charge to penne order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the whole processe: I will so far as my memory,
and iudgement serueth, somewhat further you in
the truth of the story. And therefore omittinge the
ruffle made by Iacke Straw &amp; his Lewd meiney,
with the murder of many notable mē which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
happened, (for Iacke as yee knowe was but a
poore Prince) I wil begin with a notable example,
which within a while after ensued. And although
the person (at whom I beginne) was no kinge nor
Prince: yet sithens he had a Princely office, I wil
take vpon mee the miserable person of Syr Robert
Tresilian chiefe Iustice of <hi>Englande,</hi> and of other
his fellowes learned in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Law y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> were plagued w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
him: thereby to warne all of theyr callinge &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
to be ware of wronge Iudgementes, miscō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struinge
of Lawes, or wrestinge the same to serue
the Prynces turne, which rightfully brought
them to a myserable ende, which they
may iustly lament in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ensuinge.
