Thys
<pb facs="3"/>myghty Lord I saye hath now of late begonne to poure oute hys plages vpon the Frenche Kynge, as it dayly dothe appeare more &amp; more, and all the cause thereof is synne &amp; vnrighteousenesse.</p>
   <p>For lyke as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Israelites were plaged for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> synne of Dauid ther Kynge, wythe Pestilence. Also be the Frenchmen nowe destroyedde and punysshed of God the Lorde for ther synne, in despising of god and his word, for the light is now come into the worlde, but men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue loued darkenes moore then y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lyght, because theyr dedes be euel neyther wyll they comme to the lyght lesse theyr deades should be reproued.</p>
   <p>Nowe when y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Frenche Kynge consydered and marked wel that the Emperoure woulde set vpon
<pb facs="3"/>hym wythe stronge hande of the borders of Artoyis and Loreyne. So hath he ymagined and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed after his old vse and custome how &amp; after what waye he should breake this his purpose &amp; let hym from it, &amp; to prolonge it as longe as he myght, to the entent that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Sommer myght be spente or he shoulde haue anye power, so that the Wynter myght come, when y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> colde and wette should dryue thē oute of the felde.</p>
   <p>Now hath the Frenche Kynge thought that he woulde set vpon the Emperoure in another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey farre of to make the Emper. with his armye to get them the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
   <p>Whervpon the Frenche Kyng sente the Dolphyne into Italye, thorowe Sauoye wythe a verye
<pb facs="4"/>great Armye.</p>
   <p>And manye Earles, Lordes, &amp; Knyghtes, as the eldest sonne of Mounsieur devendome, and the eldest sōne of Mounsieur deguise and suche other, with many Capi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taynes, for to destroye the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Myliaene,</p>
   <p>But God the gyuer of all vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory hath ordeyned it otherwyse. For as they wente towardes the Mountaynes of Italye, they had great lacke of vytayle so that for lake of foode, many of them dyed. And when they came into Italy, so dyd they destroye al afore them wherby the land sustayned great losse, &amp; all thys was done to cause the Emperour to come thether &amp; helpe the Italyans, &amp; that in the meane tyme the Sommer should be spent and the Wynter to come
<pb facs="4"/>on them or they shulde beginne to do any thyng. Now the Frenche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men beinge in Italy wrought all the meanes the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>en, the which they stormed then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng to wynne it and to destroye it. But when they marked that it colde not be wonne they thought to haue famyshed them. But the gentyll Lorde &amp; noble Capitaine of the Emperoure called Marcquis delgasto, hath withe all spede gathered an Armye to defend the Emperoures countrye. And is come agaynst the Dolfine, to the same for to vittayle it, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> frēch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had layd seage to it afore his comynge the spare of .v. wekes so that all that whyle no vyttayle colde come to the towne.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>Wherfore thys noble Capitai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Marcquis delgasto entending to socoure, helpe and rescue the towne with al his youre &amp; strēgth and to vy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">

   <p>Therfore he mente his awn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> persone in the forwarde. And the mayne battel were the most part hye douchmen, whych played the men as hereafter shalbe declared.</p>
   <p>Nowe when they were come neate to the towne &amp; in the syght of the frencht Armey, so shot they at the frenche oost most fearsly, so that Marcquisdelgasto with his Sod yars (the which were moost part Spanyardes and Italians) ran fearsly vppon the frenchemē and fought longe with them, and at the laste the Frenchemen we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re putte to flyghte and all theyr fyrste Armye (that is to saye La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangarde)
<pb facs="5"/>be all slayne.</p>
   <p>And when the mayne batayle of the Frenchemen were fled, then the Italians and Spaniardes be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gon to gather theyr spoyle amōge them that were slayne and so wēt cleane out of theyr araye, &amp; thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte of no nother thyng but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mā, for hymselfe seakyng after ryches, thynkynge that the felde was all wonne, wher vppon the Frenchemen seynge and percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge the Italians and Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes oute of ther araye and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, gatheryng the spoyle. So the mayne battell of the Frenchemē came on them withal the hast the cold, to sleye them as they dyd, for the Spanyardes and Italyans seyng them come on thē so fearsly dyd theyr best to come in theyr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raye, and battayle agayne but y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      <pb facs="6"/>Frenchmē came on thē so strōgly defendyng them that with great force the kept the Spanyardes &amp; Italyans that they cold come in no aray, nor battayle &amp; so the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Marcquis delgasto were conquered &amp; ouercome, the cause ther of was theyr couetousenes &amp; for lacke of better takinge hede. And Marcquis delgasto was sore wounded, and when he sawe that the Frenchemen had gotten the vpper hand, so recolde he backe w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> his halbardes to his great Army y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whych were most part Douche men.</p>
   <p>And the Frenchemen folowed hym but whē his Armye saw him comming, beynge theyr chefe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitayne and sore wounded, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened theyr Leger and receaued him into them and closedde theyr
<pb facs="6"/>Leger agayne, and sought forthe wythe agaynste the Frenchemen which assayled them fearslye, &amp; so the recolde backe a lytyl and a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll syghtynge with the Frenche men tyl they were come to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> next towne, and lyke valyaunt men of warre spite of the Frenchemen, brought they theyr Capitayne in to it and so saued his lyfe.</p>
   <p>Of thys feate the Frenchemen were not a lytyll glad, thynkyng that they welde ouer runne al I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly &amp; wyn the towne also of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringiaen by kepyng theyr vittai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les from them, and the Frenchmē dyd much myschefe in all parties wher they came. And ther is an Earle in Italy, called Picus Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randula which fauoureth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> frēch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men greatlye, and so he tooke vp many Souldiers to the nomber
<pb facs="7"/>of .xxiiij. M. to helpe the Frenche<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men with all, he thynkyng y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they shuld wyn all Italy.</p>
   <p>Now when Marcquis delgasto hard y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they robbed, burnt, toke &amp; destroyed the land, thē he caused a great nomber of men of warre to be made redye, and sent them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge of greate power wythe hys principal Capitaine of Salerne. Whē this great Armye was come in to the Dukedome of Myllaene for to fight with the Frenchmen, and to stoppe them of theyr mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chefe &amp; destrucciō y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they daily did to the countreye. And so it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> on the .iiij. day of Iune last past at .v. of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> clock at after none came the Prynce of Salerne w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> his people in goodly order, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all redy to fyght, set vpon the Frenchemen betwene two Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="7"/>named Noule and Sarauair Now the chefe Capitayne of the Frenchemen, was one Peter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strossy, brother to the wyfe of the Dolphyne of Fraunce this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne made vnto his people afore they shuld fyght a great oraciō, in couraging thē after the best wyse he colde and holdened thē to fight manfullye thorowe whyche they were greatlye encouraged to the battayle. And when they came and mette together they foughte longe tyme so that moche people were slayne on bothe the sydes.</p>
   <p>Yet at the last God gaue the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye to the noble Prince of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerne so that he wan the felde, and with force of Armes ouercame y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> frenchemen, so y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the moost parte of them were slayne.
