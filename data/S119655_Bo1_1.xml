      <head>Section 1. Of the Excellencie of Mans Nature, aboue all Creatures.</head>
      <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a most certaine truth (auerred by the common consent of all Writers,) that the Nature of Man, of a selfe instinct from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, is wholly propensed vnto a desire of knowledge: A matter not in controuersie; yet by the Philosophers of former times ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, to manifest thereby the excellencie of mans Nature, though in an other both sense, and phrase; referring the same by priuiledge of a speciall difference, to a preheminenced soueraigntie in Man, ouer all Creatures through the benefite of Reason: making him therein equall to the Angels; but in a more singuler eminencie farre surpassing all Creatures; and so by consequent, their Lord and Ruler. As this is most true, and of all confessed accordingly; so yet are we fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="16"/> to search out a more speciall meaning thereof. God sayd in <hi>Genesis: Let vs make Man in our Image, according to</hi>
         <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note>
         <hi>our likenesse.</hi> It seemeth by these wordes, that God had a purpose to make <hi>Man</hi> a most singuler Creature, when he first entred into counsell as it were, with his owne Wisedome, to create him his Superintendent ouer all his other Creatures; and therefore saw in his wisedome, how necessarie it was for him to adorne this souereigne Creature with endowments of qualities fitting the charge of so large, and potent dominion. S. <hi>Paul</hi> well vnderstanding the same, in his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> by those two wordes of Gods <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Likenesse,</hi> in Man, implieth the whole perfection of mans Nature by two wordes also, saying; <hi>Man after God, is created in</hi>
         <note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 24.</note>
         <hi>Righteousnesse and true Holinesse.</hi> It is not enough therefore for vs to know onely the creation of this our Nature to be heauenly, and so in a kind of preheminence most eminent by the power of Reason; but wee must in like manner accordingly endeauour to aduance it vnto the qualitie of the perfection thereof, assigned by God, in <hi>Truth, Wisedome,</hi> and <hi>Innocencie:</hi> for without these three theological Vertues, this <hi>Image of God</hi> in vs, (our Nature through the pollution of sinne, beeing wholy in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner blemished and defaced) cannot be sayd to haue been truly instructed into a sufficient knowledge of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which is thereby signified, and must be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of vs, if wee will be like to him our maker.</p>

In this forme of Prayer, we aske of God what is meete to be giuen vs by him, for the sustenance of our earthy, and corruptible life, which otherwise cannot be relieued and maintained; as Food, and Cloathing, whether in sicknesse, or in health. And this is to be craued conditionally, so as these may haue a speciall reference to the performaunce of Christian due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties towardes one another; that Gods glory thereby may the better be aduanced, euen in these his Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie benefits, which we must necessarily acknowledge to proceed from his meere, and solie free Bountie: and so vpon this acknowledgment wee are with that <hi>Samaritan Leaper, to fall downe at Gods feete,</hi> most humbly <hi>giuing him</hi>

      <p>TO this purpose I thinke it very meete, and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to this Argument, that the Readers hereof, before they pray, doe addresse themselues with a consideration of the diuerse kindes of Prayers; that so they may the more aptly <hi>Appropriate</hi> their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto God.

      <p>HEere, least any in opposition to my former Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations shall say, that some likewise in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are remembred to haue restored the dead vnto life; and so this Miracle, though onely and solely properly belonging to God, yet may also be vnto Man for imitation: I thinke good, before I proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Argument, to insert a note by way of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to the simple sort, not well instructed in the same; to witte, That where they read in the Booke of God, of any, being once dead, restored againe to life, in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by man, they doe there obserue the mediate work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that effect, in Prayers of the Faythfull; to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence it from that of Christes immediatly working power vpon <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and <hi>Iairus</hi> Daughter before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And likewise that they take heed, they doe not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any virtue to the worke of Prayer, (whensoeuer in that miraculous manner blessed of God,) as if of the worthinesse of the person, his Prayer tooke that virtue and sorce, to giue life: But let the Reader be rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideratly aduised to know, that for as much as all Gods Promises for obtayning any thing at his handes, are in Iesus Christ his name accomplished, and by him onely made good vnto vs, <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen:</hi> Wee doe therefore depend wholy vpon him in Fayth; by him, as the onely meanes to haue accesse vnto God.

      <p>THis was the last poynt, which I had to discusse in this Treatise, and shall be shut vp with the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Daniel,</hi> aswell to shew, that the Prophets also in the old Testament, obserued the like rule for sequestring themselues, from out of open places, in times of their Prayers to God; as also for that it giueth matter, for a note of an instructiue Obseruation: So then, the sayd Note being first discussed, the Treatise shalbe concluded, according as this example of <hi>Daniel</hi> hath giuen occasion of the same, and may of the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Reader be noted in the circumstances.</p>
      <p>It is written, that when <hi>Daniel vnderstood that King Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius had sealed A writing,</hi> such as the Rulers of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome had deuised against him; He persently <hi>went into his house.</hi> And (<hi>his Window being open in his Chamber towardes</hi>

      <p>But yet <hi>Daniel</hi> thus <hi>Secretly praying,</hi> was discouered: For, <hi>The Rulers assembled, and found Daniel praying, &amp; making</hi>
