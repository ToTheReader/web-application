      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, my affection that had rather be an actor then an orator, doe well then speake well, hath pickt you out to be the patron of this tragicall historie of the wars of the Iewes. The reasons that draue me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, are neither the expectance of worldlie bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, nor the fruitlesse vp-shot of ostentation, but your virtue (which is not beloued respectiuelie but onely for it selfe) hath created this good conceit in me, which (if you so please) your acceptance may continue. Now since as the Philosopher supposeth it is an action worthy a good man, to do good vnto his friend; so is it no lesse commendable to accept an office of kindnes from a friend. For by giuing we bewray our well wishing; and by receiuing, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and continue frendship: vpon this ground I praie you build the good entertainment of my present, and nourish this good custome in me (which was vsuall both amongst Grecians and Latins) I meane my translation, which if it please you, I haue my wish. As for my maligners, I expect no worse from them then <hi>Iason</hi> the <hi>Thassalian,</hi> who being assailed and wounded by an enemie (who had an intent to kill him) had an impostumation opened that saued his life: their stabbe and stroke of disgrace shall cure and heale the hidden and neglected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of my minde, and notwithstanding I shall both <hi>Genio &amp; ingenio</hi> liue to loue you, and lament their want of char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
