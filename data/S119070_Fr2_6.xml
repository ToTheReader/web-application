      <hi>George Herbert</hi> to his friend the Translator of this Book.</head>
   <p>MY deare and deserving Brother, your <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap>
      </hi> I now returne with many thanks, and some notes, in which perhaps you will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover some care, which I forbare not in the midst of my griefes; First for your sake, because I would doe nothing negligently that you commit unto mee; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly for the Authors sake, whom I conceive to have been a true serv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>nt of God; and to such, and all that is theirs, I owe diligence; Thirdly for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches sake, to whom by Printing it I would have you consecrate it. You owe the Church a debt, and God hath put this into your hands (as he sent the fish with mony to S. <hi>Peter,)</hi> to discharge it: happily also with this (as his thoughts are fruitfull) intending the honour of his servant the Author, who being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured in his own country he would have to flourish in this land of light, and region of the Gospell, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his chosen. It is true, there are some things which I like not in him, as my fragments will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, when you read them; neverthelesse I wish you by all meanes to publish it, for these three eminent things observable therein: First, that God in the midst of Popery should open the eyes of one to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and expresse so clearely, and excellently the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Gospell in the acceptation of Christs
<pb facs="17"/>
righteousnesse (as he sheweth through all his Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertions) a thing strangely buried, and darkned by the Adversaries, and their great stumbling-block. Secondly the great honour and reverence, which he every where beares towards our deare Master and Lord, concluding every Consideration almost with his holy Name, and setting his merit forth so pious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for which I doe so love him, that were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, I would Print it, that with it the honour of my Lord might be published. Thirdly, the many pious r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>les of ordering our life, about mortification, and observation of Gods Kingdome within us, and the working thereof, of which he was a very diligent observer. These three things are very eminent in the Author, and overweigh the defects (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) towards the publishing thereof, &amp;c.</p>
