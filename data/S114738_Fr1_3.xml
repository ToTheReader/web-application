   <head>A BRIEFE DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Deuotion of our B. <hi>LADY.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>EVEN as with all manner of deceitful subtelties and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous vntruthes, heresie doth euer go about to derogate vnto the glory of the most soueraigne Queene of heauen and earth: so is it the part of euery zealous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke with as much care and diligence, to procure to set forth, amplifie, and increase, her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull praises, and most deserued honour. Wheras therfore in this litle treatise we are to set downe one of the most speciall deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and seruices that the holye Church vseth vnto the glorie of this B. Virgin: I thinke it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that before we enter into the principall discourse it selfe, wee briefly for the behoofe of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
<pb facs="8"/>set downe, wherein the deuotion, and seruice of so high a creature doth consist.</p>
   <p>Two thinges therfore are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, for the wholle perfection of that which we call the deuotiō of our Lady. First, for to haue a deepe and setled conceit of her worthines and greatnes, next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Almightie God him selfe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all spirituall and corporall creatures. Secondly to deriue frō such due estimation, an earnest study, and endeuour for her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour &amp; the glorie of God, &amp; our owne profite, of doing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming whatsoeuer may becom vs. Concerning the first therfore, I will here only touch amongest her infinite priuileges only a few, and such as either without heresie cannot be doubted of: or are by the firme consent of the wholle
<pb facs="8"/>Church, most constantly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: or may with godly deuotion be gathered out of the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and auncient Fathers: lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the large proofes therof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many learned books which of this point are euery where extant.</p>
   <div type="privileges">
      <head>25 singular priuiledges of our Blessed Lady.</head>
      <p n="1">1 That as she is in all maner of vertues and dignities, farre excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all other creatures; so was she before all worlds appointed and chosen to so great highnes; in so much, that <hi>ab eterno,</hi> Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God considering and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding so singular a worke of his hand, next vnto him selfe and the humanitie of our Sauiour, had a speciall delight and repose in her.</p>
      <p n="2">2 When the time came that so
<pb facs="9"/>excellent a creature shoulde bee brought into the world, she was foretold by Angelicall reuelation vnto both her barren parents, euē as before euen from the begining of the world, she had in sundrie waies bene both prefigured and promised.</p>
      <p n="3">3 Her Body, although it were conceiued according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall order of mans generation, yet was both the matter ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therunto with such deuotion as became so holye parents: and there wanted not the speciall coo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peration of the holy Ghost, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring (as the Church singeth) the habitation of the sonne of God. Whence it did proceed, that in perfection of bewtie and comple<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction, she was such, as is credibly to be thought neuer to haue bene subiect to such particular defects
<pb facs="9"/>of body, as are either caused by the euilnes of complection or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for punishment of sinne, or procured by disordered life: and that in her person she did ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry such a shew of heauenly come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and maiestie, that a greate Saint beholding her, said,<note place="margin">Dion. Areop.</note> that if he had not other wise ben taught by his faith: he would haue dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her to haue some Godhead within her.</p>
      <p n="4">4 When the time came that her Body should be quickned with a reasonable soule, (which in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the very creating within a body by carnall generation, des<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cending from ADAM cōtracteth originall sinne, and geueth life, and beeing to a child of wrath:) shee only was exempted frō such deformitie, and presently made the child of God, and euer from
<pb facs="10"/>that time full of grace and of all vertue: although in the processe of her most holy life, she continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally increased the same, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the conceauing of the sonne of God, and the comming of the holy Ghost vnto all the Apostles.</p>
      <p n="5">5 She had then such abundāce of grace bestowed on her from God,<note place="margin">D. Tho 5. Par. q 27. ar. 5 <hi>Psa.</hi> 86.</note> that she farre exceeded the grace of all Angels &amp; holy soules: so that she laying her foundatiōs aboue so many high hills, we may not any way conceiue vnto what a hight so perfite a sāctuarie grew before her death. Neither wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted shee any grace or gifte of the HOLY GHOST, as of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, working miracles, and such like, although whilest she liued in this world, it was conuenient for the confirmation of the doctrine of Christ, that he only and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
<pb facs="10"/>shold worke miracles. But she hath aboue all other Saintes since her assumption into heauen: receiued that power of her sonne and daily in all countreies practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the same.</p>
      <p n="6">6 As diuers holy Fathers do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie,<note place="margin">Amb. &amp; Beda in Luc. vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Aug. ep. <hi>57</hi>
         </note> that S. IHON Baptist when he was sanctified in his mothers wombe, had the vse of his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will: voluntarily cōcurring to the acceptation of that grace which hee then receaued; which is not obscurely signified vnto vs in the Gospell it selfe: where we read that the Infant exulted in ioye, which argueth knowledge of the cause of so great ioy: so is it also most worthely to be thought of this Virgin: for that generall rule of all Diuines and holy Fathers, that whatsoeuer priuiledge hath bene granted vnto any pure crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="11"/>is to be in a higher degree attributed vnto her. And it were very agreable vnto her other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uileges, to thinke the same vse of reason to haue still continued in her: especially wheras the wholle Church attributeth such discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto her, as well the space of her infancie being with her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: as also when beeing three yeere olde she went of her owne accord to present her selfe with great deuotion to the seruice of God, in the Tēple: And the giftes of God,<note place="margin">
            <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</note> (as S. PAVL teacheth vs) being alwaies without repentāce: it was not conuenient that she a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other should euer loose that which she once receiued.</p>
      <p n="7">7 Her holy natiuitie and presen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation were vnto the holy persōs which were by the inspiration of God made priuie vnto her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb facs="11"/>and to the hope of the redēp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Israel now at hand; a cause of such ioy as neuer before had bene in the world: all being full of Gods miracles and heauenly comfortes.</p>
      <p n="8">8 The bolines of her life euen from the beginning vnto the end therof was such that it was voide from all sinne, not onely mortall but also venial.<note place="margin">Aug. lib. de nat. &amp; grat. c. <hi>36.</hi>
         </note> Yea she was who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly deliuered from that inclinatiō vnto euill, and difficultie in that which is good which we all recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued from ADAM; not only in her conceiuing of CHRIST, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so from her first immaculate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; when beeing free from Originall sinne, shee was also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the sequell therof, which the Diuines call <hi>fomes pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati:</hi> so that in all her life the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior powers of her soule, coulde
<pb facs="12"/>neuer be moued without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of reason.</p>
      <p n="9">9 As her life was more holy thē euer of any other creature: so did she abound with more heauenly visitations, then euer was graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto any being cōtinually gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded &amp; waited vpon with Angells: yea,<note place="margin">
            <hi>Exe.</hi> 33. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12</note> if vnto S.PAVL &amp; MOISES was shewed in this life the very essence and glory of God, as the Diuines after S. AVGVSTINE &amp; other holy Fathers doe more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably iudge then must we also for the rule aforesaid not doubt, but vnto this Virgin the same priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at some time or other was graunted: which so great gifts of God she alwaies concealed with vnspeakeable humilitie, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her selfe to no creature, but alwaies ready to become the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of all.</p>
      <pb facs="12"/>
      <p n="10">10 She was the first which vow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed vnto God her virginity &amp; that without any insttuctions of any as well as without example.</p>
      <p n="11">11 She had by the special work of God ioined with her vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able virginitie the fecunditie of a mother; and whatsoeuer is perfit in mariage; vnto which she yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her selfe not purposing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish her sacred puritie, but by most certaine reulation assuringe her selfe of the perpetuety therof: that so the sonne of God might be borne in wedlocke, shee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued from infamie, and so great a misterie of the incarnatiō of our Sauiour Christ, concealed from the Deuill, and there should not wāt vnto her selfe and her sonne in this miserable life the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie comfort of a fosterer Saint IO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEPH her spouse: whō presently
<pb facs="13"/>after the mariage shee caused to vow also virginitie, making them selues a perfect paterne of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny couples as by theire example haue in the Church of Christ vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the same.</p>
      <p n="12">12 She by her holines and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler perfectiō deserued that the sonne of God should be incarnat and take flesh in her immaculate wombe, for this word of deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or meriting doth S.AVGVS<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>TINE vse when he yeeldeth the reasons why shee was euery way free from sinne:<note place="margin">Lib. de nat. &amp; grat. <hi>1. 36.</hi>
         </note>
         <hi>Quia concipere ac parere meruit eum quem constat nullum habuisse peccatū:</hi> Because she deserued to conceiue &amp; bring forth him, whom it is manifest to haue had no sinne: yet this merite do we not so vnderstād, as thogh the worke of the incarnation it selfe could be deserued: but that
<pb facs="13"/>supposing that God of his meere liberallitie and goodnes determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the same, she might deserue of God with an imperfite kind of merite, (which the Diuines call <hi>de congruo</hi>) that what he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to do, he shold do, both the sooner, and take her as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of his goodnes, &amp; grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes in the same. And yet such was her base conceit of her selfe, that so farre she was from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation or imagination of soe great a benefite, that she desired to be the handmaid and slaue of whatsoeuer woman were to bee the Mother of the MESSIAS of the worlde, whom shee knew by the profoundest intelligēce of the holye Scriptures which euer any creature had, of which she was a continuall student, to be borne of a woman a Virgin.<note place="margin">Esa. 5</note> For as she had
<pb facs="14"/>learned most highly to conceiue of God, and his appointed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so had she also vsed her selfe with sinceritie to humble her self in the fight of God, that he might exalte her, &amp; therfore dare I bold<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly say, that if this most absolute Virgin,<note place="margin">
            <hi>Iac.</hi> 4 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5</note> had not bene so worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disposed, as in deed shee was, for so great a sacrament: Almigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie God would not haue sent his Sonne. For as he had ordained be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore all the world the most holy incarnation of his only sonne: so had he also ordaind togither with the priuiledges of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture of his sonne: the dignitie of her from whō he was to take the same. Yet do I not say that Gods prouidence coulde be deceaued herin: but that he would with the same foresight prouide both the end and the means of so great an
<pb facs="14"/>end. And as our sauiour him selfe whatsoeuer he did for our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, although he did it with order and commaundmēt from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet he did it voluntarily and freelye: Euen so shee which was thought fitte of God him selfe for so greate a worke, although Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God him selfe was the chiefe author of her worthinesse: yet did she freely and voluntarily concurre vnto our redēption: by making her selfe with Gods espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace a fitte mother for our Redeemer. Whereby we learne what deuotion, reuerence, and gratfulnes we shoulde carry to so great a benefactrice.</p>
      <p n="13">13 The plenitude of time which God in his eternall wisdome had ordained beeing now come: the Angell GABRIEL commeth to bring her these ioifull tidings, &amp;
<pb facs="15"/>with great reuerence, as not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming to call her by her proper name, saith vnto her, <hi>Haile full of grace:</hi> when she nothing frighted with the sight of a yong man (for such figure the Angell bore) as one much accustomed to the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersation of Angells: was only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed with such honorable spea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches: yet beeing certified by the Angell of what God had determi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned of her, &amp; of the saftie and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie of her vowed Virginitie, she freely gaue her consent. But what consent? Such a consent as brought the Sonne of God into the world.<note place="margin">He. <hi>4.</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus est.</note> For as S. BERNARD saith, shee spake a word, which was, <hi>Behold the handmaid of our Lord, be it vnto me according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy word,</hi> and presently she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued in her most chast wombe the eternall word of God; equall
<pb facs="15"/>vnto the Father; &amp; the holy Ghost When as shee had alwaies bene the Temple of the holy Ghost, so now she was first made the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of the same eternall spirite, framinge within her an eternall house for the wisdome of GOD,<note place="margin">
            <hi>Prou.</hi> 9</note> which was Christ our Lord: and secondly the Mother &amp; Temple of the sonne of God, who corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dwelled within her for the space of nine monthes. A moste happy consent: and most glorious sonne, wherein Almightie God him selfe made his Tabernacle, for the redemption of the wholle world.<note place="margin">
            <hi>Psa.</hi> 18</note> And ô base and vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hart, who wilt not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and reuerence so greate a benefite.</p>
      <p n="14">14 Presently after the concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Christ, as though neither she her selfe nor Christ our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb facs="16"/>newly come into the worlde could be idle, &amp; not attend to the worke of our redemptiō: she wēt to her cosen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> although in shew to visite her beeing great with child: yet also to sanctify her burden which she had within her For he which now dwelled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in MARY, by her sacred voice, as by an instrument, sanctified him which was to be the Precursor of the true Messias: &amp; endewed him with those vertuous habits, which brought forth afterward such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actions, as the scripture yeldeth testimonie of.</p>
      <p n="15">15 Without all sorrow, paine, indecencie, preiudice to her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall integritie, she alone, as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worthy to be priuie to such a mysterie (when all things were at quiet silence, and the night in her course was at the middest of her
<pb facs="16"/>iorney) receiued in her Angelical handes from the Kingly seate of her sacred wombe, the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent word of God, &amp; laying him in a manger, nourished him with her most pure breastes; and was present at the homage and fealty which by the holy Angels with heauenly melody was yelded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
      <p n="16">16 She was the principall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser of that most comfortable name of Iesus, cōfirmed with the first effusion of that sacred Blood, which was to take away the sinns of the world.</p>
      <p n="17">17 She had not only an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicall familiaritie with the sonne of God, and was a principall scho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lar of his; but he vouchsafed also to be subiect vnto her, she hauing a motherly right and auctoritie ouer him, and he with his labour
<pb facs="17"/>and toile gaining greate part of her liuelehode, for the space of thirtie yeeres, especially after S. <hi>Iosephs</hi> death.</p>
      <p n="18">18 All the Apostles and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hauing abandoned her holy sonne, she forsooke him not, but accōpaning him vnto the Crosse, and contemplating him theron, suffered in her aflicted mind (yet without any excesse or disorder of passion) whatsoeuer he suffred in his diuine Body: was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded most carefully by him to his most tenderly beloued Disciple: receiued his naked body with mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therlye familiaritie in her sacred lap: &amp; with most certaine expecta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of his Resurrection, after she had buried him returning home, all the Disciples although not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge lost the faith of that point which they had not as yet perfect<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="17"/>receiued yet not sufficiētly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of the same Resurrection.</p>
      <p n="19">19 She was the first vnto whom he appeared after his glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. For although of such apparition there be no mētion in the Gospell: yet of this affection to his louing Mother we need not doubt, but that as the Church sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth: <hi>Prima meretur gaudia, quae plus ardebat caeteris:</hi> She deserued the first ioy, which did loue more then the rest; And the delay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his resurrection and the apparition vnto <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene;</hi> is an argument that first he appeared vnto his Mother. And he had so determined, that for the saluation of mankind, two such notable personages liuing neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily together, as was him selfe and his glorious Mother; his only greatnes should be shewed first:
<pb facs="18"/>which beeing fully commended vnto men, he would afterwarde make knowen the excelencies of his Mother, euen vnto the worlds end. With whom before he had shewed any only priuate fauours, and therfore in the Gospel there is not mention made of her many priuileges, but only of such things as belong to the necessary confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the faith.</p>
      <p n="20">20 After the Ascention of our Sauiour, she was the mistres of the Apostles,<note place="margin">Luc. <hi>2.</hi>
         </note> when they went to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach in the world, and to the Euā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists going about to write the Gospell. For shee had diligently laid vp in her hart, such things as her sonne, for our saluation had done, and such as none but her selfe could be witnes of.</p>
      <p n="21">21 At the coming of the holy Ghost, shee receaued alone, as
<pb facs="18"/>much grace, as all the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Disciples,<note place="margin">S. Bona. in specu.</note> such beeing the loue of her deare sonne vnto her, and so great her capacitie, ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cordinge vnto which Almightie God not permitting his vessels to remaine emptie, doth alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fund his holy giftes &amp; graces.</p>
      <p n="22">22 Hauing for the space of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeeres after her sonnes As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, both bene a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the millitant Church, and hauing also receiued as much ioy of the conuersion of soules, and the name of her sonne spreade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the world, and continually visited with singuler deuotiō, the places where she remembred the fruitfull stepps of our Sauiour for our redemptiō: Being warned by an Angell of her death, &amp; all the Apostles miraculously presēt, she yeelded her soule, with vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="19"/>comfort &amp; quietnes, amōgst so holy a company, and with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly melody of Angels, into her sonnes owne bosome, who most louingly had inuited her, &amp; most ioifully receiued her into his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Tabernacle in recompence of the harbour receiued by her.</p>
      <p n="23">23 Her body hauing bene with great solemnitie and many sacred hymnes, both of the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and also of Angels commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the sepulcher, the Angels continued also for the space of three daies in the same place with their heauenly melody.</p>
      <p n="24">24 The third day her sacred bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy with farre greater solemnitie and ioies of Angels, being againe restored vnto the glorious soule, was in the bosome of her deare sonne, whom she had so ofte en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in her blessed lappe, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpted
<pb facs="19"/>vp into heauen being more reuerent &amp; holy, then hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen itselfe hauing contained that which heauen could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
      <p n="25">25 She was exalted to such dig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nity, as she had bene before the beginning of the world chosen vnto: that is, to be Queene of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gells, and of all Saints; and of all the world, an especiall aduocate vnto her Sonne for all mortall creaturs Other Saints are in deed made by God Kinges ouer the world,<note place="margin">

            <hi>Io.</hi> 14.</note> yet are they not Kings one ouer another, but partners and fellowes of so great a felicity. This is the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our B. Lady, that she on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly is exalted aboue all Angells &amp;
<pb facs="20"/>Saintes, being made so much the more better thē they all, by how much the more perfit a name she hath receiued, then they.

         </note> thou art my mother? and hauing this very conuenient priuiledge vnto her wholle life, and former dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, that as we receiued Christ by her, so by her, Christ doth at our death especially receiue vs. Finally by her as the Necke of the Church frō Christ her sonne, the head therof, we receaue all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of spirituall &amp; heauenly good I will therfore conclude with the saying of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> wonderfully discoursing of this Virgins name Mary: which signifieth starre of the Sea. O thou whosoeuer doest perceiue thy selfe in the fluxe of this world rather to be tossed in
<pb facs="20"/>the middest of stormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestes, than to walke vpon the earth: turne not away thy eies from the brightnes of this starre, if thou wilt not be ouerwhelmed with stormes: if windes of tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do arise, if thou doest incurr the rockes of tribulations, looke vpon the starre call vpon Mary. If thou beest tossed with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of pride, Ambition, Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Emulatiō: looke vpon the starre, call vpon Mary. If Sloth, Anger, or Couetousnes, or alure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the flesh doe shake the ship of thy mind: looke vpon Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry. If thou beest troubled with the enormity of crimes, confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the vncleanes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, frighted with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of iudgement, &amp; beginnest to be swalowed into the gulfe of sadnesse, or into the deapth of
<pb facs="21"/>despaire: thinke vpon Mary. In dangers, in distresses, in doubtful cases, thinke vpon Mary, call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mary. Lett her not departe from thy mouth, let her not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte from thy hart. And that thou maiest obtaine the releife of her praier, doe thou not swarue from the example of her conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. Following her, thou strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not: calling vpon her, thou de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spairest not: thinking vpon her, thou errest not: she holding thee thou fallest not: shee protecting thee, thou fearest not: she being thy guide, thou faintest not: she being mercifull, thou shalt ariue, and so in thy selfe thou shalt feele by experience, howe worthely it is said. <hi>And the name of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin was Mary.</hi>

      <p>Now for the second part, thus it behoueth euery true Christian to be deuout of our B. Lady.</p>
      <pb facs="21"/>
      <p n="1">1 To be stirred vp to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God himselfe, who hath shewed his power in so gloriouse a creature of his handes.</p>
      <p n="2">2 To Imitate her perticuler ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
      <p n="3">3 To conforme our selues to her diuerse affections which shee had in her wholle life, to reioice with her ioifullnes, to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of her sorowes, to congra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tulate with her glory.</p>
      <p n="4">4 To yeeld her such honor and reuerence as she deserueth: to ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mire her, to loue her, to praise her to acknowledge her as our speciall patrone, to dilate her prai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses vnto the worlde, to salute her with diuerse deuoute praiers, spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cially with the <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> to acknowledge with thākfull mind the benefites receiued from her, and by her meanes to commend
<pb facs="22"/>our owne necessities and of our frends and of the wholle Church vnto her, to offer all our actions yea and our selues vnto God by her, to exhibite vnto her, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior reuerēce &amp; honour, which is agreable vnto the practise of the holy Church &amp; of all deuoute persons: finally to acknowledge her as our mother in all thinges hauing recource vnto her as her tender children, preparinge our selues for her feastes &amp; expecting them as in the which we may hope to receiue singulercomforts and at our death reposing a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall hope in her protectiō. These thinges, deare Brother if thou wilt practise: I doubt not but thou shalt not only highly please this most B.
