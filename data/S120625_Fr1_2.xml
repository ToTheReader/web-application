      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the many cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses &amp; temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with which the life of all men, euen the most godly is distressed, be seriously weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="3"/>
and withall the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolation that too often sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priseth the hearts of most Christians, be compassionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought on: and if with all the singular glory of a godly mind framed vnto vnmoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rest, and stedfast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, be throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of; it cannot but bee manifest, that if a way can bee shewed how a Christian may fill his heart with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in any condition hee can fall into, in respect of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that such a course is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and all ought to take notice of it, and with all care and paines imploy themselues about it. This by Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb facs="3"/>
vpon apparent groūds of Scripture I haue indeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to shew in this Treatise; and doubt not but by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence humble and godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians will finde much refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing and establishment of heart, if they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues distinctly &amp; diligently to draw of the water of life, out of those wells of saluation, opened for them euery where in this roule of Gods Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
   <p>This Treatise I present to your Worships, and vnder the countenance of your names, desire to commend it vnto the Church of God: and this I am induced to doe for
<pb facs="4"/>
diuers reasons: your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse in the profession of sincere Religion for many yeares, the publike seruice you haue done in your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the administration of Iustice, for the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the good, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of abuses, your great care from time to time to plant painfull and profitable teachers in the places of your abode, together with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifts with which God hath furnished your mindes, deserue to be freely and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely acknowledged in the Church of God; and in mine owne particular I haue beene so many waies obliged, that
<pb facs="4"/>
with much gladnesse I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this occasion, to let the world know my desire to bee thankfull for the many helps &amp; furtherances my ministry hath receiued from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance &amp; endeuours of both your Worships, as occasion hath at any time bin offered. Desiring your acceptance hereof, and praying God to preserue you in his fear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, till the Day of Christ, and to inlarge in you the desire &amp; power of wel-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things, I end and rest, <hi>Isleworth, Octo. 1618.</hi>
