      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y most honourable Lord, the late departure of our L. P. Clement the 8. hath administred vnto me a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and opportunity during the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancie, to search out more particularly all points about the election of Popes, and the formes of proceeding therein, as well ancient as moderne, iudgeing it a very inconuenient matter, that we should be so addicted to the investigation of the least strange antiquities, as some doe, employing their whole studie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and to be ignorant of that which occurreth in our owne times, and in other things which touch and more neerely concerne vs. I made therefore a little memoratiue, with intent one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it should haue been for mine owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular vse, that vpon any default of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory heereafter, I might haue had recourse to the same: But my dutie, (for the honour you vouchsafe me, in being inquisitiue after my studies, &amp; hauing a care of the same) obliging me to giue you aduise herein, you did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire to see it, as you haue alwaies an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible affection to vnderstand, and be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with al honest and commendable maters,
<pb facs="4"/>
with a spirit and courage which surmounteth your yeares: but further hauing seen the same, you thought it expedient, that it should bee published and imprinted: It being not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impertinent to my relations of Rome, which before I presented to you, reduced as they saiy, within the length of a little foote; according to the proportion of my age of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares. It shall bee therefore you, my good Lord, to whome they that reade this Treatise, and take any contentment therein, must giue thanks; euen as on the contrary, they that out of a prowd humor, disdaine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne whatsoeuer is not done by themselues, shall haue somthing to say against you, and not against me, that doth but onely obey and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue your will and pleasure, as I ought to doe; hauing no other reference heerein, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate by all meanes possible, that I am,</p>
