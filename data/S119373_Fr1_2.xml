   <p>I Commende in to thy gentil handes (good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a most notable and godly learned worke of fyue Homelies / set furthe in Latin about .ix. yeares past by the reuerende and ryght famous clearke Rodulphe Gualter of zuirik / at suche tyme as the Bishop of Rome bestowed the treasures of his blessing wyth fyre and sweorde (by Italia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and Spanyardes) vpon certayne partes of Germanye: whych neuertheles were (by the migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye power and prouidence of God) so preserued in the myddes of affliction / that the more trauaile Satan (by his sonne and heire Antichrist toke to haue suppressed the Gospell of Christ / the more it florisheth: &amp; the more he persecuted it / the strōg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer it is confirmed / and the depelier it hathe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken roote. yea and (as it is Goddes wonted pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise / to tourne the malice and furie of his enemies to the furtheraunce of his glorie) it neuer prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Germanye (thākes be to the mercie of God for it) as it dothe nowe. And for asmuche as we Englishe mē did (by solemne othe) abiure his v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped power and forged autoritie (whom the said author of thys worke calleth the myghtie houge Antichrist) in the dayes of Goddes lawfull appointed Ministers of famous memorie / Kyng Henry theight / and his sonne the blessed Kyng Edwarde the sixthe: and seyng ther is no lesse ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannye and plage purposed / and hanging at thys present (by the iuste iugemēt of God / for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples vnthankfulnesse / negligence / and aduised per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie) ouer the noble realme of Englande / than at that tyme was attempted in Germanie: I thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght it good / to translate and set furthe this nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worke / into our vulgare Englishe tongue / for iij. causes. Furst to stere the fauourers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Iesus Christ / and the weake brethren / to geue God most heartie thankes for his mercifull gifte of knowlage in this case / and with teares (for the miserable condicion of our naturale coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
<pb facs="2"/>
/ now pressed with the tirannous yowke of antichrist) to poure out feruent prayers to God almyghtie / that he wolde (of his abundaūt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie (for Christes sake) vouchsafe to wythdrawe (once again) this deserued and iustly sent miserie. Secondarely / to desire those men / which esteme &amp; measure religion and Goddes worde / by the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of worldly thinges: to beholde (with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent consciences) what wealthe and pleyntie of meate and money / the Masse (the daughter of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist) hathe brought wyth her again into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande: and therby (though they compt litell vpon Goddes worde) to beholde how horrible a thing it is / to fall into the handes of the lyuyng God / by committing of wilfull periurie: and in what state they stande against the dredfull daye of the Lord (whose eyes and iudgement no colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense can deceaue \ for receauing againe of his most blasphemous enemye / whom they hade re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by a necessary lawfull othe / made in his holy name. Thirdly / to prouoke the bringers in a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gain / and mayntenours of his pretenced power &amp; autoritie (whom this autor calleth Antichrist) either to repent and reuoke their popishe &amp; dam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nable errours / and confesse and embrace the truth of Christes Gospel with vs: or els to cōfute this worke / not with mennes traditions nor vayne falsely vsurped titles of the churche / and catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fayth: but with the manifest worde of God (wherupon the catholike churche of Christ / and the true christian iustifieng faithe is buylded) yf they can: as I knowe / they can not. For their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillarie is to shorte and to weake / yea all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of the very gates of hell shall neuer be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to encountre it / muche lesse to preuaile against it. In the meane tyme / we being established and quieted in the inuincible trueth of Goddes most holy sacred worde (wherby the autor of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke translated by my poore trauaile / dothe most learnedly &amp; muinciblye paint out vnto thee that great enemye of God / Antichrist) shall by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
<pb facs="3"/>
of Goddes holy spirite / patiently digeste their railyng and tirannye. And considering oure former vnthankulnesse / carnalitie / and necligence in our vocacion / we shal most humbly submit our selues to our heauenly fathers rodde and correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and loke for deliueraunce at his owne mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyfull leasure / knowyng that in the myddes of his wrathe / he remembreth mercye.</p>
   <p>Take paynes now to reade ouer diligently these fyue Homelies with the Autors preface / good reader. And yf God lightē thyne heart with this candle / to consent vnto the truthe wyth vs / wherof thou wast either ignoraunt before / or in case thou be already persuaded / yet yf thou be the better instructed and more soundly satled hereby in this behalfe: I haue my hole desire / and full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. God geue thee vnderstandyng in all thinges / and in hym ryght hertely well to fare.</p>
   <p>The Autors owne tytle of thys boke / is thus.</p>
   <q>Antichrist. That is to saye, fyue Homilies, wherin it is proued, that the Bishoppe of Rome is the ryght and myghtye houge Antichrist, whom the oracles of the Prophetes, Christ &amp; the Apostles tolde before shoulde come, and that we shoulde beware of him: Set furthe by Rodulphe Gual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zuirik. &amp;c.</q>
