I need say little of it, it is big-enough and can speake for it selfe. An old and ordinary subject it is, but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, and in no ordinary way. I will say no more of it but this, and it is enough; It
<pb facs="3"/> but seldome or never when the Elder are disinherited.</p>
   <p>Your hand was put forth to uphold this <hi>pillar,</hi> that was not <hi>Substantive</hi> enough to stand of himselfe, nor had so much wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as to cleave to a Nother; so, though he had your hand, yet he stood not, he is falne: So it must needs be sooner or later with every man, who hath not a single eye to that invisible Hand, who is the Great Supporter of a Man, and onely makes the house a Blessing: The low Cottage, as well as the high Throne, is <hi>established by Righteousnesse</hi>

   <p>Since he fell we have been in our Ruines, and in them, some of us, having recourse to your selfe, found you as ready and active as you were able; you said you would doe it, and what you said was done, your word was your deed. This and more, whereof none can speake more then can my selfe, renders you honoured, I think of all, that in a faire and cleare way
<pb facs="3"/> (else you will not heare of it,) have had occasion to use you: And my intendment here, is but to tender my acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, and you cannot be offended that I shew my selfe thankfull.</p>
   <p>I could give you <hi>Titles</hi> of respect, &amp;c. and not flatter neither, as the manner is, and as some doe, who <hi>feare not</hi> their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Job. 32.</note>. But what are Mans <hi>eulogies</hi> in a wise Mans esteeme? Nothing: They, whom the King of Kings will honour, are honoured <hi>indeed;</hi> and they who honour Him, shall be so honoured, that's certain. You will give me leave then to leave the common way of complements, a way I could never comply with, and to be your Remembrancer in two things; they are very grave and weighty both.</p>
   <p>1. God hath given you a rich portion in things below; It is a point of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wisdome, not to think these <hi>The portion</hi> (It was, and is the Righteous Mans Sinne <note n="e" place="margin">He received his good things not as he should, as a pledge of Gods further favour, but as a full and compleate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: as a <hi>propriatory</hi> not as a <hi>Steward</hi> and an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countant: he accounted his life as his, and as if there had been no other; Bish. <hi>Andr.</hi> pag. 316.</note>) either <hi>during</hi> or <hi>satisfying:</hi> not During; of such portions it will be said, as once it was, In the <hi>Time-past, Thou had'st
<pb facs="4"/> them;</hi> pleasures, profits, honours; They were, now they are not; And when they were, and thou had'st them, They were not <hi>satisfying;</hi> They filled, They wearied thee, They did not satisfie, no more then the East winde doth satisfie an hungry sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack. There are three <hi>markes</hi> upon the Rich-mans folly, which makes it very <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>1. He said to his soule, <hi>Thou hast much goods;</hi> That was a great mistake; They were the goods of the <hi>Body,</hi> not of the <hi>soule:</hi> Barnes full, and Coffers full, and yet the soule not the fuller, not the richer; perhaps the poorer, the leaner; The more emptinesse, the more of that fulnesse.</p>
   <p>2. <hi>Laid up for many yeers;</hi> A cleere mistake that too; for, that Night, the soule was pluckt away. But grant a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for many yeers, a thousand twice told; yet an end comes at last; They must be eternall good-things, which an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall soule can relish and enjoy, being su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and proportionable thereunto.</p>
   <p>3. <hi>Take thy ease;</hi> That was a third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb facs="4"/> exceeding all; for suppose, The soule continue with the Body, and the Body with the Goods: Soule with Body; Body with Goods, wife, children, riches, health, honours, all continued together, there were no parting: suppose it so; yet we know, for so we read, that the <hi>Mountaine</hi> (it contains all the fore-mentioned) may be <hi>strong,</hi> yet the Man <hi>weake</hi> upon it; The Mountaine may continue, yet the Man may be troubled; It was <hi>Davids</hi> case: All is in Gods <hi>face</hi> towards us: if that <hi>shine</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Man, all is well and Lightsome; if that be clouded or hid, all is nothing; The Man will be troubled. God can, without Taking the soule away, or goods away, He can put the Spirit of a Man into such a condition of darknesse, as that all those comforts shall be to a Man, but as the white of an egge, no more relishing. <q>As there be joyes the world gives not; so are there afflictions, the world inflicts not, saith a Learned Divine <note n="f" place="margin">M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>G.</hi> Childe of Light. 6.</note>.</q> There is a breaking of the bones, whereof <hi>David</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/> complained, when there is not a bone in the body out of joynt: The soule may be broke with sorrows, vvhen there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of vvorldly comforts round about us. And this requires our <hi>Marke</hi> for mighty reasons: <q>for it is as difficult a thing to goe-out of our selves to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alone for comfort; as to goe-out of our selves to Christ alone for Righteousnes.</q> The Rich-mans Tower is as strong now as ever it was, in his <hi>conceit</hi>
      <note n="g" place="margin">

         </gap> Prov. 18. 11.</note>, and he is as firmely bottomed upon his <hi>Mountain;</hi> and he speaks as confidently now to his soule, <hi>Take Thy Ease,</hi> as ever he did; for though the History be old, the practice is new. But this is our wisedome, and for this we shall be counted understanding Men, if looking for ease and Comfort, we look up to God with a single eye and trust per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly on Him; for enquire from one end of the heaven to the other: Aske of the Barnes and Winepresses, they are the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest and fattest places under the Sunne, aske them or any Creature else, whether they
<pb facs="5"/> can <hi>give ease to the soule?</hi> They will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>no,</hi> it <hi>is not in them:</hi> though yet they can contribute a great deale, But then the light of Gods countenance must shine through them, if not, they contribute No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; That He may be known and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the God of <hi>all comfort</hi> and the <hi>Father,</hi> not of some, but <hi>of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations.</hi> What ever outward comforts we have, the comfort of our spirits is from God. So then we are driven to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion; God <hi>onely makes the soule to Rest,</hi> and gives it <hi>ease;</hi> and that is never, till He <hi>deales bountifully with it</hi>
      <note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 117. 7.</note>, till He satisfies it with Himselfe a sutable and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable-good both <hi>During</hi> and <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The soule is scattered and lost, when it is <hi>parcelled</hi>-out to variety of things: It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fixe now, It doth but roule like a Ship at Anchor in a Tempest; It must be brought to the <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>one Desire</hi> and one <hi>love;</hi> Till then, it will be as unstable as the water; as restlesse as a <hi>Meteor,</hi> still tossed,
<pb facs="6"/> and in doubtfull suspence: So Truth it selfe Assureth by that very <hi>Metaphor</hi>

But, ô the peace, the securitie of that person, whose heart is <hi>fixed trusting in the Lord!</hi> he hath left <hi>Cisterns,</hi> Creature-comforts, and is gone to the <hi>Fountaine,</hi> where he shall be satisfied; he is got to the Rock of his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, where is an <hi>abiding;</hi> and now he shall stand fixed and firme upon his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, like the Rock, against which the raging waves may beat, but shall be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; Nay, more fixed is he then so, faster he stands then the <hi>hills</hi> or <hi>mountaines,</hi> yet, because of their setled standing, are they called <hi>perpetuall hills, everlasting Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi>

   <p>I know, I have transgressed my Rule at this point, for I have been too long upon it; Yet I pray you, doe not think so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is an high point, and I should say yet more unto it, because it is so high, and of such mightie concernment; for this is it
<pb facs="6"/> which, being well observed, will hold-up a mans Spirits, when the body must fall asunder from it selfe; and make the heart rejoyce, when the eie-strings must break: But I consider your person and place, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wil winde up all and your thoughts together in one <hi>word,</hi> which you often meet with; I will onely annex <hi>Selah</hi> here, a word, which <hi>sounds high</hi> and gives an elevation to the minde answerable to the matter; so your thoughts are raised now, reaching after good-things, which shall endure as long, as Eternitie is long, for ever; And this is to be Truely <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted;</hi> This, in a True sense, to be <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded.</hi>

   <p>II. God hath given you a Name upon earth: He hath given you to know too (and you blesse His Name for it) that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is the least degree of your glorie.
