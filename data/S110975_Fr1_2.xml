The right godlie, and no lesse famous clearke, Master Iohn Caluyne, wrote in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, this treatise: of the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of a christen man. Which litle worcke to haue been made in the treasurie, or store house of God, it doth so euidently apere: that for me, to spende tyme in the commendation of it, it were but superfluous. This muche onely I wyl say: it so setteth furth, and paynteth before our eyes, what is the office or dutie of a christen

         </gap> Io iii, b.</note> Askest thou what that promise is? I answere: it is thys, that all that beleue in hym, haue remission of their synnes &amp; euerlastynge lyfe. Or els: fayth

Or els, to discribe it more at large, fayth is such a sure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidēce in the mercy of god (which for Christes sake he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to all that beleue in him) that it not onely feeleth our synnes to be so vile, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> for them God myght by his iustice, worthily dampne vs: but also feeleth goddes mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be so greate (first, in the free forgeuenes of oure synnes: then, in the enrichynge of vs, wyth the enheritaunce of euerlasting lyfe: and thirdly, in keepynge &amp; defen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyng vs in thys wretched world, vntyll the tyme of our departure from hence) that it worketh now in our hertes towarde God (euē

them, what so euer thyng, at any tyme shal come to them, either by the deuyll, or any other euyl cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature. Me thinke I here the say: if I were assured to atteyne this greate mercy at Goddes hande, then shoulde I haue greate ioye in my herte: I answere, considre dearely beloued, two thynges: fyrste,<note place="margin">Io. iii. c.</note> that it is God that hath made the promise, who is fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and can no more cease to be true,<note place="margin">i. Cor. i. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. Nu. xxiii. c.</note> then he can cease to be god, therefore he wyll fulfyll his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise for his truethes sake.<note place="margin">Mat. xi. d I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>. Ga. iii. d</note> And agayne considre, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he hath made that promise to all that beleue it to be true. Nowe why doest thou not then, beleue it? thou doubtest peraduenture of thy fayth, lest it be but an opinion: well I shal tel the, or rather, I haue told the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and nowe once agayne I do tell the, howe y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> mayest know


<pb facs="8"/>
and feele whether it be a lyuely fayth. For if, it worcke in thy hert a lothsomnes of thy synne, and a desyre to do goddes wyll 'then arte thou sure that thou haste a true fayth: for thy repentaunce on the one syde, and thy desyre to worcke rygtuously, on the other side, do testify it, yea &amp; that y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> hast already, and (as I maye saye) or euer thou arte ware, obteyned goddes mercy, for, they are the ryghte fruite of a lyuely fayeth,<note place="margin">Ro, v. a.</note> yea onely,<note place="margin">Eph. v. c</note> of suche a fayeth, as through the holy goste, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended mercy, and of suche a conscience, as wherein, the same spirite, who is the earnest of euer lastynge lyfe, doth dwel for euer. Haste thou not nowe cause then to haue greate ioye in thy herte?<note place="margin">Ro. xiili. c</note> naye rather howe canst thou but haue excedynge greate ioye, and <note place="margin">Phi. iiii, d.</note>the peace of god also whiche pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sseth


<pb facs="8"/>
all vnderstandynge? Thus thou seest y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fayth, is not a vayne opinion, but an assured cōfidēce, of thinges hoped for, and of thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges whiche are not seene. And what is more to be hoped for, or lesse can be seene, then God hym selfe? then fayth is an assurednes and a certentie of the hauyng of god, yea of hauynge God to be oure mercifull father, oure ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly louynge brother and saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, our continually present, and moste strongest comforter. Hym therefore, of a thankefulnesse for his mercy and goodnes, let vs al our lyfe long so vnfeinedly loue, that our lyfe and conuersation maye declare that we haue thus tasted of his plentuouse mercye, and in is holye ryghtuous and good lawe, lette oure meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be daye and nyghte. And nowe that we maye the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie


<pb facs="9"/>
walke therein, beholde we haue here before oure eyes, the conuersation of a trewe beleuer or Christian, so godlie, so playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and so learnedlie, sette forth, that if we shall expresse the same in oure selues, we shall declare, that we are not feyned Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but worthy warryours of Iesu Christe, agaynst selfe loue, synne, and Sathan. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore we shal shewe, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Christ by fayeth, dwelleth in oure her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes not idelly, but workynge, yea myghtelie workynge, being neuer vnlyke vnto hym selfe, so that nowe thou shalt, in thy lyfe and conuersation, shewe thy selfe an other certeyne Christe vnto thy neighbour, in so muche, that where Christe came into thys worlde, and bestowed hym selfe vpon vs, and to oure vses, euen so Christ wyll nowe, do the same


<pb facs="9"/>
in vs: as once he dyed for vs, euen so, wyll he kyndle in oure hertes, a loue to oure bretherne and that in so sure &amp; <abbr>ferūet</abbr> wyse, that we shall reioyse, not onely to be euyll spoken of, or to suffre losse of goodes or imprisonment, but allo (if neede require) to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffre death for their sakes. Thou wylt say, I am weake and fraile I am not able to do thus: no. But haue fayth and thou shalte be stronge,<note place="margin">Io, xvi. g.</note> for all thynges are possible to hym that beleueth, and thou arte able to do al thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thorugh him that strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the &amp; dwelleth in the. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore merueilous thynges shal he do by the, his instrument. For, as when Christe was conuersaunte here on earth, he lette nothynge passe hym, whereby he myghte expresse his great loue towardes vs, euen so nowe, Christe shall


<pb facs="10"/>
likewise be mynded in the: as thē, for oure loue, Christe was scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, crucified, and put to open shame, euen so nowe, Christe shal be pacient and sufferynge in the: as then Christe moste liberally, gaue hym selfe and all that he had, vnto vs, while we were syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and his enemies, euen so nowe Christe shall be boeth libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and mercifull in the. And as then, Christe desired the crosse, thirsted for oure saluation, and humbled hym selfe to very death prayinge for his enemies: euen so nowe Christe in vs, shall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seeke his owne profite, nor thynke on aduengmente, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise suche as be weake, but shall become all vnto all men, that at the lest way he may wynne some. And by thys meanes shall we stoppe the sclaūderous mouthes of the enemies of fayeth, whiche


<pb facs="10"/>
saye that the teachynge of it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth &amp; taketh awaye al good worckes, so that oneles they be altogether vngodly, as thei shal se the good worckes of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, they shall glorifie our father whiche is in heauen. Nowe to make an ende, I haue (good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) trāslated a good parte more, of the institution of a Christen mā wrytten by thys noble clerke, whiche I can not nowe put in print, partly through myne owne busynes, as well at Douer as at Calleis, and, partly by reason the prynter hath presently no leasure for the same. Yet, by the grace of God, I wyll shortly (the Kynges maiesties busynes geuynge me leaue) put forth either the, same or part therof, to the edifiyng (I truste (of the christen cōgregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
