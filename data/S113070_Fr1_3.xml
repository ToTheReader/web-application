      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord, the Philosopher <hi>Bion,</hi> being demaunded what beast was most noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some vnto all men, answered, if you aske me of sauage wild beasts, it is a Tyrant: but if you aske me of tame beasts, it is a Flatterer. <hi>Diogenes</hi> as I remember, made in a manner such an answere, who in place of a Tyrant, speaketh of a detractor and backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and saith in another place, as <hi>Antisthenes</hi> in <hi>Laertius,</hi> that it is more dangerous to fall among Flatterers, than among Rauens, I haue desired to be farre from that vice, which now adaies is common and familiar with many men, who in the beginning of their workes, insert a thousand lyes, attributing excessiue praises vnto those, vnto whom they addresse the same, a man may rightly call them the fauning dogs of Kings, Princes, and great Lords, euen as <hi>Diogines,</hi> of whom we haue aboue made
<pb facs="5"/>mention, called <hi>Aristippus,</hi> because he flattered <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> the Tirant of Syracusa: the interpreter of <hi>Nicephorus</hi> in his Ecclesiasticall historie, reporteth, that <hi>Constantine</hi> Emperour of the Romanes, did so abhorre Flatterers, that he called them the Moathes and vermine of the Court: <hi>Sigismond</hi> did so hate them, that hearing one (beyond measure) to praise him, comparing him with the Gods, he gaue him a blowe on the eare: <hi>Alfonso</hi> King of Arragon and Sicilia, said that Flatterers were like vnto Wolues, and as Wolues in grating and gnawing vse to deuoure certaine other beasts, euen so Flatterers tend to the ruine of Princes and great Lords by their flattering and lying. To what purpose so many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? to shew (my Lord) that vowing and consecrating this my little labour, I intend not by flatterie, to procure to be the more acceptable, for although that I know my selfe farre from it, if I should flatter you by too much praising you, I should be afraide you would vse me, as <hi>Alexander</hi> vsed the historian <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> who hauing written a booke of his acts (wherein he shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a flatterer) recited to him (in a certaine voyage by sea) the contents thereof: <hi>Alexander</hi> being vnable to endure his flatterie, pluckt the booke out of his hands, and threw it into the Riuer Hydaspis, and turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe towards him, said, Thou doest better deserue to be throwne there thy selfe, seeing that thou makest me so to fight alone, and that thou, with one onely dart kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest an Elephant: euen so, thinking that I peraduenture exceeding the limits of reason, you might throwe my booke into the fire, and make a sacrifice thereof vnto <hi>Ʋulcan.</hi> But to keepe me from this fault, in this dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="5"/>I haue desired to obserue two principall poynts, which will preserue me from incurring the dishonest name of those abouesaid: the first is, that I here say not that to your praise, which I might well say, but doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holde my peace, than peraduenture to wander (to no purpose) through those spacious fields of your prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which ought to be handled by a more skilfull pen than mine. The second is, that I addresse my selfe to a personage, so illustrious, noble, and generous, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I should say all the good of the world, I ought not to be reprehended of the vice abouesaid, seeing that he is not onely worthie of all praise, but also sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth it: the common report, all France, the fauour of the most Christian most magnanimous, and most noble Monarke beare sufficient testimonie of the rare vertues, and singular perfections which are in you, which raise you aboue all the greatnes which you enioy: for digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; greatnes serue to little purpose, or are rather hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, without the noble vertues wherewith they ought to be adorned: which is the cause that I boldly present vnto you, this my little booke, which although vnworthie of you, after an infinite number of others, which the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pens of our France haue dedicated vnto you, assuring me so much in your graue humanitie, that you will giue no worse entertainement vnto this, which I here hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly present vnto you, than you haue done vnto others, which peraduenture more boldly haue prevented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto your view. This doing (my Lorde) hauing made an end of the preface of my booke, of the estate, description and gouernment of the kingdomes and Common-wealths of the world, almost imprinted to be
<pb facs="6"/>presented to the King, you shall giue me occasion to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt (according to my ordinarie profession of writing) some greater &amp; more serious matter, which shal not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture be vnworthie of you, &amp; will not feare (seeing your naturall goodnes and clemencie) to wearie you with that, whereof you haue but too much, and which daily commeth to your hands, seeing the great number of bookes which are vowed vnto you, which maketh me stedfastlie to beleeue, that if you receiued them ill, and gaue them euill countenance, there would not be so many addressed vnto you; neither should you be so followed by the muses, which flie all those which hate them: in the meane time, I beseech you to accept in good part my humble deuotion, which I offer at the feete of your greatnes, which I pray our good God (my Lord) long to preserue by his grace, and to graunt you <hi>Nestors</hi> yeares, according to the desire of all the gentle wits in France: from Paris the last of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember. 1584.</p>
