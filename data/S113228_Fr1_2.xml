   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Litle thought of printing this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, when I preach't it, much lesse of dedicating it to your Worship, after I had resolued to print it. But I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded vnto the one, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="3"/>
of my freinds and audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (who do better conceit of it then I my selfe): and I am emboldned vnto the other; first, <hi>quadam affinitate, by some small alliance,</hi> which makes me to presume more vpon you, then vpon any other. Secondly, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of your Worships loue towards vertue &amp; learning, which, as most men say, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds your greatnesse: and herein you do no whit dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate from your Ancestors and forefathers, whose loue vnto learning did so abound, that their famous and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table deeds, (of which both
<pb facs="3"/>
the Vniuersitie of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and many other places, can testifie) do aeternize their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, in the Register of euer-liuing fame: There let them liue, and may your Worship continue in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their foot-steps, that your vertues may as long continue also after your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequies. And as I am bold to present vnto you this smal gift, this plaine <hi>Looking glasse;</hi> so I humbly intreat your Worship, as willingly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, and to looke in it, that being shrouded in the chamber of so worthy a Gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tleman, it may be kept from
<pb facs="4"/>
being cracked by the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations of censorious tongues. So shall I remaine</p>
