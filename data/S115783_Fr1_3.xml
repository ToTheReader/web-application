   <head>❧ A briefe ingresse to the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst all sortes of studies, and labors belonging to the lyfe of man, as there is none comparable to the searching of holy scriptures: so in reading thereof di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent regard ought to be had. First with what minde, and to what end a man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them. Secondly in what sence, and after what meaning he vnderstandeth them. Touching the first, as the scriptures, and word of God of his nature is holy: so is it requisite no man to resort thereunto, otherwise then with an holy minde: nor to read them, but to a blessed purpose. That is, to profite in a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall intelligence: to learne the true will, and worshippe of God in his word: to encrease in fayth: and to search out the kingdome of lyfe.</p>
   <p>This done, the second consideration is to be had, for the true sence, and right vnderstāding of the same. Some there be, and that not a few, who entering the studye of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred scriptures, haue not all peraduēture the right meaning of the holy ghost therein conteined. The good Enuch in the Actes of the Apostles, was well occupied in his kouche, reading the propheticall scriptures, yet he vnderstode not what he red, before an expositor was sent him. Thapostles themselues had the scriptures, and red them: yet how farre from the meaning thereof were they, before their senses were opened? So the Iewes, and Saracens to this day doe haunt the scriptures, but for lacke of trew vnderstanding, in what blindenes do they yet remaine? They which in reading the misticall scriptures, do see nothing els but the literall sence, and outward history therof, though they thinke to see something, yet in very deed see nothing. Albeit I denay not, but in the externe letter, and historye of the ould testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is a certen veritie of thinges so doon, as in the letter is specified: yet vnder the same letter, and historicall truth, lyeth an other more secret, and misticall truth, which must be opened. For as the scriptures of the former testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were written most by the prophets, so haue they
<pb facs="8"/>
no doubt, a propheticall meaning. And as all the scriptures were inspired by the holy spirite of God, so carye they a spirituall vnderstanding secretly couered vnder the visible letter.</p>
   <p>As for example the eating of the Apple, and casting out of paradise: the slaughter of Abell, by his brother Caine: The floud, and Arke of Noah: the promised blessing in the seede of Abraham: The vnknowen generation of Melchisddech both king, and priest: The sonne of Abraham, geuen, and borne by promise, with the inheritaunce cast vpon him: The whole discourse, &amp; story of Ioseph: The tipicall lambe, with his bloud sprinckled, and bones vnbroken: The pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage through the red sea: The hard rocke gushing out in water springes: Manna: The brasen serpent: The whole course and lyfe of Moses: The land of promise: The workes and death of Sampson: The victorie of Gedeon: The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Dauid: The tabernacle, and temple of Salomon, with the propitiatory, and the Arke: The rapting vp of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as: The casting vp of Ionas: Yea the geuing also of the lawe it selfe, in outward tables, vpon the penticoste day, that is, fifty dayes after the deliueraunce. These I say, with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber such other thinges moe, which from time to time, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened amongest that people, although in fact, and historye they beare a truth in deed: yet notwithstanding, vnder the same historicall truth, as vnder a vaile, or curten lyeth hid other matter of higher misteries, and greater priuities: which if they be well discussed, shal rapt a mans minde into more perfect knowledge, of spirituall contemplation. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we read, to happen to S. Austen by hearing Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose expounding the miseries conteined in the oulde testament.</p>
   <p>So that the propheticall Scriptures may well be resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, in a maner, to the person of their owne maister, that is, to Christ himselfe. Who being here in earth, if a man looke onely vpon his outward shape: his humble poore estate in this world: his quiet, and simple demaynour: his paynefull trauailes, the manifold afflictions, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his werisome lyfe: his sharpe crosse, and reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death, and looke no further, he shall see no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te in him But draw this curtaine of flesh a little, and with a further insight vew well what lyeth within, and ther
<pb facs="9"/>
shall appeare an other manner of matter: There shalt thou behold the glory of the kingdome of God, the admirable wisedome, and omnipotent power of the Father, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of Sathā, hell, and the whole world, with all the pride thereof, and the fulnes of the deitie, there corporally dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as S. Paul himselfe both did see, and testifie. In much lyke sort, the scriptures writtē, and inspired by God, if they be sought for no further, but for the literall meaning only, or outward precepts of lyfe, they little auaile to saluation. But if the misticall tipes, and manifest oracles of the law, Psalmes, and prophets be thorowly opened, what light, what lyfe, what knowledge geue they? without which I see not, how the fayth of a Christian man can stand sound and sure. And therfore the Lord himselfe, whē he would geue fayth to his disciples, either opened the scriptures vnto thē, or els opened their eyes, to vnderstand the scriptures.</p>
   <p>And therefore, Doct. <hi>Vrbanus Regius,</hi> thauthor of this treatise, is well worthy of thankes, and commendation, for this his labor, in opening to vs such scriptures, as the Lord Iesus appeareth in his talke to haue opened to his two disciples going to Emaus. And in lyke respect, no lesse commendation also is of his part deserued, and of our part to be recounted, to this our good brother, and learned scholemaister, Hilton, who at request hath taken paines to translate the same, into our english countrye speach, for the better instructiō of such, as haue not ben brought vp in the skill of the Latine tongue. Accept therefore well in worth gentle reader, the laborious trauaile of this godly man, &amp; read it as the Lord shal geue thee time, and leasure: vpon a more fruitfull matter, thou canst not employ thy diligence. For when all other thinges shall faile thee, onely fayth in Iesus the Lord, is that must saue thee, both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and soule. Read and pray. The Lord Iesus heare thy prayers, and blesse thy reading. Amen.</p>
