   <head>THE AVTHOR TO the gentle Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, the speciall cause indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing me to take in hand this worke, and to bring my can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle lighted into the glorious Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine of this age, and to publish the same to the view of this famous common-wealth, was, that I haue seene &amp; heard, with griefe of heart, in many places whither I haue come, wicked and vnquiet liuing betweene man &amp; wife: the which caused me many a time to consult with my selfe, how I might be a meanes to reforme the same. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered and thought with my selfe, that many wanted meanes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb facs="3"/> one to another, and that there was no booke extant of this subiect in English; and that for want of meanes many haue liued igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, and so of necessity wickedly and discontentedly together, to the dishonor of God, the offence and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill example of others, the losse of their credits, the wasting of their goods, the corrupting of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and seruants; and finally to the consuming of their owne bodies; yea many to the destroying of their soules for euermore. The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of these things moued me not to delay, but speedily to seeke out a remedy for them. And I pray God grant, that euery one that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the aforesaid disease, when as this booke shall come to their hands, may apply it effectually vnto themselues, that so they may expell the poisoned malice of their cankered hearts. And all these pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents I would haue to marke, that the
<pb facs="3"/> more they giue way vnto their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or rather vnnaturall affections, the more they shall be tainted with the horrible vices whereto they are addicted. And againe, the more they are infected with them, the more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous poyson their children shall draw from them, not onely whiles they are in their mothers wombe, but also much more afterwards by their euill examples. And howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it is little regarded that children can be infected with the parents dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position while they are in the wombe: yet dayly experience doth shew, that as they are formed and proportioned in body much like vnto their parents, so likewise in their nature and affections. Now therefore though thou hast small regard of thy selfe, yet for thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens sake, which are the fruit of thy body, take heed, obserue and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise good counsell herein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; which if thou doest, I make no
<pb facs="4"/> doubt but thou shalt be a meanes to saue both thy selfe &amp; many others: And moreouer, pondering these things deeply with my selfe, as I said, I called vnto remembrance a Dialogue betweene two women to this effect, written in Latine by the reuerend learned man <hi>Erasmus;</hi> and thinking it was not in English, I thought to publish the same in our mother tongue for the benefite of my countrymem: but after consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering further, that that onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned women, yea and that they might attaine to all that which hee counselleth there, and yet be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; I haue added thereunto the substance of faith and repentance, with diuers other particular poynts and examples, though briefly; which being practised, are sufficient to life eternall. And moreouer, lest men by reading the former part of this booke, which teacheth the duty of wiues, should domineere too much
<pb facs="4"/> ouer them, I haue shewed them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the later part thereof, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they owe to their wiues, drawne from plaine proofes, reasons and arguments of holy Scripture; so that they may both learne how to behaue themselues each to other, and both of them to God, as they ought. And now if thou shalt reape profite from thence, as I hope thou shalt, except the fault be in thy selfe, giue glory to God, &amp; counsel to thy neighbours, as time and oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is offered: and in so doing, I doubt not but God will giue a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vnto thee &amp; thy directions; and by this meanes thou shalt be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of a publicke and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all good, not onely in making good parents, but they by thy meanes also shall make good children, and good seruants: and this by Gods blessing shal successiuely go on from age to age, euen to the end of the world: and so by this meanes good
<pb facs="5"/> parents which are scarce, shall bee multipled to the increase of Gods Church, and the flourishing estate of the common-wealth. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know this, that good parents are speciall instruments to make godly children, and good seruants; and godly children and good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants will make religious men and women; and religious men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mē doth make a flourishing church, and famous common-weale, set forth Gods glory, and establish the Princes kingdome. Therefore I pray thee consider, and lay it vnto heart, what a common and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all good this peace-making is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene married couples. Therefore by this premised, euery one may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily see how necessary, comfortable, and commodious this little booke may bee through Gods blessing, to all sorts of men (high and low, rich and poore, religious and prophane) that some may teach, and some may
<pb facs="5"/> learne, and all reape profite one by another. And now gentle reader, if thou finde any slips herein, as haply thou maist, I pray thee couer them with thy courtesie. Accept of my good wil, &amp; receiue that with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to God which may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to thy selfe; and if I shal heare that it shal be courteously receiued, and carefully practised, it shall bee a meanes through Gods fauour, to stirre me vp to attempt a greater worke, that shall be more profitable both for the Church of Christ, and my deare country, for the wealth of both which I onely desire to liue, and to haue maintenance to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest my loue and duty which I owe vnto them.</p>
   <p>But because I will not bee tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the preface, I will conclude, lest I weary thee before thou come to the Conference. Onely this I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of thee, that thou wilt not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begin to reade the booke, but
<pb facs="6"/> reade it to the end. And howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer some things may seeme vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorie vnto thee at the first: yet I feare not but in fine thou shalt finde it profitable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. And thus I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thee and all thy good exercises to the blessing of the Almighty.</p>
