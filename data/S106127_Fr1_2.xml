      <hi>Halcyons</hi> daies of peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, haue reason to reserue some time for the solemnizing this peaceble Armour of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories; where we may see in what bonds of due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and affection wee are tied to the Almighty, not onely in hauing preserued vs from many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile incursions, but in his continuing of his loue towards vs, wee cannot well dijudicate of comforts but in relation of discomforts: Nor is peace with so generall acceptance entertained by any, as by them who haue sustained the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of warre. Many precedent experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments haue wee had, and this Ile hath tasted of misery with the greatest, and now reuiued in her selfe, should acknowledge her miraculous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, as not proceeding from her owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but deriued from the supreme influence of heauen, whose power is able to erect, support, demolish, &amp; lay wast as he pleaseth: <hi>Hinc Timor, Hinc Amor.</hi> Hence wee haue argument of

Feare and Loue.

Wee should recollect our selues, and benefite our vngratefull mindes with these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations: that our present felicity be not bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the ruines of a succeeding calamity. These Histories (my Noble Lord) bee the best representments of these motiues. And in peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing discourses of this nature (next to the Sacred Word of God) we are strangely transported aboue humane apprehension, seeing the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable foundations of Common-weales plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (to mans thinking) in the port of security, wonderfully ruinated: Grounding their dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon some precedent crying sinne, which laid their honour in the dust, and translated their Empire to some (perchance) more deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing people.

This <hi>Suruey</hi> (my Lord) haue I presumed to Dedicate to your Honour, not for any meriting discourse which it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends, but for the generality of the Subiect: Your protection will raise it aboue it selfe, and make me proud to haue an Issue so highly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized: it presents it selfe with feare, may it be admitted with Honour: So shall my labours be in all duety to your fauour deuoted, my prayers exhibited, and my selfe confirmed</p>
