   <head>The Author to the Reader.</head>
   <p>THe ancient workemen in times past (as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> affirmeth) dedicated their workes and Buildings to the gods, according to their natures, strength or weakenesse; so is the forme called Dorica ascribed to the gods, <hi>Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and valiant <hi>Hercules,</hi> taking such formes from strong men. The forme called Ionica, is ascribed to the goddesse <hi>Diana, Apollo</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> as of the nature of Matrons, that is, of wise &amp; sensible women, which are both tender and strong: for <hi>Diana,</hi> by her femurine nature is tender, but by vsing to hunt, shee is strong: <hi>Apollo,</hi> by reason of his beauty, is tender; but being a man, he is strong: the like of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> But the Corinthia is taken of ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ds, and they ascribe all to the goddesse <hi>Vesta,</hi> and her chaste mayds: yet at this time I thinke it good to procéed in another sort, nothing differing from the ancients afore sayd. My meaning is, to follow the maner and customes of the Christians, that I (as far as I may) will ascribe holy Buildings to God and to his Saints: and profane buildings, as well publicke as priuote, I will ascribe to men according to their professions. So say I then, that the Thuscan maner (after my opinion) is fit for strengths, for Gates of Cities, Townes and Castles, places for treasure, munition and Artillery to kéepe them in▪ for prisons, hauens of the Sea, and such like things, seruing for the warres. It is true, that rusticke and playns worke, that is, such Buildings as are made of rough stones, and others that are made somewhat smoother, according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which the Stone-cutters take therein, are sometimes mixed with Dorica, and sometimes with Dorica and Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia. Neuertheles, for that the Thuscan order is the roughest set foorth, farre more then the other are, I am of opinion, that the Country Bulding is more like vnto the Thuscan, then any of the rest: which you may playnely sée to haue béene obserued by the Thuscans, as wel in their chiefe Cities and Townes of <hi>Florence,</hi> as without in their Country Villages, in so many rich and fayre Buildings, made after the rusticall maner, as may be séene in all Christendome, mixed with such a slight manner of worke, as the workeman thought good. Therefore I conclude, that such Buildings are more agréeable to Thuscan order, then any other. Therefore, altering somewhat from Antiquities, and some others of ours, I will in diuers sorts shewe of such workes, <hi>viz.</hi> how to make Gates of Cities, Townes, or Forts; as also, in publike and priuate places, Houses, Galleries, Windowes, Niches or seates, hollowed in worke, Bridges, Water-courses, and such like seuerall Ornaments, as may happen into a workemans hands to doe. Men may also (not differing from the ancient rules) mixe this rusticall maner with the Dorica, and also with Ionica; and sometimes with Corinthia, at the pleasure of those that se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ke to please their owne fantasies, which a man may affirme to bee more for pleasure then profit: therefore the workeman ought to procéede with good aduice, especially in publike buildings, wherein comelinesse is commendable.</p>
   <p>In the beginning of this Booke, I obserued the Comedians order, who (when they intend to play any Comedy) first send out a Prologue, who in few wordes giueth the audience to vnderstand what they intend to entreat of, in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. So I, meaning in this Booke to entreat of fiue maner of Buildings, <hi>viz.</hi> Thuscan, Dorica, Ionica, Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia and Composita, haue thought good, that in the beginning thereof, men should sée the Figures of all the seueral kinds whereof I purpose to entreat of. And although that in the Columnes and their ornaments, all the measures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions are not set downe, but onely the principall, by generall rules; yet will I not fayle, as occasion shall serue, to set them downe in particularities: but this is done, as I sayde, to shew in generall rules for an Introduction onely, the better to be vnderstood of euery workeman, and in the beginning will obserue <hi>Vitruuius</hi> order and termes, marked on the sides with <hi>A. B. C.</hi> that euery workeman may name them according to his country spéech. And first, the Stilo bato, or Thuscan Pedestall, I meane the flat, without Crowne or Base, shall bee a perfect fouresquare. The perfect Dorica shall be as much more as the drawing of a liue from corner to corner, of the perfect fouresquare, placing it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. The Pedestall Ionica, shall be of one fouresquare and an halfe: the Pedestall Corinthia, shall be a fouresquare and two third parts thereof. The Pedestall Composita shall bee of two perfect fouresquares. Also, wonder not, that the Chapter next ensuing is the fist, which others would estéeme the first; for that the first Booke doeth contayn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> a Chapter of Geometry: the second of Perspectiue, shall be of two Chapters: the third of Antiquities, shal be of one Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which maketh foure Chapters: so that, this considered, the next shall be the fist.</p>
