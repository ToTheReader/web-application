   <head>The Publisher hereof to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Reader, of what rank or
degree soever.</head>
   <p>BEloved, I (<hi>qualis quisque sum</hi>) travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and residing, ef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>soones, about
my lawfull negotiations in divers Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine
places, both in France, Germanie,
and the Netherlands, have done, and do
observe in the truly Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in all those Countries, That they all,
as it were with an unanimous consent, do
abandon in their Congregations, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
bodily <hi>bowing, capping, crowching,
oringiug at the Name or naming of Jesus,</hi>
and their Ministers do hold it to be an
ignorant practise, and impious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie:
Yea, I dare be bold to say, all the
rest of the purely Reformed Churches in
Christendome are of like unanime Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and practise. And I having, not
without Divine Providence, obteined the
Manuscript, which by the same Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
have passed the Presse, do here
communicate &amp; present unto your view
the <hi>Opinion, Iudgement, and Determination</hi>
      <pb n="61" facs="31"/>
of a Pair of reverend and learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of our owne Church, members of
our two famous Vniversities, (the one of
Cambridg, the other of Oxford) concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the same <hi>bovving, capping, crowching,</hi>
&amp; <hi>cringing at the nam of Iesus:</hi> which letter
and Treatise I confesse and professe, have
given me and some Christian freinds of
mine aboundant satisfaction in the point.
Our latter learned Authour calls them
that so much use &amp; plead for it, not unpro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perly,
<hi>Ceremonialists</hi> you may easily know
them; They are all for <hi>Ceremonie,</hi> naught
for <hi>sinceritie;</hi> like the Apples of Sodome,
<hi>all shevv, no substance;</hi> somewhat like unto
painted sepulchres, <hi>glorious without, rotten
within;</hi> Not much unlike a fantasticall
Picture, which this Age hath produced,
<hi>all belly, Nobody;</hi> nor much unlike the
Datestone, <hi>all shell, no-kernell;</hi> Even so are
these men, (like Baalls consening Priests)
all for <hi>externall vvillworship an adoration,</hi>
preferring it before <hi>internall &amp; spirituall
true worship &amp; devotion:</hi> though the Holy
Ghost hath plainly said: <hi>God will be served
in spirit &amp; in truth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb n="62" facs="32"/>
Yea, some of their Lives and Doctrines
do declare, as if (we may doubt) they
wished that <hi>that</hi> and other sacred <hi>Texts of
Holy-writ</hi> for <hi>inward sinceritie</hi> were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated,
and as if they drew all their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
and devotions out of the large vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
entituled <hi>Ceremoniale Romanae Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae.
O Fearefull! O Tempora! O Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res!</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And hath indeed my learned Authour
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rmed them <hi>Ceremonialists?</hi> I hope, I
may, without offence, change two Letters
in the word, and theu they are just <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall-astes,</hi>
or <hi>asses</hi> rather. All which
so much use and advocate for the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
use of this <hi>Ceremonie</hi> of <hi>bowing,
capping, &amp;c.</hi> (and are readie to cry downe
<hi>preaching,</hi> alleaging <hi>it is no part of Gods
Worship,</hi> with other grosse erronious
points; and, squaring the word with the
crooked squire of their own Inventions,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 9</note>
      <hi>teach,</hi> indeed, for <hi>Doctrines the Traditions
and Precepts of Men.</hi>) I challenge,
charge, and adjure them, or any of them,
whether Bishop, Doctor, Parson, Vicar,
Priest, Curate, or Chaplaine, in the Name


<pb n="63" facs="32"/>
of the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> (which they so super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiously
abuse) as they will once answer
at his Tribunall, either punctually to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
(with the spirit of meeknesse, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Gods Word be their Warrant,
Touchstone, or Vmper) these precedent
Tractates; (They need not doubt of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
License at London House) Or els,
to recant their Superstitious and Erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Doctrines, and practises; or, at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to leave pleading for Baall: And I
desire all other moderate minded Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to be satisfied in the controverted
point: But, <hi>if any list stil to be contentious,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 16.</note>
I must answer them, <hi>we have no such cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
neither the churches of God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And besides the Opinion, Iudgement,
and Determination of these two reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Divines, doubtlesse you may have
seen allready published, the learned and
accute <hi>Layick</hi> of <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> (that hath<note place="margin">Mr. W. P.</note>
stood so stoutly, and written so piously &amp;
profoundly in defence of the Orthodox
Doctrine of the Church of England,
against Papists, Arminians, and all other
Eunemies of the Church,) his opinion,


<pb n="64" facs="33"/>
judgement, and discussion, also in this
point of <hi>bovving, capping, crovvching,</hi> and
<hi>cring at the name of Iesus:</hi> And a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Cord (I trow) is not easily broke:
I cannot but equallize his writing with
these two Divines: And though I have,
I thinke I need not challenge an answer
to them or him, seeing now my second
cogitations tells me, that both theirs and
his, are alltogether unanswerable (for I
hold <hi>Widdows</hi> nor <hi>Page,</hi> to be any direct
answeres to the point but the one a Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and the other a Sophister. And they
not answering, I say, directly and punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
to the Premisses, I professe (whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I am) if ever I be called from the
Hagh in <hi>Holland</hi> to Pauls Crosse, will
there proolame: That all those <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
asses</hi> are silenced, gravelled, and can
not answere, and therefore ought to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to the Premisses. But me thinks
I heare still some of them mumbling, that
these precedent Authours, nor the others
by them cited, are sufficient to stop their
mouths, and stay their practise; Then let
me have leave to propose to them, That,


<pb n="65" facs="33"/>
That if the matter may be putt for the
voyces or hands to the Clergie-men, I
dare pawne my deerest life, that most,
or the greatest part of Bishops, Doctors,
and other Divines of the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
will subscribe to our-learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours:
And that will be doubtlasse <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
superque.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The superstitious Ephesians we know
cried <hi>Great is</hi> (the Goddesse) <hi>Diana of
the Ephesians:</hi> So we may say, <hi>Great is the
Goddesse Dotage</hi> of these <hi>Ceremonial asses.</hi>
Whom therefore we must leave to S.
<hi>Pauls Doome,</hi> alleaged by our first learned
Authour in his Conclusion.</p>
   <p>Yet for all this, let me not be mistaken,
that I doe by the promisses, in approving
these learned and pious Authours, Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
&amp; discussions out of Gods Word,
in this point, disapprove or dislike (allto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
the Ceremonies of our Church;
For, as they are conformable to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Ceremonies, so I am perswaded there
is a moderate laudable use of them, so a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
they that use them, doe them <hi>for decencie
&amp; in order,</hi> according to S. Pauls Precept.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="66" facs="34"/>
Our last learned Authour, at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of his Treatise, asketh the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites
a Question: In like manner, if these
<hi>Ceremoniall-asses</hi> would give me leave, I
would aske them an other; and that is:
whether our Common Beggars, when
they aske, beg and iterate for <hi>Iesus sake,</hi>
which sacred Name they take in vaine
(though many of their numberlesse num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
know neither God nor Christ Iesus
his Sonne) perhapps 100. or 1000.
times in a day, whether, I say, we that hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
them, be bound to <hi>bow, cap, crowch, cring,</hi>
or no?</p>
   <p>And so, beloved reader, if thou reapes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
any contentment by this twofold Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
give God the Glorie, the Authour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
