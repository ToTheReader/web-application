   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is high time to search in what corner
of the Church the fire is kindled, being
crept so far, as that with the verie smoke
the consciences of diuers are smothered.
It is found that certaine <hi>Martins,</hi> if no
miscreants in religion (which wee may
suspect) yet without doubt malecōtents
(which wee ought to feare) haue throwen fire, not into the
Church porch, but into the Chauncell, and though not able
by learning and iudgement to displace a Sexton, yet seeke to
remooue Bishops. They haue scattered diuers libels, all so
taunting and slanderous, as it is hard to iudge, whether their
lyes exceed their bitternesse, or their bitternesse their fables.</p>
   <p>If they be answered by the grauitie of learned Prelates,
they presentlie reply with railings; which argueth their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be as farre frō the truth of deuotion, as their writings
from mildnes of spirit. It is said that camels neuer drinke,
til they haue troubled the water with their feete, &amp; it seemes
these <hi>Martins</hi> cannot carouse the sapp of the Church, till by
faction they make tumults in religion. Seeing thē either they
expect no graue replie, or that they are settled with railing
to replie; I thought it more conuenient, to giue them a whisk
with their owne wand, than to haue them spurd with dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
learning.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Scithian</hi> slaues, though they bee vp in armes, must
bee tamde with whippes, not swords, and these mutiners in
Church matters, must haue their mouthes bungd with iests,
not arguments.</p>
   <p>I seldome vse to write, and yet neuer writ anie thing, that
in speech might seeme vndecent, or in sense vnhonest; if here
I haue vsed bad te<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>mes, it is because they are not to bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
with good tearmes: for whatsoeuer shall seeme lauish
in this Pamphlet, let it be thought borrowed of <hi>Martins</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb facs="5"/>
These <hi>Martins</hi> were hatcht of addle egges, els could
they not haue such idle heads. They measure conscience by
their owne yard, and like the theeues, that had an yron bed,
in which all that were too long they would cut euen, all that
were too short they would stretch out, and none escapte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rackt
or vnsawed, that were not iust of their beds length: so
all that are not <hi>Martins,</hi> that is, of their peeuish mind, must
be measured by them. If he come short of their religion, why
he is but a colde Protestant, hee must bee pluckt out to the
length of a Puritane. If any be more deuout than they are,
as to giue almes, fast, and pray, then they cut him off close by
the workes, and say he is a Papist. If one be not cast in <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi>
mould, his religion must needes mould. He saith he is a
Courtier, I thinke no Courtier so peruerse, that seeing the
streight rule of the Church, would goe about to bend it. Jt
may be he is some Iester about the Court, and of that I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
because I know all the fooles there, and yet cannot gesse
at him. What euer he be, if his conscience be pind to his cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance,
J will account him more politicke than religious,
and more dangerous for ciuill broyles, than the Spaniard
for an open warre. I am ignorant of <hi>Martin</hi> and his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer,
but my conscience is my warrant, to care for neither.
For I knowe there is none of honour so carelesse, nor any in
zeale so peeuish, nor of nature any so barbarous, that wil suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor
those that be suckers of the Church, a thing against God
and policie; against God, in subuerting religion; against po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
in altering gouernment, making in the Church, the
feast of the <hi>Lapithees,</hi> where all shall bee throwne on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
head, because euerie one would be the head. And these
it is high time to tread vnder foote: for who would not
make a threshold of those, that go about to make the Church
a barne to thresh in. <hi>Itaque sic disputo.</hi>
