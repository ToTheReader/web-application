   <head>VVhat ceremonie euerie woman ought by Gods <hi>word to vse in the time of praier,</hi> publike or priuate.</head>
   <bibl>1. Corinth. chapter II, verse. 4, &amp;c.</bibl>
   <p>
      <hi>EVerle man praieng or prophesieng, hauing anie thing on his head, dishonoureth (God) his head: but euerie woman that praieth or prophesieth bare headed, dishonoureth (hir husband) hir head. For it is euen one verie thing as though she were shauen.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Therefore if the woman be not couered, let hir also be shorne; and if it be a shame for a woman to be shorne or polled (as in deed it is) then (for shame) let hir be couered (and keepe hir haire trussed vp vnder a kercher.)</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>For a man ought not to couer his head (but ought to be polled and bare, for somuch as he is the image and glorie of God, in whom his maiestie and power dooth shine, concerning his authoritie ouer his wife, and other of Gods creatures subiected vnder his dominion and rule.)</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>But the woman is the glorie of the man (or receiueth hir glorie in commendation of man, and therefore is subiect:) for the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the man created for the womans sake; but the woman for the mans sake.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Therefore ought the woman to haue power on hir head (that is, some thing to couer hir head in signe of subiection, bicause of the angels, to whom also they shew their dissolution and shame, and not onelie to Christ and his church, or congregation where they praie.)</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Iudge you in your selues also, is it comelie that a woman praie vnto God bare headed? Dooth not nature it selfe teach you, that if a man haue long haire like a woman, it is a shame vnto him: but if a woman haue long haire, it is a praise vnto hir: for hir haire is giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hir for a couering (and to the end she should trusse it vp about hir head: to declare that she must couer hir head.)</hi>
      <q>
         <p>But if anie man list to be contentious, we haue no such custome, neither the church of God.</p>
