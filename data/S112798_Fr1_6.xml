   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou may perhaps wonder <hi>(gentle Reader)</hi> to see mee adde this little abortive to the importunate spawne of so many Bookes, which (as the Souldiers of <hi>Cadmus</hi>) rise up, and iussle each other, appearing and perishing in a moment. And truly J must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that this conceit had almost perswaded mee to commit Paricide, and (as the <hi>Lamias</hi>) to smother mine owne Creature in his Cradle. For it being perhaps like those untimely Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which according to Physicall tenets are not vitall: it had beene more advantagious for him to have received death with Patience, than to have expected it with Apprehension: specially since parents have absolute power of
<pb facs="7"/>life and death over the babes of their braine, and that in this case onely, a voluntary death may with honour prevent, an ignominious end. But fatherly affection taking advice in favour of his children, hath suppressed this first motion, perswading me it tasted more both of Humanity and conveniencie to abandon it, than to kill it. Now whether Reason hath rightly advised me, or Selfe-love deceived mee, I blame not my Friend. If any fault bee committed, I desire not they should beare the blame, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expose it to thy Iudgement, and lay it open to thy mercie: It may happen upon the like good Fortune as those forlorne children doe, whose hazard often proves more advantagious to them than their Parents providence; their Fates relieving the infelicitie of their birth: but howsoever it shall please God to dispose there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>I</hi> dedicate it to his Honour, and thy service, and the designe it hath to become usefull to those who please to entertaine it, will (as <hi>I</hi> hope) cause it to deserve from them, if not praise, yet at least favour and pardon. The subiect is not new, as touching the matter, but onely in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, order, stile, and way of handling the
<pb facs="7"/>same. Now to the end to deliver thee a just account of my designe, and that you may know what you are to expect from mee in this worke, and how I proceed; I am to let you understand that here <hi>I</hi> speake of the <hi>Politicall Art,</hi> as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> did of the <hi>Oratorial,</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore,</hi> where he rather treateth of the Eloquent, than of Eloquence; of the Orator than of this Art: so my obiect in this discourse doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly touch upon the Art of <hi>Policy,</hi> but on the <hi>Politicke</hi> person; not on the matter, but the man, not on the Formes, Lawes, or Maximes of States, but on the vertues and qualities pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for him who governes by his Councell, or by administring Iustice, under the Authority of asoveraigne. Now since God is the finall end of man, and consequently whatsoever concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth man, the soule and body, the spirituall and temporall, ought equally to ayme at God: and for the taking a true sight, to receive the rule and conduct thereof from his divine Law, I therefore consider <hi>Politicke</hi> Vertues, with the Order, habitude, and reference they ought to have to this finall end. Since humane Society, whether Ecclesiasticall, or Civill, ought onely to
<pb facs="8"/>tend to the happy societie of Saints, and that in vaine the Ecclesiasticall part endeavoreth to draw them thereto, if the Civile divere them.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>The Name.</hi> Arist. Non est amicitia inter Deum &amp; homines.</note> The same Subiect giveth it the Name of <hi>Christian Politicks;</hi> for the Pagan Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers who have treated upon this Subiect, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not acknowledged God as the finall End of man, but holding there could not be any amity or correspondency betweene two so infinitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand: they have therefore not referred, either civill society, or the direction thereof to this end. So that <hi>Christians,</hi> who knowing and adoring the true God, and apprehending by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation his great love towards us, and how he being our Center and Beatitude, we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre all to him: cannot in this case finde in the Books of the ancient Sages, any exact, or perfect rule herein, but are to deduce their principles from a higher spring, and to levell their marke at the true obiect, if they desire to draw a true and direct line. Besides (as the Apostle saith) <hi>IESVS CHRIST is the onely Corner stone, that ought to be placed:</hi> which is to be understood, not onely of what concerneth
<pb facs="8"/>Faith, but of whatsoever belongeth to manners, life, administration of Offices, and conduct of affaires.</p>
   <p>The order and division of this Discourse fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the nature and quality of the subiect; and as the <hi>Politicke</hi> life consisteth not but in Action; and since in euery Action three things are necessarie, that is to say, What we are to do, our Will, and Power to effect the same: so doe I divide all my Worke into three parts. The first, whereof treateth of the qualities causing the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, to know what is requisite or profitable for publicke good. The second speaketh of such parts as are fitting for the perfectionating the honestie, and integritie to will, and desire the good hee knoweth. The last discourse to of such sufficiencies as adde vigor towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction thereof. The Wisdome, Love, and Power of God go verneth all things on Earth. The light, heat, and force of the Sunne inspire soule and life into all this Elementary World. Wisdom, Goodnesse, and Power, are the three motions in <hi>Policy.</hi> These are the three darts of <hi>Iupiters</hi> Thunder, the three tines of <hi>Neptunes</hi> Trident, the three Lillies, adorning the Armes of our
<pb facs="9"/>King.<note place="margin">Funiculus triplex diff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

         <hi>The Style.</hi>
      </note> It is the triple cord whereof the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man speaketh, very hardly to be broken.</p>
   <p>As for my stile or way of writing, <hi>I</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to follow the iudgement of that Romane, who sayes, <hi>The most efficacious way of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or writing is to ioyne Eloquence to VVisedome, perswasive words, to firm and solyde reasons.</hi> And in this sort have all the Antients proceeded, not Ethnicks onely, but the first Fathers, likewise of the Greeke and Latine Church. The meerely Scholasticall straine is good, and profitable in other subiects: but in this it would appeare over punctuall and smallie ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill: and the Orator onely adorned with a pomp of ill placed words, tends rather to ostentation than instruction. But when both these, the one having quitted her strictnesse, and roughnesse; the other her colours and curiositie, doe unitedly ioyne (in the same Oration) the one by contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting sinewes, the other ornaments; the one force, the other lively Graces; the one what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth, the other what pleaseth; they iointly yeeld what severally they are unable to affoord: Flowers and Fruit Pleasure and Profit. But though <hi>I</hi> be farre from attayning this point; yet
<pb facs="9"/>have I (at least) endeavoured to approch: It being sufficient glory for me to have known and followed the better forme. Those who onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rhapsodies of resemblances, adaptations, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, and heaped Authorities, who frame not a body, but a monster of discourse, shall not perad venture finde here wherewith to satisfie their conceptions. For I will at first confesse I have not imployed my time in searching com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places, nor in turning over the tables of Bookes, to swell my volumes with the spoyles of others. The precise and necessary authorities for the proofe of what <hi>I</hi> speake see me to me suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, leaving superfluities to those who are at bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leasure to transcribe whole Authors, and to cause the world daily to see the Metempsy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chosis or transmigration not of Soules from one bodie to another, but of bookes from one paper to another. Or to imitate that Romane Emperour, who appropriated to himselfe the pourtraicts of the gods, by onely taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the head and title, substituting his owne in their stead. Besides, <hi>I</hi> will not defend this Booke from the Tongues of Zoiles, and detractors, (as ordinarilymen doe) since it
<pb facs="10"/>were a vanity couched under pretext of Feare, to suppose so small a Work as this, were worthy to be assaulted, and a meere fancie to forge Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and as in Theaters to arme them with intention to assaile them. It were too presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous an attemp, and no lesse than to usurpe not upon the persons onely, but even upon the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of a more violent Empire than that of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, should <hi>I</hi> seeke to force the liberty of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with purpose to subject and captivate them to private opinions. Let therefore (who please approve of what I write, or reject it who list. Let every man remaine free in his owne conceipt, permitting me to rest at liberty in my good and honest intention, inciting me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute my poore endeavors to Gods glory, and publick utilitie.</p>
