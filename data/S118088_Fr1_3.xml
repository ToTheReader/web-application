      </gap> to be counted feeling members, hath bene very troublous frō the beginning of the world, not like vnto the estate of <hi>Moab</hi> setled vpon her dregs, &amp; not powred out from vessell to ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, Ierem: 48. 11. yet the more afflicted, the more beloued of God. Whose face watred with teares is faire, and whose mourning voyce is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in the sight of God, Cantic. 2. 14. And like as doing of good willingly hath a great recompense of reward from God: eucn so patient suffering of euill for righteousnes sake is highly commended in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and richly rewarded in heauen. Yea the very Ethnicke Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher <hi>PLATO</hi> (to whome the glorie of the sufferings for Christ was vnknowne) affirmeth that men who suffer scourging, binding, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, boring out of eyes, and finally strangling of their breath for righteousnes sake, are exceeding happie, or (as the word <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> imports) thrise happie: <hi>PLATO in Repub.</hi> Howbeit the superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue degree of suffering that can bee found amongst the Ethnickes could neuer equall the glorie of the sufferings of Christian people. They who were initiated in the mysteries of <hi>MITHRA</hi> (this word in the <hi>Persian</hi> language signifieth the sunne) could not be admitted to that honour before they had bin tried by suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ring of four score diuerse sorts of tormentes, such as long abstinence from meate and drinke, solitarie liuing in the wildernesse a long time, triall of suffering the feruent heate of fire, and the coldnesse of water, and many other tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vntill the number of four score had bene completely filled out, Nazian, in Iulianum. These voluntarie sufferings, like as in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning they wanted the warrand of Gods calling, so likewise in ende they shall want the hope of Gods reward. But the mouth of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe pronounceth Christians to be blessed who die in the Lord, for they rest from their laboures, and their workes follow them, Apoc. 14 13. The manifold persecutions of the Church, may bee diuided into three ranckes: some of them were fierce and bloody, some were craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the third was and is both cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ll and craftie. The ten Ethnick Emperours, <hi>NERO, DOMITIAN, TRAIAN,</hi> &amp;c. were so prodigall of the blood of the Lordes Saintes, that they powred it out like water vpon the ground. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Emperours were subdolous and craftie, but the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb facs="5"/>
of the Antichrist (which is the third) goeth beyond the rest both in crutltie and craft. The experience we haue had in our own dayes of the crueltie of the supposts of the Antichrist, and their craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie conuey of their malicious interprisesintended against our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lord, his royall race and noble Counsellers doth clear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>y prooue that the malice and craft of the Antichrist goeth as farre beyond the malice &amp; craft of all Emperours, as the flood of <hi>NOAH</hi> goeth beyond the inundation of <hi>Nilus.</hi>

But these are chiefly counted persecutours, who either kindled the fire as <hi>NERO</hi> did, or else by n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>well to the fire, to the ende that the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented flame of the fornace might strike the greater terrour into the heartes of Christians. A short compend of the first ten great persecutions I haue collected out of sundrie authors, whereinto neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie driueth me to write of persecuting Emperours so far as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the historie of the Church, and no further, and of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Christians, specially teachers, against whome the rage of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting Tyrants was most ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>efully bent. The names of the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques also behoued to be remembred, the most malignant vleer that euer bred in the Church of Christ. These are the wandering stars of whome the Apostle Iude speaketh, to whome is reserued the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of darkenesse for euer, Epist. Iud. ver. 13. I haue made litle
<pb facs="5"/>
mention of Councils, except of that famous Councill holden at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> by the Apostles, Acts 15. Prouinciall and nationall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills during the space of the first three h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ndreth yeeres were few in number, by reason of the rage of persecuting Emperours, and some of them that were gathered were obscure, and the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>sse regarded, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their contradiction one to another. There was a Council gathered at <hi>Rome,</hi> another in <hi>Caesarea Palestinae,</hi> another in <hi>France,</hi> the fourth in <hi>Pontus,</hi> and one in <hi>Asia,</hi> all these were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered for one and the selfe same purpose, to deliberate anent the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Pasch day, Euseb. lib. 5 cap. 23. In <hi>Rome VICTOR</hi> was in one opinion, <hi>POLYCRATES</hi> in <hi>Asia</hi> held another opinion, <hi>IRENAEVS</hi> in <hi>France</hi> was wiser then the rest, and was more carefull to keepe vnitie in the Church of Christ, then to dispute contentiously anent kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of dayes. The nationall Councill of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>ARTEMON</hi> and <hi>BERYLLVS,</hi> wherein <hi>ORIGEN</hi> was present. Euseb. hist. eccl. lib, 6. cap. 37. A Councill holden at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>CORNELIVS,</hi> and another in some partes of <hi>Africke</hi> for the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous suppressing of the error of <hi>NOVATVS,</hi> Cyprian, epist. lib. 1. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 2. A notable Councill holden at <hi>Antiochia</hi> against <hi>PAV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IVS SAMOSATENVS</hi> a pernicious heretique, Euseb: lib. 5. cap, 29. All these were gathered for suppressing of heretiques. Some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were gathered by <hi>CYPRIAN B</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> for rebaptising of those who were baptized by heretiques. This weakenesse both in <hi>CYPRIAN</hi> and in other B shops of <hi>Africke</hi> was after corrected by the Church. In the treatises that I haue subjoyned after euery Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, I had regard to discouer the fountaines of errours, that began to spring vp in the first three hundreth yeeres after our Lordes ascension to heauen. Howe ancient so cuer the small beginnings of errours doe seeme, yet are they posterior vnto that wholesome summe of true doctrine deliuered to the worlde by Christe and his Apostles. Who so listeth to vse the like order in all the rest of the Centuries vntill our owne dayes, no necessitie shall driue him to vse <hi>HERODOTES</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest excuse in the description of the riuers of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and <hi>Boristhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> whose fountaines in his dayes were vnknown, and therefore his preterition of a thing vnknown was to be fauourably comported with by the reader: but the welspring of all the rest of popish errors accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of time wherein they began to set foorth their head, may bee as easily pointed out by the finger as these whereof I make
<pb facs="6"/>
mention in the first three hundreth-yeeeres. The R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>etoricall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>NAZIANZENVS</hi> speaking to the deade, and bringing in a virgin crauing helpe at the blessed virgin, the mother of our Lord, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ourageth <hi>LINDANVS</hi> to count invocation of Saintes to be an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Apostolicke tradition. Nazianzenus <hi>in laudem Cypr.</hi> ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> could be not be ignorant that invocation of Saintes began not to take roote before the foure hundreth yeere of our Lord, and that in great weakenesse of doubtsome speaches, <hi>O anima Constantini</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, That is, O soule of <hi>CONSTANTINVS,</hi> if thou hast any sense or feeling, to wit, of things done amongst vs, Nazian. oratione <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>. contraJulianum.</p>
   <p>Therefore the treatise of invocation of Saintes may more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently he subjoyned to the fourth Centurie. The other cause where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue compiled these treatises, is to declare how circumspectly we should beware of the small beginnings of defection from ancient veritie, because the beginning of errour is like vnto a soft vapour ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing out of the sea, thickning in the aire, conuerting into a cloud, and in end sending downe mightie stormes and tempests vpon the earth. Who could haue once imagined that <hi>Natalitia Martyrum</hi> a thing in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> selfe not vnlawfull, could haue turned to that horrible abuse that now is in Poperie, that all these holy. Martyrs are made media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of our intercession? Or who could haue imagined that the reuerent keeping of the reliques of Saints could haue turned in end vnto ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and knceling before them with confidence to be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heard of God? The Lord grant we may beware in time of the beginnings of defections both in doctrine and in maners that haue cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
