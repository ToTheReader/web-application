      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ftervvard God tryed Abrahā,
and sayd vnto him: Abraham.
And he aunsvvered, Here I am.
Then sayd he to him, take thyne

thou louest, &amp; goe into the country of Morea,
&amp; there offer him vp for a burnt sacrifice vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

   <p>Abraham therefore rising earely, sadled
his asse &amp; tooke tvvo seruants vvith him, &amp;
Isaac his sonne. And vvhen he had cut vvood
for the burnt sacrifice, he arose and vvent
to the place that God had told him of. The
third day, Abraham loking vp, savv the place
a farre of, and sayd to his seruaunts, tarry you

the fire and a knife in his ovvne hand, and so
they vvent forth togither. Then sayd Isaac
to Abraham his father. My father. Abraham
aunsvvered, here I am my sonne. And he said,
Beholde here is fire and vvood, but vvhere is
the Lambe for burnt sacrifice. Abraham aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvered,
my sonne, God vvill prouide him a
lambe for burnt sacrifice. And they vvent on
both togither. And vvhen they came to the
place that God had spoken of, he builded an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
there, and layd the vvood in order vppon
it, and then bound Isaac his sonne &amp; laid him
vpon the altar aboue the vvood, and putting
forth his hand cavvght the knife to stryke of
his sonnes necke. Then an Angell of the Lord
cryed vnto him from heauen, saying Abrahā,
Abraham. VVho aunsvvered, loe here I am.
And he sayd vnto him, lay not thy hand vpon
the child, nother doe anything vnto him. For
novv I knovve thou fearest God, seeing thou

hast not spared thine only sōne for my sake. &amp;▪
Abrahā loked vp &amp; savv, &amp; behold a sheep
vvas cavvght behind him in a bush by the
hornes. Then Abraham vvent and tooke the
sheepe, and offered it vp for a burnt offering
in steede of his sonne. And Abraham called
the name of the place, <hi>The Lord shall see.</hi>
VVhereof it is sayd at this day of that moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne,
<hi>The Lord shal be seene.</hi> And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
of the Lord called vnto Abraham from
out of heauen the second tyme, saying: I haue
svvorne by my selfe sayth the Lorde, for as

as the sand on the seas shore, and thy seede
shall possesse the gates of thyne enemies.
And all nations of the earth shall
be blessed in thy seede, because
thou hast obeyed my
voyce.</p>
