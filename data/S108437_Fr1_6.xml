      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained zeale, and dutie I owe vnto the most free, and honorable seruice, and glory of almighty God, hath bred a restles desire, &amp; doubtfull dilemma in my troubled thought, so that euery sence stands a mazed with doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I were better to make knowne the least part of my vnfained and true, repentance, and mine experience, of afflictions in rude, and vnpol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht lines: or else lay open the plaine demostrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my weakenes in this my rash presumption. But the deepe affection I haue, wishing the good of all the Faithfull: And chiefely the praysing, &amp; magnifying of the mercy of Almighty God, hath ouercome all difficillities. I confes my too-too much insufficiencie to attempt to shew mine owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in matters of so great consequence, and of so high a nature. yet I hope the gratiousnes of
<pb facs="7"/>
your mindes will answere the goodnes of my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and that you will rather blame the want of Art, then want of heart. A further motiue that sets forward mine attempts in this busines, was the due consideration of afflictions, and whence they came, I wayed that God may finde sufficient cause in all men (because all men are sinners) yet doth he worke in his punishments, by a geometricall &amp; not an Arithmetic<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ll proportion: laying vppon the strong, the heauier burthen, and on the weake the lighter, and on no man more then he can well beare, I considered the end wherefore the Lord did the same. And I found that they were for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, not distructions, and that he doth often try vs by the crosse to make vs true to his crowne. And from this, by reflection, looking backe to my selfe, who haue had a wofull, large, and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of imprisonment, troubles, crosses, sicknes, and afflictions, and haue past euen the Alphabet of Calamities, to make good vse of them, and to lenifie my griefe, I composed thiese swanlike songs. And because <hi>Bonum quod Communius eo melius,</hi> &amp; euery good guift is of it selfe difusine I thought it the dutie of brotherly loue to make common to all that was comfortable to me, being assured that my rudenes, and rashnes in thiese my willing laboures, can not spot or staine the richnes of beautie and Gods most pretioas and blessed workes: on which I haue endeuoured to imploy my meane capacity in this mine exercise, where the foundation of building is good, the fault is in the Artificer, if the worke want vniformitie, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondencie.
<pb facs="7"/>
For his erring in proportions can no way impeach, or derogate from the true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and sound ground worke, of a sure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A little or smale spring from the first head cannot stop the curraunts of great floods, or the maine waues of the Ocean Sea. These Cantons are but drops taken out of the fountaines of <hi>Israell,</hi> though the booke be but as a wooden dish, it will serue the poore mans turne to drinke in, &amp; quench his thirst. The rest I leaue to the flowing streames of the graue Diuines, as fragant flowers out of a pleasant garden, being grosely gathered, and vnorderly placed, yet retaine their beautie, and sauour, and the fault in vnorderly placeing is to be found not in the flowers, but in the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer: lay the fault of any errour herein to the man, the manner and meeter, no to the matter, In loue is no labour, therefore my labour is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and yet wy labour exceedes my learning, &amp; my will my skill Paynting is fit for ragged wales, not for fine Marble. And often times smoth filed tongues are ioyned to defiled hearts: God knowes, towards him my soules sinceritie, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you mine hearts integritie. If thou art curious, be curteous, and doe not discourage: if learned though thou seest the fault be many, let thy louo be more: In all giue God glory, to whom be all glory for euer, and euer, Amen.</p>
