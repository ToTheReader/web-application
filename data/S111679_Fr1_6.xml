      <l>THe mighty IOVE beholding from aboue,</l>
      <l>The mistes of sinne. which from the earth arose,</l>
      <l>In angry moode, sent IRIS downe to mooue,</l>
      <l>Throughout the worlde, the exercise of foes,</l>
      <l>With vengeance armde: who poured downe her Ire,</l>
      <l>And with debates, set Monarchies a fyre.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Whole Countries burnde, did dim the Sun with smoke</l>
      <l>The Cannon noyse, the Ayre with Thunder rent:</l>
      <l>The wounded men, with shrikes the Heauens shoke;</l>
      <l>The Temples spoyld: the'Townes to ruine went:</l>
      <l>Vnwillyng yet, to worke the worlds decay,</l>
      <l>IOVE, CYLLEN sent, in part his wrath to staye.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Who hastes his charge, with winges as swift as winde,</l>
      <l>But comming to, the Region next the grounde,</l>
      <l>He could no way, for clowdie darknes finde:</l>
      <l>And fearing, in the Ocean to be drownde:</l>
      <l>He houered till, in fine, he did espie,</l>
      <l>A PHAROS light, which was a PHENIX eye.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Led by this Starre, amaine he commeth downe,</l>
      <l>And footing sets, vppon a fruitfull Ile:</l>
      <l>Where liu'd a Queene, crownd with the worlds renowne</l>
      <l>Vpon whose rule, Grace, Peace, and Wealth did smyle.</l>
      <l>Her Senate, graue, her Citties, Mansions weare,</l>
      <l>For such as fled, for persecutions feare.</l>

      <pb facs="6"/>
      <l>To whom he gaue the tokens that were sent,</l>
      <l>Faire PALLAS forme, and VENVS louely face:</l>
      <l>Sweete PITHOS tongue, and DIANS chaste consent:</l>
      <l>And of these giftes, PANDORA nam'd her Grace:</l>
      <l>And ioynes with all, IOVES blessings to the same,</l>
      <l>To make her liue, in euerlasting fame.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>These monsters fell, which publike order breake,</l>
      <l>Dissention, Wrath, and Tiranny, he bounde:</l>
      <l>This office done [he thought as IOVE would leake]</l>
      <l>To Heauen he hyes, and blessed leaues the grounde:</l>
      <l>Where this good Queene, and Subiects quiet lyue,</l>
      <l>When ciuill warres, her neighbor kingdomes greeue.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Euen this is she, whose sacred fame is knowne,</l>
      <l>Through out the worlde, in Enuie, Feare, and Loue,</l>
      <l>Enui'd, because, she raignes in peace alone:</l>
      <l>Feared, in that, she shielded, is by IOVE:</l>
      <l>Lou'd, for desarte, whose vertues shine as bright,</l>
      <l>As twincking Stars, do in the frome night.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>This Siluer Pen, meete for a Virgins praise,</l>
      <l>VRANIE heere, doth ISMARITO giue:</l>
      <l>With charmed charge, this Queenes renowne to raise:</l>
      <l>As she in spight of Death, and Time may liue:</l>
      <l>Which right is hers, the labour is but thine,</l>
      <l>Then [Iudging] write, as she may seeme deuyne.</l>
