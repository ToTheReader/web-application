   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>BY your patience, if you haue leisure to laugh, and will take any paines to Read, it may be you shall be fitted a penny worth to your humour. Heere is no matter of state, diuinity, nor Phisicke, but, and so foorth, such stuffe, as will giue you occasion perhaps, when you haue worne it out, to commende it to your friends: tis no outlandish, but made at home, and nere the worse, for I know no reason to barre any man of his wits, that can tell kindely how to vse them: There are so many excellent writers in high Poetry, and strange plots, that poore men, who would do well, are afraide of euery Scholler, for feare of a scoffe, and of him that hath no learning, for lacke of wit. But at aduenture, this is done: how well, I knowe not, but you that Reade, may iudge as you list, there are changes in it enough to make a Play: but the foole in the midst may marre all: whose part, let it be put vpon my selfe, for too much prattle, I care not, if I here take an order with my pen to make an end of an idle Epistle.</p>
   <p>Your friend as occasion serues.</p>
