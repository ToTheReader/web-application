   <head>❧ To the worshipfull the Maister VVardens, and generall Assistants of the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie of Chirurgions in London: <hi>Iohn Hester</hi> wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth them all the true direction to the perfect way of knowledge in their Science, according to their profession.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had translated out of the Germaine tongue into English, this little treatise of the French Pockes (a worke of more worth then the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Bulcke peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may seeme to import) I aduised with my self a while to whom I might best assigne the patronage thereof, and meeting with no one degree, from the Prince to the Pesant, that woulde not highly scorne and disdaine a matter of so base and vile a reckoning, as harshe to the hearing of many, as it is in the feeling of others odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I found none likelier to giue countenaunce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, then you my Maisters of chirurgerie, who by the profession therof, maintain no smal part of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaunce, <hi>Leuis est labor cum lucro.</hi> And though there be among you at this day some, which to the profit of the rest, by theyr writings haue trauailed therein wyth commendations, others, that by their painefull and dilligent cares, haue endeuoured many harde and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous cures of this filthy disease: yet beare with me I pray you, if after so many learned and wel experienced men, I also (the meanest of many) bring foorth with the poore widdow my little poore myte: and yet ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="3"/>so little nor so poore, but that the intelligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der shall find as well in the discourse, matter worth the discouerie, as in practise, Medicines worthy the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
   <p>In the preparing of which Medicines, if leaning to myne Author, I seeme to leaue others of more auten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique credit, neyther blame mee, nor condemne him, but waying the case in ballance of indifferencie, alowe vs so farre forth to follow the authoritie of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as they haue or doe follow the trueth it selfe; a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie which hetherto the best men haue euer challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: and sure in my opinion, these fellowes that to fill large volumes, rather set downe what other men haue said, then what they should haue said, as many of our VVriters now adaies doe, thinking him the best Clark that voucheth most Authors, neyther waying theyr reasons, nor pondering their proofes, but hudling run on with <hi>ipse dixit,</hi> I say these fellowes, by blotting a great deale of good paper with much superfluous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, lead a great many good wits a woolgathering, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing them to seeke for that they neuer finde, or els to find somewhat not woorth the seeking. For who I pray you of any iudgment, woulde seeke in <hi>Gallen</hi> or <hi>Hipocrates,</hi> men in cuery wise mans censure, without doubt, well woorthy the credit they are in, who I say would seeke in thē, or their Appothecaries, Medicines for diseases whereof they neuer tooke notice. I denye not but theyr method may well be followed, euen so farre as generall rules may prescribe in particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but to be tyed to a Medicine neither applyed nor approoued by them, is more then they allowed in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb facs="3"/>or (for ought that I see) more then others shold allowe to them. Now that the diseases of the French Pocks was neyther knowne to them, nor to theyr suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors for many yeeres, (although I know some auer it to be <hi>Lepram Arabum</hi>) is a matter so farre out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, that it refuseth all shew of disputation, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as this latter age of ours sustaineth the scourge thereof, a iust whyp of our lycentiousnes, so let it, (if there be any to be had) carry the credite of the cure, as some rewarde to some mens industries: neyther let vs peeuishly distrust our owne wittes, furnished with so many helpers, and apishly admire other mens, onelie for theyr antiquitie: this were to tie God to times and seasons, &amp; to play bopeepe in a secure shroude of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, vtterly dis-franchizing our selues of the free le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacie, <hi>Dij laboribus dona dant sua.</hi> Great curtesie is made who shall carrie the name, the Frenchman po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting it ouer to the Spaniard, the Spaniarde to the Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan, and either of these returning it back to other, but I would we in England were not as deeply interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the thing, as either of thē are in the name, which because I feare we are, as knowing more herein then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man knowes, I thought good for the benefite of such as are distressed, to deliuer to the Chirurgion, that which many (I am sure) haue not yet seene: offering therewithall my paines, labour, and industry, as well in the preparation of Medicines heere set downe, as in any other, by any of my freendes otherwise prooued by experience, all yours, and freende to euery one of you.</p>
