   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Cribimus indocti doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti{que}
poëmata passim.</hi>
Pardon me Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men &amp; others that
delight to write, if
out of my own humor &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of my selfe, I deliuer this cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
before my booke, that all wee
write is but conceit. And nothing
pleaseth conceited mē more then
to haue partners or acquaintances
with their conceits. <hi>Scire tuum nihil
<pb facs="3"/>
est nisi, quod scis hoc sciat alter.</hi> Be it
learned or not, yet the contriuing
pleaseth the humor, so the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
be drawne out of the sweete
impressiō of content. Being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued,
partialitie breeds either such
pittie, that the houres spent to our
pleasure, should be blotted with
obliuion, or such hopes, that what
we write, may meete with like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
humors, which may receiue
it vvith some liking, as vve die if
vve offer not the vvorld our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.
The end is to our vvritings
that are vnlearned, al one, as to the
learnedst Poems that are. For <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
vvho immitated none, and
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Archilocus,</hi> who is compared with
<hi>Homer,</hi> because they only finished
their workes in their life. And <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi>
the curious Ape of <hi>Homer. Ouid</hi>
the Amorous, <hi>Martiall</hi> the lycenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<hi>Horace,</hi> the mixt betwixt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
&amp; <hi>Satirique</hi> vaine. The flower
of our age, sweete pleasing <hi>Sidney.
Tasso</hi> the graue. Pollished <hi>Daniel</hi>
the Historick. <hi>Spencer</hi> the Truthes
Faith. All these haue this only vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of their pains, they please others
&amp; thēselues. In like maner, as we
please our selues, so some are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with vs. For as these are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
&amp; deified almost by the wisest,
the lernedst, &amp; the deepest sighted
<pb facs="4"/>
into great matters, the ignorant
not being able to attaine vnto thē.
So we are held among the inferior
spirits, and are the litle Penates, to
countrey, homely and lowe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
wits, admired by such, and
religiously read, though neuer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kē
into the others hands. Are they
then knowne? So are we. Are they
not knowne to all? No more are
we. Do they carp and iest at vs, if
by chāce we fall into their fingers?
Wee will crie quittance, for wee
wil not vnderstand them in some
things, and touch them with an
Ironicall Adage; <hi>Quae supra nos nihil
ad nos.</hi> Gentlemen &amp; others, I pray
<pb facs="4"/>
you let vs holde together for the
preseruatiō of our reputation, and
maintain the prescription of our
lowe subiects, least <hi>Apollos</hi> musick
do quite drowne poore <hi>Pan,</hi> and
the countrey Hornpipe be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.
Alas, if the woods, the poore
brooks, and the dales of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
sound not sometime in our
eares, as well as the Prince of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,</hi>
let the lasses giue ouer laaking
in the greene, and dauncing about
the Maypole. It were great pittie
the little <hi>Cupids</hi> Altars should bee
altogither defaced, from whose e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
renuing influence, so many
pleasing subiects doo flowe into
<pb facs="5"/>
our brains. For whilst he cōtinues
honored in the world, wee must
once a yeare bring him vpon the
stage, either dācing, kissing, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or angry, or dallying with his
darlings, leaping into their eyes,
seating himself in their breasts, cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
more then imperiously
all the gods; or crying for childish
peeuishnes; or metamorphosed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
many chāgeable shapes; or play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a gardē as I do at this time;
weeping, and againe stung with a
Bee. There is a secret (but, I may
not reueale the counsels &amp; secrets
of our state of loue) which makes
this young god, be to all men the
<pb facs="5"/>
plain song to their descant of their
In <hi>Nomines.</hi> It cannot be youth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
for then old men could not
dote, and young men might only
claime priuiledge of loue frō the
the God. What should it then be?
Surely, if not a secret influence in
the beloued, I cannot diuine the
reason. For if aged Trees were not
succoured with the Sun as well as
yong plants, their decay would be
sudden. All sorts do offer sacrifice
to him. Let all sortes then be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
deuoutly in the opinion of
deuotion. For the aged no sooner
laught the yong man to scorn for
louing, but straightly hee doated.
<pb facs="6"/>
Let me I pray you abruptly thus
end, least I speak too much, when
I doubt my speech will onely
please my owne conceit.</p>
