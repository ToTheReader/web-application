But when thou hast perused the summe, the circumstance therof (I doubt me) will proue the old said sawe to be true: <hi>Cauda de vulpe testatur:</hi> That the foxe is knowne by his taile. Yet the Lord forbid, that we should rashlie iudge of anie man, seeing that God hath ordeined one to be the iudge of the quicke and the dead, the good and the euill,<note place="margin">Actes. 10. Rom. 12. Iohn. 8.</note> to whom it is giuen to giue iudgement. And as they were at diuerse times proponed in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: so they were at diuerse times of leasure againe answered and rescribed, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing anie good order of a catechisme. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou must not looke to find anie such me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, or obseruation of an orderlie teaching herein.

Wherby he was driuen to the more diligent turning, and search of scripture bookes, least he should haue appeared in his answers <hi>Asinus ad lyram posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> as sit therevnto, as an asse is to plaie on the harpe: or else to haue said nothing, but laid his finger on his lip, as Harpocrates vsed, when he would haue silence. For as long as a foole is silent, he differeth not among stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, from the wise. And as it is easier for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Momus, to find a fault somtimes, than to mend it: so is it easier alwaies to aske an hard question of anie man, than to answer it discreetlie according to the truth. And for that the whole consisteth in questions, answers, and syllogisticall obiections, dialogwise, I haue imagined <hi>Falsiloquus,</hi> which is a speaker of false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to demand, and obiect: and <hi>Veriloquus</hi> a speaker of the truth, to answer him againe. The Lord giue vs his truth and peace,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> which giueth not his peace, as the world giueth peace. It was not ment at the first that this should haue come vnto thine hands, but now, if thou gentlie accept of it (such as it is) I am suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie acquited and recompensed.</p>
