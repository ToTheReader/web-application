   <head>To the Religious and Vertuous Lady, the Lady IANE BOYS, Widdow to the right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull Sir IOHN BOYS, sometime Recorder of the City of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> grace &amp; peace from our LORD IESVS CHRIST.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Adame,</hi> I present vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diships view and reading, this Homelie preached in the
<pb facs="4"/> French tongue by that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and iudicious diuine, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Peter du Moulin,</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the word of God, and by me translated, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that excellent conference betweene God and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant <hi>Abraham;</hi> wherein we may behold on the one side the nature of sinne, and the vengeance of God when sinners are come to their full measure; on the other side the patience and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar accesse, which he affords to those that loue him, how milde and patient he is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them that feare him, and how hee behaues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe towards his enemies,
<pb facs="4"/> and all to this end to moue vs all to faith, repentance, and humility.</p>
   <p>And sithence my small paines in englishing it yeelds me a right to make choyce of one to whom I may dedicate this little volume, I am bold to present the same vnto your Ladiship (hoping your fauourable acceptance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) and the rather because it befits you, (Madame) in many respects, for these vertues that are here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, are in you. (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame) I speake it without flattery; faith, repentance, humility, zeale to Gods house, loue to his word, loue
<pb facs="5"/> and faith which you haue to the Lord Iesus, and towards all his Saints; for you are an <hi>Anna,</hi> alwayes seruing God in the Temple with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and prayers, a <hi>Lydia</hi> in hearing Gods word, a <hi>Mary</hi> in pondering and meditating the same, a <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> to Widdowes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, a <hi>Shunamite</hi> to the Prophets and Ministers of God, not onely countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our persons and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery with your person and presence in our Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi> when you are here, but also cherishing vs with good and comfortable words, and exercising your
<pb facs="5"/> liberall charitie towards our poore, not leesing your first loue, like the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> but continuing it towards vs frō time to time; and therefore the iust God will not forget your piety towards him, nor your charity towards his Saints; but as your name and charitable workes are inregistred in our booke of remembrance, so is your name written in the Booke of Life, your deeds of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in feeding, couering, visiting the poore, written in that Booke that shall be opened in the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your consolation; then shall you reape plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb facs="6"/> what you sowe here, and as <hi>Damascen</hi> speakes, here you giue a little, there you shall receiue much; now you giue a transitory thing, then shall you gaine an eternall; here you giue a penny, there you shall receiue a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for if <hi>Iulius Cesar</hi> gaue Lands to one that gaue him but a draught of water, what a reward will Christ giue to those, that giue but a cup of water to drinke in his name to those that belong to him? If <hi>Darius</hi> gaue a Kingdome to <hi>Silosontes,</hi> that gaue him a garment onely; what a Kingdome will Christ giue to those that
<pb facs="6"/> giue him cloathing, foode, and drinke, in the name and person of the least and poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of his brethren? The same Iesus Christ whom you feede, cloath, and visite here on earth in his members; as he feedes you and cloathes you here on earth, not onely corporally, but also spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, with the spirituall <hi>Manna</hi> the bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, euen he himselfe who is your spirituall foode and garment also, will giue you that euerlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, prepared for you from the foundation of the world; where and when you shall be crowned with the crowne
<pb facs="7"/> of righteousnesse, cloathed with the roabes of glory, sit downe with <hi>Abraham, Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> to be nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with the fruit of the tree of life and water of life, and liue eternally with him in the kingdome of heauen, <hi>Amen.</hi>
