      <salute>Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y motion is for Charity, for that which is the lustre of profession, the ornament of high birth; for this have your Fore-fathers left vnto you their armes, and their possessions: this is that which will send honour into their Tombes, and make their herses (as it were) cast forth yet a kind of fragrancy; charity legitimates you in your pedigrees, and causes the world to acknowledge that ye like true heires enjoy their means, not having cut off the entayle; by this the hearts of friends approve of you, and the mouthes of <hi>Adversaries</hi> are stopt. Shall <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> have the preheminence of vs in any vertue, or especially get the fore hand of vs in Charity? no, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that pure obedience can draw as free bounty from you, as the <hi>Allective</hi> of Merit did from them; our Religion as it hath blowne vp the dying coales vpon the Altar, so it hath not put out the fire in your Kitchins, though the Rood-loft be downe, that there need no prayers to <hi>Saints,</hi> yet Charities box was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="3"/>pluckt vp, that ye should neglect the prayers of the poore; wee have not beene so mindfull of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that we have thrust by humanity; or beene so earnest to restore the primitive piety, that wee have forgotten the ancient pitty; no, we have made faith speake, that before was tongue-tyed with ignorance, and commanded her to worke, lest the world should thinke wee have removed an <hi>Idiot,</hi> and brought in a sluggard; wee looke that the bread of life may bee broken in our Temples, and the bread of compassion in our Halls, wee would have a famine of neither; whatsoever was bad in Popery, we have swept it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sinke, whatsoever was good, wee desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it with greater honour in the family; wee wish the old Basket of Hospitality were made wider, and that the Foundations of <hi>Almes-houses</hi> were layde a pearch longer, and a yeare sooner; we loath, rebuke, condemne Covetousnesse, if wee cannot reforme it, yet our disciplining blowes are seene vpon the back of it.</p>
   <p>Oh then ye Honourable, and Noble Personages, poore mens Wonders, and the Lands Beauties, be as enclined to Charity, as ye are enabled to it; it is the Crest of your Religion, it is engraven into your Armes; Looke daily vpon that which your Fathers bestowed vpon pious vses, as vpon their pictures or linages; be enamoured on their vertues, be ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of their praises. Carry your selves favourably to your Tenants, or else <hi>Nicippus</hi> Ewe shall seeme to have brought forth a Lyon, and be constant <hi>Fosterers</hi> of the poore, lest ye blot out the very memories of your famous Progenitours. Looke vp to that heaven
<pb facs="3"/>where they now shine, and behold the staves of that Ladder by which they ascended; Make a solemne search for their old Accounts, and let your propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Charity not be inferiour to their yearely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, that ye finde there they bestowed vpon the poore; they purchased your lands for you, built for you those magnificent structures, spent much in those dayes in warres, and yet scanted not their workes of mercy; ye then which have all these things provided for you, and are eased of many of these cares and charges, and perhaps have new honours conferred vpon you, why should not ye equal them in bounty? Oh therefore whether ye attend at Court, or reside in the Country with vertuous <hi>Iob,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iob 31.</note>
      <hi>Eate not your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels alone.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And ye the auncient Gentry of our Kingdome, whom your Fathers have made generous, degenerate not from them; why carry ye their bloud in your veines, or put their honours into your birth-rights, if ye will not imitate them? The Country rang, and the Kingdome ecchoed with their Bounty, and why should not ye their successours labour to be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with them? It is the Monster of speech and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise to heare, or see, that House-keeping should bee out of fashion; No, this is to have faith and fame out of fashion, and to have nothing put into fashion, but basenesse, and penuriousnesse; Keepe your standing Houses therefore in the Countrey, and be not Dor-mice in Cities; are not those aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Families straightned? then neither let the olde Hospitality be, Your Fore-fathers were not so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish to erect those large buildings onely for <hi>Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>to gaze on, nor of such abject spirits to raise vp such magnificent edifices for Farmers to roost in; No, they were reared vp for you to have Receptacles of honour in your Countries, and to bee fitted with Mansions for Charity, if ye would not starve Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for maintenance. To come therefore to those houses onely to receive Rents, or to feast with your Neighbour Gallants, were to give the shoulder to Charity, and to put the scorne vpon all your Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitours worthy purposes. By all the reverence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ye beare to your Auncestours memories, by all the comfort that ye take in their vertuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yea, by the renowne that ye desire to professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by the rewards that ye hope for in heaven, carry I beseech you an exact resemblance of them in their <hi>Almes-deedes,</hi> lest ye hold along with them in a long line of descent, till the day of judgement, but then come to part at the Throne. Thus wishing that Charity once againe may lift vp her old bright brow in the Nation, I rest as</p>
