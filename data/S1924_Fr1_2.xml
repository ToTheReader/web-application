   <p>SEns plainnes in speking
is of wise men commen
ded, and diuerse do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
longe prohemes
of Rhetorike: I haue
sette out this mery treatise / wherin
plainnes and flateri do come in trial / 
in such wise as none honest man wil
be therwith offended. The persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that do reasone, be of small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation:
For Pasquillus, that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
moste, is an image of stone, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge
in the citie of Rome openly: on
whome ones in the yere, it is leful to
euery man, to set in verse or prose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
taūte that he will / agayne whom
he lift, howe great an astate so euer
he be. Not withstandynge in this
booke he vsith suche a temperaunce / 
that he noteth not any particular
persone or Countrey. Gnatho was
brought in by writers of Comedies
<pb n="2" facs="2"/>
for suche a seruante / as alway affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
what so euer was spokē of his
maister: but he was a Greke borne,
and therfore he sauorith some what
of rethorike. Pasquille is an olde
Romane / but by longe sittinge in the
strete, and hering market men chat,
he his become rude and homely.</p>
   <p>Harpocrates was the prelate of the
temple of Isis and Serapis, whiche
were honorid for goddis in Aegypt / 
whose image is made holdynge his
fynger at his mouthe, betokeninge
silence. These thre communed to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as it foloweth / but where, I
had forgoten to aske,. All be it by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the matter is merily brought
in, and therwith sauoreth somwhat
of wisedome: I thought hit not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniēt
to participate it with you
that will not interprete it but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
to the beste meaninge, And in
the redinge this littill treatise distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly,
will consider diligently the state
<pb facs="3"/>
and condition of the parson that spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth / 
with the ordre and conclusion
of his hole reason. And if it seme to
you, that Pasquill sayth true, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claringe
howe moche ye do fauoure
truthe, defende hym ageynste vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
tunges and ouerthwart wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
whiche doeth more myschieffe,
than Pasquillus babillinge.</p>
