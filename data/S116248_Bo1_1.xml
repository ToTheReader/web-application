   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>ECEIVE (CHRISTIAN READER)</hi> a proofe of the force of Trueth, and a praesage of the ende of that worke God is about to doe in these last Ages: A man brought vp in the Learning of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and inchaunted with the Sorceries of <hi>Babel:</hi> without the helpe or counsell of any Protestant, by occasion of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish tyrannie, searching the trueth, findeth out their errour in Doctrine, and abuses in Discipline: and conuinced of both, first in his minde forsaketh their opinions, and now in his body fleeth from their society. This is not like to the change of <hi>Apollinaris</hi> and <hi>Arrius</hi> of olde, or of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier</hi> in our time, whose miscontented humour, for hopes disappointed, made them alter their opinion: But more like to that of <hi>Paulus Vergerius,</hi> Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Iustinople,</hi> whom vnjust suspitions at the first burdened with a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret fauour of <hi>Lutheranisme:</hi> for purging whereof he intended a refutation of <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine: But while he wrangled with the Trueth, to ouer-come it, hee was taken captiue of it: and leauing his Place and Dignities, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himselfe at <hi>Tubing</hi> to our Profession.</p>
   <p>The ground of our praesage is <hi>GODS</hi> Trueth in Times accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein Prouidence goes on with remarkeable degrees of persons and places, not without some respect to the periods of time. Hee raysed <hi>Wickleff</hi>
      <pb n="4" facs="6"/>from their Schooles, <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> from their Pulpits, <hi>Martin Luther</hi> from their Cloysters, and nowe <hi>Marke Antonie</hi> from their Arch-episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Chaire. The places haue the like gradation: Great <hi>Britaine</hi> seemeth too faire from <hi>Rome,</hi> to waken them by <hi>Wickleffs</hi> crye: Therefore it soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nearer in <hi>Germanie.</hi> And nowe <hi>Dalmatia</hi> looking ouer the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Gulffe, assureth <hi>Italie</hi> that her next Aduertiser shall bee within her bowels. Jt was more than a Poeticall licence to applye <hi>Sybillas</hi> Oracles of CHRIST to <hi>Saloninus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Pollio,</hi> for keeping in memorie his victorie in taking in <hi>Salonas:</hi> But this our <hi>Saloninus</hi> maketh large resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and applyeth the Oracles of GOD to the owne purpose: As the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie hath gone before, so Princes doe follow: The King of <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> with most of the Princes of <hi>Germanie,</hi> stand out alreadie against <hi>Rome:</hi> The ambiguitie of <hi>France</hi> will resolue in ende in an open departure: And the temporizing of <hi>Venice</hi> importeth more the want of occasion, than of will and resolution. The <hi>Romane</hi> Empire did stretch out it selfe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, proceeding from the middes to the extremities, as circles goe out from the Center: And at the extremities againe their ruine began, and went backe to the heart. The fall of their Spirituall Monarchie shall keepe the same course.</p>
   <p>The periods of time haue their owne obseruation. The <hi>Iewish</hi> solemnitie of <hi>Iubilee,</hi> not brought in the Church till the thirteenth Age, was then tyed to the Centenarie number: and that their joye hath since proued to be like the song of the Marmaide before a storme: for soone after, <hi>Wickleff</hi> beganne to trouble their mirth: and in the ende of that Age <hi>Iohn Husse</hi> made them some more businesse: till in the 1415. yeere, the holy Fathers, at <hi>Constance</hi> by a Punicke Faith, brought him to the fire. An hundreth yeeres after him <hi>Luther</hi> renewed his song with greater boldnesse, and in the 1517, yeere gaue out his Propositions against the Pope: from which time they haue perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themselues, and cuen to this daye assure their followers, that <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine can stand no longer than an hundreth yeeres. This present yeere clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that period: and while they looke for an euanishing of that Doctrine, beholde, euen from themselues it receiueth againe a newe light, anewetesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. We holde with <hi>Plato</hi> the fatalitie of Periods, but <hi>Pythagoras</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are too weake a grounde for such a necessitie: Or if wee shall take anie numbers, it must bee these of sinne; and in sinne, more the degrees than the numbers. <hi>The Amorites sinnes must come to the height, and the
<pb n="5" facs="6"/>Iewes must fill their cuppe before their punishment.</hi> The Pharisees of our time doe mightily to fill out their measure. The pryde and filthinesse of <hi>Sodome,</hi> the whordomes of <hi>Babell</hi> are now multiplyed exceedingly, and the greatest sinne, euen that to death, is become an epidemicke disease among their Clergie. Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. can denye the trueth, <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth can scoffe at it, <hi>Gardinerus</hi> can confesse it at his death, but with this addition, <hi>That it must rather still be impugned, than the state of Rome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay:</hi> All their wittes runne vpon this one poinct, but all their meanes turne vpon them: The cruelty of their Inquisition, The tyranny of their Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Their impudency in falsifying wordes and writs, giue them but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments aduantage: But euen from these shall come their rnine. Alye hath no more strength than for the time it is spoken, and credulously embraced: but the eternall force of Trueth hath more than a momentanie preuailing. What then resteth for them, but that they giue place to the fatality of their estate, since they will not giue place to the Trueth. And for vs, while <hi>Rome</hi> is renting in it selfe, take heede that we be not diuided. Whosoeuer now casteth in the apple of strife in the Reformed Church, proueth an enemy to GOD, and an improfitable friend to Antichrist. Let vs stande still, and beholde the worke of the LORD, and bee sure while wee imagine wee haue left <hi>Babel,</hi> that we haue first forsaken <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
