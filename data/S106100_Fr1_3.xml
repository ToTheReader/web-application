   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or so much as in this most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cittie of Naples, deuoute Reader, there be manie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations dedicated to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Virgin, and blessed mother of God. which oftentimes did come togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not onlie to praise and honour the Queene of heauēs, but also to exercise them selues in mental prayer, a meane most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, whereby to amend and direct our life, and my Superiours deeming that it would be a greate help to such, as be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voute to the Mother of God, if they might haue an abridgement of her life and actions, both to consider and imitate them: this there godlie desire did animate and spurre me forwards to write this litle booke, which doth conteine first the Storie of the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> life and manners, faithfullie gathered out of auncient and holy fathers, with the citations of their bookes, which for more briefenes and facilities sake to find out, the places that be alleaged, at heere sett downe in latin.</p>
   <p>After this there be imm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>diatly set downe
<pb facs="4"/>for eache historie, three short points where vppon to meditate, taken out either of the historie that goeth before, or of some other godly considerations; to the end that eache one may haue sufficient matter, whereof to thinke and discourse: because our minde and vnderstanding, when it hath some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and grownde, doth easelie discourse of it selfe, and findeth out diuers conceits and spiritual thoughts, in which the sowle is much comforted, and entring into it selfe doth thereby reape great fruite and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie. Finallie after the points of meditation, there doe folow three documents or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, awnswering to the said points, which documents put in practise, wil serue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie as a wonderful aide, to direct and conforme our liues and actions, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those of the blessed Virgin, our Queene and Soueraigne.</p>
   <p>Maruaile not, Christian Reader, that I in this little booke doe laie, before thine eyes the virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> for a patterne to imitate her life &amp; manners? seeing that <hi>Sophronius</hi> doth confesse the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> to be the forme and Rule of Christian discipline, giuen by almightie God to men, next after Christ the first and chiefest president of al perfection. <hi>Rupertus</hi> likewise avowcheth, that our Sauiour Christ ascending vp into
<pb facs="5"/>heauen, leas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> the virgin <hi>Marie</hi> for a mistresse of Christian beleefe, &amp; life. And long time before them both, that worthie and holie martyr S. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> named the virgin <hi>Marie</hi> the mistresse of Christian Religion: which office of mistresse, she did rather performe in woorks &amp; examples of perfect and sound vertues, then in woords. In somuch that who soeuer wil consider with diligence the course of the virgin <hi>Maries</hi> life, shal euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie perceaue that the prouidence and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God did so dispose her life, that it might serue for an example to al sorts of person, as I wil manifest by the ensuing discourse.</p>
   <p>The Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> from three yeares of her age vntil fourteene, remained with other virgins in the temple of Ierusalem, in which place, with her abhorring the vanitie of the world, with her prompt Obedience to the Superiours of that place, with her diligence in praier and deuotion, with her modestie and humilitie she taught as vvel virgins, as other religious vveomen, how each of them ought to behaue them selues in their state and calling. Afterwards til neare fourtie and fiue yeares, she vvas a mistresse to married vveomen, and such as haue care of how shold: for albeit she was the Queene of Angels, the mother of God,
<pb facs="5"/>and ful of al grace and wisdome, yet she did obey, honour and respect her spouse <hi>Ioseph,</hi> with vvhome she liued alwaies in concord and quietnes. Besides this, in this care of her house and bringing vp of her sonne Christ, she vvas most diligent: for she did so wel dispose and appoint her time, that neither the affaires of her house did hinder her pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor these vvere anie impediment or let, to such domestical busines as pertained to her charge.</p>
   <p>In the rest of her life which vvas, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the more common opinion, vntil threescore and three yeares of age, she was an example and mistresse to widdowes and poore vveomen, because she in her wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe state, as S. <hi>Brigit</hi> writeth, as it were deade to the world, did liue vvholie to God; &amp; giuen to cōtemplation of celestial things, did leade a life rather diuine than humane. Her prouision vvas smal and fit for poore folkes, and some doe esteeme that she, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Ascension of Christ, did liue as the Hebrew widdowes were wont to doe, of the common almes and collections, vvhich in the primitiue Church were gathered to sustaine the poore. To be short, she taught by her example how euerie one ought to behaue him selfe as wel in time of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and fauour, as of aduersitie and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb facs="6"/>for somuch as in al the giftes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours that she receaued at Gods hāds, she did humble her selfe with al her hart; as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in this, that being chosen the mother of God, &amp; hauing vnderstoode such newes from the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> she called her selfe the seruant and hand-maide of our Lorde. And when she went to visit S. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and vvas by her saluted verie magnificallie, and as the mother of God: she did magnifie our Lord, acknowledging al her good to come from him. So that in prosperitie she teacheth vs to humble our selues, and to praise alinghtie God.</p>
   <p>But in tribulation and aduersitie she hath giuen vs such rare examples of vertue, that if the afflicted and vexed in this life would wel consider them, their tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations would not seeme to be so grieuous as they doe As for example sake, the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> in this life had no other good but one onlie sonne, vvhich was of infinite bountie and perfection, for that he was in one person both God and man, now she did see this her sonne to be of enuie accused, &amp; vniustlie condemned to the most grieuous torments that could be imagined, euen to the most infamous death of the Crosse. Shee did see him also die vppon the Crosse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two theeues, and was not able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
<pb facs="6"/>him the least comfort that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised: when not withstanding she did sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port al these iniuries and cruelties, with incredible fortitude of courage, not moued to indignation against those enuious accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, not lamenting of the wicked Iewes, nor reproching the Apostles that so disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie had forsaken their maister.</p>
   <p>Yet were the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> tribulations not ended with this, for that <hi>Artopheius</hi> saith after the Ascension of Christ, she was greatlie persecuted of some malicious and wicked people, who did vexe and molest her by vsing her spitefullie in woorks, and detracting of her good name in woords: but she with patience and praying to God for her persecutours, did ouercome the euil wil of them al. Accept then, good Reader, this so perfect a patterne and mirrour of Christian perfection: and I doe exhort thee, if to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>e thou canst take thereby some fruite for thy soule, not to expect and deffer til to morowe. I doe also exhort thee to cleanenes and puritie of minde, which wil make thee fit first for meditation, and then to be more beloued and fauoured of the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> who hath particular care and protection of those that be chaste and pure: finallie I doe exhort thee to practise those documents that do immediatlie folow the meditations,
<pb facs="7"/>which documents doe direct vs to doe wel, and to bridle our passions and disordered appetites. For to make goodlie discourses, to find out deepe conceits in meditation, and afterwards not to worke wel according to our good determinations and instructions, is euen as if one heard a good sermon ful of excellent doctrine &amp; holsome counsel, but neuer did practise any of al those things he had heard.</p>
