   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apostle after his Christiā salutaciō, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth GOD thankes for these
Colossians, that thei were come to the true knowlege of Christ by the word of God, preached
to them by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paphras, and had receiued faith hope, and charitie, as their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes declared: he
praieth to God for their increacemēt in spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al knowlege and Godly liuing, shewyng the
benefites of Christ the hed of the Churche, to theim and to all men, willyng theim to stand
sure groūded vpon Christ the sure foundaciō, and that thei would not shrynke from
Christ and his doctryne, by no craftie meanes of pseudapostles that
<pb facs="7"/> craftely went aboute to deceiue them by false doctrine, by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticion of
Angelles, by Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, by tradicions of men, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementes of the worlde mixtyng the lawe with
the Gospell, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng Christ not to be onely the aucthor of healthe, nor the waie to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
father, to be made by Christ but by Angelles, supersticiously obseruyng the Sonne, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
Mone, and the Sterres. Therefore the Apostle, monisheth theim to beware of these
pseudapostles, and of their deceiuable doctrine and to sticke to Christe and to his true
doctryne, as a sufficient doctryne to bryng to health and saluacion, by Christ alone, with
out helpe of the Angelles, of the lawe, or of any other thyng. He exhorteth them to remēbre
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
<pb facs="8"/> death and his resurreccion, and to dye from synne and euill maners, and to walke
in a newe life, shewyng to diuerse states and degrees of men, their offices and dueties,
exhortyng them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to feruent praiers, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng his Epistle (which he would should bee
red aswell to the Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicians, as to the Colos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians) with christian salutacions,
wishyng the grace of of God euer to be with thē <hi>AMEN.</hi>
