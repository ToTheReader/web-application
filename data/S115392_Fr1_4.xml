   <head>THE AVTHORS EPISTLE DEDICATORIE To Henry the third, the most Christian King of France and Poland.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ven as (most Christian King) we see the members of mans body by a friendly consent are alwayes busied, and stand ready to performe those functions for which they are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by nature, for the preservation of the whole, of which they are parts: so it is convenient that we, which are, as it were, Citizens of this earthly Common-weale should be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the following of that calling which (by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) we have once taken upon us: and content with our present estate, not caried away with rashnes and envy, desire different and divers things whereof we have no knowledge. He which doth otherwise, perverts and defiles with hated confusion the order and beauty, on which this Vnivers consists. Wherfore when I considered with my selfe, that I was a member of this great Mundane body, and that not altogether unprofitable, I endeavored earnestly, that all men should be acquainted with my duty, and that it might be knowne how much I could profit euery man. For God is my witnes, and all good men know, that I have now laboured fifty yeares with all care and paines in the illustration and amplification of Chirurgery; and that I have so certainly touched the marke whereat I aimed, that Antiquity may seeme to have nothing wherein it may exceed us, beside the glory of invention; nor posterity any thing left but a certaine small hope to adde some things, as it is easie to adde to former inventions. In performance whereof, I have beene so prodigall of my selfe, my watchings, faculties and meanes, that I spared neither time, labour, nor cost, wherby I might satisfie and accomplish my own desires, this my great work, and the desires of the studious Neither may we doubt but their studies would at the length waxe cold, if they only furnished with the Theoricke and Precepts in Schooles and that with much laboure, should see no manuall operation, nor manifest way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Arte. For which cause I seeking the praise and profit of the</hi> French <hi>Nation, even with the hinderance of my particular estate, have endeavored to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate and increase Chyrurgerie hitherto obscure either by the infelicity of the
<pb facs="5"/>
former ages, or the envy of the Prosessors; and not onely with precepts and rules, but being alover of carved workes I beautified it with 300. formes, or graven figures and apt deliniations, in which whosoever shall attentively looke shall finde five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred anatomicall, or organicall figures belonging to the Arte, (if they be reckoned particularly). To every of these I have given their names and shewed their use, least they should seeme to have beene put in vainly for ostentation or delight. But although there be few men of this profession which can bring so much authority to their writings either with reason, or experience as I can; notwithstanding I have not beene so arrogant, but intending to publish my worke, I first communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it with men the most excellent in the Arte of Phisicke, who gave me greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to perfect and publish it, that it might be in common use: professing they wished nothing more, than that it might be turned into Latine, so by which meanes it should be knowne to forraigne Nations, that there is no kind of Learning which is not delivered with great dexterity of wit in this kingdome over which you rule. And thus much I dare boldly affirme, that there is scarce any, be he never so stately or supercilious, but that he may here find something which may delight him, and by which he may better his knowledge. Therefore I doubted not to consecrate this booke unto your Majestie both as a Patterne and treasury of my labours aswell in respect of my duty, who am yours by nature and education, as that I might mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest to all, your Highnes exceeding bounty towards me, in placing me, (having here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore enjoyed the office of principall Chirurgeon under 3 Kings your Majesties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors) in the same dignity, and that of your owne accord. And moreover I did conjecture that it would fall out, as now it doth, that this my worke caried through the world by the fame of your Majestie name, should neither feare the face nor veiw of any, supported by the favour and Majestie of a most invincible Monarch and most excellent and renowned Prince. Neither did King</hi> Charles <hi>the ninth of happy memory, incited by the relation of the most gracious Queene his Mother, refuse to reade it, being he under stood it proceeded from him, who having happily passed all his time in private and publik employments, and conversed with all men of all sorts, was judged most worthy to obtaine this favour, as to have the front of this worke adorned and beautified with the splendor of his prefixed name. I encour aged by this hope, desired that my request should passe as by a certaine continuation and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from a most powerfull, to a most Invincible King; and doe wholy consecrate these my labours taken for my Countryes good unto your sacred Majestie. God grant that your Majestie may have happy successe of all your enterprises aboundantly added to</hi> Nestors <hi>yeares.</hi>
