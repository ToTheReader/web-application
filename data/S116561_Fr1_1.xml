   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS I was at Chester requested (Right Worshipful) to bestow som pains in the presence of certaine Recusantes (though I knew my selfe least able of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers there to discharge the matter) yet vpon earnest intreaty I was at length ouer-intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to supply the roome, and to vndertake a sute so charitable. Since which time it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some deare frinds to craue a copy of my labour: which when they had obtained; they did with earnest perswasion assay to moue me to cōmit the same to the presse. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto though at the first I was loth to yeeld, yet at length I was ouercome and resolued to grant vnto them: especially because I had therein discouered the shamefull, subtil and
<pb facs="2"/> malicious practises of our aduersaries, the Papists, the popes Foxes, who in this our day breath daunger without delay &amp; spite the grapes of our Sauiours vine, that hath these many yeares fructified, &amp; euen now of gods mercy doth florish among vs. That so the Popes Foxes may be more throwly knowē: &amp; being knowen, more warily auoided: or rather diligently sought and made fast, least their libertie doe worke an vtter wast to our vine. And forasmuch as the care of Christes vine hath craued, or rather the malice of the Fox hath forced me to bestow this my small &amp; vnworthy trauell; as I craue the Christian Reader to take al to the best, so (Right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful) I am bould to request your accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same, as some pledge of my thankfulnes to you. Desiring the Lord God to blesse you against al the Foxes &amp; litle Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes of Rome, that seeke nothing but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of our vine, which God continue &amp; keepe to our comfort and his own glory, <hi>Amen.</hi>
