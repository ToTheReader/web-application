   <head>¶ To the right high and mightie Prince, Philip by the grace of God Lantgraue of Hesse. &amp;c. Thomas Naogeorgus his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble subiect wisheth. &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE BEVVTIFVLL LIGHT of the Gospell (moste vvorthy Prince) hath novve so manye yeares shyned, that not vnvvorthily, if it so had seemed good to God, it might haue dravvne all men to the loue and estimation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, &amp; assvvaged the malice of the chiefest enimies, in suche sort, as thoughe they could not find in their hearts to embrace it, yet at the leastvvyse they shoulde forbeare from their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable slaunders and cruell raylings. But bicause they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe beleeue (as vve reade in the Actes of the Apostles) that are before appoynted to saluation: So farre of are our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from vvaxing more gentle, or any vvhitte forsaking their crueltie and reprochfull vvordes, as novv at length they poure out more boldely and dispitefully the vilest vvordes they can, not onely agaynst the poore Preachers, but also agaynst theyr doctrine, and the very Gospell it selfe. For of late came there one abrode, (vvhose name I vvill not here declare) vvho taking occasion of these last vvarres, vvith a foolish and slaunderous booke, cuttes in peeces, teares, chides, and vvith as yll reportes as may be, burdeneth as vvell the Princes, as subiectes, that bee fauorers of the Gospell, and herevvithall (full vvisely) calles vs againe to Poperie, tearming vs Apostatas, and forsakers of our fayth. But surely he deserueth no aunsvvere, as one that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept raylinges hath vttered nothing: and his Booke that hee vvrote, seemes to be vvritten by a man ouerseene vvith vvine, hauing no Methode therein, but a certaine disordered heape of vvordes, and (as they say) a tale vvithout a head. Yet vvoulde
<pb facs="4"/>
I there should be some that should aunsvvere this slaunderer, not for his sake, but for the vvorthinesse of the religion that vve professe: vvhereby hee might perceyue vvith vvhat rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, vngodlinesse, and malepartnesse he controlles and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes the thing he doth not vnderstande. For although vve are bound by the vvorde of God, to beare and dissemble the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and offences that are done vnto vs: yet such things as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto truth, the pure doctrine of the Gospell, and so to the honour and glorie of God, vve ought by no meanes to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but earnestly both vvith vvordes and vvritings to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the enimies, as vvith great commendation did the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctors of the Churche, agaynst the Heathen, and first planters of Herisies: for these slaunderers, although of such as sufficiently knovve the truth, they be but laught at and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised, yet doe they infect, and not a little abuse the vveake, and cause them to mistrust and think the vvorse of the religiō vve teach. Therefore eyther for the Doctrine it selfe, or else for the vveakelinges that haue but nevvly begonne to taste the truth, the vvickednesse and malice of this defamer, in calling the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell that vve preach Turkish, and by other hatefull tearmes, is to be beaten dovvne and vtterly confuted. And here I can not but vvoonder vvith vvhat face hee can thus shamelesly behaue himselfe, since it is vvell knovvn he neuer reade any booke of ours, vvhereby hee might rightly iudge of our fayth and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, neyther is it reason for the fault and offence of some one Prince or subiect to giue iudgement vpon all. But I thinke he learned these slaūders, at the Sermōs of some bavvling Friers, or other venimous Papistes, vvho haue more care for their bellies, than for the truth, vvherby he thought to be accounted a great Clearke, for thundering out his rayling Rethoricke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst vs, and thinkes it no little glorie, if vvith his fonde and ruffianly booke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, he may not ouerthrovv (for so great his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not: and if it vvere▪ the truth is inuincible) but like a flie
<pb facs="4"/>
or a gnat, sting and bite vs, vvhome it pleaseth him to call Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans. But I trust there shall some man bee founde that shall aunsvvere the foole, as Salomon sayth, according to his follye, least he should seeme vvise to himselfe. I for my part, as vvell as leysure vvoulde presently serue, haue plainely and truely set forth the chiefe members of the Popish state, their fayth, their cerimonies, and religion, though I passe ouer names: that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may see, vvhether they or vve come nearer to the steps of the Apostles, and vvhether they be Catholikes, or rather vve vvhom they so hate and persecute as Heritikes. VVhat good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, vvhat true dealing, or vvhat thing agreeing vvith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike doctrine there is among these Papistes, I truelye can not see. On the other side it plaine appeareth, that our religion is such, as the Papistes vvith all their indeuor, by faythfull vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Scriptures, yet hitherto coulde neuer bee able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throvv. VVhither than do they call vs? Doe they thinke that vve vvill forsake the truth, and follovve falshoode in so cleare a light? VVhy doe they call vs Apostatas? Is it a shame to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake vngodlinesse and Idolatrie, and other thinges both vaine and foolish? That this religion of theirs is none other, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende so brieflye to shovve, that it maye appeare as in a Table, vvhereby our men maye pacientlier beare the iniuryes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches of these fellovves, in seeing from vvhat monsters by the doctrine of the Gospell they are deliuered, and our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saryes not beare their heades so loftie, and boast themselues to bee the true Church of Christ, beholding the abuses asvvell of their life, as of their religion, disclosed &amp; declared vnto all men. I therefore exhort our brethren, that they esteeme as their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test glorie, the departing from the Pope, and as a singuler bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of GOD, the knovvledge of the Gospell. I exhort al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so and admonishe our aduersaries, that they leaue of in time frō slaundering, not onely vs (vvho in respect are nothing) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the truth of God, and the Gospell of Christ, and that they
<pb facs="5"/>
vveigh the matter vvith more diligence, and remooue a vvhile from their eyes the consent of numbers of people, the auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Pope and his members, and the accustomed religion of a fevv hundred yeares: for these and such other like are of no force in the confirming of truth, but are rather lettes and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunces to the knovvledge thereof, and common to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes of the vvhole vvorlde, vvho by antiquitie, continuaunce, aucthoritie of Kinges and Princes, and the generall consent of people, are able to defende their supersticious lavves. But other groundes of fayth and religion ought Christians to haue, as the consent of the Prophetes, and the Apostles, the authoritie of the holy Ghost, bearing vvitnesse of our Lorde Iesus Christ, as vvell in scriptures, as in the heartes of men. These if they thorovvlye consider, and vvithout parcialitie regarde, I doubt not but it shall come to passe, that clothing themselues vvith Christian shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse, they shall amende and returne vnto more sounder and surer doctrine. A great foolishnesse it is to knovve vvhat is best, and to follovve the vvorst, as many of our aduersaryes for gaine, and their bellies sake do. In the meane time, most excellēt Prince, great cause vve haue to reioyce of our selues, beholding in hovve great darkenesse, errors, deceyts, and vanities, our enimies vvalke: and to besech God, that it may please him, to open their eyes and their mindes, that they may beholde the light of the Gospell, by vvhich the quietnesse of heart is onely obtayned, and that they may seeke for and enioy al things in Christ our alonely sauiour. Hovve great a griefe it is to such as trauaile to bee ignoraunt of their vvay, or taught amisse by some malicious guide, they vvell can tell that haue had experience thereof. Neyther doth it anye vvhit auaile to proue many vvayes, and yet to bee farre of from the right. VVhich commonly happeneth, as is vvell knovvne, to our enimies. For many vvayes they attempt, and trie, and carefully vvrest their mind hither and thither, to obtaine the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of their sinnes, and euerlasting life. But euery man that
<pb facs="5"/>
is Godly doth see, that they striue and trauaile in vaine, vvhen the only vvay vnto God is Christ,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> vvho is made vnto vs of God the father, vvisdome, righteousnesse, sanctification,<note place="margin">1. Corin. 1.</note> and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and there is no other name in the vvorlde giuen vnto men vvhereby they may bee saued,<note place="margin">Actes. 4.</note> but onely the name of our Lorde Iesus Christ. This vvay bicause it is plaine, and not gainefull, the blinde and vvicked guides doe eyther craftily shunne, and leade men into thickets, or vvildernesses, vvhence they neuer can get out, or carie the poore creatures to craggie rocks, and breake neck mountaines. Besides vve ought to account it no small benifite of God, that vvee are deliuered from these fellovves, and that vvee vnderstand their deuises and deceytes, vvhereby vve may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually bevvare of them. For this onely intent, haue I taken this vvorke in hand, that the truth and the brightnesse of the Gospell may the better shine out, by setting forth the contrary deuises, vvorspippings, ceremonies, and life of the Papistes, that euery man may take heede of these, and more earnestly receyue, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and vvith all their endeuor keepe and defende the other. And to you (most vvorthie prince) haue I dedicated this vvork for many respects, all vvhich to rehearse vvere nedelesse. Your singuler and gracious fauour tovvards me, and liberalitie vvell beseeming a prince deserueth some greater matter, and more meete for your highnesse▪ But I knovv your grace is alvvayes vvoont more to esteeme the minde of the giuer, than the gift: neyther did I minde to giue your grace this, as a recompence for your goodnesse tovvardes me, (for that am I neuer able to doe) but onely to declare my selfe, not vnmindefull of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifites. Moreouer, I thought it good to giue this booke vnto you as meetest before all other Princes, for your great and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler trauaile in setting forth of the Gospell, for the daungers and miseries that you haue sustained in defending of it, vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in euen to captiuitie, and the great hazarde of your lyfe (from the vvhich I thanke God, and vvith all my heart reioyce, that
<pb facs="6"/>
you are at the length deliuered, and restored to the seat of your Progenitors) most valiantly ye haue striuen: and also for the vvonderfull and Princely courage of your heart, in so many, so great and grieuous temptations, and constancie in keeping it. You shall here beholde vvhat things they bee (although you vvere not before ignoraunt of them) vnto the vvhich, though by sundrie deuyses assaulted, you coulde by no meanes bee brought. And on the other side aparantly, vvhat maner of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it is that you furthered, hitherto defended, and by the mightie helpe of God retayned. Certaine there be that are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere and vnmoueable in keeping their fayth heretofore deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered them, as the Turkes, the Ievves, and such others, but set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon no certaine ground, nor aucthorised by the vvitnesse of any holy scriptures, but only by the inuentions and dreames of men. But such constancie (or if I may so say) obstinacy, is to be cōmended, that hath hir foundation vpon Gods vvord: and can by no meanes bee dravvne or forced to error and vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for the vvhich the vvitnesses of Christ haue alvvaies bene vvorthily praysed. Therefore bicause I thought this little work vvould not be altogither vnpleasaunt vnto you, I presumed to dedicate it vnto your highnesse, most humblie beseeching you to beare vvith the simplenesse thereof, and to accept herein my vvell meaning minde, and to receyue me into your graces protection, vvhose long prosperitie, vvith the happie successe of your most noble and renovvmed children, I earnestly desire God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue. </p>
