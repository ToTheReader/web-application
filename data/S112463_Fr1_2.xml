      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>ECEAVE this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, O Queene of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, with thy Hand of grace; which the hart of thy Seruant, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate at thy purest Feet; as a token, wrapped vp in words, of the most reuearing, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring Loue, which he owes, &amp; wil euer be striuing to pay to thee. And vouchsafe (of thy Goodnes) to present it to thy Son
<pb facs="3"/>our Lord, the sole Redeemer, and Sauiour of the World; since it aymes at nothing els, but his glory, which with infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he hath vouchsafed to place, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Loue, with mortall Man. Thy selfe, and thou alone, art that happy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who by the aboundant sloud of his Grace, wert made able to swim, through all the moments of this life, in the Purity, and Perfection of this dunne Loue. Nor didst thou euer fayle therof, from the first instant of thy Immaculate Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the bowells of thy blessed mother, to that other of thy Assumption, in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of thy most beloued Sonne. O suffer not his Creatures, who are also adopted sonnes of thine, to be still so vnlike their mother; as to disperse, and dissipate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, by inordinate Loue, vpon the transitory obiects of this world. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, it is too much, that hitherto, we haue defiled our soules; and that forsaking the cleere, vntroubled spring of diuine Beauty, we haue bene miserably glad, to stifle, and drowne our selues (whilst yet we are the workes of his Hands, and the ioy of his Hart) in the muddy pooles of profane Delight. Behold how we sigh, &amp;
<pb facs="3"/>groane in thy sacred eares: some of vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thè seruile yoke of present sinnes; and some others, vnder the sad effects, and consequences of our former wickednes; since we are full of weakene; towards good workes, and of an auersion from ioyfully and perfectly complying, with the superexcellent, wise, and holy will of God. Demaund of that God, obtaine of thy Sonne; that he will print himselfe fast vpon our Soules; that so (O glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Queene, O thou most certaine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Afflicted) we may be dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by thy prayers, from these chaynes, which are striuing to dragge vs downe as low as Hell. And once being free, we may fly vp, from whence we are fallen, and adhere to God, with thee, by an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Loue.</p>
