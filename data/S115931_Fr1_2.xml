   <head>The Preface or Entrance into the BOOKE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Suppose I am to dispute with a man, and bee about to lay downe euery thing to his reason: if hee grant that hee haue reason, I need no further proofe of <hi>Ens:</hi> for if a man haue an eye to see things, there must bee an <hi>Ens,</hi> which must be the subiect of it; for else it should bee in vaine: and as our outward eye were in vaine, if there were not some things to bee seene thereby; so were our inward eye of reason to no purpose, if there were not an <hi>ens</hi> to be seene. Now I will stand more vpon <hi>ens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I will ground my Rules of Art vpon it, but that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is the proper adiunct of <hi>ens,</hi> wee shall see more plainely hereafter. Yet let vs know in the meane time, that if there be reason, it must either see something or nothing; now it cannot see nothing but <hi>per accidens,</hi> because it properly seeth <hi>ens,</hi> as I see a man not to bee in such a place, because I see him not. True it is, that <hi>ens</hi> is the subiect of all Arts, but more specially of Logicke, Grammar, and Rhetoricke, as they are generall: for indeed Reason first seeth both it selfe, and the other Arts.</p>
   <q>Ens est quod est.</q>
   <p>Now hauing found that <hi>ens</hi> is, it is requisite that wee should know what it is; and I say <hi>ens est quod est.</hi> If wee shall looke at the Grammatical notation of <hi>ens,</hi> it is a participle of the present tense, and therefore is as much as <hi>quod est,</hi> euen as <hi>legens</hi> and <hi>qui,</hi> or <hi>quae legis</hi> are the same: or as in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>verberans,</hi> or <hi>qui verberat</hi> are all one, and that the
<pb n="2" facs="3"/>
very particle doth shew. For if it be of the present tense, it is the same with the verbe of the present tense, so that <hi>ens</hi> and <hi>quod est</hi> are the same. Againe, if there be <hi>ens,</hi> as we haue already proued, then <hi>vel est quod est, vel non quod est, vel quod non est at neque, non quod est, nec quod non tst, ergo quod est.</hi> For when I say <hi>non quod est,</hi> then I put <hi>ens fictum impossibile, ergo</hi> this can no way bee <hi>ens</hi> no not in our phantasie; when I say <hi>quod non est,</hi> then I put <hi>ens sictum impossible,</hi> and to that I giue a <hi>quod</hi> but <hi>non est,</hi> so that in the end I say, <hi>ens est, quod est,</hi> that is; neither <hi>ens fictum possibile,</hi> nor <hi>ens fictum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibile;</hi> and therefore if wee will define <hi>ens fictum impossibile,</hi> it is <hi>non quod est,</hi> if wee define <hi>ens fictum possibile,</hi> it is <hi>quod non est.</hi> Now if neither <hi>ens fictum possibile,</hi> nor <hi>ens fictum impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> be <hi>entia,</hi> then <hi>ens est quod est.</hi> And againe, when I deny <hi>non quod est,</hi> I deny <hi>est,</hi> and when I deny <hi>quod non est,</hi> I deny <hi>est, ergo, ens est quod est.</hi> Againe, <hi>ens</hi> and <hi>bonum</hi> are all one, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>non ens</hi> and <hi>malum</hi> are all gone, therefore <hi>si ens non sit,</hi> then it is <hi>bonum</hi> and <hi>malum: ergo ens est quod est.</hi>
   </p>
   <q>Ens est primum vel à primo.</q>
   <p>If <hi>ens</hi> bee, it must bee either first absolutely which is not from another, or it must be from a first, that is from another, which is not from another: againe contradiction shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, for it is as if I should say, <hi>ens</hi> is <hi>non aliunde</hi> or <hi>aliunde;</hi> that is, it is of it selfe, or not of it selfe; and this is contradiction. But obiection may be made, that in the continuall generation of things, one thing is before another, as my father begot me, and another begot my father, and so in <hi>infinitum, ergo</hi> it is not necessary that <hi>ens</hi> should bee absolutely first or from a first. <hi>Answ.</hi> This is nothing, for am I from my father. This then hee was before I was, and I am after him, <hi>ergo</hi> here is <hi>prius</hi> and <hi>posterius,</hi> therefore here cannot bee eternitie, <hi>ergo</hi> this <hi>ens</hi> is not eternall. Againe, is not my fathers case as well as mine to bee from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and so all men till they come to <hi>ens primum:</hi> Yes, <hi>ergo</hi> all men are from others, till wee come to this first abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute being, which is not from any other; for then he should
<pb n="3" facs="3"/>
not bee <hi>primum: ergo ens est primum, vel à primo.</hi>
   </p>
   <q>Ens absolute primum est quod est seipso.</q>
   <p>First if there be <hi>ens primum</hi> or <hi>à primo,</hi> there must bee <hi>ens primum</hi> of necessity, for if there be <hi>ens primum,</hi> ye grant it me, if there be <hi>ens à primo,</hi> ye must also grant <hi>ens primum,</hi> therfore <hi>ens primum</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>primum,</hi> and <hi>maximè intelligibile,</hi> therefore A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists are here to be confuted, for they may sooner doubt whether they themselues bee, then whether God bee, for if they bee <hi>entia à primo,</hi> they must first know him, that is <hi>primum,</hi> before they can know themselues, for the cause is before the effect. <hi>Quod est seipso,</hi> it must be being either <hi>seip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so</hi> or <hi>aliunde,</hi> if <hi>aliunde, ne primum,</hi> for that from which it is, is <hi>prius</hi> vnto it, <hi>ergo est seipso.</hi> Obiect. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith that God is not <hi>seipso,</hi> neither any creature whatsoeuer, for then he saith, the same thing would be the cause of it selfe, and the effect. <hi>Resp.</hi> It is a meere sophisme, or rather an Amphibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia of the phrase. For when we say God is <hi>seipso,</hi> we doe not meane that he hath causes, but we meane priuatiuely that he is not <hi>aliunde,</hi> and <hi>est seipso,</hi> and <hi>est</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> are the same, it is <hi>quod est,</hi> and so <hi>est seipso.</hi>
   </p>
   <q>Ens primum est <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>.</q>
   <p>If he be <hi>seipso,</hi> thē he is without causes, that that is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly first must haue no causes, for then it is not absolutely first, <hi>ergo</hi> there can bee no <hi>scientia</hi> of him <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, for <hi>tunc scire dicimur cum causas scimus.</hi> Againe, first if he haue no causes, hee hath no end, <hi>ergo</hi> hee is not made for an end, <hi>ergo</hi> there can be no art of him to guide him to an end. So that wee finde in this respect that <hi>ens primum</hi> cannot bee the subiect of Art; Euery art is to guide the thing whereof it is an art to it <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. Againe, it euery art doth lay forth the causes, effects, subiects and the proper adiuncts of a thing, for if it haue no causes it can haue no qualities, and God hath none of these, <hi>ergo</hi> hee is not the subiect of Art. Hence againe, as this <hi>ens</hi> is beyond our reason, so hee is beyond our speech, either Grammar or Rhetoricke, so that concerning
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
this <hi>ens primū,</hi> whatsoeuer we thinke or speak it is imperfect. Now bring it to our Logicke after another sort, and we shall see this <hi>ens</hi> to be beyond Art. Our Logick bringeth vs first to a first efficient, &amp; in the resolution of any thing we go so far, as in the end we find a first efficient. Now this first efficient hath nothing before it, <hi>ergo</hi> that is beyond our reason, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what that is wee cannot tell, and therefore if wee shall make him an effect to looke out his causes, we shall not make him first, <hi>ergo</hi> hee is beyond all art; then againe there is no art but is an eternall rule in the Idea of God, as a precept of that thing whereof it is an art to guide it to its <hi>Eupraxie,</hi> therefore if there should be an art of him, there must bee a former <hi>ens</hi> which must haue the Idea of it, to shew how this <hi>ens primum</hi> was made, and whereby it must bee gouerned: so that he is not the subiect of our reason; so that whereas I said before, that <hi>ens</hi> was the subiect of our reason, here I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call it, and say that <hi>primū ens</hi> is beyond our Logick: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he being beyond all art, wee will goe them ouer more briefly, till we come to <hi>ens à primo.</hi> First then, he is without efficient, for he is without causes, <hi>ergo</hi> hee is vncreated: for the first matter, though it were without matter, and forme, yet it had an efficient, and an end, <hi>ergo</hi> was created: then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he is <hi>seipso, ergo</hi> he must be vncreated, hence also hee cannot be annihilated, neither generated, nor corrupted: againe, hence he is <hi>independens aliunde,</hi> and therefore <hi>supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum:</hi> againe, hence he is without matter: Now if hee bee without matter, therefore he is without <hi>genus, ergo</hi> is not a <hi>species</hi> either <hi>subalterna,</hi> or <hi>specialissima.</hi> Againe, if hee bee without forme as without <hi>genus,</hi> then he cannot be defined, <hi>ergo</hi> he must bee without limitation of essence, <hi>ergo</hi> without limitation of quantity, <hi>ergo</hi> without limitation of place, and because he is without beginning from any other thing, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is without any duration, and because hee is without any matter, <hi>ergo</hi> hee is truely spirituall, for so wee account things spirituall, according to the subtlenes of their matter, but he hath no matter at all: againe he being without matter and forme, <hi>ergo</hi> can be no <hi>membrum,</hi> because euery member
<pb n="5" facs="4"/>
containeth a portion of matter and forme, neither can he be an <hi>integrum,</hi> because that consisteth of members, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine part of matter, and forme. Now in that he is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly first, therefore he can be but <hi>vnum,</hi> for else there should be more: againe if there should bee more then one, then the one would say as well as the other, I am as forward as thee, and so none could be absolutely first. Againe he is no <hi>genus,</hi> for that is an vniuersall, or Synopsis of many together, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he is but one: so that now he is not properly an <hi>ens,</hi> but an <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, and aboue our Logicke: againe, in that hee is absolutely first he must needs bee without accidents (to vse their terme) without adiuncts, for they are second things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising from their substances, and <hi>in absolutè primo ente</hi> there must be nothing, but that which is <hi>absolutè primum:</hi> so that here we see his most simple being, and that he is beyond our Logicke. Now if he be without all <hi>potentia,</hi> both <hi>essentialis,</hi> and <hi>accidentalis,</hi> hee is pure act; so that this act now of his must needs be his <hi>essae,</hi> because he is pure act, for if he bee <hi>agere,</hi> then his <hi>esse,</hi> and <hi>agere</hi> are the same: so that if any one doth any thing, as euery <hi>ens à primo</hi> doth by <hi>potentia,</hi> it is not pure act: some say the Angels doe <hi>agere per essentiam,</hi> but it is false, vnlesse they meane that they act first by <hi>potentia:</hi> now indeed there is nothing, but it doth act <hi>per facultatem essentiae.</hi> First the forme, that is the beginner of act, and when it acts vpon matter internall, that is habituall, or a faculty, when it acts by the matter vpon some externall obiect, that is an act; for first there is the essence, the matter, and the forme, thē the faculty, the formes act vpon the matter internally; lastly, the act, which is of the forme, by the matter externally: now these are not in God, but are his very essence. Now we find then, that this <hi>primū ens</hi> must be <hi>actus,</hi> &amp; <hi>purus actus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no <hi>potentia</hi> in him at all, <hi>ergo</hi> it must needs bee, that he is <hi>primus actus, ergo optimus actus,</hi> for <hi>primus actus,</hi> and <hi>optimus actus</hi> are all one: Againe hence it must needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that if there bee any act of other things, it must needs bee from him, and therefore if there be any thing <hi>actu</hi> it must be from him: so then thus we haue found him abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in euery thing.</p>
   <q>
      <pb n="6" facs="5"/>Ens a primo.</q>
   <p>Now to returne to the first Syllogisme. If there be reason, there must bee an <hi>adaequatum subiectum</hi> of it, <hi>ergo ens à primo,</hi> for we haue heard that <hi>ens primum</hi> is beyond our reason, so that there must be <hi>ens à primo,</hi> which is <hi>adaequatum subiectum rationi,,</hi> and that now is liable to all our Logicke, for it hath causes, effects, subiects, adiuncts, &amp;c. and thus we will goe on, and see all the subiects of the arts in the concretion of <hi>ens à primo,</hi> which the Philosophers say, cannot bee demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
   <p>That we might dig deepe, and lay our foundation of Arts sure, I haue shewed that there is a being, and that it is double, the one from whom art is, the other in whom it shines, now we heard that <hi>ens est quod est,</hi> which is nothing but the true notation of <hi>ens</hi> resolued by Grammar <hi>quod est.</hi> Now for the continuall succession of things which some dreame of, this it is, if all things bee effects, there must bee so many causes, <hi>ergo</hi> in the end wee shall come to a first cause, that is not <hi>effectum:</hi> Further wee heard that <hi>ens primum,</hi> was <hi>quod est seipso,</hi> that is without any other: so that in propriety hee is neither <hi>essentia,</hi> nor <hi>ens</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. Hence he neither hath causes, neither is any argument that doth arise from causes, <hi>ergo</hi> is an <hi>indiuiduum,</hi> but not a <hi>species:</hi> hee is without end, <hi>ergo</hi> he is <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: hence he therefore was neuer made, <hi>ergo</hi> he made all things: hee is without definition, distribution, and properties, because he is without causes, <hi>ergo</hi> there can be no art of him, but he must bee the Author of art, as wee shall heare hereafter. He is <hi>merus actus,</hi> because hee is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>potentia,</hi> both <hi>substantialis,</hi> and <hi>accidentalis,</hi> againe hee is <hi>primus actus, ergo optimus actus, ergo</hi> whatsoeuer is well done of any thing is first from him, againe he is <hi>infinitus actus, ergo</hi> able to doe any finite thing, yea, and infinite.</p>
   <q>
      <pb n="7" facs="5"/>Ens à primo est, quod vt est à primo, sic est ex nihilo propter primum.</q>
   <p>First we proued before, that there is <hi>ens à primo,</hi> for <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium, &amp; adaequatum subiectum rationis est, at ens à primo est proprium &amp; adaequatum obiectum,</hi> rather then <hi>subiectum ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, ergo, Est à primo,</hi> that we heard before, for it cannot bee of it selfe, for then it should bee absolutely first, <hi>ergo</hi> not the subiect of our reason, <hi>ergo</hi> it is <hi>aliunde, ergo</hi> it is in the end for him that is not <hi>aliunde. Propter primum,</hi> euery <hi>ens à primo</hi> is made, <hi>ergo</hi> for an end, <hi>ergo</hi> at last <hi>propter primum,</hi> as <hi>propter finem:</hi> Againe <hi>optimus actus</hi> must doe nothing in vaine. It is a rule of nature in schooles, that God, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>nihil agunt frustra,</hi> which indeed is a generall rule of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke applyed to two speciall arts, naturall Philosophie, and Diuinitie. Now then at last wee shall finde euery thing to be made, for that which was neuer made, <hi>ergo propter pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum ens.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Obiect.</hi> But some things might bee made for things at are made.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> I suppose mediately, yet when all things are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, <hi>ergo</hi> made for an end, at length wee shall come to an end, that is not an effect, as all creatures are made for man, and man also being made, is therefore for an end, <hi>ergo</hi> for God: hence therefore we see that <hi>ens à prima</hi> is <hi>propter primū, ergo</hi> euery <hi>ens à primo</hi> hath his vigour, or <hi>impulsus</hi> from his first efficient whereby it is set forth to his end, so that the Lord hath shot out euery <hi>ens à primo</hi> as it were an arrow out of his bow to act his end: so that the vigour and <hi>impulsus</hi> of euery <hi>ens à primo,</hi> which it receiues from God, is that it may shoot at it end, <hi>ex nihilo,</hi> because there was onely a first efficient before it, for if it were <hi>ex aliquo,</hi> then there should be more firsts.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ob.</hi> But how can something be made of nothing.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ans.</hi> God is infinite both <hi>à parte aute,</hi> and <hi>à parte post; ergo</hi> hee can make things of nothing, which haue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="8" facs="6"/>
distance <hi>à parte ante,</hi> though not <hi>à parte post,</hi> for so eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature is infinite.</p>
   <q>Ens à primo est concretum.</q>
   <p>
      <hi>Ens à primo</hi> must bee both like, and vnlike <hi>primum:</hi> so the world is one, <hi>ergo</hi> like God, it is made of many simples, <hi>ergo</hi> vnlike him: so euery thing is one, <hi>ergo</hi> like God, but is <hi>concretum, ergo</hi> is vnlike him: so that euery creature must take a blow of God, as <hi>Iacob</hi> when he wrestled with the Angel tooke a blow on the hip, though hee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, whereby he was made lame. Againe our Logicke tels vs first of simples, and then of the disposing of them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ens à primo</hi> must be <hi>concretum</hi> of simples, because it must be liable to our reason; so that as before there was <hi>ens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was reason, so here this <hi>ens,</hi> which is the subiect of our reason must be <hi>concretum,</hi> because I must see it with my eye of Logicke. This <hi>concretum</hi> is of <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, the reason of it is this, this <hi>ens</hi> though it be for God, yet it is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately for man, as wee may see through all the creatures of God, <hi>ergo</hi> wee thus conclude, that euery thing was made for man, and man for God; for wee know that euery thing consists of matter, and forme, and the end of the matter and forme of a thing is to make vp the effect, and thus wee say, euery thing is it owne end. Now then in euery <hi>ente à pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> there must be an <hi>actus</hi> to cary it to man, and an <hi>actum,</hi> that is, that that is caried, that that is <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> is <hi>actus,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> is the <hi>actum,</hi> or that which is caried. So wee know that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke caries from the thing to man, and speech from man to man, that which he hath to seene with his Logicke. By <hi>actus</hi> I meane that which doth make the thing actually to bee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to mine eye: so that it cannot come to me, but <hi>actu,</hi> by act, and it must bring the <hi>actum:</hi> now this <hi>actus</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>; for as colour acts the externall thing to my externall eye, and is about the thing, so this <hi>actus</hi> doth to my reason, and is <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, that is, about euery thing, and is an obiect of my eye of reason, though it ariseth from the thing, and flieth about it. Now this <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> doth, <hi>concrescere</hi> both with it selfe, and
<pb n="9" facs="6"/>
with <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: so that Logicke is <hi>concrescus</hi> with Logicke, and with Grammar, and Rhetoricke, &amp;c. And hence it is called <hi>commune,</hi> because it is <hi>concrescens</hi> with <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, and with euery concretion <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, So that it is <hi>concrescens cum seipso, &amp; cum omnibus alijs concrescentibus.</hi> Now that that is <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, is the <hi>Logismos</hi> of the thing, or the <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> of it, and these are the <hi>actus</hi> of the thing: for I see euery thing by my Logicke, and that sees nothing but arguments, axioms, syllogismes, and method; <hi>ergo,</hi> I can see nothing but that that it doth thus dictate to my reason; <hi>ergo,</hi> Logicke doth act the <hi>actum,</hi> or that which is <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> to my reason. Now then there must be reason in euery thing, because I am to see euery thing by my Logicke, which is the rule of reason, <hi>ergo</hi> all things must be lyable to it, <hi>ergo</hi> it must apprehend the <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> in euery thing. Again, there must be <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> in euery thing, because though all things at the beginning were made for one man, yet by reason of sinne since his fall, one cannot see all things, therefore there must be a carrier from one man to another, that which one man sees with his eye of Logicke, hee may vtter it to another: so that <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> is <hi>actus rei ad hominem,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> is <hi>actus rei ab homine ad hominem.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now this <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> is eyther <hi>loquentia</hi> or <hi>eloquentia:</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this distribution is this, wee heard before that speech was a carrier from man to man; and because things that are reported, are not so easily receiued, as those which are seene by our eye of <hi>Logicke, ergo</hi> it was requisite that there should not onely be an <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, whereby things might be vttered, but also a fine sugering of them with Rhetoricke, for the more easie receiuing of them.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Eloquentia</hi> is eyther more fine or more graue; that is, <hi>soluta,</hi> or <hi>ligata:</hi> the reason is this, <hi>argumentum</hi> is <hi>artificiale,</hi> or <hi>inar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiale:</hi> now because speech is an inartificiall argument, and so not easily receiued, therefore Rhetoricke serues to deliuer the matter more soberly and grauely; and Poetry yet makes it more fine, where all things must be done by measure and sweet sounds.</p>
   <p>So that now we see how these generall Arts are <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>:
<pb n="10" facs="7"/>
and that they are not of so great necessitie in respect of the thing, as in regard of vs for our good: for, so as euery thing is made for man, so he must see them for his good, by that rule that they are created.</p>
   <p>These now though they be <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, because they are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall, yet they are <hi>ab ente primo,</hi> because there are causes, effects, subiects, adiuncts, &amp;c. and speech <hi>in ente à primo.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now the <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> is eyther quantitie or qualitie, the reason is this, euery <hi>ens à primo</hi> is finite, <hi>ergo</hi> must needs haue limits of quantitie, if he haue limits of essence.</p>
   <p>Quantitie is eyther discreet, or continued, for if euery thing be finite, then it must be discreet, or distinct from any other. Againe, as it is discreet, so it is continued, so farre as the forme extendeth the matter, whereby wee may see how farre it reacheth, and where it reacheth not. Now as there is quantitie, so also there must be qualitie in euery thing, for there is no <hi>ens à primo</hi> that is pure act, <hi>ergo</hi> it hath a forme act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon a matter, &amp; thence proceed all quantities. Againe, it being made for an end, must therefore act vnto its end.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Qualitas est natura, &amp; bonitas,</hi> euery thing hath nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath a matter and a forme, <hi>ergo</hi> there is nature in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing. And therefore <hi>Ramus</hi> saith, <hi>Forma est praecipua re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum natura:</hi> and the Philosophers call <hi>forma principium actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> and <hi>materia principium passionis.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now this <hi>ens</hi> being of this scantling for quantitie, and of this nature for act, must be good for Gods glory: so that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing hath a goodnesse in it. Againe, were all things made for man, and must hee see them with his reason? Yes: <hi>ergo</hi> they are good for him: <hi>ergo</hi> hee must haue a will to imbrace them as <hi>bona,</hi> as well as an eye of reason to see them as <hi>vera,</hi> and so man also is made for God, as his will acts goodnes.</p>
   <p>Now for the order of these, <hi>actus</hi> is before <hi>actum:</hi> for the one is <hi>actio,</hi> the other is <hi>passio,</hi> and <hi>actio</hi> is before <hi>passio,</hi> and is more excellent then it. Againe, <hi>actus</hi> doth <hi>concrescere</hi> with it selfe, and with the <hi>actum</hi> that is in the thing: <hi>ergo, actus</hi> is more generall; <hi>ergo</hi> is before <hi>actum.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Againe, because wee doe not giue names to things but
<pb n="11" facs="7"/>
with reason from some argument of Logicke in the thing: and againe, because there must be an <hi>actus</hi> from the thing to man, before there can be an <hi>actus</hi> from man to man, therefore the <hi>Logismes</hi> in the thing must be before the <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> in it; <hi>ergo</hi> Logicke is the most generall, and first in order of all arts.</p>
   <p>Of those things that are <hi>acta,</hi> quantitie is first, because it ariseth nexly from the matter, and forme of a thing: for first of all the matter, and forme limit the thing, when they are put together, before they act any thing, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they act one vpon the other. Now qualitie, that is the act of the forme vpon the matter; <hi>ergo,</hi> it is after quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, but before goodnesse, because that is the end of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures act. For seeing quantitie ariseth immediately from the matter and forme of a thing, and nature from the act of the forme vpon the matter: therefore goodnesse must be the last, as being the end of all the former: and thus did the Lord make all things, first making the causes effects of things, then imposing speech on them, then number, then measuring them by Geometrie, how farre their magnitude should reach, and where it should not reach, before it should act. Now this act of Nature was to goe no further vpon externall obiects, but onely be acted by the forme vpon the matter; whereas the morall act of goodnes was to goe further, for that is for God. Againe, Nature is the next inmost thing to quantitie, and Goodnes is last. And thus haue we seene all that is <hi>in ente à primo,</hi> which is the ground of all Arts.</p>
   <q>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> est, qua omnes artes comprehenduntur pro subordinatione finium.</q>
   <p>Now wee are come to Arts, and first wee are to beginne with Encuclopaidia, and the definition of it. First for the name, it is <hi>Orbis ille, &amp; Circulus Artium.</hi> The reason of it indeed is as much as Arts quite through, as wee vse to say when there are many poore folke to bee serued, though
<pb n="12" facs="8"/>
they stand in a long row, Haue you serued them round? But there is a further reason of it, A circle wee know is a round line, whose beginning and end meet together in a common point; therefore this learning in a Circle must be shewed to haue a common point, and that wee shall easily finde. The proper subiect of Art is <hi>Ens à primo,</hi> because we heard, that was made for an end. Now then from whence <hi>Ens à primo</hi> had his beginning, from thence must <hi>Ars</hi> haue his beginning: But from <hi>Ens primum</hi> it had his beginning, <hi>ergo.</hi> Againe, as <hi>Ens à primo</hi> hath for his beginning <hi>Ens primum,</hi> so it must haue <hi>Ens primum</hi> for his last end, because <hi>Ens primum</hi> is not made for any end, but is the last end of all things it selfe, <hi>ergo</hi> hee must also be the last end of Arte: Then here wee finde, as <hi>Ens primum</hi> is the beginning of Art, so also hee is the end of Art; because he is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and end of those things that are the subiects of arts; therefore there is one common point wherein they begin and end: <hi>ergo</hi> hauing the same beginning and end, here is <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. Now howsoeuer the phrase may seeme otherwise, as wee heard before, yet here wee see the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God in this name, though the Graecians did not know the reason of it when they gaue it. Now the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture seemeth to witnesse this truth. For the Lord saith, <hi>I am the beginning and the end:</hi> that is, of things. And againe, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega:</hi> these belong to Grammar, <hi>ergo</hi> to Art, <hi>ergo</hi> hee is both the beginning and end of things, and the Alpha and Omega of the Arts.</p>
   <p>That this wisedome is round, we may also see in regard of the subiect; for the World is round, and that is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of Art: <hi>ergo</hi> Art is so, for Art is an adiunct to it, and euery adiunct takes figure of his subiect. Againe, if we will take Art for Knowledge, Knowledge is in a mans head, and that is round, so <hi>Encuclopaidia</hi> is euery way <hi>in circulo:</hi> and thus wee see the reason, why this name should bee giuen to a Chaine, whose linkes are the Arts. Now if <hi>Ens primum</hi> be the cause of <hi>entia à primo,</hi> then he hath the Idea of them in him: for he made them by counsell, and not by
<pb n="13" facs="8"/>
necessity; for then he should haue needed them, and they haue a parelion of that wisedome that is in his Idea. Again, it must needs be that this wisedome is his, because hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes them by the rules of Art, for so euery rule of Art is a Statute-law of God, by which hee made the things, and whereby hee gouernes the things, whose art it is. Now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is so, therefore this Law hath God for the author, and looke what Idea was in the making of the thing, the same Idea is in the gouerning of it: for if the Lord should make it by one rule, and gouerne it by another, it would not serue the turne to guide the thing to the <hi>eupraxie,</hi> whereunto it was made. So that hence it followes, that euery rule of Art is eternall. Againe our rule of Logicke tells vs, that euery rule of Art is most true, and therefore is from God. For so euery rule is true, as it answers to that Idea that is in him: and is most iust, most wise; <hi>ergo</hi> is from God, who is most true, most iust, and most wise. Now it is in God as in the fountaine, &amp; it is in the creature too, but there it is by a refraction: for this wisedome comming to the creature, according as the creature is, such is the Arts order and course. So that if <hi>ens à primo</hi> be diuided into parts, this wisedome also will be diuided into parts: and as in a Looking-glasse that is broken, looke how many pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it is broken into, so many images shall you see: So for the Arts, looke into how many parts the thing is diuided, into so many parts will the Art be distributed.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Q.</hi> What is the next subiect of <hi>Ars</hi> in the thing?</p>
   <p>
      <hi>A.</hi> The Frame, as the tearme shewes: for so <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> in Greeke signifieth <hi>fabrica</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, because it is seene in the frame of the thing: so that the frame of the thing is taught in the Art. So when I say <hi>Dialectica est ars bene dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serendi,</hi> I doe not define Logicke, but I define the frame of reason: so that the parelion is the frame of the thing, and thence are the Arts written, and by the Art wee see the frame: so then <hi>Encuclopaidia</hi> is the wisedome of God in the thing, <hi>ergo</hi> the subiect of <hi>Encuclopaidia</hi> is <hi>Ars,</hi> that is the Frame of things.</p>
   <q>
      <pb n="14" facs="9"/>Qua comprehenduntur, <hi>or,</hi> continentur.</q>
   <p>The Chaine <hi>Encuclopaidia</hi> is not a <hi>genus</hi> to <hi>ars,</hi> no more then a Chaine is a <hi>genus</hi> to the Linkes, but an <hi>integrum:</hi> for as a Chaine is an <hi>integrum,</hi> and the Linkes <hi>membra;</hi> so <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuclopaidia</hi> is an <hi>integrum,</hi> and the Arts are the members that make vp the whole. Now as the linkes must be linked together, before there be a Chaine: so the Arts must be holden together, before there bee <hi>Encuclopaidia:</hi> so that euery Art is a linke, and they must be linked together to make vp the whole. Therefore I say, <hi>qua continentur,</hi> as parts, <hi>continentur à toto.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For Arts may be holden together; for there is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie among the Arts, for <hi>Ars in genere</hi> is <hi>genus</hi> to them all: Therefore as <hi>Tully</hi> saith, they haue a certaine common kinred, as being <hi>species</hi> of one <hi>genus:</hi> but this holding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether is after another manner then linkes in a Chaine; namely, <hi>pro subordinatione finium:</hi> Therefore they are not holden together confusedly, and as they come to hand, but euery one must haue his ranke according to the generalitie of the end thereof. So that if wee linke Grammar on the Chaine before Logicke, wee doe not right: and so in like sort for the other Arts.</p>
   <p>I say, <hi>qua omnes artes,</hi> because as a Chaine that hath not all his linkes, is not perfect, because it wants some parts: so the Chaine of Arts will not be perfect, if there be any wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; the rule of Logicke teacheth vs so much: for <hi>Encu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clopaidia</hi> is a <hi>totum, ergo</hi> if any <hi>membra</hi> be wanting, there will not be a <hi>totum</hi> made vp. And thus we haue heard the definition of <hi>Enculopaidia.</hi> Now the subiect of it is <hi>Ars,</hi> as the notation of it <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> sheweth: and this wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is one in him, but is made various in the thing.</p>
   <q>
      <pb n="15" facs="9"/>Ars est quae constat praecaeptis primè verissiméque scientificis rei suae ad <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> continuatis.</q>
   <p>First for the word <hi>Ars.</hi> For the Latine tearme diuers haue diuersly sought for the notation of it. Some say it commeth of <hi>arctus</hi> a Sinew: some of <hi>arx</hi> a Tower. Now those that say it comes of <hi>arctus</hi> a Sinew, giue this reason, Because the sinew is the strongest part in a man: for though the bones be stronger in some respect, yet because they will breake, whereas the sinew will bend, <hi>ergo</hi> the sinewes are stronger, so the arts in a thing serue to strengthen it for its <hi>Eupraxie.</hi> If it come of <hi>arx</hi> a Tower, wee know that it is impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the matter and building, and for the forme also it is excellent, and so the strongest thing in the world: so the Arts are for matter inuincible, for forme most goodly.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ars</hi> in Greeke is called <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, which signifieth <hi>Fabrica,</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>Fabrico,</hi> because it is seene in the frame of the thing. But, as wee heard, the frame of the thing is the subiect of Art: and when I say, <hi>Logica est ars bene disseren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> I doe not define Logicke, but the frame of reason, as it hath framed man: so when I say <hi>Grammatica est ars bene lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendi,</hi> I describe speech as it is to be framed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when wee call it <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, it is a Metonimie of the Subiect for the Adiunct. So that here wee may see, that Art is the wisedome of God, but yet as it is <hi>energetick</hi> in the thing, so it is called <hi>Ars,</hi> So that marke this, that Art is the Law of God, whereunto he created things, whereby he gouerneth them, and whereunto they yeeld obedience: for by their obedience wee come to see this frame; therefore this Art is Gods wisedome, as it is resplendent in the things, which is but as a drop of water to the whole Ocean sea, in respect of the infinite wisedome that is in him. Marke this well, for the Schooles runne into many absurdities, whilest they haue thought that Art is in a mans head, and not in the thing.</p>
   <q>
      <pb n="16" facs="10"/>Quae constat.</q>
   <p>I make no <hi>genus</hi> of it, for it is <hi>genus summum</hi> in its kind, as <hi>Ens</hi> also is.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ob.</hi> But the Schooles say Art is an intellectuall vertue, <hi>ergo</hi> hath <hi>virtus</hi> for his <hi>genus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ans.</hi> It is no <hi>genus</hi> of Art, neither is <hi>Ars quatenus</hi> it is Art in the thing a vertue; but as it is <hi>scientia</hi> in mans head, so indeed it belongs to the Ethickes: for if <hi>virtus</hi> were a <hi>genus</hi> to <hi>Ars,</hi> vertue belongs to Ethickes: and so by this reason, Ethickes should be the most generall Art, and also by that reason Ethickes should be vnder Ethickes: for <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus intellectualis</hi> is but a little part of them, therefore this is <hi>fallacia accidentis,</hi> as they call it.</p>
   <p>Againe, to call it an habit as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith it is, and as the Schooles make it, that conceit is very simple, for <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> or <hi>quantitas habitualis</hi> belongeth to Logicke, and is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a speciall kinde of adiunct: therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth define <hi>homo</hi> to be <hi>genus rationale,</hi> whereas wee know <hi>genus</hi> is but an adiunct <hi>animal,</hi> which is the <hi>genus</hi> of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo:</hi> so that it is not Art in the thing, but the knowledge he hath of it, which is adioyned to man. Now wee haue heard, that Art is the wisedome of God, <hi>in ente à primo,</hi> and the frame of the creature is in the antitype of this wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and is a subiect of Art. I say <hi>Ars est quae constat,</hi> though it be the frame of the thing. Now <hi>constare</hi> is to stand together in parts.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Q.</hi> How come Arts to haue parts, being but that one wisedome in God?</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ans.</hi> Not in regard of God, but in respect of the frame of the thing where wee see it. For euen as Gods Mercy and Iustice are one, but various in respect of the obiect: It is Mercy to him that comes before him in Christ; it is Iustice to him that appeares before him without Christ: So Art is one in God, but is various in respect of the various worke it hath wrought in the creation of things, and that it act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in their gouernment to their end. Againe, those parts
<pb n="17" facs="10"/>
must <hi>constare,</hi> for in the frame of the thing the subiects of the Arts doe <hi>constare, ergo</hi> this wisedome following them must <hi>constare</hi> in his parts: and as one thing hath his frame, and another his, differing from the other; hence the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Arts must be various, and must <hi>constare</hi> one with another; hence it followes, that in Art wee must haue no rules but those that will <hi>constare,</hi> and are essentiall to it. So that if wee bring a rule af Grammar into Logicke, or <hi>è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trá:</hi> or if wee leaue out of Logicke some essentiall rule to it, it will not <hi>constare:</hi> againe if the rules of Art be disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they will not stand together: therfore when I say <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stare,</hi> I say two things, first that euery Art must haue all the rules, that are essentiall to it, and no more: &amp; secondly, that euery precept must be placed in his due order, and rancke. For as a Painter that makes the picture of a man would make it verie deformed, if hee should set the head where the feet should bee, or <hi>contra:</hi> so were it as absurd for an Artist to disorder his Art.</p>
   <q>Constat praeceptis.</q>
   <p>Euery thing hath his speciall acts before it can work that maine act, for which it was made, as reason must haue two parts, it must see the simple causes, effects, subiects, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncts, &amp;c. and Axiomes, Syllogismes, and Method, that it may <hi>benè disserere,</hi> therefore there are many pettie acts of reason to be performed, which though they all conspire in one maine act, yet are they not one another: and here we see, that as Arts did arise from the frame of the thing: so the precepts of Art are from the Acts of things: so that thus Arts <hi>constant praeceptis</hi> or <hi>regulis,</hi> all is one, both are good, &amp; <hi>regere</hi> is as large as <hi>regula,</hi> and <hi>praeceptum</hi> as <hi>praecipere.</hi> But my reason why I rather chuse <hi>praeceptum</hi> is this, because <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi> is tropicall, for it is often taken for a Square or Rular, whereby we rule any thing, and this is a grand Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che. And againe, because the Lord hath created, &amp; gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his creatures by the precepts of arts, as by so many sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
<pb n="18" facs="11"/>
or Cōmandements of the things act for his <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, as at the Creation, when the Lord said, Let there be light, by this rule, as by a Precept did the Lord create light, and also gouerns it. It is a Law as God gouernes reason, speech, quantity, &amp;c. by the rule of Logick, Grammar, Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; and euen as a King gouerneth his Dominions by his Lawes: so the Lord gouerneth his Creatures by the rules of Arts: and because the Creation began with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, therefore we still hold it, and they may bee called Lawes, Statutes or Commandements, &amp;c. euen as the Lord calleth his Lawes for man Commandements. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine I rather call the rules of Arts <hi>praecepta,</hi> then <hi>regulae,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they being shortly deliuered are as so many short di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the guiding of the thing to the end thereof.</p>
   <q>Primè verissimèque scientificis.</q>
   <p>Euery Precept of Art, must be <hi>scientificum,</hi> that is making knowledge: <hi>scientia</hi> (saith our Logick) is the iudgement of a necessarie Axiome, and therefore must bee so true, so iust, and so wise, as nothing can bee more true, more iust, more vvise. Why? so are the Precepts of Art both in God, and in the Creature, for as for deductions the Lord hath shut them vp in a briefe rule of Art; for looke how many vses there may be of a rule of Art in the thing whose rule it is, so many deductions will there arise from that rule. Now man not being able to take this wisdome from God, which is most simple, therefore it hath pleased the Lord to place it in the things, and as flowers doe send out a sent, or odor that doth affect our sense of smelling, so eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry precept of Art doth <hi>spirare</hi> a sweet science to our glasse of Vnderstanding, which is indeed that irradiation, which we heard of in Diuinity in the Creation of things: but it is called <hi>scientia</hi> by a Trope, for as the sent of a flower is not properly odor, but that that doth affect the sense; and as when we see a strange thing, we say, looke what a sight is yonder, whereas sight is properly of the eye: so wee
<pb n="19" facs="11"/>
call Art a <hi>scientia,</hi> or sweet sauour in respect of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, which is a metonimy of the adiunct for the Subiect.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Quest.</hi> Now how doe they <hi>scientificare?</hi> how are they <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> Wee haue heard how they are in the things, and from thence they doe come by an irradiation, to the Glasse of our vnderstanding, and as the Sunne beames comming through a redde or blew glasse, &amp;c. will bring the colour of the glasse with them to our sense: so doth the irradiation of Art from the thing bring the colour of the thing with it to our vnderstanding. I meane that this irradiation doth bring the frame of the thing with it, according to which we see it. Now then first it is called the wisedome of God, as it is one in him, then is it called <hi>ars,</hi> as it is in the thing, and when it is brought by an irradiation to our vnderstanding, the first Act of it is to see the simples in the things, and this is called our <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentia,</hi> for it is that perspicacie whereby wee looke at the inuention that is in the thing: so that it is the first Act of our <hi>intellectus.</hi> As it is receiued in an axiome, we call it <hi>sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia.</hi> It is our <hi>sapiētia</hi> as we can discourse with it syllogisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally: &amp; as we apply it rightly in time, and place, so it is <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia.</hi> And it is <hi>Ars</hi> as we can execute it, and practise it in <hi>Analysi</hi> or <hi>Genesi,</hi> as <hi>Ars</hi> is rightly an intellectual vertue, as we teach it to another it is <hi>doctrina,</hi> and his learning is <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplina;</hi> lastly, as we set it downe in writing or printing, it is <hi>liber.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And euery rule of Art is true, as when I say, <hi>Rosa est flos, Socrates est homo,</hi> though there be neuer a Rose or <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> in the world, because the rule is eternall, for it is in the eternall Idea of God, though the thing be not. Now some Meta-Phisitians, not distinguishing aright hereof, say the thing is eternall, that is (say they) the thing was in Gods eternall Idea; nay the Idea of God is eternall, but not the thing. I but <hi>Kickerman</hi> saith, the thing is eternall <hi>quoad essentiam,</hi> not <hi>quoad existentiam,</hi> but that is false, for
<pb n="20" facs="12"/>
      <hi>existere</hi> belongs to <hi>effectum</hi> in Logick, and euery effect must haue all the causes, <hi>ergo</hi> matter, and forme, and these are not eternall.</p>
   <q>Primè,</q>
   <p>For there is no rule of Art, but is a necessary Axiome in its owne place, and so is firstly true. Now deductions are true but at the first, second, third, or fourth hand, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they are drawne from the first rule, at the second, third, or fourth hand, and are so far forth true, as the first rule is true; therefore when we dispute with any Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, we bring our controuersie to a rule of Art, and if they deny that, wee say <hi>contra negantem principia, non est dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum,</hi> though there is no rule of Art but may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, and is first because it deliuereth the first causes of the things.</p>
   <q>verissimèque,</q>
   <p>Euerie rule of Art as it is <hi>prima scientia,</hi> so it is <hi>verissima:</hi> but for deductions, as they are <hi>secundae,</hi> or <hi>tertiae scientiae,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they arise from the first rule, so they are <hi>secundo,</hi> or <hi>tertio</hi> true, to wit, so farre forth as the first is true.</p>
   <q>concinnatis rei.</q>
   <p>Here is the subiect of <hi>Ars,</hi> and as <hi>praecepta</hi> were the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and <hi>primè verissiméque scientificis</hi> were the qualities before: I doe not say <hi>fabricae,</hi> for that is but one thing, whereas the rules of Arts are many. Againe Art is the rule of the gouernment of the thing, as well as of the frame of it, therefore here is <hi>ens,</hi> or <hi>res</hi> in generall: I doe not say <hi>concinnatis</hi> to any one thing, because as <hi>Ars</hi> in <hi>genere</hi> is to all the speciall Artes; so is <hi>ens</hi> in <hi>genere</hi> to all the speciall <hi>entia.</hi> Now if you aske me what <hi>res</hi> is, I told you before in the definition of <hi>ens,</hi> so that it was defined before, but here I take it as a subiect of Art.</p>
   <q>
      <pb n="21" facs="12"/>Concinnatis.</q>
   <p>I had not a better word, and therefore was faine to take this, though it doth not fit my purpose, as I would, for the thing indeed is made to the rule, and not the rule to the thing, though we first see the thing, and by the Act therof obserue the rule, <hi>Concinnatis</hi> to fit together, or to sing in parts, so that euery thing must be placed in order, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted each to other, for nothing can bee wisely done, if the precepts of Art be broken.</p>

   <p>We haue heard what <hi>encuclopaidia</hi> is, <hi>qua Artes compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henduntur, pro subordinatione finium,</hi> and what <hi>Ars</hi> is. Now we come to the common affections belonging to Art, and they are <hi>praxis,</hi> and <hi>prattomenon.</hi> That Art hath his <hi>praxis,</hi> and <hi>prattomenon,</hi> I thus proue it: If the end of things bee an <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, then as there is that <hi>actio,</hi> or <hi>motus:</hi> so there must be a <hi>res motu facta,</hi> the <hi>prattomenon.</hi> But the end of euery thing is an <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: therefore I proue it is an <gap reason="foreign">

      </gap>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>laus rei est in actione,</hi> and if there should be any thing made, that had not an end, it were in vaine. Againe, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is Gods worke, and he is pure Act, therefore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing must agree to him, and so <hi>agere.</hi> And if there be a <hi>praxis</hi> and a <hi>prattomenon</hi> of the thing, there must needs be a <hi>praxis</hi> and <hi>prattomenon</hi> of Art, because the thing is fitted to the rule of Art, and not Art to the thing. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why some haue dreamed that euerie Art hath not his <hi>praxis</hi> and <hi>prattomenon</hi> is, that false distinction of Arts into
<pb n="22" facs="13"/>
theoreticall, and practicke, they call them theoreticall which they doe onely contemplate; practicke when wee can by art <hi>agere.</hi> But there is no art but is both theoreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and practicke, for as we heard before, that wee might both <hi>scire, sapere,</hi> and <hi>intelligere, &amp;c.</hi> so we may contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, and <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>ergo</hi> this distribution is <hi>fallacia acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentis,</hi> for they doe not distinguish art as it is in the thing, but from their owne knowledge of it.</p>

   <p>
      <hi>Answ.</hi> It is <hi>ars</hi> as it is <hi>in fabrica rei,</hi> not as it is <hi>in homine,</hi> but there is <hi>Praxis,</hi> and <hi>prattomenon</hi> in euery thing, as in the Sunne we may see, his motion is <hi>praxis,</hi> his course that he makes is <hi>Prattomenon:</hi> againe, man doth not contemplate onely, but also worke by the rule of Astronomy, and by nature, as in the sowing of corne, and planting of trees, &amp;c. Now for practicke they say they are such as doe only prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and leaue no worke behinde them: or they are also poieticke, and leaue a worke behinde them. Of the first sort they make Ethickes, Oeconomickes, Politicks, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, Optickes, and others. Why? doth not the Ethician worke a good morall action, or vertue, by his rule of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thickes? and hath not the good husbandman in working by the rule of Oeconomicks his <hi>prattomenon</hi> as well, as his <hi>praxis?</hi> and so of the rest. Is not the Common-wealth the <hi>prattomenon</hi> of a good Politician to be gouerned by him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of the Politickes? so for Musicke is there not a song sung, as well as the singing of it? and when they set their song we see it plaine, that there is an <hi>opus</hi> as well as a <hi>motus.</hi> Now they had these from <hi>Aristotle,</hi> but they are false, and it is not commendable in the Creator, that euery thing should haue his <hi>praxis,</hi> and <hi>prattomenon.</hi> Againe it doth not resemble the Creator, who is <hi>purus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> vnlesse there be a <hi>motus</hi> in it, and a <hi>res motu facta,</hi> as the rule of Logicke teacheth in the doctrine of <hi>effectum,</hi> and not onely Logicke, but also Grammar teacheth so
<pb n="23" facs="13"/>
much, for there is <hi>scriptio,</hi> and <hi>scriptum;</hi> so in Arithmetick there is a numbring, and a thing numbred. So for Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry there is a measuring, and a thing measured: and so for all other arts. And it cannot be otherwise by the rule of Grammar, for euery verbe is a transitiue, and that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actiue, or neuter, and both of them gouerne an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiue case, which is rhe subiect into which they passe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, as <hi>amo patrem, Pater</hi> is the subiect vnto which <hi>amo</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth ouer: and <hi>sero</hi> a verbe neuter hath his subiect in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as when I say, I sow, it is as if I should say, I sow seed. therefore there is a <hi>prattomenon</hi> of euery Art, as well as a <hi>praxis.</hi> For if a man smels, he smels something, and when hee sees, hee sees something, and drinking, hee drinkes drinke.</p>
   <q>Praxis est artis in agendo motus.</q>
   <p>There is nothing that can act <hi>sine motu,</hi> but only God: and hence it is that <hi>motus</hi> is generall to euery effect, and therefore is an effect by our rule of Logicke.</p>
   <q>Praxis <hi>is</hi> Genesis, <hi>and</hi> Analysis.</q>
   <p>These two belong to art in like sort, because they belong to the thing where Art is, for if you grant a <hi>motus</hi> of euery thing, it must either be from principles to the making vp of a thing, or to the resoluing of it. Now if Art make vp a thing, it can also vndoe it, for the way is the same, onely there is a progresse, and regresse: so if I by my rule of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar ioyne a nominatiue case, and a verbe together, I can also by the same rule vndoe them againe, and see whether it be true; and this we call construing of Latine, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> indeed is distruing, for it is Analysis, for we pull that asunder, which <hi>Tully</hi> hath layd together, and indeed no ne can well vndoe a thing, but he that made it, or one that knowes how to make it: and therefore we doe not send for a Ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to pull downe a house, but for a Carpenter, <hi>ergo</hi>
      <pb n="24" facs="14"/>
if euery thing haue his <hi>Genesis</hi> and <hi>Analysis</hi> Art must also haue them, which follow the thing.</p>
   <q>Genesis est progressus artis a simplicibus ad composita.</q>
   <p>This Art hath his <hi>Genesis,</hi> which is a progresse, for <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> begins at the simples, and so goes to the composites, therefore must needs be a progresse, now euery thing but God is composed of simples, therefore there must needes be a <hi>Genesis</hi> of euery Art which still followes the thing. So Logicke first lookes at the inuention of things, then at the axioms, syllogismes, and method. So Grammar first begins with letters, then with syllables, then with words, then with sentences: and Arithmeticke first considereth simple number, then comparatiue, &amp;c. So Geometry first lookes at lines, then at superficies, then at <hi>corpus:</hi> so naturall Philosophy first begins with simple natures, then with composites, first with those that are without life, then those that liue, first a simple life, secondly those that liue a composite life.</p>
   <q>Analysis est regressus a compositis ad simplicia.</q>
   <p>
      <hi>Analysis</hi> is an vnwinding of a bottome of thred, which we wound vp before: so we analyse that which was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nised before, so that it is a <hi>regressio, &amp;c.</hi> for that way that you tooke in <hi>genesi,</hi> the same way you take in <hi>analysi,</hi> onely you begin at diuers ends. So in Logicke wee take an axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome, and resolue it into arguments, and so in Grammar we take a sentence, and resolue it into words, and so when I aske what a word signifies, he that telleth me the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it doth analyse it, and so for the other arts as wee heard before in the doctrine of <hi>Genesis.</hi> Now the Schooles thought that <hi>genesis</hi> and <hi>analysis</hi> belong to Method in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, which happily they might haue from <hi>Aristotle;</hi> who intituleth his bookes <hi>Analytickes,</hi> and thence they make method to be double <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to euery art, therefore must be taught <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>:
<pb n="25" facs="14"/>
and againe, there is <hi>genesis,</hi> and <hi>analysis</hi> of one and the same axiome, as when I seeke for a cause, or any other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to make an axiome, or when I resolue it into a cause, &amp;c. so that when I aske, what is Latine for such a word, I genise it, and englishing it I analyse it, so that they belong not to method, which is a disposition, for they may be of one word; againe, they may be as well of any other rule as of method. Now because they did obserue the <hi>analysis</hi> and <hi>genesis</hi> in method more vsually, then of art in generall, therefore they thought them to belong onely to it; now indeed if I take any rule of art from other rules of art, I practise method, therefore they may bee speciall practises of method, for as I said before they may be in any other rule of Art, as well as in it. And method is not dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble because of them, no more then any rule of Art is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because of the double vse of it, and these are the life of Art, therefore those that will be expert for practice of any Art, let them practise these. Now for the generall arts, I thinke none will doubt, but that they belong to them, but for the speciall arts there may be some doubt. If you draw any deduction from any first rule of any speciall Art, it is <hi>genesis;</hi> or if you draw deduction vnto a first rule from it, it is <hi>analysis, &amp;c.</hi> So when you examine the Sunnes course by the rule of Astronomie, it is <hi>genesis, analysis contra.</hi> This <hi>analysis</hi> if it be imitated (for so it pleaseth the Lord to let vs resolue his creatures) that we may worke alike, that is called <hi>imitatio:</hi> so that those that haue writ so much of <hi>imitatio,</hi> are to bring it hither, and <hi>imitatio</hi> is generall, as we imitate some <hi>analysis</hi> of something that is genised. And indeed all our practice is nothing but <hi>genesis</hi> imitatiue of <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: so a child when hee writes a copy by his masters example doth imitate him, for first he lookes at the line, then at the sentences, then at the words, and lastly at the letters. So a prentise when he works according as his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster teacheth him, doth imitate his example: and thus as we see Gods wisedome making vp the thing, so we see mans worke in imitating God.</p>
   <q>
      <pb n="26" facs="15"/>Vbi genesis desinit, ibi incipit analysis.</q>
   <p>For if <hi>genesis</hi> be <hi>progressus à simplicibus ad composita,</hi> and <hi>analysis regressus à compositis ad simplicia,</hi> then <hi>genesis desinit vbi incipit analysis: at, ergo;</hi> againe it followes that <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysis coniuncta</hi> is <hi>verè hermineutica,</hi> or <hi>interpretatiua,</hi> for when I haue an example, and doe resolue the <hi>prattomenon,</hi> giuing to euery art his owne, I tell you all that is to bee seene in the thing, as in this example, <hi>homo est bulla,</hi> but this latter consecution will come in better in the doctrine of <hi>prattomenon.</hi>
   </p>
   <q>Prattomenon est res motu artis facta.</q>
   <p>
      <hi>Prattomenon</hi> is that that the Art hath done by his <hi>praxis,</hi> for <hi>actio</hi> must goe before <hi>passio,</hi> and <hi>praxis</hi> is before <hi>pratto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,</hi> and there is nothing, but it is made for man, and therefore must haue a <hi>prattomenon,</hi> for else the motion of it would be little worth: now to <hi>prattomenon</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs two things, <gap reason="foreign">

      </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, for when Art hath acted, and acted a worke, it resteth not there, for it is for an vse, therefore there must goe with <hi>prattomenon,</hi> an vse thereof. Now this vse may bee confused with the <hi>pratto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> of other arts; so that this rule is here to bee taught, that the arts for their precepts are distinct, but not for the vse of their <hi>prattomena:</hi> for vse holds the <hi>prattomena</hi> of arts together, as in this example, all flesh is grasse, if it be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For in this there is the <hi>prattomenon</hi> of Logicke, Grammar, Rhetoricke, Naturall Philosophie, and lastly the <hi>prattomenon</hi> of Diuinity. Hence wee say the vse of arts is generall, but we mean the vse of the <hi>prattomenon</hi> of arts, for the precepts of art are not only distinct, but the <hi>praxis</hi> to, and the <hi>prattomenon</hi> also till wee come to the <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> of it: as we may see in a Shipwright, his rule of art is distinct, his <hi>motus</hi> is distinct, and his <hi>prattomenon</hi> is distinct, till you come to looke at the manifold vse of his <hi>prattomenon.</hi> So first the shepheard hath his <hi>prattomenon,</hi> then the grasier he vseth the <hi>prattomenon</hi> of the shepheard, the butcher vseth

the <hi>prattomenon</hi> of the grasier, and the Cooke vseth the <hi>prattomenon</hi> of the butcher, and they that eate the meat the Cooke hath dressed vse his <hi>prattomenon.</hi> So that if the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher will dispute as we say, he disputes as a Logician making axiomes, or syllogismes, and so takes the <hi>prattome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> of Logicke, and vseth it in naturall Philosophie. So the Taylor takes cloth made to his hand, and he vseth it to this, or that end, to make such, or such a garment with it. There is also that <gap reason="foreign">

      </gap>, for as the <hi>prattomenō</hi> of euery art may be ioyned w<seg rend="sup">th</seg> the <hi>prattomenon</hi> of other arts: so it must be proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they be not so confused together, but that they may be seuered againe. So I can take magnitude from a body by the rule of Geometry, for whilst I take the <hi>pratto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi> of any thing, and cary it to the art to which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth, that is <hi>apharesis,</hi> it hath beene taught in Schooles to be peculiar onely to Geometry, but it doth not take magnitude from the thing, but seeth it there distinct, and pulls it from another, and giues that <hi>prattomenon</hi> its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vse, and so lookes at it by that art whose <hi>prattomenon</hi> it is, and so doth euery art whatsoeuer, <hi>ergo</hi> it is generall to them all.</p>
   <q>Posterior ars prioris vtitur opere.</q>
   <p>This is from the vse, so we may see in manuall arts, the shepheard hath his <hi>prattomenon,</hi> and the Grasier he takes, and vseth it, and then the Butcher vseth the grasiers <hi>pratto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,</hi> and the Cooke he vseth the Butchers, &amp;c. and thus we haue heard of art in generall.</p>

the Arts of them, namely, Logicke, Grammar, and Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke be generall: and because the other doe not <hi>concro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scere</hi> with the rest, but onely in part, <hi>ergo</hi> they are more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, for though number, and magnitude may <hi>concrescere</hi> with nature, but not with all other Arts, as Logicke, &amp;c. therefore they are not so generall. Now things are more generall, or speciall in vse, <hi>ergo</hi> the Art which still runnes on with the thing must bee distributed accordingly, not that I here distribute Art into <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>species,</hi> for in that sense they are all alike, yea the most speciall Art is as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, as that which is most generall, therfore take heed of that, for I doe not meane so, but I meane that some Arts are more generall in respect of the generall vse of their <hi>prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomenon,</hi> and some are more speciall in regard of the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vse of it, as one Art may be without another, and by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is before it, as one is before two, for so Logick need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not any other Art, but all the rest haue need of it.</p>

   <p>This generall Art hath for his subiect euery thing, <hi>ergo</hi> I thus define it; It is the splendor or light that brings the thing to man from man: now in that it is of generall vse, it must needs be <hi>vbique.</hi> But is <hi>ens in genere</hi> the subiect of the generall Art? yes, but at the second hand, it is firstly the subiect of <hi>ars in genere.</hi> Now there are generall to <hi>ens in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere</hi> these two adiuncts, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, therefore the Arts of them must be generall, and in euery thing: so that if you looke at <hi>ens quatenus ens,</hi> it belongs to <hi>ars, quatenus ars,</hi> if you looke at the reason or <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> in the thing, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Logicke, Grammar, or Rhetoricke; so that looke at <hi>ens:</hi> as the Metaphysitians teach it, and you shall finde all their doctrine to be here, or in Logicke, or in Diuinitie, about the efficiency of God. Now I say it is <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>non ens</hi> by consequence, but <hi>non ens</hi> is more speciall, and belongs to <hi>contraria negantia</hi> in Logicke, but <hi>ens fictū</hi> is more generall. I say <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, or <hi>circa,</hi> not but that it is in the thing, for the <hi>Logicū artificiū</hi> of God is in euery thing: but it
<pb n="29" facs="16"/>
is in the outside of it, and flyes out of it, and acts outwardly to me, and in that respect I call it <hi>circa,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: I say <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> also, for there can bee no Art of <hi>non ens;</hi> for <hi>non ens</hi> is no creature, and Art is the wisedome of God, and therefore is of that that is something. Now the Poets fall into many figments, but they meane there by things, and so they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to some speciall Arts: and all <hi>Esops</hi> Fables, and other fables are but Allegories belonging to natural Philosophy, or to morall Philosophy, thought there may bee fables of any Art, for <hi>fabula</hi> belongs to rhetoricke, which is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Art.</p>
   <q>Ars generalis est rationis, <hi>or</hi> orationis.</q>
   <p>This generall Art running according to the generall thing, that is, which is of generall vse, is either the <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: now the <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> is more generall, because the thing must first be carried to me, before I can deliuer it to another. Againe, the <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> is of absolute necessity in euery thing, and therefore must needs be there, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> is therefore generall because it may be eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, but is not; For it is impossible for vs to see any thing without there be reason in it, <hi>ergo</hi> Logicke the Art that made it, is most generall, and <hi>omnium</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> and therefore by nature is first, for other arts cannot bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, that may be without them. And thus now wee are come to Logicke.</p>
