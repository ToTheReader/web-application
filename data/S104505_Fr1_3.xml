   <head>A
PREAMBVLATORY
EPISTLE vnto P. R.
the Mitigator.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be but two Romish Maladies
(Master P. R.) which in my books of
<hi>Discouery</hi> and <hi>Full Satisfaction</hi> might
stand need of your <hi>Mitigation:</hi> the
one is the vsurped and transcendent
Iurisdiction of the Pope aduanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all Christian Kingdomes, to the troubling or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting
of all Princes and people of contrary Religion;
the other is your professed Art of <hi>mentall Equiuocation.</hi>
The first of these I haue proued to be (in the Protestant
States) the Damme, and the second the Baud to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion:
therefore haue I been by you censured for <hi>a false
and slandrous Libeller.</hi> But if, as the woman in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of her cause appealed from the Iudge sleeping vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same Iudge better informed, you will giue me
leaue to appeale from <hi>P. R.</hi> as he is a <hi>Passionate Railer,</hi>
vnto <hi>P. R.</hi> as he is a <hi>Placable Reasoner;</hi> then I am sure
no man shall proue either me <hi>a false slanderer,</hi> or you a
true <hi>Mitigator:</hi> because you in your <hi>Treatise</hi> haue esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
<pb facs="5"/>
such a Papall authority, which (after denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sentence) may depriue Protestant Kings (in
your opinion Heretikes) of their Kingdomes; making
all such Protestant Princes and all their adherents also
alliable vnto all those penalties, which the Popish Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
by you defended, haue awarded against Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,
which are, losse of lands, of honours, and of their
liues; so farre, as to allow that euery man may in such
a case sheath his sword in his brothers throat: not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing
your fellowes, who conclude that all this
must be done, when there is sufficient meanes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
And shall not Protestants (except they will
acknowledge themselues to haue deserued a new Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre)
call this your doctrine execrable and <hi>rebellious?</hi>
We reade of <hi>Petilian</hi> a Donatist, who to the end he
might moderate and mitigate the sharpe reproach of
the crueltie of his sect intended against the Orthodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xall
Professors, did make a great boast of courtesie and
humanitie: against whom <hi>S. Augustine</hi> writeth thus:
<hi>Isto modo &amp; miluus,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Aug. lib. 2. adu. Petil. cap. 83.</note>
      <hi>cùm columbos rapere non potuerit,
columbum se nominat; vbi enim potuistis, &amp; non fecistis?</hi>
That is, <hi>By this meanes</hi> (saith S. Augustine) <hi>a Kite, when
he can not seize vpon a Doue, will be a Doue: for, I pray
you, when did you spare vs, being able to hurt vs?</hi> The
like boast of other Heretikes, called <hi>Rogationists,</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the like Answer:<note place="margin">August. Ep. 48. ad Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</note> to wit: <hi>Nulla bestia, si neminem
vulneret, proptereà mansueta dicitur, si dentes &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
non habet: saeuire vos nolle dicitis, ego non posse ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitror;
si autem possetis, quanta faceretis, quandò nihil
potestis, &amp; non cessatis?</hi> That is, <hi>There is no beast, which
may be called tame, because it doth no hurt when it hath
neither teeth nor talant: You</hi> (Rogationists) <hi>say you will
<pb facs="5"/>
not mischieue vs; but I rather thinke you can not: for
how will not you do what possibly you can, seeing you cease
not to be doing, when you can do nothing at all?</hi> Are not
these <hi>Rogationists</hi> and you Romanists equally bent to
like mischiefe? Is not your Defence <hi>(P. R.) Miluus &amp;
Columbus, A Kitish Doue?</hi> For by the Title pretending
<hi>Mitigation</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> it may seem to be a <hi>Doue,</hi> but
by the <hi>Treatise</hi> it selfe professing a plaine rebellion, it
proueth a <hi>Kite.</hi> Whereby we may suspect that in the
capitall characters of your name <hi>P.</hi> may betoken a <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
and <hi>R.</hi> a <hi>Rogationist.</hi> Otherwise, answer your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
sincerely vnto this their Interrogatorie; <hi>Did
you euer spare vs, being sufficiently able to hurt vs?</hi> For
the time past you can not satisfie; for the time to come
you will not ingage your selfe further than your Preface
hath promised, viz. <hi>It is not impossible for vs to liue in
subiection.</hi> But will you know the best way to prooue
your Aduersarie <hi>T. M.</hi> slanderous? Then must you
teach your Disciples to cease to be murderous. Your
second, and (as you call it) <hi>the speciall part,</hi> which is the
Defence of <hi>Mentall Equiuocation,</hi> is no whit better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified:
for the maine reason to free it from a lie, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the outward speech, [as <hi>I am no Priest]</hi> is mixed
with a <hi>clause reserued in the minde,</hi> [as, <hi>To tell it vnto
you.]</hi> Wherein againe I appeale from your Position to
your Confession, granting, That <hi>there is a mentall Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,
which no clause of reseruation can saue from a lie.</hi>
Which one Confession is sufficient to conuince all
your Mentall Equiuocators to be apparently liers. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
thus obteined my cause in both questions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
you rage and raue, disgorging your stomacke,
and casting vpon me all the cankred and galfull termes
<pb facs="6"/>
it could vtter: yet can I not be offended with you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
only (as <hi>Tully</hi> spoke in the like case) <hi>Quiame noce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
vol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>isti: Because you meant to doe me iniurie.</hi> After
you had laboured, by disabling my iudgement concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the cause, to wound me in the head, you proceed
further, to preiudice my conscience, by pretending
<hi>multiplicitie of frauds and falsifications,</hi> seeking thereby
(for so I may call it) to stab me at the heart. But know
(<hi>P. R.</hi>) that your false and calumnious obiections of
<hi>falsifications</hi> are in this <hi>Preamble</hi> so farre discouered,
that I may truly thinke the Scripture verified vpon
you,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 1.</note> where it is thus written: <hi>Therefore art thou inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable,
ô man, whosoeuer thou be, that iudgest; for doing
the same things, by iudging another thou condemnest thy
selfe.</hi> Therfore I wish you in the feare of God, so to vse
your iudgement in this life, as still remembring, that
after death you must be called to iudgement.
Our Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> preserue vs to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of his sauing Grace.
Farewell.</p>

      <signed>Yours to warne, and to be warned,
