   <head>THE PREFACE TO THOSE OF THE CHVRCH OF ROME.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IRS, that which I intend at this time to offer vnto you, it may be, would be better accepted if it were tendred vnto you by another hand: howbeit I dare boldly affirme, that neuer any spake vnto you, that was either more voide of hatred, of more desirous of your good and saluation. The word of God, whereupon we ground our Religion, commandeth vs to loue those that hate vs; and to beleeue that those which haue persecuted vs, haue thought that in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they haue done God good seruice. Euery man that seeketh the truth, ought to be thus affected, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is impossible to reape any fruite by our communication: for no wound will euer be healed, as long as the inflammatiō continues. And as in an house that burneth, those that speake are not vnderstood, by reason of the noise and cries of those that gather about it: so we shall neuer vnderstand one the other, as long as our minds are inflamed with hatred and rancour. The studie of sacred truth requireth a peaceable spirit, which deliberately weigheth things, without carping at the persons. For what reason haue we to hate any man because he erreth, or because we thinke we see clearer then he doth? Now as blind men commonly
<pb facs="4"/> are mutinous and cholericke, so those men are most violent that haue least vnderstanding: so that he that will take vpon him to remedy this ignorance, must seeke to pacifie their rage. But there is no hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in him who studieth to be ignorant, and feareth to know the will of God, lest he should be obliged to follow it. Such is the malady of this age, wherein the people make profession to follow without knowledge; and to beleeue the Church, not knowing what the Church ought to beleeue: and rely vpon the faith of another, not knowing the rule of faith, which is the word of God. As if those that are our pastors and guides, ought to be our warrant before the iugdement seate of God; or as if it were a vertue to beleeue in God by an atturney. It is true, that the people ought to obey their guides (prouided God be their guide,) and to beleeue that which they teach, (so that which they teach be drawne from the word of God:) which if they hide from the people, and hinder them from the reading thereof, it is an euident signe either that they feele themselues culpable; or that in stead of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themselues vnto this rule, they would haue their authority to be the supreme rule. For why should the word of God contained in the holy Scriptures, be suspected by vs to be a dangerous booke?<note place="margin">Index librorū prohibitorum cum regulis confectis per patres à Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentina Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do delectos. Regula <hi>4.</hi> Cum experimento manifestum sit, si sacra Biblia vulgari lingua passim sine discrimine permittantur, plus inde ob hominum temeritatem detrimenti quàm vtilitatis oriri: Qui absque tali fatultate ea legere seu habère praesumpserit, nisi prius Biblijs ordinario reddi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>is, peccatorum absolutionem percipere non possit. <hi>Where you must note, that there it is spoken of Bibles tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated by Catholicke Romane authors.</hi>
      </note> Why should children be forbidden to looke into their fathers testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle wrote his Epistles to the people of Rome, Corinth, and Ephesus, that they might reade them: why then should Christians in
<pb facs="5"/> these dayes be depriued of the reading of them? The Catholicke Epistles of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> are written to all the faithfull in generall: why then should not Christian people reade those let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are expresly addressed vnto them, and written for their instructions? Why should not a Christian reade the writings of the Prophets, as well as they of Beroea did,<note place="margin">Act. 17.11.</note> who hauing bin at Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching, went and conferred his doctrine with the Scriptures? To what end is it, in our Sermons to alledge the places of the holy Scriptures, if the auditory be not permitted to examine whether they haue bin faithfully and truly alledged? It is a most horrible thing, that in those countries where the Inquisition reigneth, it should be a crime deseruing burning, to haue a Bible in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue; and in the meane time not onely the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of friuolous fables is tollerated, but whoredome also by the law and publicke authoritie is established and permitted. And if it be the translation that displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his Holinesse, at least he ought to take order that there should be one done according to his mind. To alledge that some men abuse the reading thereof, is as much as to accuse the Apostles of want of discretion, for hauing written their Epistles to Christian people, without foreseeing that they might abuse them. By the same reason also, preaching likewise should be prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, because men abuse it. We also abuse the bountie and goodnesse of God. And if we must haue speciall leaue to reade the holy Scriptures, is it not a miserable case, that we may not obey God without licence? and that God can haue no seruants without the Pope of Romes permission? If they say, that it is not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nor fit that ignorant people should reade them; I
<pb facs="5"/> answer, that all men are ignorant in religion before they haue read them; and that, without impietie, a man cannot haue knowledge in religion without the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Therefore let me intreate you to shake off this scrupulositie, whereby God is wronged, as if his word were contagious, and a net spread abroad to intangle the consciences of weake Christians; lest that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie be accomplished in you which is pronounced by the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> saying,<note place="margin">Esa. 5.13.</note>
      <hi>Therefore my people are gone into captiuitie because they haue no knowledge;</hi> and that saying of our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Ye are deceiued,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Math. 22.19.</note>
      <hi>not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures.</hi> Suffer not this precious treasure, nor this contract of our spirituall mariage with the Sonne of God, to be pulled out of your hands. Suspect those who during the night of ignorance, hide this celestiall light, and in the meane time light and set vp candles at noone day. Neuer hope to be saued by the faith of other men, for God saith,<note place="margin">Habac. 2.4.</note> that <hi>The iust shall liue by his faith;</hi> and that <hi>If the blind leade the blind,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Math. 15.14.</note>
      <hi>both shall fall into the ditch.</hi> Now to make you know, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is taken away from you, not to keepe you within the bounds of sobrietie, but to detaine you in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, consider that in the Church of Rome they reade certaine Chapters of the holy Scriptures openly vnto you in a language which you vnderstand not. If in those Chapters men spake vnto God, it might for an excuse be alledged, that God vnderstandeth all langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: but those Chapters are diuine instructions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God speaketh vnto men. Tell me in conscience, why should God be, as it were, a barbarian vnto vs, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto vs in an vnknowne tongue? Why doth he speake vnto men, but because he would haue them to vnderstand him? Why are those things (which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb facs="6"/> would be held to be ridiculous, and contrary to common sense) in religion esteemed to be good and conuenient? Is it not rather an intention of the enemy of our saluation, by that meanes to expose Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to an open scorne, and to hinder the word of God from being vnderstood by vs? to the end also that the threatning pronounced by God vnto those people with whom he is angry, might be accomplished, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.21.</note>
      <hi>By men of other languages will I speake vnto this people, and yet will they not heare me.</hi> This mischiefe hath produced another; for that by taking the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from you, which is the booke that maketh men wise, they haue giuen you images, which are termed the books of the ignorant, because by them ignorance is maintained. By them the people is amused, in stead of being taught the truth. In stead of instruction, they giue them recreation. But because the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the law of God is against it, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the seruice of God, forbiddeth vs to make any grauen images, &amp; to worship or fall downe before any thing that is in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath: and that this law pronounced with thunder and lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, thundereth yet against this superstition: these Doctors haue imposed silence to the law of God, and haue bene so bold as to race this commandement out of the Houres of the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and Seruice bookes which they giue you leaue to reade: which makes vs wholly to suspect them. And it is a thing hardly to be thought or beleeued, that poore little wormes of the earth dare be so bold, as to correct that law which God pronounced with his owne mouth: yea the same law, whereby at the latter day they shall be iudged. For these practises the holy and sacred name of the Church
<pb facs="6"/> serueth for a couer. They say, that the Church cannot erre: that she is the soueraigne Iudge of the points and doubts of faith: and that she is an infallible interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scriptures. By which Church they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand neither the Grecian, Syrian, nor African, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though much ancienter and purer then the Romane,) but onely the Romane Church: which hauing neuer bene other then a particular Church, is said to be the vniuersall Church; and by this meanes the Church of Rome is become a iudge in her owne cause. The Greek Church (much ancienter then the Romane) complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that the Church of Rome hath reuolted and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated it selfe from her, producing against her, her chaires, her succession, and her antiquitie. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, the Church of Rome boasteth to be Iudge, and so will be both Iudge and partie. And in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether the Church of Rome cannot erre, she her selfe will be Iudge: and which is more, when que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is made to decide what the dutie of the Church is, the Church of Rome will be the soueraigne Iudge, that she may haue no other law then that which she will establish, and which she propoundeth to her selfe. And when any argument is moued concerning the sense and interpretation of the Law of God, she saith she is the infallible interpreter thereof, and will haue her interpretations to be held to be of equall authority with the Law of God. And yet it is certaine, that at the latter day she shall be iudged by that Law. There is no absurditie more palpable, then to make sinfull men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible iudges of the sence of that law by which their sins ought to be iudged. What obedience, thinke you, is the soueraigne Maister of all creatures to expect, if his seruants might presume to say vnto him, It is true
<pb facs="7"/> that thou hast commanded vs to obserue such a law, but we interprete the same otherwise, and iudge that thy commandement ought thus to be vnderstood; and thou knowest that we are infallible iudges in such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that our interpretations are of equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with thy commandement. After this maner it were better to be a seruant then a maister. By which of these two wayes, think you, ought the Prelates of the Church to be iudged at the latter day? whether by the law of God, or by their owne interpretations? Herein I make all men iudges, that haue any sparke of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, or any free iudgement without preiudicate opinion in them; whether in religion, God gouerning and teaching the Church by his word, or the Church which ought to receiue this word and yeeld obedience vnto him, ought rather to be soueraigne Iudge? And which should rather be Iudge, either the Scripture that commands that there shall be a Church, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds and prescribes lawes thereunto; or the Church which onely testifieth the same to be the Scripture? specially seeing that this testimonie may be giuen by a corrupt and disobedient Church to the Scripture? Which shall rather be Iudge, the Scripture that is one, and which iudgeth without passion; or the Church which is deuided into diuers contrary Churches, which cannot be assembled together, and whereof the Pastors are subiect to be ambitious, and addicted to couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and that ought to be suspected Iudges, when they onely seeke their owne profite and authoritie.</p>
   <p>Here I can easily, as it were with a finger, point out and shew vnto you, that you are led and guided in a way wherein it is impossible for you to be saued. For you are taught simply to beleeue in the Church of
<pb facs="7"/> Rome, and without other enquiry, wholly to depend vpon the authoritie thereof. And yet neuerthelesse, you are depriued of all meanes whereby to know and find out, whether this Church wherein you beleeue is pure, and teacheth true doctrine. For how should you know it? is it by the holy Scriptures? But that booke you are not permitted to reade. At Rome and in Spaine, to reade it is burning. Wil you know it by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie? But they are Greeke and Latin bookes, which the people vnderstand not. What knowes an artificer, a woman, or labourer among you, whether his Church teacheth truly according to the Scriptures? or whether his Church was the same that it is now, twelue or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred yeares past? or whether in a great role of Popes set downe in a paper, the first of them belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as the latter do; and whether time hath wrought no alteration therein? To be short, you haue no other proofe for the puritie of your Church, but onely the testimonie of your Church it selfe, the Prelates where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of boast and brag that they cannot erre. In the meane time they bereaue you of all meanes of discerning er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror from truth, by hiding from you the rule of truth, which is the holy Scriptures. But why should the Church of Rome rather haue this perfection, then the Greeke or Syrian Churches (farre ancienter and purer then the Church of Rome) founded by Iesus Christ himselfe and by his Apostles, and which also affirme that they haue Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chaire? Doth the Scripture attribute any prerogatiue aboue others to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church? or doth it giue her the priuiledge not to erre? From all this there followeth two things that are as cleare as the Sunne at noone day; the one, that your faith is onely grounded vpon the authoritie of
<pb facs="8"/> men; and by consequence, that your religion is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and not diuine. Whosoeuer saith, I beleeue the Gospell and the word of God, because the Church commandeth it, giueth more credite to the Church then to God. To doubt of Gods truth, is a lesse crime then to make it to depend vpon men. The other, that of all humane testimonies you ground vpon the worst &amp; most vncertaine: for you beleeue that your Church is good, because she saith so, and make her Iudge in her owne cause: not once considering, that by this word Church, you vnderstand not the Christian people, nor all Pastors in generall, but the Pope and a few Prelats, whose rules are called the Rules of the Church; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they tend wholly to the profite of the Clergie, and to aduance the Empire of the Bishop of Rome. And will you alwayes hold your soules, by God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to his image, and which he hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the bloud of his Sonne, in this miserable cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie? Will you draw and heape the wrath and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God vpon your heads, by reiecting the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation which is offered vnto you?</p>
   <p>I confesse that the Church of Rome in certaine points alledgeth the Scriptures; and that betweene vs and her there is great contention touching the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thereof: but we vse the Scriptures in other manner then those that teach you.</p>
   <p n="1">1. For they prohibite the people to reade them, and we exhort them thereunto.</p>
   <p n="2">2. They perswade you that the Scriptures are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and ambiguous: but we say, that all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to saluation are therein contained, and may be from thence clearely deduced.</p>
   <p n="3">3. They say, that the Scriptures are an imperfect
<pb facs="8"/> rule, and will haue another vnwritten rule, and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church, which they equall in authoritie with the Scriptures. We on the contrary say, that the holy Scriptures are able to make vs wise vnto saluation:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.15. 1. Cor. 4.6.</note> and that we ought not to presume aboue that which is written: and that in those things which are cleare and manifest in the Scriptures, and need no interpretation, all doctrines necessary to saluation are contained.</p>
   <p n="4">4. Also when we alledge the Scriptures, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them as the soueraigne Iudge, and as that which gouerneth the Church, and giues her her authoritie. But the Church of Rome alledgeth the Scriptures as a doctrine authorised by the Church, and saith, that we must receiue them because the Church hath so ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it.</p>
   <p n="5">5. And when we interpret the Scriptures, we giue not our interpretations for lawes, as the Church of Rome doth, neither do we make our selues iudges and infallible interpreters of the holy Scriptures.</p>
   <p n="6">6. Lastly, when we interpret the Scriptures, we draw our interpretations from the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. But the Church of Rome drawes her interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from the vnwritten word and traditions.<note place="margin">He tooke bread &amp; gaue it, Do this in remembrance of me.</note> As for example, we expound these words, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> by these words, <hi>The bread which I giue you, is the commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of my bodie;</hi> which exposition is found in the text it selfe, touching the institution of the Sacrament: or by these words of the Apostle,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.16.</note>
      <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the bodie of Christ?</hi> But your Doctors do not interpret the Scriptures so: for they draw their interpretations from the vnwritten word, and from Traditions. When the Lord said to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I haue prayed that thy faith may not faile:</hi> they say
<pb facs="9"/> that by those words the vertue not to erre was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the Popes of Rome his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors. But the Scripture speaketh not of Popes, nor of Bishops of Rome, nor giueth any successor to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his Apostolicall place. In like sort there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Malachi</hi> of a pure oblation that should be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all places.<note place="margin">Mala. 1.11.</note> This oblation, according to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the Romish Doctors, is the Masse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they say, that the body of our Lord is really sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. But this interpretation is taken out of the vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word: for the holy Scripture speaketh not of the Masse, neither commandeth vs to sacrifice the body of Iesus Christ; nor establisheth Priests in the Church to sacrifice the Sonne of God. And so when the Scripture saith, <hi>Thou shalt worship one onely God, and him onely shalt thou serue:</hi> the Romish Doctors interpret it, that God onely forbiddeth the adoration of <hi>Latria,</hi> but not of <hi>Dulia,</hi> which is an inferiour religious seruice. But the Scriptures make no mention of the adoration of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> nor of any other religious seruice, but onely of that which is due vnto God. These are interpretations which the Romish Church drawes from the vnwritten word, which is referred to the discretion of the Church of Rome, and cannot be learned but from her mouth. For I am of opinion, that neuer any man saw all the doctrines of the vnwritten word drawne into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, because that word altereth and changeth with times and seasons, and is accommodated to the times, and that still the Church of Rome hath power to adde new articles therunto, and namely touching the points of faith.</p>
   <p>The greatest mischiefe is, that these traditions and doctrines of the vnwritten word, are not onely addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="9"/> to the Scriptures, but manifest contradictions: whereof the Masse onely sheweth many examples.</p>
   <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Bellar. in Bark cap. <hi>3.</hi> Non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte de Ecclesia Christi sentit, qui nihil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit, nisi quod expresse in veteri Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum aut factū esse legit: quasi Ecclesia poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioris temporis aut defierit esse Ecclesia, aut facultatem non habeat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicandi, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarandi, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituendi, etiā &amp; iubendi quae ad fidem &amp; mores Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</note> For Iesus Christ administring the Sacrament of the Eucharist, spake in a tongue vnderstood by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants: but the Priest in the Masse speakes in a tongue not vnderstood by the people.</p>
   <p n="2">2. Iesus Christ communicated to all the assistants: but the Priest oftentimes eateth and drinketh alone.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Iesus Christ giueth the cup to all men, and will haue all to drinke thereof: but the Priest drinkes alone, and denieth the cup to the people.</p>
   <p n="4">4. Iesus Christ offered nothing to God: but the Priest in the Masse prayeth God to accept his oblation of Christ.</p>
   <p n="5">5. Iesus Christ lifted vp no hoast: but the Priest lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp an hoast to be adored.</p>
   <p n="6">6. In the institution of the holy Sacrament, there is no mention made of a sacrifice, nor to sacrifice the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Iesus Christ: on the contrary, the Priest preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to sacrifice the body of Iesus Christ in a reall and propitiatory sacrifice for the quicke and the dead.</p>
   <p n="7">7. In the institution of this Sacrament, there is no adoration of the hoast, but all the Apostles sate at the table: on the contrary, the Priest causeth the hoast to be adored. He that at this day should do as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did, should be held and esteemed to be prophane and an hereticke.<note place="margin">Oramus te Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine per meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Sanctorum quorum reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiae hic sunt &amp; omnium Sanctorum, vt indulgere dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris omnia peccata mea.</note>

There was no reliques hidden vnder the Lords table, nor bones of any of the Patriarkes or Prophets: on the contrary, vnder the stones of the altar there are bones of the dead, without which reliques an altar can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be consecrated; and the Priest in the Masse asketh mercie and forgiuenesse of his sinnes for the merites
<pb facs="10"/> of the Saints, whose bones are hidden vnder the altar.</p>
   <p n="9">9. The Gospell witnesseth, that Iesus Christ giuing bread vnto his disciples, said, it was his body: on the contrary, the Priest saith, that the bread is not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Iesus Christ, but that the bread is transsubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the body of Iesus Christ.</p>
   <p n="10">11. Iesus Christ witnesseth, that it was the fruite of the vine which he dranke: but the Priest denieth that it is the fruite of the vine.</p>
   <p n="11">11. Iesus Christ will haue vs to do it in remembrance of him: but the Priest pretendeth to make Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
   <p n="12">12. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in foure places saith, that we breake and eate bread: on the contrary, the Priest maintaineth that we neither breake nor eate bread.</p>
   <p n="13">13. The Lord instituted a Sacrament, but the Priest celebrateth a sacrifice. In a word, the one celebrated the holy Supper, the other singeth Masse, expresly made to disfigure the holy Supper of the Lord.</p>
   <p>The Romish Doctors thinke to defend their cause by vsing a childish accusation or obiection against vs, saying, that seeing we will needs follow our Lord Iesus Christ, we ought to celebrate the holy Sacrament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter supper, in a high chamber, and admit no women vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. But neither the place, nor the houre, nor the sexes of the assistants, are of the essence or any part of the action; and without them the action is still entire: and therein Iesus Christ neither prescribed any rule, nor made any prohibition. But the change and alteration which we obiect against them, is in essentiall things, and such as change the nature of the action: seeing that thereby an adoration is induced, which was neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, nor yet practised by the Apostles: a sacrifice
<pb facs="10"/> established which the Lord did not appoint: a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition touching dead mens bones authorized: a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon repast changed into a priuate Masse: and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple depriued of the vnderstanding of the ordinary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; taught to take God in their hands, to eate their Creator, to adore the Creature, and are depriued of halfe the Sacrament (that is, of the cup) whereof Christ said, <hi>Drinke ye all of this;</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.8. Let a man examine him selfe, and so eate of this bread and drinke of this cup.</note> as the Apostle also comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the people of Corinth to take the cup as well as the bread. Wherein we propound a way and meanes for vs to agree one with another, which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused but by him that loueth discord, that hath no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian bloud in him, or that striueth against God. For euery Christian confesseth, that Iesus Christ did well, and that there is no exception to be taken against his institution. And although it were lawfull to celebrate the Supper in other manner then he did it, yet all men grant, that it should not be ill done to follow his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to speake as he spake, and to do as he did. This is it that we require. And it is certaine, that the Pope might end all the controuersies growne and raised vpon this point, which trouble and make a diuision in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if he would reduce the holy Supper into the forme wherein the Lord did celebrate it; laying aside all disputations, and bind the people to the example of the Sonne of God. What discommodities or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences soeuer might be alledged to the contrary, they cannot equalize nor counterballance the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that we owe vnto Iesus Christ, the peace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, nor the revnion of this rupture and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, which hath bin the cause of so many troubles, and hath shed so much bloud, and which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the sides of the Church of Rome, as well as it doth
<pb facs="11"/> ours, exposing the same to the violence of Turkes and Infidels.</p>
   <p>All indifferent persons will easily confesse and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that this is truth; but fearing that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences should be touched therewith, they vse an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall meanes to represent our religion vnto you in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maner then it is, and paint it out before you like a terrible monster, making vs to speake and teach those things which are altogether contrary to our beleefe and confession: and withall, diuers of you are so light of credit, and so easily caried away, that you rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to learne and vnderstand what our religion is by the inuectiues of our enemies, then by our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. And although we haue protested, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue nothing of all that which they impose vpon vs, yet they will constantly perswade vs, that we beleeue that which we beleue not. Wherein against their wils they iustifie vs. For thereby they secretly confesse, that our religion being truly set downe, cannot be repressed: and that if it were liuely described, it would at the first make a strong impression in the spirits and hearts of the auditors, by the euidence of the truth thereof. They say,</p>
   <p n="1">1. That our religion teacheth, that good works are not necessary.</p>
   <p n="2">2. That the elect may commit sinne, and liue wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly without danger.</p>
   <p n="3">3. That God rewardeth not good workes.</p>
   <p n="4">4. That God constraineth our wils, and forcibly draweth them to goodnesse.</p>
   <p n="5">5. That we accuse and blame God to be vniust, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing propounded a law vnto vs, which we cannot fulfil.</p>
   <p n="6">6. That we are enemies to the Saints and to the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Marie.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="11"/>
   <p n="7">7. That to vnderstand the Scriptures, euery one of vs boasteth that we haue a particular inspiration giuen vnto vs.</p>
   <p n="8">8. And that we deny the omnipotent power of God in the Eucharist. All this is false, and contrary to our beleefe.</p>
   <p n="1">1. Our religion teacheth, that good workes are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to saluation. For men go not into heauen by the way of hell, nor to the kingdome of God by seruing the diuell.</p>
   <p n="2">2. Our religion teacheth, that those that are prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated to saluation, are also predestinated to liue holy. To say, I may boldly liue wickedly because I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated to saluation, is the speech of a reprobate, that will be wicked because God is good, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Gods grace (which is a prouocation and a goade to prick vs forward to vertue) a pillow to lull him asleep in vice.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Our religion beleeueth, that God rewardeth good works, but of his free mercie, without desert.</p>
   <p n="4">4. It beleeueth that God constraineth not mens wils, but boweth them, and causeth them willingly to addict their minds to goodnesse.</p>
   <p n="5">5. It doth not esteeme it a thing vniust, that God requireth that of man which he cannot do, when man is bound to do it, and that his weaknes or want of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie proceedeth from himselfe.</p>
   <p n="6">6. It honoureth the Saints, as the same Saints did honour those Saints that were before them.</p>
   <p n="7">7. For the vnderstanding of the Scriptures, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth it selfe with that which therein is clearely and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently set downe, and leaueth particular inspirations to mad and fantasticall persons.</p>
   <pb facs="12"/>
   <p n="8">8. It denieth not the omnipotent power of God in the Eucharist, but it ruleth it selfe according to his will. It vseth the holy Sacrament, not to make Iesus Christ, but to honour him; not to make his body to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend downe vnto vs, but to eleuate and lift vp our hearts vnto him. It taketh not vpon her to take God in this life, but is content that God would be pleased to take vs vp into heauen when we die. She is not afraid that God can fall, be stolen, caried away by a mouse, or eaten by his enemies. She beleeueth not that the Son of God and the diuell both entred into <hi>Iudas</hi> together at one time; nor that Iesus Christ did eate himselfe, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was not necessary for our redemption.</p>
   <p>Our religion is a religion that acknowledgeth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther head of the Church but Iesus Christ, no other rule of faith then his word, no propitiatory sacrifice but his death, no other purgatory but his bloud, nor other merits but his obedience.</p>
   <p>It is a religion that will haue the people to reade the word of God, because she is not afraid that men therin shall find their condemnation; which speaketh in a knowne language, because she is not ashamed of her beleefe.</p>
   <p>It is a religion which teacheth fasting to consist in abstinence from meate, and not in distinction of meates: she fasteth for exercise of humilitie, and not with opinion of merite or satisfaction: she borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not other mens satisfactions, but with the Apostle beleeueth,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.5.</note> that euery man shall beare his own burthen.</p>
   <p>It is a religion, which distrusting in her owne works, trusteth in the promises of God; which preacheth hope and affiance, and not to doubt of her saluation: which recommendeth an humble assurance, and not an arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<pb facs="12"/> perplexitie, by the which those that display or boast of their owne merits, make profession to doubt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> their saluation.</p>
   <p>It is a religion, wherein men confesse &amp; acknowledge that they haue often done that which God forbiddeth to be done; far from hauing done more then he cōman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to be done: and is so far frō doing superabundant works, that it faileth in doing that which is necessary to be done. It pretendeth not to make God debtor to man by works of supererogation, but confesseth man to be a sinner before God, because of his disobedience.</p>
   <p>It is a religion, which in stead of framing and fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning stones like vnto the image of man, seeketh by all meanes possible to reforme man according to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God. In stead of worshipping a crosse of wood, adoreth Christ crucified, trusteth in his passion, and glorieth in his ignominie.</p>
   <p>It is a religion which beleeueth not, that God which gaue his Sonne to die to saue his enemies, taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to torment the soules of his children in a fire of Purgatory, and to punish them for sinnes already par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned (and for the which Iesus Christ hath made full satisfaction) by punishments which serue not to amend the sinner, but to satisfie the iustice of God.</p>
   <p>It is a religion which maketh not her prayers by number, neither maketh the efficacie of prayer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the often repetition of the same prayer, but in faith and the disposition of the heart.</p>
   <p>It is a religion which holdeth that faith consisteth not in ignorance, but in knowledge: which equally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministreth holy things as well to the rich as to the poore; not as in the Romish Church, where dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and absolutions are sold, and particular Masses
<pb facs="13"/> are neuer said, but for them that first giue something to the Priest.</p>
   <p>To be short, it is a religion which hath litle outward shew and glory, but much inward comfort, constancy and perseuerance, which will be knowne by the effects; and ordaineth few ceremonies, but ministreth many instructions.</p>
   <p>You make answer to this, and say, that these are new things. How esteeme you them to be new, seeing that Iesus Christ himselfe &amp; his Apostles taught in that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? It is true, that they are new to those that are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in an inueterate error. Healing is newer then the disease: but we must alwayes ascend vp to the spring of truth, in regard whereof all old errors are new. No man euer opposed himselfe against an accustomed rooted error, but he was accused of noueltie. But this reproch of noueltie, ill becometh the mouthes of those persons which hide the true antiquitie from the people (that is, the word of God,) and which maintaine, that yet at this day the Church may &amp; can make new ordinances tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching faith; and which by the Church vnderstand no other then the Romish Church; that in the first ages after the Apostles, cannot produce one man that was of their religion; and which know that in all antiquitie there is no mention made of excluding the people frō the cup, of prohibiting them the reading of the holy Scriptures, of reading the Scriptures to the people in an vnknowne tongue which they vnderstand not, of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Trinitie, of worshipping images, of adoring the hoast with the worship of <hi>Latria,</hi> of priuate Masses, of the Bishop of Romes Court, of his Indulgences, of the treasure of the church, of his power to depose kings, and of drawing soules out of Purgatory, nor of many
<pb facs="13"/> other corruptions which are beautified and set forth with the fraudulent title of Apostolicall traditions, as if they came from the Apostles themselues.</p>
   <p>Those that boast &amp; brag of Antiquitie, are they that rudely handle the Doctors, and censure and condemne them at their pleasure; that will haue the Fathers to be interpreters of the Scriptures (so that they themselues may be interpreters of the Fathers,<note place="margin">Cotton in the Preface of his Cath. Institut. speaketh thus of those two vniuersall Councels, saying, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia began <hi>an.</hi> 380. to draw on to rebelliō against the holy seate, &amp; to tranerse the authoritie of the Bishop of Rome, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the Bishop of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople to be his equall. After that, <hi>an.</hi> 450. they said, that they had the same priuiledges.</note> and iudges of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,) and that not onely condemne euery particular Father, but also whole Councels, wherein the Fathers generally spake all together. Three vniuersall Councels condemned <hi>Honorius</hi> Bishop of Rome to be an heretik, but at this day they reiect those Councels. At the first Councell of Constantinople, <hi>anno</hi> 381. there was 150 orthodoxe Bishops, and 630 at the Councell of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon holden <hi>an.</hi> 451. and yet neither that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor the great antiquitie, hindreth our aduersaries from condemning all those Fathers for making the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Constātinople equal with the Bishop of Rome in Ecclesiasticall things. The Councell of Constance holden <hi>anno</hi> 1416. acknowledgeth that in the primitiue Church the faithfull receiued the Sacrament vnder both kinds, and neuerthelesse ordaineth that those that would follow the ancient custome, should be holden and esteemed to be hereticks, and grieuously punished.</p>
   <p>And it is a wonder how these men dare speake of Councels, when they know very well, that day is not more contrary to night, then ancient Councels are cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the new, wherein the Pope ruleth all, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all, the other Bishops onely giuing their consents, by bowing their heads in signe of approbation; when at the entring into the same Councels, the holy Bible is laid at the Popes feet, to witnes that the word of God
<pb facs="14"/> is subiect vnto him; where the Pope is set in an high throne, &amp; the Emperour below at his feet. To be short, we see, by the practises of the latter Councels, specially the Councell of Florence, the last of Latran, and by the booke of sacred Ceremonies, that a Councell for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ages past, is nothing else but a Papall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory, but held with more solemnitie: whereas in the ancient Councels, the Bishop of Rome durst not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally appeare, and his ordinary Deputies therein had neither presidence nor authoritie: which is far from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, <hi>that no booke shall be Canonicall without the Popes authoritie;</hi> and that <hi>all Kings must kisse his feete:</hi> and to declare,<note place="margin">Annal. Baron. an. <hi>1076.</hi>
      </note> that <hi>there is no other name vnder the heauens, but that of the Pope:</hi> which are the decrees &amp; ordinances of the Councell of Rome vnder <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. <hi>an.</hi> 1076.</p>
   <p>To conclude, it is most certaine, that those which sound in your eares the Fathers and the Councels, do it not because the ancient Fathers are any thing fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vnto them, but because they know, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people cannot tell how to disproue them, and that in those things you must of necessitie refer your selues vnto them. But touching the Scriptures, which you may and ought to know, and which rule all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, those you are forbidden to reade. Yeares are not rules, and lying was from the beginning of the world. And if custome may serue for a law, tell me how many yeares at the least are required to authorise a doctrine? The Church is not in a country gouerned by custome, but in a country gouerned by a written law. There is no prescription against the diuine truth. In the time of the Apostles this mystery of iniquitie began to be hatched. How much then, thinke you, is it now increased? And in truth both the people and the pastors of the Church
<pb facs="14"/> of Rome crie out since certaine yeares past, that the Church hath need to be reformed. At the Councell of Pisa, <hi>an.</hi> 1411. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the fift, in the 20 Session, solemnly promised to spend some time to take order for the reformation of the Church, and to that end to assemble the wisest men of all nations. Not long after that, there was a Councell helden at Senes, <hi>anno</hi> 1423. where the proposition of the reformatiō of the church was laid vpon the table, and after referred to another time; for they saw that they could not stirre that stone, without shaking the Papall dignitie.</p>
   <p>But that which great personages would not do, God hath done it by meaner men, vsing vnexpected and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoped for meanes, to set the doctrine of saluation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the peoples eyes, in despite of all the forces that Satan could vse against it. You are bound and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto those that haue taken paines and trauelled in this worke, for this, that the holy Scripture (which the people saw not) is now translated into our mother tongue; and that the Spirit of God speaketh French, in such maner that no man can be ignorant of the word of God, but he that wilfully shuts his owne eyes for feare to see the light. You are bound vnto them also for this, that the Pope doth now tyrannize lesse ouer you then he did 4 or 5 hūdred yeares past, &amp; that your bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage is eased a fourth part:<note place="margin">Such buls are found in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Paris, and in the third Tome of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, at the end of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Latran vnder Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent the third.</note> for then the Pope gaue those French men that at his commandement armed themselues (besides the remission of all their sinnes) a degree of honour in Paradise aboue other men. But if now at this day he would by a Croysado send the French men into a far country to fight against heretiks, or to conquer certaine townes (vpon his enemies) for him, as he did not long since, you would mock and iest
<pb facs="15"/> at his commnndement. Then his manner was, when a King had offended him, to interdict his kingdome, and by that meanes (as much as in him lay) to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate diuers millions of people, to command an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of diuine Seruice to be made throughout a great country, to forbid the bels to be rung, to hinder burials, and to expose the countrey for a prey to him that first could conquer it. England was sixe yeares and a halfe in that state in the time of King <hi>Iohn;</hi> but at this day he puls his sword no more out of the sheath, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that taking so much vpon him, he should be the meanes to ouerthrow his owne dignitie, which the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospell hath already much shaken.</p>
   <p>You are also beholding vnto vs, that sellers of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons run not throughout France from house to house, as they did in the time of <hi>Boniface</hi> the 9. and <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. who for halfe a crowne sold to euery man that would haue them, a remission of all his sins, and the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a soule out of Purgatory.</p>
   <p>The time hath bin, that in France men commonly spake of miracles, of S. <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire, and of the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of damned soules, or such as were come out of Purgatory, which illusions are for the most part vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed away at the rising of the Sun of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the night of ignorance had hidden. And if at this day there are any small miracles spoken of, it is secretly, and neuer before vs: for before a man that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God, and knoweth him, Satan is as it were chained, and loseth all his force, and the magistrates themselues of your religion haue oftentimes punished such impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures corporally. There are not many persons among you that wholly beleeue in their religion, and that find not fault with the Church of Rome. For it is hard for a
<pb facs="15"/> man to support the Decrees &amp; the Glosses, which say,<note place="margin">Tit. 8. de Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend. cap. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posuit.

      <hi>that the Pope is aboue the law, and that he hath power to dispense against the Apostles and the Gospell:</hi> that call the Pope, God, and Diuine maiestie: or the lying Legends, which in many things compare and equalize S. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke</hi> and S. <hi>Francis</hi> to Iesus Christ: or the opinion of those that cause S. <hi>Francis</hi> Cowle to be put vpon them when they are dead, because (as their Doctors say) that Cowle is as good &amp; as auailable as a second baptisme: nor the runnings of poore people for pardons two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles off, when remission of all our sins is offered at home vnto vs by the doctrine of the Gospell: nor the pardons of seuen or eight hundred thousand yeares: nor the priuiledged altars, whereon a Masse being said, a soule is deliuered out of Purgatory: nor the opinion of those that teach, that the Pope can make that which is sin, to be no sin, and that which is no sin, to be sin. And it is certaine, that although we should say nothing, yet the truth speaketh in the consciences of many persons that are holden vnder this captiuity by the feare of men and their domesticall affaires; for the diuell tilleth men by the belly, and rocketh them in a cradle of pleasures and honours to bring them asleepe: whereby it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that the sparks of the truth knowne, are quenched in them, or if they be not quenched, they burne, and torment their consciences, &amp; serue for nothing else but to make them more culpable. For hauing not onely bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their talent of the knowledge of God in the earth, but also for misspending the same; for hauing bin asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to confesse the Son of God before men, and not defending his cause when time required, and for fearing to offend men more then God, whose promises are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, his threatnings horrible, and his iudgements eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb facs="16"/> and ineuitable: who hauing in our dayes shewed and done so many miracles to repaire the ruines of his Church in this Realme, wil not leaue those vnpunished that seeke to trouble his worke, and that expresly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out of the way at high noone day.</p>
   <p>All this which hath bene spoken proceeds from an ardent desire that we haue that you should be saued, and that God might be serued; for herein we haue no other interest then your saluation, seeing that from the defence of this cause, we receiue nothing but trouble, hatred and discommodities. We rather much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to liue in peace and amitie with our fellow citizens vnder one selfe same religion, if we could or might do it, without offence vnto God; and ceasse not to pray &amp; beseech the Father of mercie (whose compassion sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts our iniquities) that he will pardon those that hate vs, that he will touch their hearts with repentance, and illuminate their vnderstandings with his light, to know the day of their visitation, and the way of eternall saluation, for feare that in the end he should turne his fauour from a people that turne their backs vnto him, and send greater darknesse then the first, vpon a nation that striueth against the light of the Gospell.</p>
   <p>If these considerations moue any man, it will be no small ioy vnto me, and an ample reward of my labour. If it happeneth otherwise, we shal at the least haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered our soules, and discharged our consciences, and serued for a witnesse in so hard and stiffenecked an age, attending till the Sonne of God come from heauen, to heare our griefes, to deliuer his children, and to reward euery one according to his workes: to him be glorie eternally. Amen.</p>
