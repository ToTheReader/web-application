The Lord is able, but this is not ordinary, but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous to raise up stones, that is of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate,
<pb facs="151"/> and seared, such as was the chiefe, and jaylor, children to <hi>Abraham.</hi> The blessed Apostle more then once produces the senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their owne Poets<note n="k" place="margin">Acts 17.28. 1 Cor. 15.33. Tit. 1.12.</note> to convince the errors of the Heathens. <hi>Tertullian, Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Augustine</hi> bring irrefragable arguments for confutation of these out of their owne bookes.</p>
   <p>Some certaine seeds, and small sparkes there bee of wisdome in the <hi>Ethnick</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers Histories, Orators, Poets, writers of Tragedies, but they all come farre short of that is delivered in the doctrine of the Church. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And to gather it into a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, first they faile in the knowledge of the essence, will, and true invocation of God: they are ignorant how God is rightly to bee worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, what workes please him, and for what cause they please him, as being to seeke of the matter of a Mediator, no way able to discerne the persons of the divinity, and the severall benefits received by them.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In the second place, they have no right judgement what sinne is, nor what justice is in respect of God. For they cannot tell how sinne came in, that doubting in the mind of Gods providence, and power, and that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and carelesnesse, in regard of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is a sinne: much lesse that ignorance of the Sonne of God, and his contempt is so. The righteousnesse of Christ, not our owne to make us just before God they condemne, as
<pb facs="152"/> the corruption, and cut-throate of good manners, and discipline.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Concerning the calamities that befall mankind, they attribute them to the unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and crooked<note n="l" place="margin">Or to the next causes residing in the subject or object.</note> will, not to the just judgement of God against transgressors, as they ought to doe. Remedies against which they can render none that are<note n="m" place="margin">Some <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap> perhaps lenitives, as light as nothing.</note> effectuall.</p>
   <p>Disputing of the soules immortalitie, they are like the waves of the sea tost with the tempests of<note n="n" place="margin">
         <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Phaedone</hi> much doubteth hereof himselfe, and leaveth others his followers in a quandarie <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> incertainty.</p>
   <p>Seeing all things swarving from the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter they conjecture, and no otherwise, of a judgement to come upon the world.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Of the restitution of the body after death, and life eternall to accompanie it in all their volumes, they say not so much as <hi>gru</hi> to it, and as little credit they yeeld the same.</p>

         </gap> Xenophon.</note> beneficent, and a lover of mankind: yet hee brings it not home to have comfort of conscience by it, when he reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to the promise of gratuitall<note n="p" place="margin">Which must needs be had, where is no full obedience of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, not so much as in one duty: and as for obedience of parts, it is but a piece of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed toward all, but not keeping in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction any of the Lords precepts.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
   <p>Thus you have some survey of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their wisdome.</p>
   <p>Now whereas justice is thought to<note n="q" place="margin">

<pb facs="152"/>
      <hi>Aristotle</hi> places a man in a city, and therefore speakes of civill justice. Hee sets an order to a citizen living under Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and lawes in a politicall society, and so putting a difference betweene universall, and particular justice drawes it downe to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member, and then divides particular ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice into<note n="r" place="margin">In the commutative he requires an equall communication of things in a proportion Arithmeticall: in the distributive an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of persons in an equality Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</note> commutative, and distributive. These disputes are full of prudence, howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it but legall only, and carnall, not such as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the law of God, not of just weight in his sight, but the justice of faith is that, which tried in the ballance of the sanctuarie, is approved for good. Which relies not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatsoever action, or quality of worth in us, but upon the free mercy of God in the sole incomprehensible merit, and mediation of Christ.</p>

For forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and temperance: in the one, they sought their owne or some other ends, not Gods glory: in the other, there was no more, then a restraint, as in the case of chastitie in <hi>Alexander</hi> toward <hi>Darius</hi> daughters: so in the rest depending thereupon, neither was that ever in their thought, which moved <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> to that singular resolution; <hi>Shall I doe this thing, and sinne against God?</hi> I conclude
