translateth others from off that soil whereon they grewe,<note place="margin">Psal. 80.9</note> and plants them on som other groūd; and that either because of the barrenness of the soyl, or vnfruitfulnes of the plant, or for some other cause best known vnto himselfe. It hath pleased him in mercie not to supplant, as iustly hee might haue done, and that for euer, but onely to remoue me into another corner of his Ʋineyard (Blessed bee his name it is any where within that pale). The soyle wheron I grewe, was fat and goodly (neuer plant could growe on better) no fault in it, of this translation. The Plant it self was badde and barren: and that (as safest it is for me to iudge) occasions it. I haue but loytered, when I should haue laboured, in gods haruest. Now Lord forgiue it mee.</p>

      <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.24</note>Seeing now I must leaue you, <hi>my loue my Brethren I leaue with you;</hi> and this as a testimonie of my loue. When I am out of sight I would not bee forgotten. Read and practise what here you finde, and what formerly you haue beard: and I dare say I shall not bee. These are the last Sermons that I preached amongst you: let them not bee least esteemed: take them as the last Farewell of a hearty friend. When they were preached to the eare, passion hindered many of your attentions: I now present them to your eye,<note place="margin">Luke 1.4</note> that you may bee more fully enformed of those things wherein you were then instructed.</p>
   <p>Let it suffice, my Affection is so great towards you, that I cannot express it. God workes my heart to loue those that loue him. The Lord imprint in your minds this seale of that my Affection vnfeyned, and enable you by his grace to doe his will;<note place="margin">Acts 20.32.</note> that so at last you may bee made partakers of a glorious inheritance amongst all them which are sanctified: which shall be faithfully prayed, for by him</p>
