                 <title>Mathematicall recreations. Or a collection of sundrie problemes, extracted out of the ancient and moderne philosophers : as secrets in nature, and experiments in arithmeticke, geometrie, cosmographie, horolographie, astronomie, navigation, musicke, opticks, architecture, staticke, machanicks, chimestrie, waterworkes, fireworks, &amp;c. Not vulgarly made manifest untill this time: fit for schollers, students, and gentlemen, that desire to know the philosophicall cause of many admirable conclusions. Vsefull for others, to acuate and stirre them up to the search of further knowledge; and serviceable to all for many excellent things, both for pleasure and recreation. Most of which were written first in Greeke and Latine, lately compiled in French, by Henry Van Etten Gent. And now delivered in the English tongue, with the examinations, corrections, and augmentations</title>

   <head>By vvay of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement. Five or sixe things I have thought worthy to declare before I passe further.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst,</hi> that I place not the specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative demonstrations with all these <hi>Problemes,</hi> but content my selfe to shew them as at the <hi>fingers end:</hi> which was my <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ot</hi> &amp; intention, because these which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>and the <hi>mathematicks</hi> can conceive them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sily; others for the most part will content themselves onely with the knowledge of them, without seeking the reason.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Secondly,</hi> to give a greater grace to the practise of these things, they ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed as much as they may, in the subtiltie of the way; for that which doth ravish the spirits is, <hi>an admirable effect, whose cause is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne:</hi> which if it were discovered, halfe the pleasure is lost, therefore all the finenesse,
<pb facs="19"/>
consists in the dexterity of the Act, concealing the meanes, and changing often the streame.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Thirdly,</hi> great care ought to be had that one deceive not himselfe, that would declar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> by way of Art to deceive another: this wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> make the matter contemptible to ignoran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>Persons,</hi> which will rather cast the fault upon the <hi>Science,</hi> than upon he that shewes it: when the cause is not in the <hi>Mathematicall</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ples, but in him that fayles in the acting of it▪</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in certaine <hi>Arithmeticall</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>positions they have onely their answers as I found them in sundry <hi>Authors,</hi> which an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> one being studious of <hi>Mathematicall</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning, may finde their originall, and also th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> way of their operation.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Fiftly,</hi> because the number of these <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blemes,</hi> and their dependences are many, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> intermixed, I thought it convenient to gathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> them into a <hi>Table:</hi> that so each one accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to his fancie, might make best choise o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> that which might best please his palet; the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter being not of one nature, nor of like subtil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie: But whosoever will have patience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> reade on, shall finde the end better than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">

      </gap> beginning.</p>
