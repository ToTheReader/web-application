      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendly Reader, after I had finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my former Bookes, I was drawn on, as well by diuerse my friends, as also with a certaine affectation which I beare thereunto, for to set forth a Booke of the art of measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring grounds by this my new deuised instrument: for that I see daily errours continually practised, euen by those which be in most practise: whereby it giues the ignorant occasion, and not without cause, to bring in question the truth of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and noble science of Geometrie, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse of all Arts. Let no one be offended though I affirm that all ascending, or descending grounds heretofore laide downe in plano by the plaine Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Theodelitus, &amp;c. are falsly laid downe. If they followe the doctrine of anie one writer now extant, I know the rules they publish to cast vp the contents, be true, but the rules they teach in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentally to fetch the contents is false, as may appeare in the ninth Chapter of this Booke. Some it may be will say, we haue instruments sufficient already, and then what needeth this? which I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme also conditionally, that they adioine the vse of the II Chapter of this Booke thereunto: but
<pb n="112" facs="67"/>this let such vnderstand, that they haue not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a better for portabilitie, and true rendring of the quantitie of an angle; for the whole instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be carried in a small walking staffe, of one inch diameter in the biggest place. And as thereby thou art taught to platte and measure grounds, both Arithmeticall, &amp; Mechanicall, so also haste thou rules to know whether thou haue wrought true of false; which heretofore was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer published, but thou left in that point, as it were to worke at random, so that thou mightest hope to haue wel done, though thou hadst no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie thereof. Then if this Book giue thee full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and bring the art of measuring grounds vnto a perfect head in one entire volume, which neuer heretofore hath beene; accept him kindly, &amp; giue the Author good words for his paines: &amp; so I end, wishing my selfe present when any doubt happens to arise by meanes of hasty writing, or ill phrased tearmes,</p>
