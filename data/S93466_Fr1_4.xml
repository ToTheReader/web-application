   <head>The Argument and occasion of this Dialogue.</head>
   <p>IT happened (as ofte it doth) that diuerse Gentlemen béeinge conuited to dyne togeathers: Among many other thinges, they chaunced to fall in spéeche of the Countrey and Courtly lyues, reasoninge whyther it were better for the Gentlemen of Englande to make most abode in their Countrey houses, (as our English manner is,) or els ordinaryly to inhabite the Citties and chéefe Townes, as in some forraine Nations is the custome. These Gentlemen as they were diuersly disposed and vsed, so were their opinions of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter likewise differinge: some commending the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey dwelling, others preferring the Cittie habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This matter a while spoken of by euery one, was at length by assente of the whole company disputed by two Gentlemen, th'one (for this time) I will call <hi>Vincent,</hi> th'other <hi>Vallentine,</hi> both men of more then cōmon capacity, &amp; (haply) sumwhat learned. <hi>Vincent</hi> had béene brought vp in the Countrey: <hi>Vallentine</hi> his education and life was in Courts and Citties. Either of them with the best reasons they could, maintayned their opinions, as hereafter in this discourse you shal plainly perceaue.</p>
