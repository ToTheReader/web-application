   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER, Honorable, Worshipfull. etc.</head>
   <p>TOuching these arguments following, my humble petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Christian reader (of whatsoever sorte and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) is this, that they may not be taken as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from one suspecting any religious Noble man or gentleman of the Parliament house, but rather from one as with all thanks to God, acknowledging the godly forwardnes of many in both houses, so also earnestly desiering to quicken the zeale of the best, and to provoke all other, to take the cause heere handled to heart, not onely as the cause of poore distressed men, but as the cause of God; yea, to accompt it also the maine cause of the whole land, of your selues and all your posteritie, and therefore to prefer the same <hi>(according to the daily most godly prayer of your selues, in your house of Parliament)</hi> before all other causes whatsoever, either concerning any particuler persons, or the whole common wealth.</p>
   <p>Whereas I haue perswaded them to whom I haue directed these reasons to vse all meanes they may for the doeing of any good; I desire that my words may not be vncharitably construed of any other <hi>meanes</hi> then such, as are sutable to the <hi>cause,</hi> viz. of good honest, lawfull, peaceable &amp; agreable to every mans calling. The like charitable construction I craue of any other wordes, which some parhaps may maliciously wrest against my self &amp; the cause.</p>
   <p>Wheras also some may seeme to pretend feare of his most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Maiesties displeasure to hinder their zeale and courage; such I entreate to consider, how dishonorable (if not disloyall) it is, in good causes to feare the displeasure of a Prince, who besides his
<pb facs="3"/>most Christian education from his infancy, hath long time publikly given so many worthy testimonyes of his piety and godlines. <hi>Loue thinketh no evill of any,</hi> much lesse of such a Christian Prince, <hi>It beleiveth all and hopeth all of every brother,</hi> much more of a religious King. <hi>It is the glory of a King</hi> not only <hi>to find out the secrets of other,</hi> but also sometime to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale his owne. Therefore it is not meete by present wordes or deedes, (whereof sometime there may be a deepe reason) alwayes to iudge of the mind. <hi>Iehu</hi> pretended one thing (when he procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a sacrifice for <hi>Baal</hi>) but he intended another: <hi>Ioseph</hi> a long time delt roughly (both in word and deede) with his brethren; yet in the end he sheewed himselfe most lovinge and kind vnto them. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> (for the triall of the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi>) see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a long time to repell her sute, for her daughter, first by si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, <hi>2.</hi> by a sharp reprehension of his Disciples petitioning in her behalfe: and <hi>3.</hi> by a more sharp answer to her selfe. At the last notwithstanding, he did most graciovsly open the treasures of his riche compassion towards her, and sent her away with a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant comforte. <hi>Constantius</hi> the Father of <hi>Constantine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> (as <hi>Evsebius</hi> reporteth lib. <hi>1. de vita Constantini,</hi> cap. <hi>II.</hi>) at his first entrance into the Empire, made solemne procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that all <hi>which served him in his Court, should ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worship Devills,</hi> (after the manner of the Heathen) <hi>or giue over their places of dignity and honor, and so to be bannished from his Court.</hi> But by this meanes when he had tryed them that were faithfull, then (to the farre greater honor of his Princely wisedome and piety, then if he had plainly and simply at the first professed the Christian religion,) He disgraced those that had so revolted from God, and rebuked them with a most Princely and religious rebuke, saying, <hi>That they were Traitors to God, and vnworthy the service of an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. For how</hi> (quoth he) <hi>can they keepe faith vnviolat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="3"/>the Emperour, which are manifestly convinced to be vnfaithfull to the most excellent and mightie God.</hi> On the contrary, those that for conscience had forsaken their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and given over their honors, he most highly graced, <hi>as those that would be faithfull to the Emperour, because they had been so vnto God: yea, he pronounced them worthy to be reckoned among the cheife and principall frends of the Emperour, and to be worthily much more esteemed, than Treasuries full of great riches.</hi> Therefore also he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red some of them to speciall attendance vpon his owne person, and other some he advanced to the cheife goverment of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire vnder himselfe.</p>
   <p>I leaue the application of these things. Onely I wish such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of them, that men may not be rashe (vpon any supposed apparances) to iudge Christian Princes, especially who in fromer times haue many wayes testified their sincere religiō: yea I wish less censuring of them, and more earnest praying for them <hi>in secret before him that seeth insecret &amp; hath promised to reward openly yea as David blesed the Lord God of Israell, and the counsell of Abigail, and Abigaill her self, for keeping him from sheading innocent blood, 1</hi> Sam. <hi>25.32.</hi> &amp;tc. so (to omit what thanks you may haue from his most excellent Maiesty) who also knoweth, how euen they, that for the present doe most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the matters heerafter pleaded for, will in the end blesse God &amp; your counsell, and your selues for staying them from their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their hard courses against the ministery of the Gospell, &amp; the salvation of the people depending thervpon?</p>
   <p>Finally, albeit I could haue added many other arguments to these that I haue here written for the further wheting of the zeale of those to whom these causes principally appertayne yet seing these doe a rise to such a quantite; I thought it best to spare the further paynes of my selfe, and of the reader: hoping that these which I
<pb facs="4"/>haue written, shall be sufficient so to kindle the zeale of them that loue the Lord Iesus and his truth, <hi>that they shalbe so full of matter</hi> (as <hi>Elihu</hi> speaketh of himselfe <hi>Iob 32.19</hi>) <hi>that their spirit within them, shall compell them, and that their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes shall be as the wine which hath no vent, and like the new bottles that burst, that so they may speake to take breath, and open their lipps for answer of them</hi> (if any such doe sheew themselues) that doe oppugne, or shall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the sincere ministery of the gospell. In which hope <hi>I commend them to God, and to the word of his Grace.</hi>
