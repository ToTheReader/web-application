   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Yr, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge the whole course of youre lyfe, howe it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither tendeth to the necessitie, to the profyte, and to the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, namely, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of Iustice, in dyrection of Counsell, and in mayntenance of Hospitalitie: waying also the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of your nature, howe it rather inclyneth to procure commodities, that make to the encrease of your expences, than to deuyse argument of priuate profite, to the qualifying of your charges, and last of all, acknowledging my selfe bounde vnto you in many dutyes, (as being laden vnder the burthen of your benefites) I thought good to entertayne your curtesie with some thankfull deuyse, which myght neyther interrupt these your proceedings, nor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre your estimation, nor yet obscure the liberall disposition of your mynde, and that none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb facs="3"/> but by waye of request, desiring you, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companye these your affections, with a matter of profite, or rather vvith a poynt of good Husbandrie, (in apparance base and tedious, but in vse necessarie and commodious, and in effect pleasant and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) (that is to saye) to looke downe into the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of your grounde, and to seeke about your house at Beddersden, (which I see you desire to garnishe with many costly commodities) for a conuenient plot to be applyed to a Hoppe garden, to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and accomplishing whereof, I promyse and assure you, the labour of my handes, the assistance of mine aduyse, and the effect of myne experience: And herein I rather craue pardon for my present boldenesse, than thankes for my promise past, or prayse for my paynes to come, as hauing more cause to ingraue your benefites in stone, and to proclayme them in the Market place, than to print them in the dust, or to rake them vp in a Hoppe hyll, but beeing desirous to prosecute the affection I beare vnto you, to the vttermost of my power, I set my good will in steade of better abilitie, in this sort, to meete with your friendlynesse towardes me, and if it shall please you, being of such condicion and reputation (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the indignitie of the matter) to allowe of this motion, you shall thereby especially warrant the good opinion which is generallye conceyued of your good nature, increase the measure of your curtesie towardes me, and finally make many other beholding vnto you, for whose sake I shall publishe a note for their profite and commoditie, and though
<pb facs="3"/> it be vnto you a matter of small importaunce, for that <hi>he which is full, abhorreth the Hony combe,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Prouer. 27.</note> yet in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as I present herein a mynde that wisheth well vnto you, appeaching my disabilitie, and giuing in euidence agaynst my sloth, producing as witnesse hereof, a hande ready to doe, a penne to wryte, and a tongue to speake well of you, I hope the well mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my deuice shall bee by you accepted, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the merite of my deede may iustly bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, my writings wanting forme, my wyshes effect: and be it also knowne to all men by these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentes, that your acceptance hereof shall not bee in any wyse preiudiciall vnto you, for I delyuer it as an Obligation, wherein I acknowledge my selfe to stande further bounde vnto you, without that, that I meane to receyue your courtesie herein, as a release of my further duties, which I owe vnto you. And although my matter be base, my deuyce simple, and my style homely, especially for the contentacion of a delicate eare, yet I trust it shall be <hi>gnitum opus agricolis,</hi> vnto whose capacities I haue directed the tenour hereof, not bumbasting the same with the figures and flovvers of eloquence, to the glorye of my pen, or to the obscuring of this misterie, which although it shall seeme plausible vnto some (through the exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding profite leuied thereby.) Truely Sir, myne one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye meaning is hereby to gratifie you, and to satisfie the necessitie of my Countrie, and not to giue the reynes to insatiable <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> or to niggardlye <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristides,</hi> which couet to quench their thirst with the licour (or rather the lucre) of flowing gaynes, nor
<pb facs="4"/> to fill the paunche of Epicure, nor yet to paumper him in his ease and ydlenesse, neyther to ballace the belly of Bacchus, or to lull or rocke Aeschilus in hys drowsinesse, which sort of people are greedy to taste of the marrowe of gaynes, and loth to breake the bone of labour, which is the myddle and both endes of this experience, and therefore this speciall note I will here set downe for a generall rule. The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man that lyeth in wayte to spare his halfepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, the sluggarde that sleepeth awaye oportunitie, and the vnskilfull that refuseth to learne the ryght order; maye happily rellesse the bitternesse of the Hoppe, but shall neuer sauour the sweetenesse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and yet if Hoppes woulde be had with wyshes, or if commodities might bee bought vvith desire, vvho vvoulde be better prouided than these men, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye these, that make their prouision lying in their beddes, or sitting by the fire, and in the ende buye a great Kyte in steade of a little Larke, vvhose mindes voyde of vvysedome, make their Purses manye ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes voyde of mony, and their doyngs voyde of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: for the eschuing of all such inconueniences, as in this matter may happen, I meane if it shall seeme good vnto you, to publishe this Pamphlet, vvherein if any thing haue escaped consideration, I submit the same to the correction of any other man better prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tysed herein than I am: in the meane time I heartily desire you to allovve of my motion, and to satisfie my request.</p>
