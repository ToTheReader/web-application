   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He truth and triall of this treatise (care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Reader) may I hope the better be accepted without distrust or distaste, because it hath passed thorow the fire, fanne and furnace of two iudicious and learned Divines, whom for honours sake, I am bound to mention vnto thee. The one is the Reverend and worshipfull <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Tho: Goad, D<seg rend="sup">r</seg> of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi> by whose labour this worke is carefully corrected, and iudiciously supplied, where it might offend through want or weaknesse, in any part or power of it: his starres or his spits (that I may vse <hi>Origens</hi> notes) haue beene welcome to this my Tractate. I expected his vnpartiall sentence, and he hath done iustly to shut his friend out of doores, while this worke was discussed. Know therefore with me (good Reader) by whom thou hast profited, and be thankfull. The other is <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Alexander Richardson,</hi> now deceased, to whom I haue done the office of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an brother, in raysing vp seed to the dead, to continue his name, that his memory and worth might not be put out of <hi>Israel.</hi> This skilfull Artist hath cast and coyned the heads, and I would to God he had handled them before his death. Some few specialties are vpon necessary cause altered, but
<pb facs="10"/>they are of so small moment, that they make no great breach in the body, neither in thy knowledge in viewing of the order and methode of Religion. I know if the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course as well as the heads had proceeded from the same hand, they would haue beene more accurate and perfect. A shaft shot by the hand of a Gyant, and a childe differ much; yet will I not in a fond admiration, and apish imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any person make all his deeds and doctrines like the reflection of a looking glasse, to frame all thoughts and things by his shadow. This were but to catch Doterels, and shew feats of actiuitie, to deceiue the simple. Againe, if some little thing be censured in the first inventor, I hope they that loue him, will not thinke, as good friends as they deale with him, like Gnatts, which after they haue made a sweete kinde of Musicke, euermore sting before they depart. I feare not thy profit in it, if thou will submit both it and thy selfe to the true touch-stone, I meane the sacred Scriptures; otherwise with <hi>Perillus</hi> thou mayest perish in thy owne inventions, and thine owne cunning at the last will fayle thee, and leaue thee as <hi>Absolons</hi> Mule left his rebellious Master betweene heauen and earth. Consider therefore what is said, and the Lord giue thee vnderstanding in all things, that thou mayest be no lesse wise, then good. Amen.</p>
