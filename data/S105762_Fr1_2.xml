   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE SIR ALLEN COTTON, Lord Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior: the Right Worshipfull the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen and Shriefs, &amp;c. Inhabitants of this famous Cittie of <hi>London: Mr. Doct.</hi> Westfield, <hi>Mr.</hi> Thomas Gippes <hi>Cloathworker, M.</hi> Abraham Colfe, <hi>and my good friends, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioners of St.</hi> Leonard East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheape <hi>Eternall happinesse.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE vsuall maner of setting foorth Bookes, is vnder the <hi>Patronage</hi> of some, willing and able to
<pb facs="3"/>defend the same: I affect not singularity; occasion putting me vpon the work, I trace the same way. My burthen is <hi>Balme from Gile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, Remedies and prescripts for all diseases, especially the Plague:</hi> Whither should I goe with it, but vnto this renowned <hi>Cittie?</hi> It was composed in this <hi>Cittie,</hi> and first vented in this <hi>Cittie,</hi> mine owne habitation and Ministrie is yet bounded by this <hi>Cittie:</hi> the principall distressed part of this <hi>Land</hi> was, and is ordinarily (as populous places vse to bee)
<pb facs="3"/>this <hi>Cittie;</hi> from hence as the euill was, remedy may be dispatched to other parts (being first here approued.) I am not ignorant, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in this <hi>Cittie</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> approued <hi>Doctors,</hi> haue in their seuerall stations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>Balmes,</hi> and might of the same <hi>simples</hi> or <hi>Text,</hi> furnish both this <hi>Cittie</hi> and <hi>Land:</hi> and yet am not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. This is what I could in that straight of time, a part of my labours, amidst many publique and priuate distractions, (mine whole Family being smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb facs="4"/>(though not with that hand) this may put vs in minde of our great trouble; <hi>Gods</hi> mercifull deliuerance from that trouble, and our proportioned duty vnto <hi>GOD</hi> (when as all may bee forgotten) speaking of all, to vs and our Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
   <p>It hath made choyse of your <hi>Patronage, Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, &amp;c.</hi> the weale of this <hi>Cittie,</hi> is (vnder his <hi>Maiestie</hi>) committed vnto your vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie, you haue good skill and great experience of that euill, and this remedy: You
<pb facs="4"/>haue had your parts in the one and the other: <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> to <hi>God (the Gilead of this Balme)</hi> requireth Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage: <hi>Prouidence</hi> also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of future times; What <hi>Ioseph</hi> did against times of famine, will not be amisse for you to doe in your pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, against future times of the plague. Experienced <hi>Physitians</hi> were now enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to draw out old experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And although these may bee (as the <hi>Physitians</hi> prescripts were) out of date, when as that euill shall bee ouer; yet it will not be safe
<pb facs="5"/>in such a time to be wholy to seeke. Besides, who knoweth how soone the same hand may send it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? And as yet some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions remaine of it in diuers parts of this Land; on whom <hi>GOD</hi> looke in mercie. Adde yet, this <hi>Balme</hi> is a <hi>Catholicon,</hi> a Salue for euery sore; the trembling Ague as well as the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plague, and of daily vse: in these names doth it call vpon all; especially your <hi>Honour, &amp;c.</hi> for Patronage.</p>
   <p>I cannot but visite and mention you my <hi>kinde</hi> and
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Worshipfull friends,</hi> in your places, members, and parts of this famous <hi>Cittie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Dr. <hi>Westfield</hi> and M. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Gippes</hi> (as long louing friends, I ioyne you toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the tye may bee the surer to each other, and my selfe:) Gratitude requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it.</p>
   <p>You, Dr. <hi>Westfield;</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of many kindnesses receiued: by you was the foundation of my small pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of knowledge in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things (vnder God) laid; whilst as, an hearer, I sat at your feete: I freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb facs="6"/>your furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to, and care of mee in the Vniuersity, direction in studies, cost, encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, setting me a worke first, when as I was <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>in tirocinio;</hi> and constant curtesies. If I haue failed in composition, you can and will point it mee out: If I haue taught the truth, I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion not your <hi>Patronage:</hi> If you owne it, many others will for your sake &amp; name, which is, and O that it may be euer precious.</p>
   <p>You, Mr. <hi>Thomas Gippes,</hi> by whom the Lord, tooke
<pb facs="6"/>me vp; without your good will, loue, and leaue, I had not beene an <hi>Academick:</hi> by it I went vnto the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and was maintained almost wholy there: I liued since in your house. In a word, I haue and doe still finde you a Father. I cannot but particularly name you. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude bindeth me to much more: I would encourage you and others liuing, by your example to workes of that nature.</p>
   <p>And you, Mr <hi>Abraham Colfe,</hi> the place I fill is yours.
<pb facs="7"/>It is as mine account; you are my common shelter: Your great loue vnto mee, vnto your Parish; good men and Gods truth, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a mention.</p>
   <p>Finally, my <hi>Worshipfull</hi> and <hi>louing Parishioners,</hi> you; Though the Doctrine was generall, mine application was vnto you: Some of you were not present, such as heard may safely reade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: I spake then, and write now, for your profit.</p>
   <p>I haue freely reprooued <hi>sinne;</hi> were they not that <hi>cause?</hi> Am I not a <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>could I but see them, and their fruit, the <hi>Plague?</hi> Was it not in the middest of vs? How narrowly did we escape? Was it not time to crie? Who thought ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day I should speake, or he heare more? It is Gods Ordinance to repentance, and so the saluation of my selfe, and you that heard me also.</p>
   <p>Amongst other sinnes, I much smite at the neglect of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sabbath.</hi> My purpose, doctrine, and practise, is not <hi>Iewish.</hi> I respect &amp; fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb facs="8"/>the doctrine of <hi>our Church,</hi> in those contemned (by such as know them not) <hi>Homilies:</hi> The rule I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the <hi>fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi> one of the <hi>tenne words, Gods immutable and eternall Law,</hi> &amp; would vrge nothing but what is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable.</p>
   <p>If you <hi>Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull,</hi> and my <hi>louing friends,</hi> in your places, shall approue of this <hi>Balme, quatenùs e narthesio sacro</hi> (if any question it, trie it, bring it to the Scriptures, the <hi>onely Canon and rule;</hi> doe but pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
<pb facs="8"/>it.) I hope it shall doe Gods people much good, It shall bee sauorie to their temporall, and eternall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; Our <hi>great God</hi> shall haue his <hi>glorie,</hi> I mine end. For which, with all other blessings, I shall daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech the <hi>Lord,</hi> and rest</p>
