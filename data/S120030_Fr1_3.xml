   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE TREATISE FOLLOWING.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hree speciall places are alledged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to proue the descent of Christ into hell, where he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth the soules of the godly to haue been before his comming: for this is his position; <hi>That the soules before Christs death were not</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Animas ante Christi mortem non fuisse in coelo, &amp; proinde Christum, qui ad locum ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum descendit, in infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num subterraneum descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disse. lib.</hi> 4 <hi>de Christ. anim. cap.</hi> 9.</note>
      <hi>in heauen, but in hell vnder the earth, and therefore Christ, which descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the place of soules, went down to hell vnder the earth,</hi> These places are; the first, Act. <hi>2. 27. Thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell;</hi> the second, <hi>1.</hi> Pet. <hi>3. 19. 20, In the which spirit hee went and preached to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in prison;</hi> the third, Ephes. <hi>4. 9. He that ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is hee that descended first into the lower parts of the earth.</hi> These places by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> first vrged to prooue the locall descent of Christs soule into hell, to deliuer and set at libertie the Patriarks, haue been seconded of late in a certaine Pamphlet much of that argument: In the which though the author doe pretend onely to reuiue the opinion of Christs soule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descent
<pb n="2" facs="6"/>
into hell, which is the priuate opinion of some learned men of our Church, yet in diuers places of the booke he rubbeth vpon <hi>Limbus Patrum:</hi> as may be euident to the reader in these three: first, pag. <hi>9. S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mentioneth sorrowes which were loosed at Christs resurrection, which could not be in the <note place="margin">The author of <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
               <desc>〈…〉</desc>
            </gap> to be a <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
               <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
            </gap>.</note> sepulcher, where his bodie lay dead and sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse:</hi> Here hee denieth that these sorrowes, which Christ loosed, are to be referred to the death of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: but pag. <hi>12.</hi> he directly by his death vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth hell. Hence it followeth, that if Christ loosed the sorrowes of hell (and I thinke hee is not so absurd to thinke, that he loosed them for himselfe, who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the sorrowes of hell after his death) then it will follow that he loosed them for others, and for whom els, but for them which were there detained? The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place is, pag. <hi>36,</hi> where he striueth mightily, that the place in S. <hi>Peter</hi> must not bee read; <hi>the spirits which are in prison, but which were:</hi> whereupon it followeth, that they <hi>were in hell, but are not, to whom Christ preached;</hi> or els he striueth about words: his opinion then seemeth to be this, that some soules were in hell at Christs comming thither, which now are not. The third place, which I note, is pag. <hi>52,</hi> where he hath these words: <hi>In that Christ perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally descended into hell, it doth more amplifie and set foorth his goodnes toward mankinde, than his only comming downe into the world: for, so much as the more vile and loathsome the dungeon is, the greater is the loue of that Prince, who to enfranchise and set at libertie his captiues there enthralled, disdaineth not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
into it in his owne person.</hi> Now, who els can bee imagined to bee set at libertie in hell, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>Limbo Patrum?</hi> For out of the nethermost hell of the damned, of each side it is confessed none can be deliuered.</p>
   <p>Perceiuing then, how cunningly the Answerer doth seeke to winde in an old Popish error, setting his face one way, and going another: and as <hi>Hierom</hi> saith out of <hi>Plautus, To hold a stone in one hand, and</hi>
      <note place="margin">Juxta Plauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam sententiā, altera manu la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidem tenere, panem offerre altera. Hierom. Russin.</note>
      <hi>reach bread with the other:</hi> I thought good to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case this masking Mummer, and to pull off his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard: not preiudicing hereby by this speedie replie, the more mature and deliberate answere of those lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men that are by him taxed.</p>
   <p>But before I enter into any particular defence, foure things I would premonish this secret <hi>Censor</hi> of: first, that if he be a professor of the Gospell of Christ, what came in his minde to ioyne with the common aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, in disgracing the defence of the Gospell by one vndertaken in his <hi>Synopsis:</hi> may I not say vnto him with the Prophet, <hi>Wouldest thou helpe the wicked, and loue them that hate the Lord?</hi> I may very fitly applie against him that saying of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom; You that professe your selfe a</hi>
      <note place="margin">Qui Christianum te dicis, Gentilium arma depone, aut si tu de numero hostium es, often de te liberè aduersarium, vt Ethnicorum suscipias vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera.</note> [Protestant] <hi>lay aside the weapons of</hi> [Papists] <hi>or vncase your selfe, that we may know you to bee an aduersarie, that you may receiue the wounds of the</hi> [Papists].</p>
   <p>Secondly, it had bin much more commendable, if the <hi>Answerer</hi> had bent his force against the common aduersarie. There are lately diuers Popish bookes come
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>
ouer, which might haue set him on work: what profit can it bee to him, the field being pitched against the Papists, to pick quarrels with his fellow souldiers? He might haue thought of <hi>Abrahams</hi> reason; <hi>Let there be no strife betweene thee and mee, for wee are brethren.</hi> But this is no straunge thing, for a man euen among his brethren &amp; companions often to find an aduersarie: as <hi>Origen</hi> well noteth vpon these words of our Sauiour, Mat. <hi>26. 23. He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish shall betray mee: This is the vse of many, that they lie</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Haec est consuetudo hominum multorum, vt post salem &amp; panem insidientur homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus: etiam cum quibus ad eandem mēsam corporis Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti, &amp; ad e<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>ndem potum san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis simal fuerunt. Tract.</hi> 35 <hi>in Matth.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>in waite for those, with whom they haue eaten bread and salt; yea with whom they haue bin together at the same table of the bodie and blood of Christ.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, it is against the rule of charitie, to bring mens priuate acts into publike view, and to proclame openly what is written secretly. Our blessed Sauiours rule is, <hi>If thy brother trespasse against thee, goe and tell him his fault betweene thee and him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, Matth. 18. 15.</hi> In my iudgement then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier had small cause to confute in print, a priuate let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written to a Gentleman: It had bin a better course priuately to haue conferred with him, than publikely to haue censured him. <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith; <hi>If thou</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </note>
      <hi>hast heard a word let it die with thee, for it will not burst thee. Hieroms</hi> counsel here had bin good; <hi>Other matters which you desire to</hi>
      <note place="margin">Quae de caetero velis, praesens percontator praesentem, vt si quid forte nescimus. sine teste, sine iudice, in fida aure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatur. De vest. Sacerd.</note>
      <hi>know, let vs conferre of together in presence, that if we be ignorant of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, where is neither witnesse,
<pb n="5" facs="7"/>
nor iudge, it may die in a faithfull eare.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Fourthly, Christian policie would haue required, that seeing we all hold the foundation, The article of Christs descension, we should not raise any contention, or mooue questions about the manner, nor breake the peace of the Church, seeing there are most reuerend learned men of both opinions. But the Apostles reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution should stay vs: <hi>Let vs as many as be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect be thus minded, and if yee be otherwise minded, God shall reueale it vnto you, Philip. 2. 15.</hi> They which hold not the locall descent of Christs soule to hell, should not condemne the other as Popish or superstitious men, that are so perswaded: They which affirme it, ought not account them as enemies or aduersaries of the truth that dissent from them therein; they both holding the foundation. What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate dealing then is this, for the Answerer in his Preface so vncharitablie to charge his brethren; <hi>irreligiously and vnchristianly to call the maine <note place="margin">Preface to the Christian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> grounds and principles of our faith into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion?</hi> saying further, <hi>to plant by writing, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by speaking, the cursed roots therof; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a way to heathenish Paganisme;</hi> terming them further, <hi>prophane Anaxagorists, Masters of error, aduersaries of the truth?</hi> This is an hard course thus to censure men of the same profession, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they concurre not with him in the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some places of Scripture. With how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter moderation did the Reuerend Fathers of this Church, set down this article of Christs descension, in their Synode held <hi>anno 1562.</hi> that whereas the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle was thus framed before, in the Synode held <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
<pb n="6" facs="8"/>
1552</hi> in King <hi>Edwards</hi> raigne: <hi>As Christ died for vs and was buried, so it is to be beleeued that he descended into hell: for his bodie lay in the graue vntill the Resurrection: his spirit being sent forth from him, was with the spirits which were detained in prison, or in hell, and preached vnto them, as testifieth that place of Peter.</hi> The Reuerend Fathers qualified it thus: <hi>As Christ died for vs and was buried, so also it is to be beleeued that he wēt down to hel.</hi> Thinking it sufficiēt that we agreed in the substance of the article of Christs descension, though all consented not in the manner. And I could wish that wee might there hold vs, and that men content themselues with their priuate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and seeke not one to grieue another with their mutuall inuectiues either in speaking or writing. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> saith well to <hi>Hierome: I am</hi>
      <note place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>
         <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>m stulius sum vt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitate explanationum in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, melaedi putem, quia nec tu laederis, si contraria nus senserimus.</note>
      <hi>not so vnwise to think my selfe hurt by your explanations, because nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are you preiudiced if wee hold or expound otherwise.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>As for my part I will not deale of purpose with this question, as it is controuersed among our selues, nor reuiue any domesticall strife, but onely iustifie those places, which are vrged by some of our writers against the Popish opinion of Christs descending to</hi> Limbus Patrum, <hi>and are now by the Answerer either by name, or by way of consequence excepted against. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I take vpon mee to defend others, whom hee personally toucheth, they are sufficient to speake for themselues: And I wish that from hencefoorth these home-bred quarrels may cease: and that one bond of</hi>
      <pb n="7" facs="8"/>
faith, in the diuersitie of some priuate opinions, may containe and keepe vs in peace: that same, <hi>vnum fidei lintheum, quod vidit Petrus, quatuor E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelijs alligatum: That sheet of faith, which Peter saw, tied with the foure Gospels in the corners:</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> applieth it, <hi>Hom. 2. in Genes.</hi> Now I come to the particular examination of the places.</p>
