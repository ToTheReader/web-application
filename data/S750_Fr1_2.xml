   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the relation (gentle reader) of the ensuing discourse, I haue bin so dilligent and carefull, that I haue rather failed to write so much as I might, then any way I come short of truth and sinceritie. I heard the offenders tryall and conuiction, at the Sessions house, and according to the enstructions, there deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in euidence, haue briefely set downe the whole summe in effect, though not so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly (perhaps) as a better iudgemenr could haue done. I stand free (I trust from partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, or sinister construction) being no way waged for the one, or fearefully doubting of the other. And in the opening of such cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal cases, concerning persons of no
<pb facs="3"/>higher qualitie. I am of the minde, that any writer (keeping himself within the boundes and limits of truth) hath freedome of his pen, and good ground for his publication; Because such examples remaining to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, do expresse the care and industry of precedent times, in punishing such sinnes, and serue as mirrours or spectacles, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to auoid the like monstrous enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
   <p>I haue heard an infinite number of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, concerning this present murder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and strange constructions, vppon as strange obseruations. I was neuer so giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected, as rashly to beleeue, or leane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluedly to any, but what I both saw and heard, in the honourable Court of Iustice, and in the best maner I could, I haue follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the course of direct information, such as from the worthy paines of the Coroner, his empanelled Enquest, and the Iustices that had the examination of the cause, was eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, plainely, and iustly deliuered.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>Therefore, with that olde grammaticall rule, <hi>Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I knit vp this short preface, desiring that the punishment of this mans offence may so serue in example, as the like bloudy sinne, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in, or neere this famous Citie, may neuer heerafter (by any one) be committed.</p>
