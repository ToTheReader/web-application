   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He great looue that the Lord our GOD hath borne to the Church,
neither is it, neither can it be hid from any man: and if we which haue nowe
It<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the same many yeeres, be not either stuffed and choaked vp with
his manifolde benefites, or carelesse &amp; secure, for that they haue
béene so plentifull. Then will euerie faithfull and good man say, as
I say, that of all Nations and Countries vnder heauen, we haue hitherto liued
most happily. For if Warres were looked for, the Lord hath turned all to
peace: If conspiracies and Treasons were practised, they haue
béene reuealed from time to time: If Insurrections were made, they the
authors haue béen suppressed immediatly: If Forrainers and
straungers haue determined any thing against vs, their pretended deuises
neuer tooke effect: If at any time they haue purposed to spoyle vs, the
Lord hath deliuered them into our handes: If the heauens haue portended any
great thing, or the earth hath shaken her pillers against man: or the
Elements in flaming manner, cast foorth their sparkes of fyre: yet haue all
these moste straunge thinges (to this day) shewen their force,
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their effectes, and plainely manifested their angrie
countenaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>s, against other Nations and straunge people, not against vs
of England. So that I may say, happy are we, if we may continue happy: and
blessed be we aboue all other, if we be still blessed of the Lord:
and most of all are we to praise our God, if héereafter we shall
be able to stande, as hetherto we haue done, which he onely knoweth, not man.
Of this I am certaine, and for the same I haue a good warrant: that if our
sinnes be not come vp vnto the brim, if our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities be not ripe, or our
manifolde transgressions, come vp before God, then haue we not to feare
any thing: but whatsoeuer kinde of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>righting it be, howsoeuer mens
heartes doo fayle them, or what ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and signes of alterations the wicked
doo forecast in their hearts, all shall be turned to the best, if we haue
not prouoked the Lord. In verie déede it is true, that the Lord is able
to remooue our Candel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitke: that the Lord is able to carrie vs into a
straunge lande: and he is of power to hang vp our Harpes vpon the willowe
Trées, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force vs to sing a song of <hi>Sion</hi> in
<hi>Babell.</hi> Yet let Israel be of good chéere, and you the people
of the Lord comforted, for if you will feare the Lord and obey him, all thinges
shall goe well with you,<note place="margin">Deut. 28.2.</note> all the
blessinges of God shall be powred vppon you, and you shall stande in
feare and dread of none. But and if you disobey the Lord your God, and cleaue
not vnto him, all the plagues and curses set downe in his booke shall
ouertake you.<note place="margin">Leui. 26.14. Lamen. 2.17</note> I tell you of a
trueth, that if we looke not<pb facs="8"/>to our wayes, and take héede to
such thinges as the Lord our God hath forbidden vs: without questiō he
will bring such a thing to passe, as all the eares of men that heare
thereof, shall tingle at it. For my owne part, I am perswaded, that euen
now God hath begun to becken his hand, and shake his rod at vs: and of the
same, I will yéelde cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reasons.<note place="margin">Pride.</note>First of all, the pride of <hi>Sion</hi> is great,
and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue wādring eyes, and stretched out neckes, &amp; they
mince it in the stréetes with their féete, as if onely they had
a care to liue héere, and to doo nothing else.<note place="margin">Securitie.</note>Secondly, the fulnesse of bread is great, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> are inglutted with the Oliue and the Grape, therefore beginne
freé to to be carelesse. 
<note place="margin">Whordom.</note>Thirdlie, there is a
gréeuous sinne, which of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I feare, which aboue the rest I
abhorre, which of all is most dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, which in the most is most
common, yet estéemed of ouer lighthe, by the most godlie: which is
whoredome, that is so sparinglie puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. For these sinnes am I
perswaded, that God hath begun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e to shewe his displeasure, and angrie
countenaunce vpon vs: the Lord hath nowe forewarned vs to looke about, and to
examine our selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the tyme of his comming. And assuredlie, I
am sore gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> for the same: for the Papistes, finding that we haue
displeased God, and knowing that the Lord neuer striketh, but when he is
angry: have nowe of late lyft vp their heads, thinking to make a conquest,
and to pray vpon vs, So that I sée we are nowe in distresse, and
two kinde of inconueniences fall vpon vs for our sinnes. First, the Lord is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> honoured, and the Papistes they hope for a day: Secondlie, our people
and nation is affrighted, and in parte discouraged, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> they feare that
because the multitude of Heretiques are nowe inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: that therefore God
as he hath warned vs, hath also forsaken vs: and as he hath touched vs,
hath certainly delivered vs into their handes, which is nothing so.
wherefore, séeing the &amp; the aduersaire, is so exalted
against God in his pride: and the poore Church so discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged for her
sinnes in great humilitie, I will say some thing to them be the.</p>
   <p>As concerning you the aduersaries of God, and enimies to
Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: whether you be called by the name of Papistes, or tearmed as
Catholiques, or estéemed as <hi>Iesuites,</hi> or thought to be
<hi>Seminaries,</hi>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> called by any other name among men: Vnderstand
<hi>all</hi> of you, that if we haue sinned, you haue no cause to reioyce:
we haue not trespassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, but against God: and if any
thing happen vnto vs, we are vnder the handes of the Lord, not vnder yours.
What if our fathers haue erred? what if our Kinges and Princes haue offended?
what if our Rulers haue trespassed? and we his people gone astraie?
that appertayneth not vnto you, but vnto our God. To him we submitte our
selues, to him we yéelde, to him we acknowledge our sinnes: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
for you, what haue you to doo with vs? why trouble you his people? and what
haue you to doo with his annointed? we will submitte not<pb facs="8"/>selues to the highest, we will not be delyuered into your handes,
nor into the handes of men. Knowe you that we will neither choose to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ye
thrée dayes before our enimies, nor haue seuen yéeres famine
come vpon vs in the land: but we will fall into the handes of God, let the Lord
doo what séemeth him best in his eyes. Now if it should come to
passe, that we were againe made slaues vnto you, as we haue béene
of oide tyme: yet would the Lord be reuenged vpon you: your Shéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
should be scattered, as was <hi>Gardner</hi> and <hi>Bonner:</hi> your
Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and blasphemers should perishe, as all those haue done that
stoode against vs: your Runners and Deuowrers with the swoord, should
haue a deadly ende, as hath befaine to the persecutors of our Church: and you
your selues should haue all the plagues of Egipt to trouble you, tyll you
had deliuered vs. what if we serued you, seuen or eight péeres for
our sinnes, to reclaime vs? yet would the Lord send an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Othoniell,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iudg. 3.9.</note> to redéeme vs,
&amp; consume you. what if eightéen yéeres? as we confesse
some times we did: what aduantage was that to you, when <hi>Eglon</hi> your
King,<note place="margin">Iudg. 3.14.</note> with the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and
<hi>Amalekites,</hi> were afterward destroyed for it, by <hi>Ehud</hi> of
<hi>Gera,</hi> the Captaine of the Lord? What I pray you, aduauntageth it you,
to rayle on the hoast of the lyuing God, and to curse vs, and to defie vs
before the Lord: if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you and yours, be found all onely to be they
that are cursed? for so it fell out in the dayes of <hi>Ezechias,</hi>when
<hi>Senacherib</hi> defied <hi>Israell,</hi> and rayled on the lyuing
God.<note place="margin">Isai. 37.38.</note> And so fell it out at the
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to <hi>Balack</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ziphor,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Numb. 22.</note> that hyred <hi>Balaam</hi> to curse
<hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,</hi> as the Pope hath hyred and sent you out to curse vs.
Therfore this people, if they will feare the Lord, shall not be afraide of
two or thrée Bées of the East, but euen they shall
sée your dead carcases vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ground, and you the enimies of God
to be drowned and swim before their faces.</p>
   <p>And nowe for the second point, for which I doo perceyue the
people of this Land are greatly troubled: namely, because that the Papistes
and <hi>Iesuites,</hi> with other the riffe raffe, and scumme of this
Realme, are nowe séene to appeare, who before this tyme haue
béene hidden in the bytches, and channelles of England: Let them all
vnderstand, that it is a small thing with God, and no great or rare matter,
to haue wicked men and vngodlie ones, to arise in the Familie of the Lord.
For so it must it be in his Church &amp; Congregation for euer, that
those that are his may be tried. VVhy? wherefore? for what cause should
you be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>couraged? it hath béene so of olde, from the beginning it
hath béene thus. Looke and sée, search and vnderstand, it
will be found true. It is a small matter, in great abundance of small
hearbes, to haue a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of stinking wéedes: in a mightie ground
well eared with corne, to finde some Darnel, or some Cockle: in plentifull
Gardens, and well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ored, to haue a bundle or two of Nettles: or in our great
and mighty Church of England, to haue a fewe of wicked and peruerse
papistes.<pb facs="9"/>The <hi>Israelites</hi> cannot doo amisse, though
