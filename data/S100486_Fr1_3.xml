   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
Fraunces Lorde Russell, Erle
of Bedford, one of the Queenes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
priuie Counsell, and Knight of
the most Honorable order of the Garter:
Richard Androse wysheth health,
long lyfe, wyth much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of vertue
and honor.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LTHOVGH
(Right Honorable)
on the one side the
excellency and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
of your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
telleth me that
I may not presume
to craue defence of
this my poore tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
at your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
hands: and on
the otherside, the
meanes &amp; basenesse
of mine owne estate
in such sort feare me, that I cannot without red cheekes
offer so small a Mite vnto so Noble a personage: yet the
common report and opinion of your singuler clemency
and maruellous affection towards the aduauncement of
good letters and godly exercises, doe not a little mooue
and prouoke mee to commit this my simple translation
vnto your Honorable protection. For as the Souldier
which hath beene trayned, and of long time practised in
<pb facs="3"/>
martiall feates, &amp; warlike affayres seeketh commonly for
his owne credite, to serue vnder some noble and valiaunt
Capitayne, whose experience excelleth therein: euen so
he that hath beene brought vp in the studie of knowlege,
and meaneth by manifesting some proofe to benefite his
Countrie therby, endeuoreth to procure the pratronage
and defence for the same, of such as are knowne to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uores
&amp; mainteyners of such professions. Wherfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
most assured not only by common report, but also by
certaine knowledge (right honorable) that those good and
commendable exercises which are to our Country bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall,
and to our bodies needefull, are of your Lordship
especially commended, I am the bolder to dedicate the
fruits of my weake paines in this simple trauaile to your
honorable patronage and defence. An olde rule that I
read (my good Lord) in <hi>Cicero,</hi> being a yong scholer, which
was, that I must <hi>accommodare sermonē ad personam,</hi> maketh me
to cut of all my ynckhorne termes, &amp; flattering insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in wryting to your honor, knowing that I haue to
doe with such a one as hath out of Christes precepts lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to seeke for veritie, and not for vanity, for substance
of matter, and not for superfluous eloquence in words. I
had rather (my singuler good Lorde) too bee somewhat
colde in praysing and be adiudged ingratefull, then your
honor should be to whot in reading, and condemne me
for a byting flatterer, and so deale with me as I haue read
that Noble Emperour <hi>Sigismond</hi> sometime dealt with hys
kingly Dog, to whom he gaue a good rounde box on the
eare, bicause he flattered him to his face: the Parasite
saying, why strike you me Emperour? the Noble Prince
aunswered, why bytest thou me flatterer? There be my
very good Lord, many such nippers, nay rather byters in
Princes and noble houses in these dayes, that haue not <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismonds</hi>
reward as a buffet for their adulation: but rather
yerely stipends for their doggishe fawning and flattering
<pb facs="3"/>
of Noble personages, but these <hi>Regios Canes</hi> (for so the
Philosopher termeth them, I commit eyther to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of God to conuert, or to his iustices as byting Dogges
to be entreated. In the dedication of this my rude tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
vnto your honor, I seke not to illustrate your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
vertues, which were an infinite trauayle, or to
paint out mine owne skill or cunning which were vaine,
but rather to benefite my Country, &amp; to ease my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
of their griefes and maladies, by conuerting that
which before was onely knowne vnto Phisitians and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
into their owne natiue speeche and mother tongue.
Although the translator be simple, and his knowledge
not great, yet I doubt not but the worthynesse of the
matter shall counteruayle the simplicitie of the person,
if there be any carping <hi>Momus</hi> that will sooner reprehend,
then take paines to amend this my simple exercise, let
him remember the olde Prouerb. <hi>Ne sutor vltra crepidam.</hi> I
beseech your honor to accept and receyue this my small
trauayle, as a testification of the singuler good affection
I beare vnto your Lordship, and it shall not onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
me to take paines and occupie my selfe in weightier
matters, but also binde me continually to pray vnto
the almightie for the preseruation of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
helth, with the dayly encrease of vertue
and honour, to his heauenly pleasure,
and your singuler contentation.</p>
