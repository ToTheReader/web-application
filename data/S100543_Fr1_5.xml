   <head>A Letter, shewing

Treatise.</head>
   <opener>To the worshipful his most louing
vnckle, FR: SA. &amp;c.</opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y good Vncle, the
speeches that past
casually betweene
vs at our last par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
haue runne often since in
my minde; and so (perhaps)
haue they done in yours. You
complained (as God would
haue it) that you were much
crost in the building you were
<pb facs="5"/>
in hand with, vpon a peece of
gleabe of your <hi>Appropriate
Parsonage</hi> at <hi>Congham.</hi> I
answered, that I thought God
was not pleased with it, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it tended to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding
of the Church, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
(amongst some other
words) that I held it vtterly
vnlawfull to keepe <hi>Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
Parsonages from
the Church, &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But our talke proceeding, I
perceiued that as God had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
his portion in your hart,
so in this, though it concerned
your profit, you seemed tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb facs="5"/>
It much reioyced mee, and
therefore apprehending the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
I will be bold to adde a
continuance to that happy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
(so I trust, both you and
I, shall haue cause to terme it)
and besides, to giue you some
tribute of the loue and duty I
long haue ought you. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(good vncle) as your
heart hath happily conceiued
these blessed sparks, so in the
name and blessing of God, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
and enflame them. No
doubt they are kindled from
heauen, like the fire of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and are sent vnto you
<pb facs="6"/>
from God himselfe, to bee a
light to you in your old daies
(when your bodily eies faile
you) to guide your feete into
the way of peace, that is,
the way &amp; place from whence
they came. So alwaies I pray
for you, and rest,</p>
