   <head>THE AVTHOR TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I first intended this worke, I had no other purpose then to refute a certaine small Treatise of Cardinall <hi>Sourdis,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Bourdeaux, which he intituled, THE PASTORALL LETTER, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it to all those of his Diocesse of Bourdeaux; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to shew, that parents haue no authority to hinder their children from following Euangelicall Counsels; and children are not bound to aske their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents leaue therein: that is to say, that children may steale themselues away from their parents, and may become Monkes, not onely without their parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and will, but also against it. Whereof there was a notable example in this Citie of Bourdeaux: Two Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, daughters of an honourable Citizen of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish religion, withdrew themselues from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their father and mother, to follow a Religion of a new stampe and edition, called, <hi>Of the Vrselines.</hi> This fact being found strange of many learned men, and others of the said Religion; Cardinall <hi>Sourdis</hi> took vpon him to defend it by writing; and I was requested to vndertake the refutation thereof; which I not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to refuse, to those that requested of mee this piece of seruice, I tooke in hand this worke some four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
<pb facs="12"/>monethes agoe. But I perceiued by the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and sequell of this worke, that I should labour in vaine, if I refuted not in order all the principall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Church of Rome doth alleage in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and defence of the Monkish life; which I haue done according to the method, I haue here summari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and briefly set downe, beginning first with the holy Scriptures, because the author of the Pastorall letter begins with that point. My discourse shall bee truth, the fountaine thereof shall be charity, the end thereof shall be the glory of God, the edificatiō of his Church, the conuersion of those that walke in darknesse, and in the shadow of death, to the true light; and the discharge of my conscience, before God and my Church, to the which I would giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my studies; if she receiue any edification thereby, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine fully satisfied.</p>
