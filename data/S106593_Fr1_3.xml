   <head>TO All my fellow Subiectes, vnder King <hi>Charles,</hi> in his Monarchy of Great <hi>Brittaine, who are of the</hi> Romish Catholike <hi>Religion, vnto Whom I wish in the best desires of my soule,</hi> the knowledge of Gods truth.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloved Countrimen and kinsmen, what ranke or calling so ever you are of, whether you be men of honour, or worship, whether you be of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or Yeomandry; Trades-men, or Artificers; Husbandmen, or Plowmen; Poore, or Rich; Great, or Small; Young, or Old whatsoever; that haue estranged your minds, and alienated your hearts, from the present Religion of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>wne Countrey. Which Religion is that truth, which must bring you and all men to salvation: the vtter refusall whereof, will bring to eternall condemnation: to you I say, that haue cast off your owne spirituall mother, the pure visible Church of Christ Iesus, here by Gods mercy and free goodnes in <hi>Great Brittaine</hi> placed and erected: and haue knit your selues; liue in subiection, and hold communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> a most grosse corrupted Church; to you I say, in spirituall commiseration of your spirituall misery, doe I direct this Epistle of loue: and for your sakes, haue I out of
<pb facs="6"/> my poore vnderstanding, this poore Treatise, Dialogue, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme of the Church. I know that you are ignorant what the Church is, and whereof it doth consist: and therefore as a helpe for your weakenes, I haue framed this Dialogue of the Church: I desire nothing at your hands, but that you would read it: for therein is shewed by the word and workes of God, what the Church is, and whereof it doth consist. I know your blind guides doe dehort and command you to avoid all matter of exhortation from vs, and all conference with vs. But for all them, be ruled by our Saviour Christ himselfe, whose servantes you professe your selves to be: what sayth he by your Remish Testament in the Evangelist <hi>Ioh? Search the scriptures,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iohn 8.39. 1. Thes. 4.21. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> Iohn 4.5.</note>
      <hi>for you thinke in them to haue life everlasting.</hi> And what sayth he by the ministery of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in your owne translation to the <hi>Thessalon? Prooue all things, and hold that which is good,</hi> againe what sayth he by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of Saint <hi>Iohn? My dearest beleeue not every spirit, but proue the spirits if they be of God.</hi> My desire is, that you would obserue in reading this my poore Dialogue, those rules which here our Saviour hath commanded you, for hee onely hath power in the Church, by his written word, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the consciences of men, and not your Pope and Priests by their traditions. Doe as the Nobles of <hi>Berea</hi> did in obedience to our Saviour Christs command, who searched the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whether those things were so which <hi>Paul</hi> taught them. The Scriptures, are as the Ballances of the Sanctuary, which will try whether the matter of my Dialogue, or Catechisme is too light, or of reasonable good waight: it is the touchstone, which will try whether it be gold or copper: by this rule I would haue you to try the spirit by which I wrote it, and by this touchstone, I would haue you to try all things in it, and to keepe what is good; and what is for want of learning weakly performed, in silence and loue conceale, or tell me of it. I desire
<pb facs="6"/> you not so much to consider the man that wrote it, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of it: not so much the Authour of it, as the matter in it: and I make no doubt if the error of your Iudgements, be not seated in your perverse wils, but that you may profit much in your edification by it: But if Satan haue filled your hearts with mallice against our Church, and the truth here preached, and professed, and that your partiall respect vnto the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be such, that you will walke in the wicked counsell of it, and stand in the sinfull wayes that it teacheth you, and that you are growne to that desperate state, that you will sit in the wicked seat of scorners: for the wicked saith the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,</hi> hateth to be reformed, then there is little hope to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with you vnto any good; No, if Christ the essence of all wisedome were in the flesh againe amongst you, to instruct you, as he was amongst the Iewes, who were the visible church, and yet condemned and crucified him: but my hope is, that God hath ordained many of you to salvation and eternall life, and in his good time, will effectually call you by opening your hearts, as he did <hi>Lidia,</hi> to receiue the loue of the truth, to your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall salvation: the zeale of Gods glory in the good of your soules, haue provoked me to this labour: and I hope you will not requite me with hate for my loue, nor evill for my good will; but that you will accept it in loue, as I wrote it in loue, for your edification, vnto happines and salvation for ever. Your Pope and Priests tell you, that they are your Pastors: but where is the good spirituall pasture, by which they doe feede you to eternall life? It is no where to be found, but in the large field of the word of God, revealed in the Scriptures: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of your Religion cannot be proved thence, nor from thence necessarily concluded: but is drawne out of their owne corrupt inventions, to the poysoning of your soules for ever, if you take not heede, and repent in time. For the prevention of which, I haue shewed you in this my poore Dialogue, which is
<pb facs="7"/> the purest part of the visible Church, and the safest in this part of the world, for you to ioyne with in Gods service: two wicked props there are, by which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is vphold; the one is the bloody law o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> the Inquisition of <hi>Spaine,</hi> by which the people are terrified, from questioning any point of error maintained by that Church: the other is their doctrine of an implict faith, which is in sundry parts of Religion, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue as the Church beleeveth; and by taking from them the Scriptures, that they should not spie out by that pure light, the false doctrine of that Church. Thus by a bloody law, and by ignorance, is that Church vpheld: and if that cruell law were repealed, and that common store-house of Gods spirituall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, the Scriptures opened, that all Gods people might resort to it, both in publike, and private to reade it: I am perswaded that quickly the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would fall without any further strife: but I doe not desire to detaine you long by my Epistle, from reading my ensuing Treatise; and so I rest yours in all Christian duty, if you be Christs.</p>
