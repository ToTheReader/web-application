   <p>CHristian Reader, it was wy lot to light vpon these few leaves.
And being pervsed by som that had in times past bin acquainted with the author
him self, And so fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in this canvasing cōference such sound satisfaction
for matters of doubt, which in the other Epistle of the pestilence, were short
&amp; brief, learned and scholerlike rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, still striving to bring out the
kernel of knowledge, which lay couched vnder the shell of obscuritie. And the
further he ripped and reached, to make Gods glorious power knowen, which others
so long had masked: it caused many questions to bee mooved, which in this
canvasing conference is answered to the full. I my self being an eare-witnes,
to som part of that doctrine: which was as strange to many at the first, as it
was to the men of Athens in Mars street, which counted Paul but a babler,
because he preached vnto them, Iesus and the Resurrection.</p>
   <p>But I heare the Author is in prison, And why? Because som
Ministers complayned that he preached a doctrine (which they could neither
begin nor end) past the boundes of their knowledge.</p>
   <p>But Henoch wher are thine accusers? hath the finger (of<note n="*" place="margin">Iohn. 8. 6.</note> God) written their faults easie to be read, doe
they not stand out to accuse thee? Then I hope the learned will not condemne
thee, that haue trod out the corne before thee in the same path.</p>
   <p>So was the doctrine of possession likewise distilled out of the
cloudes, and so high past every lay mans reach, that the layety were driven to
their Pastors for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the doubt of that doctrine (because the
Priestes lippes should preserue knowledge) but they being found nonresidence in
those studies, one made answer thus: I am no Prophet, I am no Apostle, Miracles
are ceased, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>These hearers could not be at the beginning &amp; ending of all
these Sermons, which was the cause they rested vnsatisfied,<note place="margin">One made that aunswer.</note> and so they began to expounde the
doctrine them selues according to those parcels which they had gleaned by peece
meale from the author, never vnderstanding the Author as he meant. But
whosoever thou be, that will take vpon thee to say all, before thou heare all,
shall be sure to lye all.</p>
   <p>And so damnable speaches were bruted abroad, before either of the
doctrines were finished: but the last Sermon of possession, made all plaine,
and so plaine, that since that time (to the glory of God be it spoken) I never
heard of any about Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don nor elswhere that were so extraordinarily possessed.
But ordinary wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that are never dispossessed of a wicked tongue:
like the Athenians which gaue them selues to nothing els, but either to tell,
or heare som Newes. but in the end M. Marbery set in foot▪ to maintaine
the same doctrine, vpon Christes Temptation in the Wildernes, affirming that
[<note n="*" place="margin">Ergo no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.</note> If no going in, no coming
out.] So did the last Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of the Pestilence make all attentiue hearers
satisfied.</p>
   <p>These circumstances considered, I tooke it for duty, once towards
the Church [who is the piller and ground of truth] as also for profitable
acquaintance hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had with the Author: I could do no lesse but diuulge
it. And so much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that therein is cleared, what in all points is
to be held touching the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: A doctrine hetherto, over-confusedly and
slenderly handled of many, If my iudgement fayle me not.</p>
