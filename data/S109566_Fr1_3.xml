second Duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> (surnamed for his
youthfull imperfections, <hi>Robin</hi> the Diuell) wherein I
stand not so much on the termes, as the trueth, publishing
as much as I haue read, and not so much as they haue
written. The Loadstarres that directed me in my course,
if they haue colours and no counterfeit, doo me right to
say they set down coulors without counterfeit: yet many
things haue happened in times past, incredible in our age,
and in our age such things haue falne out, as had our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
knowne they had meruailed: It onely behoueth vs
to applie all things that tend to good, to their end, which
is vertue, and esteeme them; to intend all things that are
bad, to their end, which is vice, and eschue them. So shall
we in reading reape that fruit, that impossible things shall
be referred to God, and possible ordered to our amends.
