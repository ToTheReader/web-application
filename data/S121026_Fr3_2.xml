      <hi>THe miracle ensewing (gentle Reader) I haue thought verie expedient to adde in this place, (though far inserior to the former sor antiquity) because it was wrought for the proose and confirmation of diuers articles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the Protestants, and mayntained by the Catholike church, and is of that qualitie that no shadowe of iust exception can be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.

      <hi>The like disgrace befell</hi> Cirola <hi>a great Patriarch of the Arrians, who vpon enuie to certaine catholike Bishoppes samous for miracles, corrupted a certaine cast-away of his owne sect with gold, to faine himselfe blinde,</hi>

The wretched man accordinge to the lesson giuen him, cryed out after</hi> Cirola <hi>Passinge by in the streetes, adiuringe him by that power which he had, to restore him his sight. The hereticall bishoppe came, and put his hand vppon his eies, saying. Accordinge to our fayth, by which we beleeue God a right, be thine eyes opened: what sollowed? Straight waies the miserable man became blinde in deede: wherevpon he pittysully bewayled his wickednesse, detected the damnable deuise, and cried out to the bishoppe saying. Behold thy golde, restore me the light of mine eyes, which through thy deceipt I haue lost. The like prankes haue bene practised, not only by diuers others, but also by the new masters of our time, which for breuitie sake I forbeare to prosecute. But God is not mocked: their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signements by diuine prouidence were always defeated, and shame to them selues, and confusion to theire religion, was the sinall rewarde of such gracelesse attempts.</hi>
