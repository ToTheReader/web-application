<hi>He was at peace with them that hated peace.</hi> So named hee
the bow and arrowes in diuers manners &amp; meaninges▪

minde the commendation of this peaceable practise of
shooting which once I as a rawe scholler reade ouer in
<hi>Toxophilus,</hi> and at times by tasked lessons interpreted in
latine here and there: but for breuitie, I refer your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and worshipes vnto the Histories there, of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian
king, and Cambyses king of Persia. Of Sesostris
and his archers. Of the Messagetanes which neuer went
without their bowe and quiuer neyther in peace nor in
warres. Of Policrates and his one thowsand archers.
Of the Scithians (whose whole substance and riches of
a man being a yoake of Oxen and a plow, a Nagge and
his dogge, his bowe and his quiuer) were inuincible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Darius and other Monarckes. To be short, the
Grecians, Persians, Athenians, and the Romanes, whose
shooting in peace and warres was worthie of praise and
fame. Neyther here ought I nor will I omit with silence
the deserued fame of our Ancestors in fauouringe this
exercise in this our litle England long ago<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e liuing and
of latter time, though breefly, referring your honours &amp;
worshippes vnto the histories at large, as of Brute and
his Troianes the first Brittaines, before and after the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall
of Iulius Caesar, Claudius, &amp; Vespasian Emperoures


<pb facs="4"/>
and they Romanes: after them the Saxons vntill the
time of Vortiger, the vsurping murtherer, who (Gods
prouidence so working for them, and his iudgement
vpon him) by the two Brethern and valiant Brittaines
Aurelius sirnamed Ambrose, &amp; Vther Pendragon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
burned in his Castell in Wales, was occasion of the
Brittaines more happier estate afterwardes. But here yet
by the way <hi>(Right honourable and worshipfull)</hi> as I applaude
in this their well doing, so it had beene a thing of Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
most worthelie to be wished, for that Prince him
selfe lesse opprobrius of all mē more praise worthie, and
most pretiouse in the sight of God: if the serpent Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
had wanted here his vennime vncurable, though his
flesh proued medicinable against all other poysons (as
saith Cardanus in his booke of Comfort.) I meane if
Vther Pendragon had wanted that serpentine poyson of
adulterie, Nigromancie &amp; murther (things odible to
God and good men:) when that most incomperable
King Arthure of great Brittaine for his princely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesse,
valiant vertues, and triumphant victories yet
prooued more Royally renoumed throughoute all the
worlde in his time and to his posteritie. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brwes
with greate and not vndeserued titles extolled
their Iudas Maccabeus. Homer the glory of all Greeke
Poets left Hector and Achilles most commendable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the worlde. Neyther by lesse diligence did the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
adorne with praise Alexander the most mightie
conquerour. And the Romanes aduanced the noble
actes of their Caesar to the Skyes not enough. The Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonians
profoundly praised Godfrey of Bulloyn (for
his noble valiancy) as the scourge of the Sarazens in his
dayes. And as euery one of those are commended with
due desert: so in like māner there were neuer Brittaines
wanting of excellent learning and exquisite knowledge
to leaue with carefull diligence and credible commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
the progenie, life, prowesse prosperitie, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
victories of our said auncient Arthure wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely
