      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all morall knowledge, the knowing of our selues; of all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall, the knowledge of our owne Countrey is the most vsefull and profitable. Yet had most men rather spend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and their precious houres in the most difficult trifles in the world, than once to enter into themselues. And most Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in Geographie take more delight to contemplate the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and most barbarous Countries of the earth, than lightly to examine the Descriptions of their owne. So that (as if like those <hi>Lamij</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> they had eyes abroad, and inclosed them in boxes in their owne homes) they are accurate in the Descriptions of the smallest village in a forraine King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb facs="6"/> when they scarce know how the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of their ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e Country is situated. The excuses that are ordinary for this common neglect, are, either that accurate Descriptions are wanting, or that they are so voluminous, that they are preiudiciall both to time and purse. But behold (courteous Reader) thou hast here exhibited vnto thee such exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site compendious Surueyes of thine owne natiue Countrey, as will at once take away these excuses, and ease thee of this double grieuance. The Country described, both in regard of Commodities wherewith it is fraught, and places of note wherewith it is graced, is a perfect epitome of the World; these Maps and Descriptions are a compleat epitome of it, and therefore in a double regard worthy thy perusall. And because no Maps can be rightly vnderstood without some insight in the generall termes or notions of Geographie, I haue prefixed a compendious Delineation of the same. If thou readest them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitest by them, I haue the principall of my desire; If thou doest both, with a candid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Labour, I haue it with Interest.</p>
