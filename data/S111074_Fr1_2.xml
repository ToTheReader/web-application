      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, I would not haue thee to imagine, that our Author would haue vouchsafed to bestow his labour vpon the confutation of such silly shifts and sorry Euasions as our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne English Jesuites and Popish Priests sucke out of their fathers plants, and cast foorth with more malice then wit, in paltry pamphlets amongst vs, to seduce simple people; for, alas, they are not worthy any wise mans view; much lesse his paines for confutation. But these of <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Arnoux</hi> are of an higher straine, and of more especiall moment; which being fully cleared and displayed by our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Author, and added as a Supplement to his <hi>Buckler of Faith,</hi> a Booke that is now re-printed, as most necessary and profitable, in these disputing times, I could not with-hold this peece from thee any longer, because I supposed it would be very vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="3"/> vnto thee also, as a light Sword to offend our common Aduersaries, the more readily in lighter skirmishes either ioyntly with, or seuerally without the <hi>Buckler;</hi> which is fit to defend vs in our strongest Incounters with them; I doubt not (good Reader) but thou shalt in both of them finde such satisfaction as shall giue thee great content, and make thee stand the more stedfestly and boldly in the breach against the enemies assaults, amidst a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of staggerers and backe-sliders, which that thou maist be inabled to do, to the glory of God, and the saluation of thy own soule, I shall alwayes pray, and indeuour my selfe to yeeld thee what helpe I am able; <hi>Vale.</hi>
