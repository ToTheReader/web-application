      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Bi non est sepes</hi> (sayth Ecclesiasticus) <note place="margin">Cap. 36.</note>
      <hi>diripietur possessio.</hi> In such times wee doe liue (courteous Reader) as no care can be too much, no diligence too great, to preserue that litle, which we haue, or are, from ruine, and rapine of the euill disposed mighty. How intolerable the iniuries were, which some Priests once sustained, and afterward freely forgaue, the whole world is now a witnes, and cannot but see, how vntimely these stirres were reuiued by the Iesuits, and the <hi>Archpr.</hi> after that peace was concluded betweene them. Other iudges, then the whole world, the Priests would haue had, as appeareth by a letter of theirs to the <hi>Archpr.</hi> in their booke dedicated to the <hi>Inquisition</hi> pa. 61. but their humble petition was sayd to be a tumultuous presumption, and would not be heard. They foreshewed what danger would grow by his deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of a home-conference, but that did nothing mooue him. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they stood in such tearmes for their good name, and fame, as they must either liue in perpetuall infamie, or vse their pennes in their owne defence: the first no way fitting their calling, and present state: the second very dangerous to both parts: it being very probable, that an <hi>Apologie</hi> would draw on an Answere: the Answere, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: and that Reply not likely to be the last, howsoeuer lost labour. But neither could this perswasion purchase any peace, or procure, that the Controuersie might be determined at home among themselues. One way more did the Priests assay to stay the outrage of the Iesuits and <hi>Archpr.</hi> and that was to send to the Vniuersitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> for their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in the matters in question, which was no sooner seene by the <hi>Archpr.</hi> and Iesuits, but an Edict made, <note place="margin">
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>9 Maij 1600.</note> and diuulged in condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their censure and great penalties threatned against those, who
<pb n="3" facs="3"/> should either directly or indirectly maintaine, or defend it in word, or in writing, <hi>whether it were truely giuen, or forged</hi> (marke I pray you this spirit) <hi>whether vpon true information, or otherwise, as being preiudiciall to the Sea Apostolike, &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This headdie proceeding, and disclaiming, or rather condemning all triall (but a selfe will, and a dangerous obstinacie in the <hi>Archpr.</hi> and Iesuits) compelled the Priests to aduise vpon some other course: in which consult, they resolued to appeale to the Sea Apostolike: and the better to preuent such blockes, as were before layed in their way vpon the like attempt, they published certaine bookes: some in <hi>English</hi> to satisfie such of our owne Countrey, as were misinformed by the one part, and were not suffered to haue any speech with the other: some in <hi>Latine,</hi> that the cause comming to triall, might not bee heard with that preiudice, which false informations had before wrought, and would not now be wanting.</p>
   <p>Against two of these bookes there is an <hi>Apologie</hi> lately come foorth, to wit, against the <hi>Latine</hi> booke which is dedicated to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and intituled: <hi>Declaratio motuum &amp;c.</hi> and againe an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish booke intituled, <hi>The Copies of certaine discourses.</hi> And at the end of this <hi>Apologie</hi> there is an <hi>Appendix,</hi> wherein two other bookes are shrewdly threatned: the one in English, which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in reply to a letter of the <hi>Archpriest,</hi> to his assistants, concerning the other bookes, and is intituled, <hi>The hope of peace:</hi> the other in <hi>Latine,</hi> which was dedicated to the <hi>Inquisition:</hi> and hath this title, <hi>Relatio compendiosa, &amp;c.</hi> It is a world to see what shifting there is in this <hi>Apologie,</hi> when a difficultie occurreth to bee answered: what iugling, to haue the matter on the Priestes side seeme odious: what haste a second vntrueth maketh to ouertake a former, which through the Authors fault onely had gotten the start: how many rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten points there are, by which one storie is made to hang vnder ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: what singular deuotion, and extraordinary charity is expressed in the most vile, and bitter termes, that either malice, or madnesse could deuise: as, <note n="a" place="margin">The Epist. to his Hol.</note>
      <hi>Children of iniquitie,</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">Apol. cap. 1. fol. 5.</note>
      <hi>Libertines, &amp;c.</hi> and how true that sentence is in this Author: <hi>In oculis suis lachrymatur ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micus, &amp; si inuenerit tempus non satiabitur sanguine:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ecclus cap. 12.</note>
      <hi>The enemy hath water in his eies: but if the time serue him, it is not blood wil satiate him.</hi> And this other also: <hi>Caput suū mouebit, &amp; plaudet manu, &amp;c. He will shake his head, and clap his hands:</hi>
      <pb n="4" facs="4"/> He will seeme to lament the course which is taken, and in the middest of his sorow he sheweth by one, or other impertinent ridiculous matter, how glad he is of any litle occasion to sport himselfe at the griefes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. Yet notwithstanding this so grosse kind of dealing, as any man, who is not ouer-partiall, might enter into it, the applause of the ignorant (who will not either reade the bookes which the Priests set out, or examine what is boldly, although most vntruely, aduouched in this <hi>Apologie</hi>) demandeth an answere, which although M. <hi>Doctor Ely,</hi> and M. <hi>Iohn Collington</hi> haue largely and learnedly giuen to the most principall points therein handled, yet vpon the earnest desire of some, who haue seene this reply in my hands, I emboldened my selfe without the Authours priuitie to publish it, referring the Reader, for more satisfaction in this present controuersie, vnto their labours.</p>
   <p>The last yeeres <hi>BREVE</hi> of the 17. of August would haue cast some doubt into me, whether I might haue attempted thus much, had not the <hi>Archpr.</hi> after a quarters meditation, or more thereon, publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the <hi>Apologie,</hi> and immediatly after an <hi>Appendix</hi> vnto it. And if an vncontrolled custome may haue the credite to be the best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of a Lawe, my feare is much lessened by the breaking out of another payre of bookes from the same Authours since that time: In which while they endeuour to manifest the bad spirits of other men, they discouer their owne, by such tearmes, as ill beseeme their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and pay doubly some one mans debt, to which they would falsely, and against their owne knowledge perswade the Reader, that all the other Priestes were liable: and if no benefite rise by this present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the Reader, yet will it be another (although a needlesse) wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse against the wilfull blinde, whome the holy Ghost rebuketh by the Psalmist in these wordes: <hi>Noluit intelligere vt bene ageret: He would not vnderstand that thereby he might doe as hee ought to doe.</hi>
