   <head>To the Christian Reader, grace and peace in our Lord Iesus Christ.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Reasons following, I have published (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) for thy good, and for the truthes sake which we wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to the world. The causes of our separation from the Church of England are divers, as in other Books already printed may be seen. This treatise handleth purposely but one of them, which is concerning their present Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie: and was (for the substance of it) written long synce in nine Reasons, which now I have revised and reduced to seven. In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding and handling whereof, I have both inserted divers things which I met with in some writings of Mr <hi>Iohn Penry</hi> that faithfull Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr of Iesus Christ; and annexed sundry testimonies and Arguments out of the Books of the forward Preachers now abroad in mens hands. The third Reason, which is taken out of <hi>Rev. 14.9.10.11.</hi> hath his weight according to the right vnderstanding of that place. Concerning which (as <hi>Mr Ridley</hi> that blessed Martyr of Christ<note n="†" place="margin">See here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, p. 59.</note> did in his time) I will commit the judgement thereof, and of all the rest, <hi>to the spirituall man:</hi> to be tryed and judged by the word of God, which is the onely rule of truth; and so to be received and approved, as they shalbe found to beare weight, being layd in the skoales of Gods sanctuary; &amp; not any otherwise or further at all.</p>
   <p>The Reasons are set downe in the forme of Syllogismes. And the two first (which conteyne in them the grounds of the rest) have more specially the confirmation of them also handled after the same manner. A course that some have desired for the further tryall of our cause. Which now I wish it may help them forward to yeeld vnto the truth. And if thy self (Christian Reader) reapest any fruit by our labours, give God praise, and pray for vs the vnworthiest of his servants, who are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where contemned blasphemed and oppugned, for the Name of Christ:<note place="margin">Ier. 30.17. Mat. 5.12. and 10.25. Heb. 12.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12. &amp;c.</note> As hath ben the lot of the Churches and servants of God in all ages, yea and of Christ our Lord himself. But <hi>it is ynough for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to be as his Maister, and the servant as his Lord.</hi> Therefore will we beare it with pacience, and rejoyce in it: wayting till the Lord our God bring forth his truth as the light, &amp; our judgement as the noone day. Great (we know) is the truth, and strong is the Lord, that will destroy Babylon, and will mainteyne the cause and avenge the blood of his servants. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. <hi>and 18. and 19. chap. with Ier. 50. and 51. ch.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now therefore let me exhort all, both Preachers and people, high and low, to compare together the Scriptures of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles concerning the work of God and fall of Babylon past and to come; and to take heed vnto themselves, that they harden not their hearts, but whiles it is called To day, to hearken vnto the voice of the Lord, who sayth vnto vs concerning the spirituall Babylon &amp; all her as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
<pb facs="3"/>
and worship, <hi>Go out of her my people, that yee partake not with her sinnes, and that ye receive not of her plagues:</hi> as of old he sayd to the Iewes concerning Babylon in Chaldea, <hi>Go out of the middes of her my people, &amp; deliver ye every man his soule frō the fierce wrath of the Lord. Rev. 18.4. with Ier. 51.45.</hi> And let there be heard,<note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 50.28. with Rev. 19 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>

         </gap>.</note>
      <hi>the voyce of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babel, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God, the vengeance of his Temple.</hi> For it is written, <hi>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The thick walles of Babel shalbe broken downe, and her high gates shalbe burnt with fire; and the people shall labour in vayne, and the folk in the fire, and shalbe weary. Ier. 51.58.</hi> Which how true it is &amp; wilbe found in the Antichristian Babylon, as it hath ben in the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, let all that are wise observe, &amp; make good vse thereof vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
   <p>And in speciall (as now I have occasion) let me intreat the Preachers seeking reformation, seriously to mynd the Books which many of them selves have written against their present estate, &amp; with indifferency to judge whether their owne Arguments (howsoever intended or alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged otherwise by themselves) rely not vpon such grounds, as are in very deed against their Ministery, aswell as against their Ceremonies; against the executing of the one, aswel as against the vsing of the other; &amp; withall against the keeping of communion with them in such estate: albeit they have not hitherto so applyed or acknowledged it thēselves. Which God in his tyme give them to do for their owne comfort &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of others.</p>
   <p>And the Lord guyde vs in these and all other things by his word and spirit in the way of his truth, keeping vs from errour and every evill way, and preserving vs to his heavenly kingdome, by Iesus Christ: who is the way, the truth, and the life. Amen.</p>
