   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or as much as some</hi> yeeres since (Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull) it pleased you so courteously to accept that Sermon, which at your request I then pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, as concerning <hi>The fruites of our repentaunce towardes God;</hi> Wherein <hi>Dauid Psal. 1.</hi> doth place <hi>The chiefest blessednesse and felicitie of man:</hi> I haue thought good to adde thereunto this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which I made at the same Church (where you, and others, Iustices &amp; Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb facs="3"/>
were assembled on the ninth of Iuly last past) vpon a part of the first Lesson, by the order of our Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for that Sabboth, as concerning that duetifull contentment of minde, which (as good subiects) we owe all to our Prince and Countrey; that as in the first we are put in remembrance of our duetie towards the Lord of Lords, and Prince of Princes: so in this other, as well we which vttered and heard it, as others into whose handes it shall come to be read, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished of those loyall affections which we ought continually to beare to our most gracious Soueraigne, and our established Common-wealth. As I am well assured that these affections are, and haue alwayes bin throughly setled in your faythfull hartes; so I doubt not, but ye are also as fully desirous, that by this slender labour, and by all meanes possible, others may be allured &amp; drawen to the like disposition. Thus hoping that you will as louingly
<pb facs="3"/>
accept the reading and publishyng, as you haue already done the hearing, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this my short Discourse to your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippes, and you and it to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Almightie. From Tondridge this .xij. of Iuly. 1598.</p>
