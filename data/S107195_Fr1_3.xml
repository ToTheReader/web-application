   <head>The Prologue.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the saying of that great and wise Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
<hi>Heraclitus;</hi> That all things are created
in manner of a contention, or battell. His
words are these, <hi>Omnia secundùm litem
fiunt.</hi> A Sentence in my opinion, worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
memorie; and, for that most certaine it
is, that euery word of a wise man, is pregnant, and full; of this it may
be said, that through too much fulnesse it is readie to burst, shooting
forth such spreading, and well-growne boughs and leaues, that out of
the smallest Sucker, or least Sprig thereof, fruit enough may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by men of discretion and iudgement. But because my poore
vnderstanding is not able to doe anymore, then to nibble on the drie
bark and rugged rinde of the wise sayings of those, who for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and excellencie of their wits, deserued to be approued; with that
little which I shall plucke from thence, I will satisfie the intent and
purpose of this short Prologue. This Sentence did I finde to be streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
by that great Orator, and Poet Lauriat <hi>Francisco Petrar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
who tells vs, <hi>Sine lite at{que} offensione nihil genuit natura
parens:</hi> That Nature, who is the mother of all things, ingendred
nothing without strife and contention. Furthermore saying, <hi>Sic
est enim, &amp; sic propemodun vniuersa testantur; Rapido
stellae obuiant firmamento; Contraria inuicem Elementa
confligunt; Terrae tremunt; Mariafluctuant; Aër quati
tur; Crepant flammae; Bellum immortale venti gerunt;
Tempora temporibus concertant; secum, singula; Nobis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum
omnia.</hi> Which is as much to say; Indeede so it is, and so
all things almost in the world doe witnesse as much. The Starres
incounter one another in the a hirling firmament of heauen; your
contrarie Elements wage warre each with other; the earth, that
<pb facs="6"/>
trembles and quakes, as if it were at oddes with it selfe; the Sea,
that swels and rages, breaking it's billowes one against another; the
Ayre, that darteth arrowes of lightning, and is moued this way and
that way; the flames, they cracke, and sparkle forth their furie;
the windes are at perpetuall enmitie with themselues; times with
times doe contend; one thing against another, and all against vs.
We see, that the Summer makes vs complaine of too much heate;
and the Winter, of cold and sharpenesse of weather. So that this,
which seemeth vnto vs a temporall reuolution; this, by which we
are bred vp, and nourished, and liue, if it once beginne to passe
aboue it's proportion, and to grow to a greater highth then vsuall,
it is no better then open warre. And how much it ought to bee
feared, is manifested by those great earth-quakes and whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds,
by those ship-wrackes and fires, as well in the ayre, as the
earth; by the sourse of water-courses, and violence of inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by those courses, and recourses, those rackings to and fro of
the Clouds, of whose open motions, to know the secret cause from
whence they proceed, no lesse is the dissention of the Philosophers
in the schooles, then of the waues of the Sea. Besides, among your
bruit beasts, there is not any one of them that wants his warre;
be they Fishes, Birds, Beasts, or Serpents; whereof, euery kinde
persecuteth, and pursueth one another: The Lyon, hee pursues the
Wolfe; the Wolfe the Kidde; the Dog the Hare. And if it might
not be thought a Iable, or old wifes tale, sitting by the fire side, I
should more fully inlarge this Theame. The Elephant, that is so
powerfull and strong a beast, is afraide, and flies from the sight of a
poore silly Mouse; and no sooner heares him comming, but hee
quakes and trembles for feare. Amongst Serpents, Nature crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Basiliske, so venomous and poysonfull, and gaue him such a
predominant power ouer all the rest, that onely with his hissing, he
doth affright them; with his comming, put them to flight, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perseth
some one way, some another, and with his sight, kills and
murders them. The Viper, a crawling creature, and venomous
Serpent, at the time of ingendring, the Male puts his head into the
mouth of the Female, and shee through the great delight, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of her pleasure, straines him so hard, that she kills him. And
conceiuing her young, the eldest, or first of her brood, breakes the
<pb facs="6"/>
barres of his mothers belly, eates out his way thorow her bowels,
at which place all the rest issue forth; whereof she dies; hee doing
this, as a reuenger of his fathers death. What greater conflict, what
greater contention or warre can there be, then to conceiue that in
her body, which shall eate out her Intralls? Againe, no lesse natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
dissention can we suppose to be amongst fishes; for most certaine
it is, that the Sea doth containe as many seuerall sorts of fishes, as the
earth and ayre do nourish bords and beasts; and much more. <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
and <hi>Pliny</hi> doe recount wonders of a little fish called <hi>Aeche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis;</hi>
how apt his nature is, and how prone his propertie for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ers
kindes of contentions, especially this one; that if hee cling to a
shiper Carrack, he will detaine and stop her in her course, though she
haue the winde in the poope of her, and cut the Seas with neuer so
stiffe a gale. Whereof <hi>Lucan</hi> maketh mention, saying,</p>
   <q>
      <l>Non puppim retinens,<note place="margin">Lucan. lib. 6. iuxta finem.</note> Euro tendente rudentes,</l>
      <l>In medijs Aecheneis aquis.</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Nor</hi> Aecheneis, whose strength, though Eurus rise,</l>
      <l>Can stay the course of shippes.</l>
   </q>
   <p>O naturall contention! worthy of admiration, that a little fish
should be able to doe more then a great ship, with all the force and
strength of the winds. Moreouer, if we will discourse of birds, and of
their frequent enmities, we may truly affirm, that all things are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in a kind of contention. Your greater liue of rapine, as Eagles
and Hawks; and your crauen Kites presse vpon our Pullen, insulting
ouer them euen in our own houses, and offring to take them euen from
vnder the Hens wings. Of a bird called Roque, which is bred in the
East Indian Sea, it is said to be of an incredible greatnesse, that the
like hath neuer bin heard of; and that with her beake, she will hoyse
vp into the ayre, not only one man, or ten, but a whole ship laden with
men and merchandise; and how that these miserable passengers,
hanging thus in suspence in the ayre, till her wings waxe weary, she
lets them fall, and so they receiue their deaths. But what shall we say
of men, to whom all the foresaid creatures are subiect? Who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
their wars, their iars, their enmities, their enuies, their heats,
their broyles, their brawles, and their discontentments? That
change and alteration of fashions in their apparell? That pulling
downe and building vp of houses? and many other sundry effects
<pb facs="7"/>
and varieties; all of them proceeding from the feeble and weake
condition of mans variable nature? And because it is an old and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
complaint, and vsed heretofore time out of minde; I will not
much maruell, if this present worke shall proue an instrument of war
to its Readers, putting strifes and differences amongst them, euery one
giuing his verdict and opinion thereupon, according to the humour
of his owne will. Some perhaps may say that it is too long; some too
short; others to be sweet and pleasant; and other some to be darke
and obscure: So that to cut it out to the measure of so many, and such
different dispositions, is onely appropriate to God; Especially, since
that it, together with all other things, whatsoeuer are in this
world, march vnder the standard of this noble Sentence; For euen
the very life of men, if we consider them from their first and tendeer
age, till they grow gray-headed, is nothing else but a battell. Children
with their sports, boyes with their bookes, young men with their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
old men with a thousand sorts of infirmities, skirmish and
warre continually: and these Papers, with all ages. The first blots
and teares them; the second knowes not well how to read them; the
third (which is the cheerefull liuelihood of youth, and set all vpon
iollity) doth vtterly dislike of them. Some gnaw onely the bones, but
do not picke out the marrow, saying there is no goodnesse in it; that it
is a History, huddled, I know not how, together, a kind of hodgepode,
or gallimaufrey; not profiting themselues out of the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
accounting it a fable, or old wifes tale, fitting for nothing, saue
only for to passe away the time vpon the way. Others call out the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
conceits, and common prouerbs, highly commending them, but
slighting and neglecting that which makes more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and their profit. But they for whose true pleasure it is wholy
framed, reiect the story it selfe, as a vayne and idle subiect, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out the pith and marrow of the matter for their owne good and
benefit, and laugh at those things that sauour onely of wit, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
conceite, storing vp in their memorie, the sentences and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Philosophers, that they may transpose them into such fit pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as may make, vpon occasion, for their owne vse and purpose.
So that when ten men shall meete together to heare this Comedy, in
whom perhaps shall happen this difference of dispositions, as it vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
falleth out; who will deny, but that there is a contention in that
<pb facs="7"/>
thing which is so diuersly vnderstood? the Printers, they likewise
haue bestowed their puncture, putting Titles, and adding Arguments
to the beginning of euery Act; deliuering in briefe, what is more
largely contained therein; a thing very excusable, in former times
being much vsed, and in great request with your ancient Writers;
others haue contended about the name, saying, that it ought not to
be called a Comedy, because it ends in sorrow and mourning, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
termed a Tragedy. The Authour himselfe would haue it take
it's denomination from it's beginning, which treates of pleasure, and
therfore call'd it a Comedy. So that I seeing these differences, between
their extremes haue parted this quarrell, by diuiding it in the midst,
and call it a Tragick-Comedy. So that obseruing these contentions,
these disagreements, these dissonant and various iudgements, I had
an eye, to marke whither the maior part inclined, and found that
they were all desirous, that I should inlarge my selfe in the pursuite
of the delight of these Louers; whereunto, I haue been earnestly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned;
in so much, that I haue consented (though against my
will) to put now the second time my Penne to this so strange a taske,
and so farre estranged from my faculty, stealing some houres from my
principall studies, together with others allotted to my recreation,
though I know, I shall not want new Detractors for my new
Edition.</p>
