   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND why to the <hi>Reader?</hi> Oh good Sir! theres as found law to make you giue good words to the <hi>Reader,</hi> as to a <hi>Constable</hi> when he caryes his watch about him to tell how the night goes, tho (perhaps) the one (of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes) may be serued in for a <hi>Goose,</hi> and the other very fitly furnish the same messe: Yet to mainteine the scuruy fashion, and to keepe <hi>Custome</hi> in reparations, he must be honyed, and come-ouer with <hi>Gentle Reader, Courteous Reader,</hi> and <hi>Learned Reader,</hi> though he haue no more <hi>Gentilitie</hi> in him than <hi>Adam</hi> had (that was but a gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) no more <hi>Ciuility</hi> than a <hi>Tartar,</hi> and no more <hi>Learning</hi> than the most errand <hi>Stinkard,</hi> that (except his owne name) could neuer finde any thing in the Horne-booke.</p>
   <p>How notoriously therefore do good wits dishonor not only their <hi>Calling,</hi> but euen their <hi>Creation,</hi> that worship <hi>Glow-wormes</hi> (in stead of the <hi>Sun</hi>) because of a little false glistering? In the name of <hi>Phoebus</hi> what madnes leades them vnto it? For he that dares hazard a pressing to death (thats to say, <hi>To be a man in print</hi>) must make account that he shall stand (like the old Wethercock ouer Powles Steeple) to be beaten with all stormes. Neither the stinking Tobacco-breath of a <hi>Sattin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gull,</hi> the <hi>Aconited</hi> sting of a narrow-eyd <hi>Critick,</hi> the faces of a phantastick Stage-monkey, nor the <hi>Indeede-la</hi> of a Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Citizen, must once shake him. No, but desperately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue (like a french Post) to ride through thick &amp; thin: indure to see his lines torne pittifully on the rack: suffer his Muse to take the <hi>Bastoone,</hi> yea the very stab, &amp; himselfe like a new stake to be a marke for euery <hi>Hagler,</hi> and therefore (setting vp all these rests) why shuld he regard what fooles bolt is shot at him?
<pb facs="4"/>
Besides, if that which he presents vpon the Stage of the world be <hi>Good,</hi> why should he basely cry out (with that old poeticall mad-cap in his <hi>Amphitruo) Iouis summi causa clarè plaudite,</hi> beg a <hi>Plaudite</hi> for God-sake! If <hi>Bad,</hi> who (but an Asse) would intreate (as Players do in a cogging <hi>Epilogue</hi> at the end of a filthie Comedy) that, be it neuer such wicked stuffe, they would forbeare to hisse, or to dam it perpetually to lye on a Stationers stall. For he that can so cosen himselfe, as to poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket vp praise in that silly sort, makes his braines fat with his owne folly.</p>
   <p>But <hi>Hinc Pudor!</hi> or rather <hi>Hinc Dolor,</hi> heeres the Diuell! It is not the ratling of all this former haile-shot, that can terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our <hi>Band</hi> of <hi>Castalian Pen-men</hi> from entring into the field: no, no, the murdring Artillery indeede lyes in the roaring mouthes of a company that looke big as if they were the sole and singular <hi>Commanders</hi> ouer the maine Army of <hi>Poesy,</hi> yet (if <hi>Hermes</hi> muster-booke were searcht ouer) theile be found to be most pitifull pure fresh-water souldiers: they giue out, that they are heires-apparent to <hi>Helicon,</hi> but an easy <hi>Herald</hi> may make them meere yonger brothers, or (to say troth) not so much. Beare witnes all you whose wits make you able to be witnesses in this case, that heere I medle not with your good Poets, <hi>Nam tales, nusquàm sunt hîc ampliùs,</hi> If you should rake hell, or (as <hi>Aristophanes</hi> in his <hi>Frog</hi> sayes) in any Celler deeper than hell, it is hard to finde Spirits of that <hi>Fashion.</hi> But those Goblins whom I now am coniuring vp, haue bladder-cheekes puft out like a <hi>Swizzers</hi> breeches (yet beeing prickt, there comes out nothing but wind) thin-headed fellowes that liue vpon the scraps of inuention, and trauell with such vagrant soules, and so like Ghosts in white sheetes of paper, that the Statute of Rogues may worthily be sued vpon them, because their wits haue no abiding place, and yet wander without a passe-port. Alas, poore wenches (the nine Muses!) how much are you wrongd, to haue such a number of Bastards lying vpō your hands? But turne them out a begging; or if you can not be rid of their Riming-company (as I thinke it will be very hard) then lay your heauie and immortall curse vpon them,
<pb facs="4"/>
that whatsoeuer they weaue (in the motley-loome of their rusty pates) may like a beggers cloake, be full of stolne pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and yet neuer a patch like one another, that it may be such true lamentable stuffe, that any honest Christian may be sory to see it. Banish these <hi>Word-pirates</hi> (you sacred mistresses of learning) into the gulfe of <hi>Barbarisme:</hi> doome them euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly to liue among dunces: let them not once lick their lips at the <hi>Thespian</hi> bowle, but only be glad (and thanke <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> for it too) if hereafter (as hitherto they haue alwayes) they may quench their poeticall thirst with small beere. Or if they will needes be stealing your <hi>Heliconian Nectar,</hi> let them (like the dogs of <hi>Nylus</hi>) only lap and away. For this <hi>Goatish</hi> swarme are those (that where for these many thousand yeares you went for pure maides) haue taken away your good names, these are they that deflowre your beauties. These are those ranck-riders of Art, that haue so spur-gald your lustie wingd <hi>Pegasus,</hi> that now he begins to be out of flesh, and (euen only for prouander-sake) is glad to shew tricks like <hi>Bancks</hi> his Curtall. O you Booke-sellers (that are Factors to the Liberall Sciences) ouer whose Stalls these Drones do dayly flye, humming; let <hi>Homer, Hesiod, Euripides,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mad Greekes with a band of the Latines, lye like musket-shot in their way, when these Gothes and Getes set vpon you in your paper fortifications; it is the only Canon, vpon whose mouth they dare not venture, none but the English will take their parts, therefore feare them not, for such a strong breath haue these cheese-eaters, that if they do but blow vpō a booke, they imagine straight tis blasted, <hi>Quod supra nos, Nihil ad nos,</hi> (they say) that which is aboue our capacitie, shall not passe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our commendation. Yet would I haue these Zoilists (of all other) to reade me, if euer I should write any thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, for the blame that knowne-fooles heape vpon a deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing labour does not discredit the same, but makes wise men more perfectly in loue with it. Into such a ones hands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I fortune to fall, I will not shrinke an inch, but euen when his teeth are sharpest, and most readie to bite, I will stop his mouth only with this, <hi>Haec mala sunt, sed tu, non meliora facis.</hi>
