      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing the importunities of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great and worthy Persons will not suffer the Authour of these Sermons to lie hid in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritie; I doe heere present you with a mite of his Labors: your Vertues iustly challenging at my hands richer returnes, then a bandfull of <hi>Lilies.</hi> Yet, as the learned and iudicious eye, will happly delight it
<pb facs="3"/>selfe to beholde the resemblance of the Authours face; so I trust your humble and religious heart will somewhat recreate it selfe with the heauenly sauour of his gracious words.</p>
   <p>Let them that knew not his person, iudge his worth by these liuing Images of his soule: for they that knew him, do affoord him the testimony of a milde and humble spirit, fraught with all rich Iewells of excellent learning and knowledge. Of his vertues, what greater euidence can be, then the sweet sauour of a good name? Of his learning, what better proofe can we haue, then the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble commendations of them who most excell in all excellent knowledge?</p>
   <p>O the admirable height of iudgement, and depth of learning that dwelt within the lowly minde of this true humble man! great in all wise-mens eies, except his owne. With what grauity and maiesty of speach did his Tongue and Pen vtter heauenly mysteries? What sweet streames of sanctified elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence did flow from his gracious lips? whose eies, in the true humility of his heart, were alwaies cast downe to the ground: all things that proceeded from his blessed mouth, were sweetely breathed out, as from the spirit of Loue; so that the most famous Vniuersity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> once his nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing-Mother,
<pb facs="3"/>giues this honourable testimony of him; That for Life and Learning, the whole world hath not many such men. But what shall I say more? His praise is with God.</p>
   <p>J here then (good Madame) salute your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diship with this little Mite; knowing you to be furnished with many Graces; but chiefly, the ground of all grace, and noblenesse, true <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> which neuer takes offence at good-meanings: Therefore all happinesse, shall euer be wished to you, and all yours; by me, which will euer liue,</p>
