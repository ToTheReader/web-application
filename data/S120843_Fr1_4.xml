   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He lips of the righteous feede many.</hi> The true diet of the<note place="margin">Prou. 10. 21.</note> soule is an Art most rare, a very diuine facultie: It must be graunted that the liuely voice of the Prophets feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth most effectually, searching euen the secret cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the soule, and working greatest impressions in the heart. The holy bookes and monuments of the righteous are as strong chests and storehouses; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath euer reserued most pretious food for poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: neither may wee reiect the industrie of the heathen: for they haue some foode meete for liberall men in matters naturall and politike, seruing well (if due regard and choise be had) for our direction in things appertaining to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life. All wise men are circumspect what they feede vpon, to preserue their bodies; and ought they not much more to be respectiue wherewith they feede their soules? Some regard onely the lips of the righteous, and feed long before they be strong men, or haue their wits exercised to discerne good or euill. Some attend onely the hand and bookes of the righteous, and these know little how soundly and truely the beleeuers mindes and hearts be fed by the breaking of the bread of life. Some regard neither: these men starue their soules with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and are setled in Atheisme and prophanenes. Some attend both, and haue well tasted of the good word of life, and goe on from strength to strength,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 13.</note> vnto the measure of the age of the fulnesse of Christ. Some yet there are which neither regard righteous men, nor righteous matter, but feede <note n="*" place="margin">Intemperantiae genus est. <hi>Seneca</hi> lib. 13. epist. 89. Non discentes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaria, quia su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peruacua didice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt. <hi>Seneca.</hi>
      </note> indifferently vpon all bookes alike, to the great hazard of their owne soules: these men are vaine, and feede themselues with vanitie. The diuell in elder ages, in the blinde Papacie, fed blind soules with fables, and idle Friers inuentions: now mens wits be refined, they can no more feede on such dry stubble. Hee feedes daintie eares with choise of words, and vncleane hearts with the vnchaste and wanton loue-songs of Italian Poetrie. Such foode breedes many vncleane beasts in Citie and Country. Such men cannot loue the truth and holinesse, because they are repleate with errour and vncleannesse.</p>
   <p>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Ascham,</hi> a man greatly to be commended for his learning and good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection<note place="margin">In his School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master.</note> to pietie, of this matter writes on this manner. <q>These inchanters of <hi>Circes</hi> (saith hee) brought out of Italie, marre mens manners in England, much by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of life, but more by precepts of fond bookes, translated out of Italian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to English. Againe, tenne Sermons at Paules Crosse doe not so much good for mouing men to true doctrine, as one of those bookes doth harme with inticing to ill liuing. I say further, these bookes tend not so much to corrupt honest
<pb facs="5"/>
liuing, as they doe to subuert true Religon:</q> More Papists be made by your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bookes of Italie, than by your earnest bookes of Louaine. This complaint ought wise men to consider well of, for that the world was neuer more full of Italian conceits, nor men more in danger for the long contempt of Gods truth to be Italianated. The diet and cure of soules afflicted is a very great mysterie, wherein but few haue trauelled to reduce that matter into any good forme of art, or to giue vs any good method of practise. M. <hi>Luther,</hi> M. <hi>Beza, Vrbanus Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> M. <hi>Taffin,</hi> and others, haue very excellent formes of consolation; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny godly brethren in our times haue ministred good helpe for the cure of soules afflicted: but wanting art and good experience, we conceiue the danger to be great, and often (as blind Empyrikes) cause it to be greater; for that wee rather gesse vncertainlie to applie good remedies, and speeches vnto the sicke, than know how to proceed by any certaine rule of art, and well grounded practise. If the naturall Physition might truly say, as touching his facultie, <note n="*" place="margin">

   <p>This reuerend man of God, M. GREENHAM, was a man in his life time of great hope, and could haue giuen best rules for this vnknowne facultie: for that the Lord by his good knowledge and experience, restored many from vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able torments, and terrors of minde; of which some are asleepe in Christ, and as yet liuing not a few. If the Lord had not so soone translated him to rest, hee was no doubt as fit, and as willing as any in our age to effect this matter. Of his knowledge this way, all the godly learned that knew him, both can and will speake, I doubt not. Of his good will herein to posteritie, let his owne words te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the good desires of his heart: for by a speciall occasion he speaketh of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe on this manner. <q>He hath had a long time a setled disposition (as he trusteth) of God, to studie the cases of Conscience, to succour the perplexed in them: he<note place="margin">In his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie.</note> hath been so filled with compassion to the afflicted (which God wrought in his heart) as if he had been distressed with them: He hath seene the manifold bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of God vpon his trauell.</q> Againe, that many godly learned friends would perswade him to the aforesaid studie, by these and such like arguments. <q>First, that hereby hee might traine vp some younger men to this end, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate<note place="margin">In the same Booke.</note> his experience with them. Secondly, that he might leaue vnto posteritie a commentarie of such particular maladies, as through Gods blessing hee hath cured, together with the meanes vsed to that end: and because precepts are
<pb facs="5"/>
wanting, rules of direction in such cases (by a through searching, with a diligent and continuall obseruation and conference with others learned and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced) might in this age, or in the age following, be brought to some forme of method and Art, whereby the knowledge and experience of these things might be made common to many, not onely to the fruitfull curing, but also the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preuenting of manifold mischiefes. Thus farre his owne words.</q>
   </p>
   <p>Let these graue Counsels and fruitfull obseruations in this first part of his holie workes (which I haue here published) testifie how mindfull and carefull he was for many yeeres, to giue herein a comfortable direction for posteritie.</p>
   <p>I am the meanest and the weakest of many brethren to write of this reuerend mans life, and labours in the Church of God: yet had I rather be noted of some for want of skill, than of any for want of loue and affection to so louing a father. I haue knowne his life for many yeeres, and reioyce in heart to haue knowne it, for that most rare graces of Gods spirit did shine in him, all tempered as with faith vnfained vnto Christ, so with bowels of compassion and loue towards men. In his holy Ministerie, hee was euer carefull to auoide all occasions of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, desiring in all things to approoue himselfe as the Minister of Christ; he much reicoyced and praised God for the happie gouernment of our most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Queene ELIZABETH, and for this blessed calme and peace of Gods Church, and people vnder it; and spake often of it both publikely and priuatly, as he was occasioned, and stirred vp the hearts of all men what he could to pray, and to praise God with him for it continually: yea, this matter so affected him, that the day before his departure out of this life, his thoughts were much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, for that men were so vnthankfull for that strange and happie deliuerance of our most gratious Queene, from the dangerous conspiracies and practises of that time. He was the speciall instrument and hand of God to bring many, both<note place="margin">D. Lopes.</note> godly and learned, to the holy seruice of Christ, in his Ministerie, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine, and to reduce not a few from schisme and error, striuing alwaies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine such in obedience of lawes, and pretiouslie to esteeme and regard the peace of the Church and people of God.</p>
   <p>When God had translated this <hi>Elias</hi> from vs, then I sought to finde him in his workes: for they doe liuely expresse the picture of his minde and heart, and taste sweetly of that pure fountaine of God, from whence they were deriued.<note place="margin">Noct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>s Attic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> Gellius &amp; Phauorinus.</note> While he liued, his lips often refreshed my soule: when he was gone, I lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much that I had not in Christianitie made that vse of him; that a Heathen doth of a naturall wise man in humanitie. But now I praise God I haue found some good supplie of that which (through mine owne negl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>gence) I wanted: for of his workes (which were then dispersed farre and neere, but now by Gods prouidence the greatest and best part are come into my hands) I can say for my content as much as <hi>Cyprian</hi> could say of his graue, ancient and learned <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Da mihi M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
         <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum.</note> both for speciall instruction and consolation.</p>
   <p>He was no sooner gone from vs, but some respecting gaine, and not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding godlinesse, attempted forthwith to publish some fragments of his workes, to the griefe (that I say no more) of many louing friends, which haue long desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and expected the impression of all his workes. And here could I wish all the godly learned were of <note n="*" place="margin">In his Epistle before his notes on the Reuelation.</note> M. <hi>Francis Iunius</hi> iudgement, for hee (to escape these hucksters handling) endeuours wisely in his life time to preuent such a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.
<pb facs="6"/>
For this cause M. D. <hi>Crooke,</hi> (a reuerend man for his learning and labour in the Church, well deseruing of Gods people) for the great loue hee bare him, and desiring the good of many, pervsed and corrected some part of these workes, intending to reuiew the whole. Now the Lord hath taken him also from vs, and giuen him rest; I haue endeuoured what I could to looke ouer the rest of all these workes; and here I offer and recommend them to the Church of God, in the best manner that I can, after some labour and wearines. I wanted not the helpe of diuers both godly and learned friends, we haue conferred sundrie copies together, and by good conference reuised and corrected all.</p>
   <p>The Treatise of Counsels I found most distracted and corrupted. Of many hundreds I selected these few, and haue reduced them into this alphabeticall order, desiring so to dispose them, as that euery counsell might be set vnder one speciall head or argument, whereunto it seemed to haue most reference. As for example, all of affections I couched vnder that title AFFECTIONS, and all of afflictions, vnder that title, and so of the rest. Of these Counsels I may anouch (Christian Reader) that thou shalt finde more experienced knowledge, and more sound refreshing for thy soule in some one of them, than in some one whole Sermon, full of humane eloquence, and affectation of stile, which so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nice eares doe so much admire, and yet still be learning and come but to a poore and meane taste and knowledge of the truth.</p>
   <p>When this volume was finished and past the presse, in reuiewing the whole, for the correction of some verball faults: I see and must confesse wee haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by our negligence, not onely in the words, but also in the matter: yet so as I trust the louing and Christian readers, will accept our endeuour without offence. In the Counsels ye haue often this addition, <hi>he thought this,</hi> or <hi>he said that:</hi> here I must request thee (Christian reader) not to iudge any such speeches to proceed from any pride or singularitie: for that such obseruations (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) were collected and taken by <note n="*" place="margin">M. Hopkins.</note> others, and not set downe by himselfe. If his own hand had giuen these workes the last filing, they might haue (no doubt) a farre more excellent forme and beautie. But such were his trauels in his life time in preaching and comforting the afflicted, that he could not possiblie leaue these workes as he desired. In that one treatise of the Sabbath I found his owne hand, with many <note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>He knew right well the Poets wittie counsell:</hi> Vos ò Pompilius san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis carmen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendite, quod <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>n multa dies &amp; multa litura coercuit, atque perfectum decies non castigauit ad vnguem.</note> corrections, and yet not answering (I am well assured) his hearts desire.</p>
   <p>There are foure yeeres past since I first purposed the collection and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all these works. Now thou hast (good reader an impression of all (which hitherto I haue collected) in this forme thou seest, that so by Gods good proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they may the better be reserued as a holy monument for posteritie. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, be aduertised againe (good Christian) that whereas some books serue well for the increase of knowledge in diuine mysteries, in the causes and meanes of saluation, yet thou must remember not to rest herein: for many be rich in knowledge which be very poore, and barren in obedience, contented onely to looke on the end a farre off, and thinking that when like Snailes they creepe in the way, they be too forward, and make too much haste to follow Christ. And againe, whereas others labour much and to good purpose in books of controuersies against all the professed enemies of the Gospell: this studie
<pb facs="6"/>
also hath not the like fruit in all sorts of people, for howsoeuer some profit much this way the Church of God, in the confutation of all the aduersaries of the Gospell: yet in very many, these bookes helpe little to godlines, but rather fill the heads and hearts of men with a spirit of contradiction and contention, as our common experience daily teacheth vs. This good seruant of Christ in all these workes, doth not onely teach and informe the mind in sundry arguments handled in this volume, concerning truth and error, that so in iudgement wee might receiue the one and reiect the other: but most principally respecteth in the whole, to edifie the heart and conscience, being well assured, that this part hath most neede in most Christians of direction and consolation: and as we be in this part affected, so be we in substance and veritie before God. For this cause hee desireth and laboureth most in all these workes, to stirre vp the heart, and to quicken the affections to embrace true godlines, that so being freed from sin by the blood of Christ, &amp; <hi>made the seruants of God, we might haue our fruit in holines,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14. Rom. 6. 22.</note>
      <hi>and in the end eternall life.</hi> In this Impression I haue carefully reuised and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in the whole worke, all the faults, which either by mine owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate reading, or by the helpe of other louing friends, I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue in word or matter. Here I rest for a time, requesting thy prayers (good Christian Reader) that now all these holy workes thus knit together, may serue to Gods glorie, and to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther building of the Church of God in our Land.</p>
