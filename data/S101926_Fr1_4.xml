      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was not longe after (gentle Reader) that I had compyled a little Dictionarye for the vse and behoue of my contry men, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Walsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the same sette forthe and published at the kinges hyghnes licence and pleasure, but there came certayne persons vnto me,<note place="margin">The occa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> makynge of thys boke.</note> whereof some were Englysh marchers bordering vpon Wales: and some not skilled in the Walshe tonge, neuertheles hauyng good and honeste occasions, eyther for their promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and lyuynges, eyther els for trade of Marchaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and other their affayres to be conuersante in the sayde contrye of Wales, and peraduenture sometime chaunce to be amonge them that can not a worde of Englishe.</p>
   <p>And some other were such Walshmen that had bē brought vp from their youth and tender age, oute of the precincte of their natiue contrye, who thoughte it reproch to be vtterly ignoraunt in their mother tong, hauing a mind also to come to some knowledge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, wherby they myght y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rather (semyng lesse straūg) renewe frendshyp and familiaritie with their contrye folke and frendes, (whyche thynge otherwyse they coulde not so conuenientlye brynge to passe) &amp; mooste chiefely to edifie them, as well in ciuyle institutions, as in godlye doctryne.</p>
   <p>Nowe the other some, were such Englishe men as had not so vrgente a cause, nor so earnest an occasion to trauell in thys behalfe, but yet were they so feruent (as it semed bi their importune request) as they (whō I spake of before) whom the Grekes with one propre
<pb facs="6"/> terme cal Philoglottous,<note place="margin">Langage louers</note> whose gētle herted disposition is alwaies addicte, bente, &amp; geuen to be sene in al lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, but speciallye of their owne felow subiectes and contrey menne, thoughe they purchase there by but small gaynes, lucre, or wynnyng, whiche thynges be the honied swete baytes of the auaricious beastly misers, and contrarywyse the defiaunce of all liberal and noble stomakes.</p>
   <p>Whan (I saye) suche menne resorted vnto me to question whether the sayde Dictionarye was as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differente for Englyshe men to learne Walshe by, as for Walshe men to learne Englishe: I answered that it was not al so indifferent. The reson why, if I shold declare it, shoulde not be easely perceyued but of the learned, who do vnderstande it already.</p>
   <p>Than emongest other communication hadde, they asked, whether the pronounciation of the Letters in Walshe, dyd dyffer from the Englyshe soundynge of them? And I sayde verye muche. And so they percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge that they coulde not profite in buildynge anye further on the Walshe, lackynge the foundation and grounde worcke (whyche was the Walshe pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the letters) desiered me efte sones to write vnto them (as they hadde sene me do in Walsh to my contryemen, to introducte them to pronounce the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Englyshe like) a fewe englishe rules of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power of the letters in our tonge.</p>
   <p>And so than, in as muche as I was not onelye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the premises, but also further perswaded that neith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>r any incōuenience or mischefe might ensue or grow therof, but rather the encrease of mutuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and brotherly loue, and continuall frendshyppe,
<pb facs="7"/> and some commoditie at the leaste wise, to suche as be desierous to be occupied thereaboutes. As for all other, euen as it shall neuer worke them pleasure, so shall it no displeasure.</p>
   <p>Euen therefore at the last, I haue bene so bold as to enterpryse (condescendynge to suche mens honeste requeste) to inuent and wryte these plaine, simple, and rude rudimentes of the Walshe pronunciation of the letters, moste humbly desierynge the Readers to accepte them wyth no lesse beniuolente hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie than I hertely pretended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them, whan I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute to treate of the matter.</p>
