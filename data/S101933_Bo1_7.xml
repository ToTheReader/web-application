   <p>FOR recreation no better meane can be kept, then that which is iust and euen with the wise mans measure: who said, Be not too iust, neither mak thy selfe too wise: for why shouldest thou make thy selfe desolate: Be not too wicked or a foole: for why shouldest thou dye before thy time, Eccle. 7 18.19. For as they are too iust and too wise; which beyond the rule of God his word, abridge the lawfull libertie of honest exercise: so they are too wicked, which either make no choise, or keepe no measure in their recreations. Which thing is manifest by this, that the first sort, doe either by immoderate austeritie, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>numbe their giftes, or by a superstitious conceit, make a shew of godlines, where the power of it is wanting: The second, doe either by excesse make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues drunken, euen to the death, [yea sometimes of their bodies,] or else by a sweet and fleshely delight do cast themselues into such a sleep, as doth partly spoyle their giftes, partlie make them slouthfull and idle to all good workes. For avoiding of both these extremities. I do alwaies with Solomon, exhort al men to lay good hold vpon the latter counsel, least in pastime, they become wretchles and prophane: also not to put backe their hande from the former, least by contempt of an outwarde blessing, they decay in ane inward grace. Because [I knowe] that will prooue true which Solomon saith. He that feareth God, will escape out of all these pitfals.</p>
   <p>For the better information of some to whome I am more especially bounde▪ I had writtin this shorte remembrance following, minding by priuate cemmunicating of the same with them further to prouoke their willing minds to make streight steppes vnto their feet: least that which is halting, be turned out of the way, when it ought rather to be healed. Heb. 12.13.</p>
   <p>But the perswasions of some who desired to haue it common, &amp; the commoditie of more easie communicating of it, this way, hath moued me to make it thus common. The general matter [<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> hope] none will mislike. In the particular pointe of lot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es, if my reasons after the poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, by the weight of the Sanctua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ie, be found too light. I will beare that losse, so the rest, being pure golde and siluer out of God his worde, may passe. Yet I warne all, that when they come to weighe them, they bring not only the Lordes waightes: but also keepe a steddy and true hand, in the doing thereof.</p>
   <p>Prooue all: hold fast that which is good: abstain from all appearance of euill▪ And if this do thee any good, help me with thy prayers.</p>
