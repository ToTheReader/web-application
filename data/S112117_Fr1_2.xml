      </gap>rswaded euill, but it was inctantly put in practise: You shall dye (said God) was heard, but you shall not dye (said the Diuell) was beleeued. Our eares are daily acquainted with the threatnings of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb facs="3"/>
against sinners, and yet that sinne, that broad way-path and highway to hell, is attempted with a delectation and pleasure so craftie and subtill are the baits and lures of the deceiuer, and so void of spirituall wisedome is the soule-murdering sinner. But if due consideration were had of the wages of sinne, and the reward of vnrighteousnesse, and to what bitternesse it will turne in the end, it would make vs lesse bold to sinne, and more fearefull to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, if we would take into our company for a daily consort, the pale memory of death, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he summoneth vs after this life. Death it selfe is very fearefull, but much more terrible, in regard of the iudgement it warneth vs
<pb facs="3"/>
vnto. Imagine to see a sinner lye on his departing bed, burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and tyred with the grieuous and heauie load of all his former trespasses, goared with the sting and pricke of a festered consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, feeling the crampe of death wresting at his heart strings, ready to make the ruthfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce betweene soule and body, panting for breath, and swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in a cold and fatall sweat, wearied with strugling against the deadly pangs: Oh how much would he giue for an houre of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance! at what rate would he value a daies contrition! Then worlds would be worthlesse, in respect of a little respite, a short truce would seeme more precious than the treasures of Empires,
<pb facs="4"/>
nothing would be so much estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as a moment of time, which non by moneths and yeeres is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uishly spent.</p>
   <p>How inconsolable were his case, his friends being fled, his sences frighted, his thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, his memorie decaied, his whole minde agast, and no part able to performe that it should, but onely his guiltie conscience pestered with sinne, continually vpbraiding him with bitter accusations? what would hee thinke then (stripped out of this mortall weed, and turned both out of the seruice and house roome of this world) hee must passe before a most seuere Iudge, carrying in his owne conscience his enditement written, and a
<pb facs="4"/>
perfect register of all his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds: when hee should see the Iudge prepared to passe the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against him, and the same to be his Vmpire, whom by so many offences he hath made his enemie: When not onely the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, but euen the Angels, should plead against him, and himselfe maugre his will, bee his owne sharpest appeacher: What were to be done in these dreadfull exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents?</p>
   <p>When hee saw that gastly dungeon and huge gulfe of hell, breaking out with fearefull flames, the weeping, houling, and gnashing of teeth, the rage of all those hellish monsters, the horrour of the place, the rigour of the paine, the terrour of the
<pb facs="5"/>
company, and the eternitie of all those punishments. Would you thinke them wise that would daily in so weighty matters, and idlely play away the time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to preuent these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable calamities? Would you then account it secure, to nurse in your bosome so many vgly Serpents as sinnes are, or to foster in your soule so many malicious accusers, as mortall faults are?</p>
   <p>Would you not then thinke one life too little to repent for so many iniquities, euerie one whereof, were enough to cast you into those euerlasting and vnspeakeable torments? Why then doe we not (at the least) deuote that small remnant of
<pb facs="5"/>
these our latter dayes, to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an attonement with God, that our consciences may be free from this eternall danger? Who would relie the euerlasting affaires of the life to come, vpon the gliding, slipperinesse; and running streame of our vncertaine life?</p>
   <p>It is a preposterous pollicie (in any wise conceit) to fight against God till our weapons be blunted, our forces consumed, our limmes impotent, and our breath spent; and then when we fall for faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and haue fought our selues almost dead, to presume on his mercy. It were a strange peece of Art, and a very exorbitant course, while the Ship is sound, the Pylot well, the Marriners strong, the gale fauourable, and the Sea calme,
<pb facs="6"/>
to lye idle at rode: and when the Ship leakes, the Pylot were sicke, the Marriners faint, the stormes boysterous, and the Sea turmoyled with surges, to launch forth for a voyage into a farre Country: yet such is the skill of our euening re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, who though in the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of health, and in the perfect vse of reason, they cannot resolue to weigh the ankers that withhold them from God, neuerthelesse, feed themselues with a strong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, that when their sences are astonied, their wits distracted, their vnderstanding dusked, and both body and minde racked and tormented with the throbs and gripes of a mortall sicknesse, then will they thnke of the weightiest matters, and become Saints, when
<pb facs="6"/>
they are scarse able to behaue themselues like reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? being then presumed to be lesse then men: for how can he that is assaulted with an vnsetled conscience, distrained with the wringing fits of his dying flesh, maimed in all his abilities, and circled in with so many encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, be thought of due discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to dispose of his chiefest iewell, which is his soule? No, no, they that will loyter in seed time, and begin then to sowe when others begin to reape: they that will riot out their health, and cast their accounts when they can scarsely speake: they that will slumber out the day, and enter their iourney when the light doth faile them, let them blame their owne folly, if they dye
<pb facs="7"/>
in debt, and eternall beggerie, and fall headlong into the lapse of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse perdition.</p>
   <p>Great cause haue wee then to haue an hourely watchfull care ouer our soule, being so dangerous assaulted and enuironed: most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly entreating the diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty to be our assured defence, and let vs passe the day in mourning, the night in watching and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and our whole time in plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lamenting, falling downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground humbled in sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath and ashes, hauing lost the garment of Christ, that hee may receiue what the persecuting ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would haue spoyled, euery short sigh will not be sufficient satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor euery knocke a warrant to get in. Many shall cry Lord,
<pb facs="7"/>
Lord, and shall not be accepted: the foolish Virgins did knocke, but were not admitted: <hi>Iudas</hi> had some sorrow, and yet died despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Foreslow not (saith the holy Ghost) to be conuerted vnto God, and make not a daily lingering of thy repaire vnto him: for thou shalt finde the suddennesse of his wrath and reuenge not slacke to destroy sinners. For which cause, let no man soiourne long in sinfull securitie, or post ouer his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance vntill feare enforce him to it, but let vs frame our premises as we would finde our conclusion, endeauouring to liue as we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to dye: let vs not offer the maine cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>p to the Diuell, and set God to gleane the reproofe of his haruest: let vs not gorge the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
<pb facs="8"/>
with our fairest fruits, and turne God to the filthy sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>aps of his leauings: but let vs truely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate both soule and body to his seruice, whose right they are, and whose seruice they owe; that so in the euening of our life we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to a Christian rest, closing vp the day of our life with a cleare sunne-set, that leauing all dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse behinde vs, we may carry in our consciences the light of grace: and so escaping the horrour of an eternall night, passe from a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall day, to an euerlasting morrow,</p>
