<hi>M. VVilliam Rice Esquier, H. G.</hi>
wisheth a happy long life, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of muche worship.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N HOVV MVCHE
the thankfull sorte are
desirous (as reson vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
and experience
daylie teacheth) to
gratifie such their dear
frends, as to vvhom for
sundrie good turnes and receiued benefits
they are not a litle beholding, the sundrie
dealing of thousands dayly in vse and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
to the vvorlde, to the great prayse
and commendation both of the one and
the other, giueth a sufficient testimonie:
So that, taking occasion thereby to shevv
the good vvill I haue, to pay in parte the
debt many yeres due, for that your boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
tovvards me (the least sparke vvhereof
I am vnable to satisfie:) I do giue vnto
you this ITLLIAN Disport, the vvhich I
haue turned out of his natiue attyre into
this our ENGLISH habite, to the ende
the same may be no lesse familiar to you,
and to such other (for your sake) as shall
<pb facs="4"/>
vouchsafe thereof, than it is either to the
ITALIAN or the FRENCH: and desire
that the same may march abroade vnder
your charge: to vvhom I recount the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
therof. Not douting but as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
therof shal bring pleasure and delite:
so the matter beeing therevvithall duely
considered, shal giue sundry profitable les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
mete to be folovved. And bicause the
name of the author (being of no smal cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
vvith the learned, for those his sundry
vvel written vvorks) is of it selfe sufficient
to carry greater commendation therwith,
than my pen is able to vvrite, I leaue to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
therin, lest my lack may be an occasiō
to the leesing of his due prayse. And vntill
Fortune (the onely hope of the vnhappy)
shall make me better able, I shall desire
you thankfully to accept this as a token
and pledge of the good vvil I haue to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
that vvhervnto mine abilitie is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to stretch. Thus taking my leaue, I
betake you to the tuitiō of almightie god,
vvho preserue you in health to his plesure,
and after this life make you possessor of
those ioyes, vvhereof vve all hope to be
partakers. 6. Martij. 1566.</p>
