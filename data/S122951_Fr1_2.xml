   <head>To the godly and
wel-affected Reader.</head>
   <p>GEntle Reader, I haue
here presented vnto
thy view, the summe
and substance of diuers Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
which I preached vnto
mine owne Charge, and some
adioyning neighbours: who
receiuing (as they professed)
much good by my Labours,
were earnest with me either
to bestow vpon them some of
my notes, or else to publish in
Print, that which I had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
in word. Whose requests
I could not well with-stand,
being vrged by some, that my
<pb facs="5"/>
calling makes me a common
seruant for any good I may in
publike, as well as in priuate.
And I was rather induced
vnto this taske in a double
respect. First, because amōgst
the heape of bookes that are
printed, too few strike downe-right
at sin, or lend a hand to
helpe forward the worke of
Grace. Secondly, because the
iniquity of the time is such,
that with too many (who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the fashions of the world)
grace is out of fashion, and of
all other things the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
or looked after; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
(as I shall make it
plaine) it be the only thing to
be desired, as that which san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies
and well-seasons euery
condition heere, and makes
way for happinesse hereafter:
<pb facs="5"/>
for the want of Grace cuts off
all hope of future glory, and
precipitates people into end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
woe and misery. Nature
by its strength may in time
worke out, or weare out many
bodily maladies, without the
aduice of the Physician, or any
helpe of physick: but the soule,
so deadly sin-sick as it is, can
neuer be helped and healed,
without the Balsam of grace;
which alone is able in time to
worke out those malignant
humors, which the soule hath
contracted vnto it selfe. A
rare thing it is to finde that
man or woman which wil not
easily be perswaded, for the
preuenting or curing some
deadly disease, to take (though
otherwise loathing physicke)
such things as shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<pb facs="6"/>
them for their good:
for Nature seekes to preserue
it selfe. Hence it is that the
Toad (vpon distemper) runs
to the Plantin, the Hart to the
Dittany, and the Dog to the
Grasse. Therefore, vnlesse we
will shew our selues to haue
lesse vnderstanding than the
vnreasonable creatures, wee
must looke out for Grace, the
only cure of our distempered
and diseased soules.</p>
   <p>Reade then, I beseech thee,
this small Treatise with the
same affection, and heart, in
which it was compiled for
thee; and that is (God knows)
an earnest desire of bettering
thy spirituall estate, and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
forward thy saluation:
that the worldly wise-man
may grow more wise for his
<pb facs="6"/>
soule; that the vngodly may
labour for grace; that the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
may be more sincere
and vpright; and that the
gracious heart may grow in
grace, and with more comfort
hold it out vnto the end. If
vpon the first taste thou fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
but little, or no sweetnesse
herein, let me intreat thee to
assay the second time; one bit
may draw down another. It is
a rare feast where euery guest
likes, and loues all the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that is made; yet he is an
vnworthy guest which will
feed of no dish, or bee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with his friend which
inuited him, because some
one or two dishes bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
which hee likes not.
Reade, taste, and consider.
If thou receiue any good by
<pb facs="7"/>
these my Labours, giue God
the praise, and pray
for mee</p>
