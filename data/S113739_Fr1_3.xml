      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, I haue published this Hystorie, at the intreaty of some of my familiar friends, beeing at the first collected with no intent to haue it printed, for as yet hauing taken but one flight, I durst not too boldely venture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, lest my vnskilfulnesse might cause my repentance. But beeing supported by the assistance of your gentle fauours, I shall grow hardie, &amp; hereafter labour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your further delight: the rewarde I expect, beeing your kinde acceptance. But if contrary to my thought, this my summer fruite be gathered before it be ripe, I promise amends with olde fruite, that hath bene a yeare in ripening, and in the beginning of the next winter comming forth. In the meane time, peruse this Historie, which sauoureth more of pleasure, then Eloquence: &amp; although hastily compiled, yet let it pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e vnder your fauourable censure: and by your courtesies, be shrowded from the variable dislikes of <hi>Momu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>
      </hi> vaine imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
   <p>The learned, wise, and curteous, will according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of their dispositions, esteeme well of this vnwoorthie worke, valuing the same, not by the worth, but by the will of the wryter.</p>
   <p>As for such as either rashly condemne without iudgement, or lauishly dislike without aduice, I esteeme them like the downe of Thistles, inconstantly dispearst with euery blast, accounting their discontent, my content: not caring for to please those that are pleased with nothing.</p>
   <p>But did my gaines, counteruaile my labours, I would then frame my fancie to sit their humours, but getting nothing, I can loose no lesse, onely to haue a good opinion of the well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to learning, is all I craue: and that I hope your good mindes will affoord.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>As at a Banquet there are seuerall kindes of meates, some pleasant, other sharpe, yet all tasted. Amongst Grapes, some sowre, some sweete, yet all esteemed, so with indifferencie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst varietie of eloquent Histories, let this serue as one dish to furnish out a Banquet, and like sowre and sweete intermingled, make a pleasant taste, by your courteous construing of my good meaning, and your fauourable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Ornatus</hi> loue. So shall I account my debt to you great, my labours wel bestowed, and my selfe bound to requite your kindnesse. You shall shewe your affection to learning, vertue in fauouring good indeuours, &amp; giue incouragement to mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> worthie labours. I rest well contented, my reward rich, and hereafter be both readie and willing to deserue your curtesie. But if <hi>Ornatus</hi> loue breede my blame, as it bred his banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then may I wish I had neuer knowne thereof, and crie out of <hi>Mala fortuna,</hi> as my reward. With the bird <hi>Cel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>s</hi> bred in <hi>Affrica,</hi> who wandring far from her nest, by forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse cannot return: and so for euer after abandoneth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. So I too boldly building on your curtesie, may bee wounded with repentance, and by my ouersight bee brought in dispaire, vnlesse your curtesie preuent the same: on which my hopes depend. And so I cease.</p>
