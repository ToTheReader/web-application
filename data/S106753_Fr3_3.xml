   <head>To the right honourable sir Robert Cecil knight, principall Secretary to her Maiestie, master of the Court of Wards and Liueries, and one of her Maiesties most honourable priuie Councel.</head>
   <p>RIght honourable, your fauourable acceptance of my second volume of <hi>The English voyages</hi> offred vnto you the last yere, your perusing of the same at your conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent leasure, your good testimony of my selfe and of my trauailes therein, together with the infallible signes of your earnest desire to doe mee good, which very lately, when I thought least thereof, brake forth into most bountiful and acceptable effects: these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations haue throughly animated and encouraged me to present vnto your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent censure this my third and last volume also. The subiect and matter herein contained is the fourth part of the world, which more commonly then properly is called <hi>America:</hi> but by the chiefest au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors <hi>The new world. New,</hi> in regard of the new and late discouery thereof made by <hi>Christopher Colon,</hi> alias <hi>Columbus,</hi> a <hi>Genouois</hi> by nation, in the yere of grace 1492. And <hi>world,</hi> in respect of the huge extension thereof, which to this day is not throughly discouered, neither within the Inland nor on the coast, especially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the North and Northwest, although on the hither side it be knowen vnto vs for the space of fiue thousand leagues at the least, compting and considering the trending of the land, and for 3000. more on the backeside in the <hi>South Sea</hi> from the <hi>Streight of Magellan</hi> to <hi>Cape Mendoçino</hi> and <hi>Noua Albion.</hi> So that it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth very fitly to be called <hi>A newe worlde.</hi> Howbeit it cannot be denied but that Antiquitie had some kinde of dimme glimse, and vnperfect notice thereof. Which may appeare by the relation of <hi>Plato</hi> in his two worthy dialogues of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus</hi> and <hi>Critias</hi> vnder the discourse of that mighty large yland called by him <hi>Atlantis,</hi> lying in the Ocean sea without the <hi>Streight of Hercules,</hi> now called the <hi>Streight of Gibraltar,</hi> being (as he there reporteth) bigger then <hi>Africa</hi> &amp; <hi>Asia:</hi> And by that of <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his booke <hi>De admirandis auditionibus</hi> of the long nauigation of certaine <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who sayling forth of the aforesaid <hi>Streight of Gibraltar</hi> into the maine Ocean for the space of many dayes, in the ende found a mighty and fruitfull yland, which they would haue inhabited, but were forbidden by their Senate and chiefe gouernours. Moreouer, aboue 300. yeeres after these wee haue the testimony of <hi>Diodorus Siculus lib. 5. cap. 7.</hi> of the like mighty yland discouered in the Westerne Ocean by the <hi>Tyrrheni,</hi> who were forbidden for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine causes to inhabite the same by the foresaid <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> And <hi>Seneca</hi> in his tragedie intituled <hi>Medea</hi> foretold aboue 1500. yeeres past, that in the later ages
<pb facs="590"/>
the Ocean would discouer new worlds, and that the yle of <hi>Thule</hi> would no more be the vttermost limite of the earth. For whereas <hi>Virgile</hi> had said to <hi>Augustus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar, Tibi seruiat vltima Thule,</hi> alluding thereunto he contradicteth the same, and saith, <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>c sit terris vltima Thule.</hi> Yea <hi>Tertullian</hi> one of our most ancient and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diuines, in the beginning of his treatise <hi>de Pallio</hi> alludeth vnto <hi>Plato</hi> his West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne <hi>Atlantis,</hi> which there by another name he calleth <hi>Acon,</hi> saying, <hi>Aeon in At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantico nunc quaeritur.</hi> And in his 40. chapter <hi>de Apologetico</hi> he reporte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>h the same to be bigger then all <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Asia.</hi> Of this <hi>Newworld</hi> and euery speciall part thereof in this my third volume I haue brought to light the best &amp; most perfect relations of such as were chiefe actours in the particular discoueries and serches of the same, giuing vnto euery man his right, and leauing euery one to mainteine his owne credit. The order obserued in this worke is farre more exact, then heretofore I could attaine vnto: for whereas in my two former volumes I was enforced fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> lacke of sufficient store, in diuers places to vse the methode of time onely (which many worthy authors on the like occasion are enforced vnto) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now more plentifully <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>urnished with matter, I alwayes follow the double or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time and place. Wherefore proposing vnto my selfe the right situation of this <hi>New world,</hi> I begin at the extreme Northerne limite, and put downe succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely in one ranke or <hi>classis,</hi> according to the order aforesaide, all such voyages as haue bene made to the said part: which comming all together, and following orderly one vpon another, doe much more lighten the readers vnderstanding, and confirme his iudgement, then if they had bene scattered in sundry corners of the worke. Which methode I obserue from the highest North to the lowest South. Now where any country hath bene but seldome hanted, or any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and chiefe action occurreth, if I finde one voyage well written by two seuerall persons, sometimes I make no difficultie to set downe both those iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, as finding diuers things of good moment obserued in the one, which are quite omitted in the other. For commonly a souldier obserueth one thing, and a mariner another, and as your honour knoweth, <hi>Plus vident oculi, quàm oculus.</hi> But this course I take very seldome and sparingly. And albeit my worke do carry the title of <hi>The English voyages,</hi> aswell in regard that the greatest part are theirs, and that my trauaile was chiefly vndertaken for preseruation of their memorable actions, yet where our owne mens experience is defectiue, there I haue bene careful to supply the same with the best and chiefest relations of strangers. As in the discouery of the <hi>Grand Bay,</hi> of the mighty riuer of <hi>S. Laurence,</hi> of the countries of <hi>Canada, Hochelaga,</hi> and <hi>Saguenay,</hi> of <hi>Florida,</hi> and the Inland of <hi>Cibola, Tiguex, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuic,</hi> and <hi>Quiuira,</hi> of <hi>The gulfe of California,</hi> &amp; the Northwesterne sea-coast to <hi>Cabo Mendoçino</hi> and <hi>Sierra Neuada:</hi> as also of the late &amp; rich discouery of 15. prouinces on the backside of <hi>Florida</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> the chiefest wherof is called the kingdome of <hi>New Mexico,</hi> for the wealth, ciuil gouernment, and populousnesse of the same. Moreouer, because since our warres with <hi>Spaine,</hi> by the taking of their ships, and sacking of their townes and cities, most of all their secrets of the <hi>West Indies,</hi> and euery part thereof are fallen into our peoples hands (which in former time were for the most part vnknowen vnto vs,) I haue vsed the vttermost of my best ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, to get, and hauing gotten, to translate out of Spanish, and here in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent volume to publish such secrets of theirs, as may any way auaile vs or annoy them, if they driue and vrge vs by their sullen insolencies, to cōtinue our courses of hostilitie against them, and shall cease to seeke a good and Christian peace vpon indifferent and equal conditions. What these things be, and of how great importance your honour in part ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> vnderstand, if it please you to vouchsafe to reade the Catalogues cōteyning the 14. principal heads of this worke. Whereby
<pb facs="590"/>
your honor may farther perceiue that there is no chiefe riuer, no port, no towne, no citie, no prouince of any reckoning in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> that hath not here some good description thereof, aswell for the inland as the seast-coast. And for the knowledge of the true breadth of the Sea betweene <hi>Noua Albion</hi> on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west part of <hi>America,</hi> and the yle of <hi>Iapan</hi> lying ouer against the kingdomes of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> which vntil these foure yeeres was neuer reueiled vnto vs, being a point of exceeding great consequence, I haue here inserted the voyage of one <hi>Francis Gualle</hi> a Spaniard made from <hi>Acapulco</hi> an hauen on the <hi>South sea</hi> on the coast of <hi>New Spaine,</hi> first to the <hi>Philippinas,</hi> and then to the citie of <hi>Macao</hi> in <hi>China,</hi> and homeward from <hi>Macao</hi> by the yles of <hi>Iapan,</hi> and thence to the back of the <hi>West Indies</hi> in the Northerly latitude of 37. degrees ½. In which course betweene the said ylands and the maine he found a wide and spacious open Ocean of 900. leagues broad, which a little more to the Northward hath bene set out as a <hi>Streight,</hi> and called in most mappes <hi>The Streight of Anian.</hi> In which relation to the viceroy hee constantly affirmeth three seuerall times, that there is a passage that way vnto the North parts of <hi>Asia.</hi> Moreouer, because I perceiue by a letter directed by her Maiestie to the Emperour of <hi>China</hi> (and sent in the last Fleet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for those parts by <hi>The South Sea</hi> vnder the charge of <hi>Beniamin Wood,</hi> chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set out at the charges of sir <hi>Robert Duddeley,</hi> a gentleman of excellent parts) that she vseth her princely mediation for obtaining of freedome of traffique for her marchants in his dominions, for the better instruction of our people in the state of those countries, I haue brought to light certaine new aduertisements of the late alteration of the mightie monarchie of the confronting yle of <hi>Iapan,</hi> and of the new conquest of the kingdome of <hi>Coray,</hi> not long since tributarie to the king of <hi>China,</hi> by <hi>Quabacondono</hi> the monarch of all the yles and princedomes of <hi>Iapan;</hi> as also of the <hi>Tartars</hi> called <hi>Iezi,</hi> adioyning on the East &amp; Northeast parts of <hi>Coray,</hi> where I thinke the best vtterance of our natural and chiefe commoditie of cloth is like to be, if it please God hereafter to reueile vnto vs the passage thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Northwest. The most exact and true information of the North parts of <hi>China</hi> I finde in an history of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> which I haue in French, set out within these sixe yeres by the abbat of <hi>Mortimer,</hi> dedicated to the French king that now reigneth, who confesseth that it was long since written in the Arabian tongue by one <hi>Alhacen</hi> a wise and valiant Captaine, employed by the said mighty prince in all his conquests of the foresaid kingdome. Which history I would not haue failed to haue translated into English, if I had not found it learnedly done vnto my hand.</p>
   <p>And for an appendix vnto the ende of my worke, I haue thought it not imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, to exhibite to the graue and discreet iudgements of those which haue the chiefe places in the Admiraltie and marine causes of <hi>England,</hi> Certaine briefe extracts of the orders of the Contractation house of <hi>Siuil</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> touching their gouernment in sea-matters; together with The streight and seuere examination of Pilots and Masters before they be admitted to take charge of ships, aswell by the <hi>Pilot mayor,</hi> and brotherhood of ancient Masters, as by the Kings reader of <hi>The lecture of the art of Nauigation,</hi> with the time that they be enioyned to bee his auditors, and some part of the questions that they are to answere vnto. Which if they finde good and beneficial for our seamen, I hope they wil gladly imbrace and imitate, or finding out some fitter course of their owne, will seeke to bring such as are of that calling vnto better gouernment and more perfection in that most laudable and needfull vocation. To leaue this point, I was once minded to haue added to the end of these my labours a short treatise, which I haue lying by me in writing, touching <hi>The curing of hot diseases incident to traueilers in long and
<pb facs="591"/>
Southerne voyages,</hi> which treatise was written in English, no doubt of a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest mind, by one <hi>M. George Wateson,</hi> and dedicated vnto her sacred Maiestie. But being carefull to do nothing herein rashly, I shewed it to my worshipfull friend <hi>M. doctour Gilbert,</hi> a gentleman no lesse excellent in the chiefest secrets of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks (as that rare iewel lately set foorth by him in Latine doeth euidently declare) then in his owne profession of physicke: who assured me, after hee had perused the said treatise, that it was very defectiue and vnperfect, and that if hee might haue leasure, which that argument would require, he would either write something thereof more aduisedly himselfe, or would conferre with the whole Colledge of the Physicions, and set downe some order by common consent for the preseruation of her Maiesties subiects. Now as the foresaid treatise touched the cure of diseases growing in hot regions, so being requested thereunto by some in authoritie they may adde their iudgements for the cure of diseases inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vnto men employed in cold regions, which to good purpose may serue our peoples turnes, if they chance to prosecute the intermitted discouery by the Northwest, whereunto I finde diuers worshipfull citizens at this present much inclined. Now because long since I did foresee, that my profession of diuinitie, the care of my family, and other occasions might call and diuert me from these kinde of endeuours, I haue for these 3. yeeres last past encouraged and furthered in these studies of Cosmographie and forren histories, my very honest, industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and learned friend M. IOHN PORY, one of speciall skill and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary hope to performe great matters in the same, and beneficial for the common wealth.</p>
   <p>Thus Sir I haue portrayed out in rude lineaments my Westerne <hi>Atlantis</hi> or <hi>America:</hi> assuring you, that if I had bene able, I would haue limned her and set her out with farre more liuely and exquisite colours: yet, as she is, I humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to receiue her with your wonted and accustomed fauour at my handes, who alwayes wil remaine most ready and deuoted to do your honour any poore seruice that I may; and in the meane season will not faile vnfainedly to beseech the Almighty to powre vpon you the best of his temporall blessings in this world, and after this life ended with true and much honour, to make you partaker of his ioyes eternall.</p>
