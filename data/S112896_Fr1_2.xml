   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any causes doe fully perswade me
(right Honorable,) that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
worke which I presume to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
vnto you, will in diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
be vnto you very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For vnto such as are of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
wisedome, vertue and Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
the wisest best and weightiest matters are alwaies
most agreeable. And whereas all men are naturally desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of the souereine welfare, highest felicitie, or cheefe
good, howbeit that very fewe doe knowe what it is, or
wherein it consisteth, or which is the right way that
leadeth thereunto: And yet not withstanding, without
the knowledge of that trueth, all their wisedome is but
mere ignorance blyndnesse and folly, all their goodnesse
is but mere corruption &amp; wickednesse, &amp; al their braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
tryumphe iollitie and pompe is but vtter miserie and
<pb facs="3"/>
wretchednesse: This present worke treateth of the trew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that is to say of the perpetuall and inuariable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
and sted fastnesse of the Christian Religion, the
only band that linketh God vnto man, and men one to
another, and all vnto God, the only Lampe that enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth
mans wit with true wisedome, the onely water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
that replenisheth his will with true goodnesse, and
the only mightis power that giueth strength and courage
to mans spirit, whereby he is enabled both perfectly to
discerne and beholde his souereine welfare or felicitie,
which is God the very founder furtherer and finisher of
trueth or rather the very trueth it selfe; and constantly
to hold on with ioy to the obteynement of the same; than
the which no greater thing can by any meanes bee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
And in the discourse of this most graue &amp; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
matter, many deepe poynts of humaine Philosophie,
and many high misteries of heauenly Diuinitie, be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
breefly and plainly discussed and layd open, to the
vnderstanding euen of the meanest capacities, that will
vout safe to reade aduisedly, &amp; to conferre the parts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with diligence. For the Author of this work being
a man of great reading, iudgement, learning &amp; skill, and
there with addicted or rather vowed (as appeareth by
this and dyuers other of his excellent writings) to the
furthering of Gods glorie by his most faithfull and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
imploying of himselfe in the seruice of his Church;
hath conueyed into this worke, what soeuer he found ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the common reason of all Nations, or in the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb facs="3"/>
principles of the cheefe Philosophers, or in the misti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
doctrine of the Iewish Rabbines, or in the writings
of the Historiographers and Poets; that might conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
make to the manifestation of that trueth which
he taketh in hand to proue. VVherby he hath so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
brought his purpose to passe; that if any Atheist In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel
or Iew hauing read this his worke with aduisemēt,
shall yet donye the Christian Religion to be the true and
only path way to eternall felicitie, &amp; all other Religions
to bee mere vanitie and wickednesse; must needes she we
himself to be either vtterly voyd euen of humaine sence,
or els obstinatly and wilfully bent to impugne the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
trueth against the continuall testimonie of his owne
conscience. Not without iust cause therfore hath so great
loue and lyking of this worke of his bene generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued;
that many not onely of Gentlemen in the Court
and Country, but also of Students in both the Vniversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
haue purposed and attempted the translating ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
into our English tongue, as an increase of comfort and
gladnesse to such as are alreadie rooted and grounded in
the trueth, as a stablishment to such as any way eyther
by their owne infirmitie or through the wilinesse of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
persons are made to wauer and hang in suspence, and
as a meane to reuoke such as of themselues or by sinister
perswasions are gone away into error, and also (if it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
bee) to reforme the malicious and stubbornhearted.
Among which number of weldisposed &amp; rightlyzealous
Gentlemen, I may not without iust desert of blame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="4"/>
to say some what (though farre lesse than is meet) of that,
right worthie and valiant Knight, your good Lordships
noble kinsman Sir Philip Sidney, whose rare vertue, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and courtesie, matched with equall loue and care of
the true Christian Religion, being disappoynted of their
purposed end by ouerhastie death in the very enterance
of his honorable race, haue left iust cause to his louing
Countrie to be wayle the vntymely forgoing of so great
an Ornament, and the sodeyne bereuing of so hopefull a
stay and defence. VVhereof not withstanding this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
remayneth, That he dyed not languishing in ydle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
ryot and excesse, nor as ouercome with nyce plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and fond vanities; but of manly wounds receiued
in seruice of his Prince, in defence of persons oppressed,
in maintenance of the only true Catholick &amp; Christian
Religion, among the noble valiant and wise, in the open
field, in Martiall maner, the honorablest death that
could be desired, and best be seeming a Christian Knight,
whereby he hath worthly wonne to himselfe immortall
fame among the godly, and left example worthie of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to others of his calling. This honorable gentleman
being delighted with the excellēcie of this present work,
began to put the same into our Language for the benefite
of this his natiue Countrie, and had proceeded certeyne
Chapters therein; vntill that intending a higher kind of
seruice to wards God and his Prince, not drawen therto
by subtile deuyce of a wylie Vlysses from companie of
Courtly Ladies, himself being disguised in Ladies attire
<pb facs="4"/>
after the maner of Achilles; nor discouered against his
will by the wisedome of a Palamedes after the maner
of Vlysses; but aduaunced through the hardynesse of his
owne knightly courage like to Prosilaus, he willingly
passed for a tyme from the companie of the Muses to
the Campe of Mars, there to make tryall as well of the
Pyke as he had done of his Pen, after the example of the
valiant Iulius Caesar, whose excellencie in all kinde of
knowledge and learning, could not hold him backe from
seeking to inlarge his renowme by hazarding his noble
person among the weapons of armed Souldyers. Beeing
thus determined to followe the affayres of Chiualrie; it
was his pleasure to commit the performāce of this peece
of seruice which he had intended to the Muses or rather
to Christes Church and his natiue Countrie, vnto my
charge; declaring vnto me how it was his meaning, that
the same being accomplished should bee dedicated vnto
your Honor; a matter so acceptable vnto me, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the charge it self, and of the partie that imposed
it vpon me, and of the person to whom it was intended:
that although in respect of the toylesome and tedious
troubles wherewith I was then pressed and am yet still
in maner oppressed, I could haue found in my heart to
haue forborne the vndertaking of so great a taske at
that tyme; yet notwithstanding I gladly tooke it vpon
me, &amp; (by the goodnesse of God) haue faithfully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it to the vttermost of my skill. In his name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
&amp; as an executor of his will in that behalf, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb facs="5"/>
offer this excellent worke vnto your good Lordship,
as his and not myne. VVherein if any words or phrases
shall seeme straunge, (as in some places perchaunce they
may) I doubt not but your good Lordship will impute it
to the rarenesse and profoundnesse of the matters there
handled, not accustomed heretofore to bee treated of in
our language. For the auoyding of which inconuenience
as much as might be, great care hath bene taken, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
and deryuing of fit names and termes, out of the
fountaynes of our owne tongne, though not altogether
most vsuall, yet alwaies conceyuable and easie to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood;
rather than by vsurping the Latin termes, or
by borrowing the words of any forreine language, least
the matters which in some cases are misticall enough of
themselues by reason of their owne profoundnesse, might
haue bene made more obscure to the vnlearned, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them downe in termes vtterly vnknowne vnto
them. VVherefore forbearing to withhold your Honor
with any further processe of words frō reading the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it selfe, which may much more delight you: I
referre both my selfe and it to your fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
acceptation. VVritten the
13. day of May 1587.</p>
