      <pb facs="3"/>
SOme mē heretofore haue attempted
this self maner of writyng &amp; y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same
worke that is here offred vnto you:
Neyther was their labour altogether
vayne. For at the least if they had but
gathered suche places of Scripture as
seme to dysagree, and done theirende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to agree thē, thoughe they haue
not yelded the true meanyng of places
which thei had takē in hand to expoūd:
yet so it is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> thys inuention of theirs
hath geuen a taste &amp; opened away vnto
such other as followed thē, who were
able to geue a more certayne resolutiō
of the same differences. Let euery one
haue hys prayse: but chiefly let not the
first inuentours be greued y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> those whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
came after holpe thēselues w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> their
inuentiō, and y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> hauing a greater light
of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> scripture they laboured to open y<seg rend="sup">•</seg>
whiche beefore was very darkly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled.
Neither let y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> laste sort seke to set
forth themself to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> dyscōmendation of
those y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> went before: but let both partes
setting abrode simply y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which god hath
geuen thē, bryng forth their workes w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      <pb facs="3"/>
a common agreement to the glorye of
hym only whiche openeth the eyes of
men, and geueth them vnderstandyng
and wysedome to speake well.</p>
   <p>Be it so than (frendly Reader) that
you read y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> others workes y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> haue trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on thys maner, or be it y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> you be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to take profite of thys presente
worke: I pray you bring with you a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
&amp; quiet Iudgement. And I hope y<seg rend="sup">•</seg>
whē you shal haue red y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> other you wil
not refuse y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> reading of this as vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
As at other tymes it hath bene
nedeful to represse the fransy of many
troubled spirits: so thinke you y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> at this
day all such are not yet so stilled, but y<seg rend="sup">•</seg>
they geue many occasions of terrible
frayes, ouerthrowing &amp; corruptyng y<seg rend="sup">•</seg>
meanyng of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scriptures to confyrme
their opinions. And it is necessary that
they should be withstode. And bicause y<seg rend="sup">•</seg>
moste troublesome and hard fighte of
theirs, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> we must abyde, is when y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
is geuē vs by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy▪ scriptures, of
which self scriptures we must borrowe
al oure strength &amp; defence, it behoueth
vs in this case, to vse great wisedome
by which we may repulse y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> deceiptes &amp;
<pb facs="4"/>
sleyghtes of our aduersaries, and so to
applie thē to our purpose as neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we mystake thē not &amp; so bee desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of weapon &amp; defence. For if wee
were assayled by any other meane, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Philosophye or by any other
doctrine of men, it were an easye mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to repulse such assaults, for y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> worde
of God which we make our bucklar &amp;
defence, is of strength agaynst al doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trynes,
&amp; is aboue al doctrynes. But
here in is al y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> doubt whē by y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> word mē
wil destroy y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> word in vs and vs in the
word. There are many y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> reade y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy
scriptures, to this purpose only y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> by the
they may establysh y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> traditions &amp; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of men. They seke in thē some
couer to kepe their trifling ceremonies
Ther ar other y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> hauyng Imagined or
takē some opiniō in their head holding
wilfully and stubbornly, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> whiche they
haue once conceaued, they wrest awrie
&amp; ouerthwartly the places of scripture
hauyng regard to their own ambition
rather thē to y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> teaching &amp; edif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>yng of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
symple ones. There are also diuerse
whiche (not caring for any religiō but
rather wishing y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> al thing wer disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb facs="4"/>
&amp; y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> euery one shold do what semeth
hī best) wickedly take certain scrapings
of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> holy scriptures, and assone as they
haue foūd in thē some litle shew of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
they lay hand on y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> as if they had
ouer cōme al, tending to no other end
but to brīg y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> word of god to be despised
&amp; hated &amp; the readyng of it suspected.
How is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world at thys day fyld ful of
Epicures &amp; contemners. Cōtrarywise
ther ar very fewe y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> hyt y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> marke, which
bryng with thē a good mynde &amp; read &amp;
heare y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scriptures to fynde Christ in
thē, &amp; to cōfyrme thē self in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> true faith,
&amp; to obey God deuoutly as they ought
But these Hogs &amp; Dogs wold not once
voutchsafe to opē their eies to loke vpō
one only sillable in thē if it were not to
finde some Iarre in thē &amp; to make thē
disagree, &amp; to haue some occasiō to find
fault with thē. But y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy ghost which
is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> teacher and author of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scriptures
who is y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> spirit of truth euer like to him
self, alwaies fast &amp; cōstant profers nor
brings forth any thing y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is contrary to
himselfe, nor any thing to entangle or
trouble y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> spirit of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> fathful reader, or to
make him vncertayn, or in doubt what
<pb facs="5"/>
opiniō to beleue &amp; what not to beleue.
For verely if there be any disagreeing
in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy scriptures how maye a man
know what is certayne &amp; sound? How
shal a mā discerne y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> truth frō y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> whiche
is false, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> good frō y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> il, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> certain from y<seg rend="sup">•</seg>
vncertayne, the lyght frō y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> darknesse?
Wherfore we must not feare that the
scriptures deceaue vs, as if ther wer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
disagreeing in thē, neither nede we
doubt y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the false expoūders of thē shal
haue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vpper hand, &amp; reach to y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> marke
y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> they shotte at, if to y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> readyng of thē
we bryng with vs a spirite ready to be
taught: but rather we shal haue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to staye vs, &amp; to defende vs agaynst
al assaultes. I hope y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they which shalbe
guyded with such a spirit of mekenesse
may be holpe by this worke which as
yet is but begon.</p>
   <p>Thys is but only a profe offered in
hast, at whiche if you shal beginne to
take profite, let vs vnderstand it, &amp; you
shal geue hym y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> hath thus begon y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to go further foreward whiche
thyng also he promiseth you. Read and
profiite in the feare of the Lorde.</p>
