      <hi>TO HIS FAYTHFUL AND</hi> Fellow Maister Henry Lassels.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>SOme prudent heads: with pollicie, do ponder how to please, the freendly man by whose desart, they haue founde healpe or ease,</l>
      <l>And other some: there be agayne, which valiently doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>eeke, to do some deed by venture great, that lookers on might like,</l>
      <l>wherby Dame Fame shuld neuer cease, triumphant Trumps to solid, the pollicie and valientnesse, which hath in them been founde.</l>
      <l>But I offrancke, and meare good will, and not to gayne the praise, as one that wanth a cunning skill, to imetate their wayes.</l>
      <l>Do present thes my triflyng toyes, and far vnconning writes: remembryng how the wise man saies, the change of thinges, delites.</l>
      <l>Which not alone apereth trew, by meates whereon wee feede, but change in all thinges doth renew, the apetite in deede:</l>
      <l>When as the Uitale spirits be filde, with vewe of learned Booke, the world eyes do willyng craue, on lighter thinges to looke,</l>
      <l>And Musicke sounde, doth much delight, the eares and minde of man, whose pleasant tunes, so mightie be, that banish cares they can:</l>
      <l>The cause for which, it hath this gifte, is the varietie, in it contaynde, by learned shifte, of skilfull Hermonie.</l>
      <l>Doth not the sounde: of homely Pipe, that Shepperds rudely bloe, refresh the hartes: of rusticke route, their simple skill to shoe.</l>
      <l>Which is sufficient proofe inoughe that change contentes the minde, wherefore I will: pricke on my Plough, some further change to finde</l>
      <l>By tillinge oft my fruitelesse feilde, whose bare and barin soyle, god knowes hath scarce the power to yeld, one Corne for all my toile,</l>
      <l>But yet where wanth the finer flower, the coursest sorte doth ease: in like case thinges of litle power, the minde sometime may please,</l>
      <l>Accept therefore my Lassels trewe, these toyes in freindly part, from him that meanes: to thee nought els, but show of faithfull hart:</l>
      <l>Use them for change: as Musicke rude, for such is sure their grace, Or els as coursest Flower is vsde, when fine is out of place.</l>
