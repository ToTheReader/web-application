      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ouing and Christian Reader, I know that the great light and knowledge of this age hath bred itching eares, so that he who will giue foorth any thing in publick, must expect of his travels more carping and censuring, than profiting. The food which in the selfe is wholesome for the soule, being drawne from the pure Word of GOD, is not savorie meat to euery mans taste. They must haue strange sawces to waken their appetite and desire of reading. But let men wander in their conceits, as they please, this remaineth sure, that they who lay not the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Faith in divinity vpon the Scripture, build not vpon the Rock. They who presume to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand aboue that which is written, remember not the Apostles precept, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 13. And they who thinke the Scriptures too shallow to wade in, as not affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding sufficient matter for their wits to worke vpon, sinke in a sea of absurdities and errours. You shall not expect in these Sermons following the large handling of these great common places of divinity, mentioned in the Title, for that you know, would require a large volume. But a plaine opening of the text adhering therevnto without digression. Wherein I will desire you not so much to regard my rude and simple do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as my affection being willing to cast in my myte in
<pb facs="6"/>
the Church Treasure, the conscience of my doing, being to me a sufficient guard against all calumnies. Thus farre onely I am bold to say, that if you will take paines to reade, you shall finde all that is set downe heere, able to abide the touch-stone of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And if in any thing I haue erred and gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray (as who can pleade perfection) then I say with holy <hi>Dauid</hi> Psal. 141. 5. Let the righteous smite me, and it shallbee a kindnesse. Let him reproue me, and it shalbe an excellentoyle, which shall not breake my head. The Spirit of GOD leade you in all trueth. Farewell.</p>
