   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>IT hath euen so happend with not a few of the Malicious (what through lazie Ignorance, what through peeuish Ielousie) at their first sight or hearing of the name of this <hi>Historie of Tithes,</hi> as it was wont with those raw Nouices, that, vpon their first admission to the sacred Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Gentiles, troubled and frighted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with a world <note n="*" place="margin">

         </gap>.</note> of false apparitions while they thought of what they should see in the inmost Sanctuarie at the vnknown presence of their Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And doubtlesse, the Priest had not a litle work to perswade them that what they should there meet with, was not an vnluckie <hi>Empusa,</hi> not a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable <hi>Mormo,</hi> not a wanton <hi>Cobalus,</hi> not a mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous <hi>Furie,</hi> not indeed any thing that their idle brains, being such meer strangers to the abstrusest parts of Truth, had fashiond out. The many fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that Malice, Ignorance, and Iealousie haue framd to themselues touching this of Mine, haue been no lesse ridiculous; and some equally fearefull, but equally false. And I must here first play the Priest also, and so cleer, if it were possible, those Fancies, by protesting that it is not writen <hi>to proue that Tithes are not due by the Law of God</hi>; not writen to proue <hi>that the Laitie may detaine them,</hi> not to proue <hi>that Lay hands may still enioy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations</hi>; in summe, not at all <hi>against the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Clergie.</hi> Neither is it any thing else but it self, that is, a meer Narration, and the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="I" facs="4"/>
of Tithes.</hi> Nor is the law of God, whence Tithes are commonly deriud, more disputed of in it, then the Diuine Law, whence all Creatures haue their continuing subsistence, is inquired after in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi> historie of liuing Creatures, in <hi>Plinies</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall historie, or in <hi>Theophrastus</hi> his historie of Plants; or then the Iustice of the old Courts of <hi>Rome,</hi> is examind in <hi>Brodaeus</hi> his historie of them, or the conuenience of the Ciuill and Canon Laws in that of <hi>Riuallius.</hi> Nor was any thing, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Title, purposely omitted. Nor was any piece of it stolne from any other mans notes. That as the rest also hath been most maliciously imputed by some that so impudently dare conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture (though they be farre enough from being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—<hi>arte aut scientia Diuini</hi>) and as iudiciously censure it or me, as those in <hi>Lucian,</hi> could <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> that were weekly stark mad in Rime till Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by reason of what they had heard of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies in Summer, and could neither iudge at all of what they said nor yet possibly hold their peace. But they know there are neuer wanting long eares readie stretcht out to base detraction; and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimates them. I know not how otherwise to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm these protestations then by sending him, that beleeus me not here, to the view of the whole. He may be there further satisfied. and shall then see al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that it is not of the Pitch of the Doctrine of the Breuiarie, or within the compasse of Pocket-lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Nor will it, I think, looke like what were patcht vp out of <hi>Postils, Polyantheas,</hi> common
<pb n="II" facs="5"/>
place books or any of the rest of such excellent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments for the aduancement of Ignorance and Lazinesse. Nor is any end in it, to teach any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation by an imperfit patterne had from the mustie Reliques of former time. Neither is <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> related in it to shew barely what hath been (for the sterile part of <hi>Antiquitie</hi> which shews that only &amp; to no further purpose, I value euen as slightly as dull Ignorance doth the most precious and vsefull part of it) but to giue other light to the Practice &amp; doubts of the present. Light, that is cleer &amp; neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie. nor could such as haue searcht in the Subiect see at all often, for want of such Light. But <hi>illos non peto, piscem peto.</hi> Neither hath it at all wanted the most approuing censures of such as are of choicest Learning, ablest Iudgment, and truly <hi>Decumatissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi> aswell in worth as Title. Nor is it at all mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall what any one shall cast on it through his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure confidence only, in any of those old <note n="a" place="margin">

   <p>But wee leaue this preposterous Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Negatiues (yet by reason of the head-long importunitie of such as haue in great number al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie misconceiud it, they were necessarie and could not elswhere haue had so fit place) and shortly thus delineat what it is by the <hi>end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi>
      <pb n="III" facs="5"/>
of writing it; by the <hi>Argument</hi> of it; by the <hi>Course</hi> of composing it; and by the <hi>summe of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> in it in behalfe of the <hi>Clergie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For the first; we find that in the frequent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations about Tithes, not only Arguments out of holy Writ for proofe of a <hi>Diuine right</hi> to them, but matter also of <hi>Fact,</hi> that is, <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Storie,</hi> is very often vsed; as the <hi>kinds of paiment</hi> of them among the <hi>Ebrews,</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Maintenance of the Church</hi> in the Primitiue times, the <hi>Arbitrarie Consecrations, Appropriations</hi> and <hi>Infeodations</hi> of them in the midle times, the <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them at this day</hi> in the seuerall States of Christendom, together with the <hi>various Opinions</hi> and <hi>positiue Laws</hi> touching them. For, <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> as they are related only and fall vnder the Question of what and whence they were, are meerly of <hi>Fact.</hi> And proofs are hence often drawn to confirm sundrie occurrences in inquirie for the truth on either side. That of the <hi>Diuine right</hi> of them is so wholly a point of Diuinitie and handled so fully by diuers <hi>Schoolemen,</hi> so imperiously by most of the <hi>Canonists,</hi> and so confidently by some of our <hi>late Diuines,</hi> that what euer could be said touching that only, by inference out of the holy Text (which must be the sole triall of it) would but seem taken from some of them which haue so pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely disputed it. Neither were that so fit to be medled with by any as by a profest <hi>Diuine.</hi> But for that other part which falls vnder <hi>Historie,</hi> there is not one of them all which hauing boldnes enough
<pb n="IV" facs="6"/>
to aduenture on it (which he disputes withall of the <hi>diuine right</hi>) shews not also too much either Ignorance or Negligence in talking of it, being v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually deceiud and deceiuing in it those most of Readers that giue their Historicall faith captiue to bare Names and common reputation.

To argue therefore from affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Canons only to Practice, is equall in not a few things (and especially in this of Tithing) to the prouing of the Practice of a custom from some consonant Law of <hi>Plato's</hi> common wealth, of <hi>Lucians</hi> men in the Moon, or of <hi>Aristophanes</hi> his Citie of Cuckoes in the clouds. To supply therefore the want of a full and faithfull collection of the <hi>Historicall</hi> part, was the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>purpose</hi> why this was composd which might remaine as a furnisht Armorie for such as inquire about this Ecclesiastique Reuenue, and preferring Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what dulling custom hath too deeply rooted in them, are not vnwilling to change their old a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>korns for better meat.</p>
   <p>As touching the <hi>Argument</hi> of it; the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing XIV.

by the <hi>Iews</hi> vnder the Law. and this from <hi>Ebrew</hi> Lawiers. The <hi>third</hi> shews the Practice of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Graecians,</hi> and some other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or vowing them.

But he permits not that any mony or other profit, being not <hi>liuing gifts,</hi> as he calls them, is by the Law of God Titheable. so that where no such <hi>liuing gifts</hi> and increase are, there no Tithes (as Tithes) are paiable to them, as he concludes.

In very dedde they must haue leuyngs to kepe them out of necessite. and thereby it is to se how in</hi> London <hi>they cannot receyue ther leuyngs of Godd by no liuely gifts of grace, like as in the Countrey. But in</hi> London <hi>they must receiue their leuings of mens gifts; that is money which is euery mans own, for their office doing.

But who sees not enough now that what is called <hi>Tithes of houses</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> is rather calld so only then is at all so? yet because the name of Tithes in those Acts of Parlament, is giuen to the Ministers main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance there, it had been perhaps reputed negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to haue omitted the remembrance of them, in the <hi>course</hi> of composing it. The Testimonies were chosen by weight, not by number. taken on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thence whither the margin directs, neuer at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hand. Neither affected I to muster vp many petie and late names for proofe of what is had wholly by all from ancient Fountains. The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains only and what best cleered them, satisfied me. and I supposd euery iudicious Reader would be so best satisfied also. For in meer matter of elder storie, what credit can <hi>Nauclerus, Cario, Cuspinian,</hi> or the numerous rest of later time, adde to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of those Ancients yet extant, from whom they borrowed what euer they haue new drest of preceding ages? <hi>Petrus Comestor,</hi> or <hi>Ludolphus de Saxonia</hi> may aswell increase the credit of holy Writ, as those other may the truth of such Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as instructed them in common with the rest of posteritie. Neither at all wish I that this of mine should gain any strength of Truth from my Name alone, but from those autorities which I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed

and brought, both for Elder, Late and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent times, out of such both Printed and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script <hi>Annalls, Histories, Councels, Chartularies, Laws, Lawiers,</hi> &amp; <hi>Records</hi> only as were to be vsd in the most accurat way of search that might furnish for the subiect. yet also I haue not neglected the able iudgements of such of the learned of later time, as giue light to former ages. but I so preferd the choisest and most able, that I haue wholly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staind from any mention or vse here of those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ignorants that (while they write) rather instruct vs in their own wants of abilitie, then direct to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that may satisfie. If through ignorance I haue omitted any thing in the <hi>Historie</hi> or the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiew,</hi> that deserued place in them; who euer shall admonish me of it shall haue a most willing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his learning and courtesie▪ But all the bad Titles that are euer due to abuse of the holiest obtestation, be alwaies my companions, if I haue purposely omitted any good autoritie of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or late time, that I saw necessarie, or could think might giue further or other light to any Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition or part of it! For I sought only Truth; and was neuer so farre ingaged in this or aught els as to torture my brains or venture my credit to make or creat Premisses for a chosen Conclusion, that I rather would then could proue. My Premisses made what <hi>Conclusions</hi> or <hi>Coniectures</hi> I haue, and were not bred by them. And although Both of them here not a litle somtimes varie from what is vulgarly receiud; yet that happend not at all from

any desire to differ from common Opinion, but from another course of disquisition then is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vsed; that is, by Examination of the truth of those Suppositions which patient Idlenesse too easily takes for cleer &amp; granted. For the old Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques that neuer would professe that they had found a Truth, shewd yet the best way to search for any, when they doubted aswell of what those of the Dogmaticall sects too credulously receiud for infallible Principles, as they did of the newst Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions. they were indeed questionlesse too nice, and deceiud themselues with the nimblenesse of their own Sophismes that permitted no kind of established Truth. But plainly, he that auoids their disputing Leuitie, yet, being able, takes to himselfe their Libertie of Inquirie, is in the only way that in all kinds of studies leads and lies open euen to the Sanctuarie of Truth, while others, that are seruile to common Opinion and vulgar suppositions, can rarely hope to be admitted neerer then into the base court of her Temple which too speciously of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten counterfaits her inmost Sanctuarie. and to this purpose also is that of <note n="*" place="margin">

   <p>For the Summe of the <hi>Performance in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Clergie</hi>; I dare confidently affirme, that neuer before was there towards so much <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law positiue</hi> for the paiment of whole Tithes, obserued to publique view as is here dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered; and that especially in the VIII. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Clergie of <hi>England.</hi> And plainly he

that talks of Tithes without reference to such <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue Law,</hi> makes the obiect of his discourse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he would haue should be, then any thing that indeed is at all. For what State is in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom wherein Tithes are paid <hi>de facto,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then according to Human Law positiue? that is, as subiect to some Customes, to Statuts, to all ciuill disposition. If they bee in truth due <hi>Iure Diuino</hi> (which Diuines must determine of) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main equally so aswel after as before Human Laws made touching them. But that is a question dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly controuerted; and among the Clergie. Now, who euer disputes it and relyes only on <hi>Ius Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> or the holy Scripture for the right of Tithes, doth but make way for him whom hee cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade that they are due by the Law of God, to thinke that they are no way due. Which questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onlesse was the originall cause of the Opinions of such as falsly taught them not at all payable, but arbitrarily as Almes euen since Parochial right in them established.

Had they sufficiently thought of the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Practice of Christian States, whereby Tithes had been variously dedicated for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Euangelicall Priesthood, and setled for other holy vses either by continuance of time, by the owne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>s conueyance, or by any such other ciuill Title (the strength whereof is immediatly founded in human Law) what colour could they

haue had to thinke that they had been only Almes? for what euer is lawfully established by a ciuill Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, is cleerly <hi>debitum Iustitiae,</hi> not <hi>Charitatis.</hi> what brain then except one bewitcht can think that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man positiue Law and common Prac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>ce which v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually either declares or makes also a positiue Law, are not most carefully to be sought after in inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries touching this sacred Reuenue, which is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise enioyed in any State then as that Law hath ordaind and permits. And let <hi>Human Laws, Practice,</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> bee as their Autors will; yet whatsoeuer argument may be found in the law of God for the right of Tithes, remains still as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht and equally of his former power, as the heat and light of heauen euer did, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the vse of Fire had vpon earth. And the truth is that diuers of them that writ, with more will then iudgment, for Tithes, fall often from their <hi>Ius Diuinum,</hi> before they are aware, and talke of them as supposd due also by Human positiue Law of Practice. But they are farre enough from shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what or where that Law or Practice is. what doe they else when they confound Tithes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated lands together? and apply that to Tithes which is equally to bee spoken of lands giuen to the Church?
