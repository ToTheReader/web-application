   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen; as the Fencer first ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a flourish with his weapon,
before he commeth to stroakes, in
playing his prize: So I thought
good <hi>(pro forma</hi> onely) to vse these few lines
vnto you before you come to the pith of the
matter. What the Gentleman was that wrote
these Verses, I know not; and what she is for
whome they are deuised, I cannot ghesse: but
thus much I can say, that as they came into
the hands of a friend of mine by mere fortune;
so hapned I vpon them by as great a chaunce.
Onely in this I must confesse we are both too
blame, that whereas he hauing promised to
keep priuate the originall, and I the copie, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret:
we both haue cōsented to send it abroad,
as common: presuming chiefly vpon your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
curtesies; assuring our selues if we
may haue your protections, wee shall thinke
our selues as safe as <hi>Vlysses</hi> did, when hee was
shadowed vnder the shielde of <hi>Pallas</hi> against
<pb facs="4"/>
furious <hi>Aiax;</hi> so we by your coūtenances, shal
be sufficiently furnished to encounter against
any foule-mouthed Iackes whatsoeuer. To
censure of this worke, is for better wittes than
mine ovvne; and it is for Poets, not for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to giue iudgement of this matter: yet if I
may be bolde to reporte what I haue heard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gentlemen affirme; many haue written
worse, some better, few so well: the worke
being so ful of choice &amp; change, as it is thoght
it will rather delight euery way, than dislike
any way. Thus curteous Gentlemen, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vppon my woonted foundation of your
friendly acceptance, I rest your debtors, and
will studie in what I can daily to make you
amends.</p>

      <signed>Yours alwayes.</signed>
