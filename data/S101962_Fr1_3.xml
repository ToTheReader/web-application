      <pb n="5" facs="3"/>hath from my very childhood taken such deepe impression in my hart, that although to satisfye my curiositye, I haue trauailed ouer the greatest part of Europe, yet in my trauailes I had alwayes this end sett be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore myne eyes, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue wher euer I might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>earne, what course was best to be vndertaken for à man to secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>(as far as the insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of this mutable world will permitt) of à good and happy end. I saw frō the beginning ther was no better secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye could be had in this world of dying well, then to liue well: And for this reason cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that saying of S. Bernard. <hi>In Religione homo viuit purius</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In Religion a man liueth more
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>purely, falleth more rarely, riseth more speedily, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth more warily, recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the dew of gods grace more frequently, repofeth more securely, dyeth more confidently, is purged from his sinnes more quickly, and rewarded with glory more aboundantly;</hi> For this reason, I say, I could haue bene well content to haue imbraced à reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious course of life; but
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>I eyther found indeed the constitution of my body too weake, or at least the cowardeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my mynde made me flatter my selfe with that cōceipt, which diuerted my thoughts from so high an entreprise. Att the length cōming home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thorough France, by the prouidence of God, and the care of
<pb n="9" facs="5"/>my good Angel, as I presume, I mett with a friend who bestowed on me one of these little bookes, sett forth in the Frēch language; which, after I had well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsed, and pondered, gaue me such content, and ioy by cause it suted so well with my wishes, and presented me so plaine, and easye a way to what I principally
<pb n="10" facs="6"/>aymed att, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured my selfe to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the holy As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation or Confrater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitye, which is herein discribed. Afterwards comming into England and there discouering my treasure gotten in France, I was follici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by some of my fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends, whose requests were commaunds vnto me, to translate the sayd
<pb n="11" facs="6"/>booke into owre lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. I did so: and it began by little and little to grow into that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall liking of so many, that it seemed too to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious to transscribe so many copyes. For which reason I gaue my consent it should be printed, that so satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might be giuen to all. And loe here the booke: which if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
<pb n="12" facs="7"/>to the spirituall benefitt of your sowles, I beseech you lett me haue some part of your prayers; and that is all the recompence I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of you, either for my labour, or good will.</p>
