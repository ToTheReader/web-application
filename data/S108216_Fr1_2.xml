   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He meanes haue been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie manifolde in all ages (moste louing Reader) which Aucthorie by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hath established in the variable, yet orderlie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernments of States and people for the holdinge them in that most louyng and memberlike duetie which one part oweth vnto others, &amp; euerie of them to the conseruation of the whole bodie in best estate. Among which, this hath had his special place: that in the common and still continuing, commerce and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeable traffique, passing between man &amp; man, Countrie and Countrie, each hath beene limited to others reasonable liking, by a due obseruation of such assise in the matter of true weight and measure, as by generall consent hath been commended to perticuler practise. Now albeit, that reason it selfe may in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, seem a sufficient schoole mistresse to euerie man not degenerate. Yet when for the needfull vse of this equitie, the Aucthor both of reason and holie religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, shall commend and commaund it to be carefullie kept of all such as professe themselues to be his people (and that vnder the penaltie of most fearefull execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="3"/>
to the violaters of the same) how ought euerie Christian to bee carried with a conscience of duetie herein: vpon which no doubt, the most lawfull and wholsome constitutions of this my natiue country of England were first founded, &amp; stil do stand built. And therfore presenteth vnto euerie true natural and loyal subiect of the same (euen as he oweth obediēce to his most dread souereigne, not so much for feare as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake) a plaine path truly tending to this kinde of iustice, which many alwaies seeking to themselues, doth sildome practise towards others, for the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of whose common, though oftentimes most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true excuse herein (in alledging their ignorance of the lawes, to be the lack of their lawful obedience) I haue drawne togither such Acts, Statutes, and ordinances, as hauing been ordeined and vsed in sundry Kinges Reignes, and now allowed by the Honourable in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: most apt and proper for the warranting of all lawfull Assise both in weight and measure, which are to be vsed at this day, and within this Realme: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such as concerne the Bakers, Brewers, and Inhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders directions. The not obseruing whereof vpon so manifest &amp; plain a publishing, what shal it els but note vnto vs the men of worst marke, whether we respect their conscience towards God, or their verteous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation in a Christian common wealth. And if all lawes established by lawfull authoritie (not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the lawes of God) are to be imbraced by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian subiects in a conscionable obedience: by what excuse then do they thinke to winde out from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert of such disobedience as directly contrarieth both Gods and mans lawes at once: of which nature these
<pb facs="3"/>
are, that command the true obseruation of weight and measure betweene man and man. In the booke of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticus thus we read. <hi>You shall not doo vniustly,</hi>

      <hi>in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in line, weight or measure, you shall haue iust Ballances &amp; true Weights.</hi> In the book of Deu. thus. <hi>Thou shalt not haue in thy bag two maner of weights a great and a small,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Deut. 25. v. 18.</note>
      <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shalt thou haue in thy house diuers measures a great and a small but thou shalt haue a right and a iust weight, a perfect and a iust measure shalt thou haue.</hi> Again in the Prouerbs, <hi>False Ballaunces are an abhomination vnto the Lord,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Pro.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</note>
      <hi>but a p rfect weight pleaseth him.</hi> Also in the first Epistle to the Thessalonians, thus it is written:<note place="margin">1. Thes. 4. v. 6.</note>
      <hi>Let no man defraud his brother in any thing</hi> (as euerie one doeth that vseth false weight or measure,) <hi>for the Lord is a reuenger of such things.</hi> By all which places &amp; many others that might be cited out of sacred scriptures, it appeareth how spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this vprightnes in the vse of weight and measure hath euer bin enioyned by God himselfe, for a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall practise among his people. And therefore most shamelesse are they before men, and no lesse desperate in dispising the reuenging hand of God: who (besides the penalties prouided by ciuil authoritie for the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them in awe) dare goe on in so manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his so fearfull threats. Leauing therfore these dispisers, to the disposing hand of the Almighty, either in mercy to amend them, or in iustice to condemne them. I commend this litle Pamphlet (shrowded vnder Gods and my Countries lawes, to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and regarding of the common) yet more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable sort of subiects in the same. As vnto whose vsuall trades (standing for the most part vpon weight and measure,) the practise therof most properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth,
<pb facs="4"/>
and for whose sakes I haue satisfied my well meaning, in deliuering them the truth rather homely then handsomely. Like as their following the same, ought to be in a plaine true dealing, and not in a craftie subtill deceiuing, which being the fruit that I hope will ensue my poore paines taking herein (as a well pleasing taste both to God and man) I will onlie content my selfe with expectation of such rewarde, committing thee (good Reader) to the conduct of that spirite that is only able and alwaies readie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thee for euerie good duetie, and to performe the same in thee, according to thy proper place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
