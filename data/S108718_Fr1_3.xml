   </head>
   <argument>
      <p>THis Epistle ensuing was written by my deare frind M. <hi>Lawrence Whitaker</hi> to a learned neighbour of mine in the towne of Euill, one M. <hi>Iohn Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> a reuerend Preacher, as his censure or Elogie of my Booke, to the end the sayd M. <hi>Seward</hi> might include it in a letter that he wrote to one Doctor <hi>Mocket,</hi> Chaplaine to the Bishop of London that then was, for obtaining his approbation that my Booke might bee printed. Therefore seeing it is a witty and elegant Epistle, I haue thought good to insert it in this place, and to prefixe it immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before my Booke, though the Author thereof bee disposed in some places to be merry with me.</p>
   </argument>

      <salute>SIR,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>I Haue with some difficulty at length traced ouer the high Alpes of this loftie Work of that worthy Orator, Traueller, and Historiographer, M. <hi>Thomas Coryat:</hi> In which long iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney though I haue met with many a rough and rockie passage, yet I haue beene so eased


<pb facs="3"/>
with the delight of many smooth and leuell allies of his owne pleasant inuention, that they haue been to mee in stead of an Alpine chaire to carry mee at case ouer the difficult and inuious precipices. Shall I commend the worke vnto you? Shall I vse any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to presse, and to proue the fitnesse of it for the Presse? No, in stead of good iuyce to giue it a sweete relish, I should presse out tarte ver-iuyce to giue it a distast, and a suspicion of defect, as if it had crackes and flawes in it, that needed to be playstered vp with the mortar of commendation. All I will say of it, shal be this: it is a garment of many colours so curiously and gracefully intermixed; It is a garden of faire flowers, so pleasantly planted and ordered; it is a ship of rare out-landish commodities, that hath landing, yea and ballasse of such worth and price, that no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace can it bee to it, though in this garment were found some rent, in this garden some weeds, in this ship some trash. I will say of the Author no worse then <hi>Horace</hi> saith of <hi>Homer,</hi>
      <q>
         <l>— Sic veris falsa remiseet,</l>
         <l>Primo ne medium, medio ne discrepet imum.</l>

What said I? <hi>Veris falsa?</hi> Nay more, <hi>sacra profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, lascina modestis, ludicra serijs:</hi> Nay, I will say with <hi>Ouid,</hi> that there bee in it,

symmetry in the mixture of his potions and electuaries; no Cooke in the decent composition of his sallets or stewed brothes. Nay both symmetry and mixture is heere such, that though I said I would not commend the worke; yet I cannot hold, but for the one and the other, I must say as <hi>Horace</hi> saith, hee is.

   <p>How strongly hath hee fortified his booke with many a fortresse and Citadel? How loftily hath hee adorned it with many a high tower and steeple? Nay, how richly and pompously hath hee set out all the Countries he hath passed through (beeing, as his title speaketh, in number seuen, equall with the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the world, the Wise men of Greece, and the mouthes of the monster-breeding Nile) hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to euery one of them, a hundred and odde Pages to attend them; nay for euery mile almost seuen lines to describe it, as by his exact Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke hee can make it appeare to you? To conclude, if the Pearle of the Netherlands <hi>Lipsius</hi> were liuing, I know hee would not thinke me too bold, if I gaue of these <hi>Monita &amp; exempla Hodaporetica,</hi> the same censure, that the <hi>Regius &amp; Apostolicus Censor</hi> doth
