   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER, THE PUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISHER HERE OF wisheth, Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, Thou hast here offered unto thee (a rare boxe of precious pearles) on most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, many sweet, grave, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, wholesome, fit, and choise passages. What the Author was, what his care for Gods glory, his delight in Gods worship, his desire of the good of others, his hatred of
<pb facs="7"/>
sinne, his griefe for sinne, his zeale and fervencie in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, his knowledge of the word, his contempt of the world, his experience of Satans subtil. ties, his compassion towards the afflicted members of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, his skill in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting, dehorting, repro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving, comforting; his joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse in the society and company of Gods children, his usuall endeavours and employments, his daily me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, his ordinary spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, his grouth in grace, and measure of sanctification, &amp;c. may be easily perceived, and plainly discerned by this his ensuing Treatise. Well knew he the worth of time, well knew he in like manner how to employ the same to his best advantage. Apparent it
<pb facs="7"/>
is, that he thought that time to be ill spent, wherein he was not doing some good to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe or others, and therefore endeavoured alwayes to bee thus employed. Was he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone? then was he either oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in prayer, reading, meditation, or such like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian exercise. Was he in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? then were not his words idle, vaine, worldly, unprofitable, but gracious, poudered with salt, tending to edification. Was he at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or supper? then would he take occasion to speake of the use of Gods creatures, the thankfulnesse we owe unto God for the plenty we enjoy, together with the usuall abuse of Gods mercies by most men and women. Was there a question propounded unto
<pb facs="8"/>
him? in the resolution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would he take occasion to dehort from some one or other vice, exhort to some one or other vertue. Did he observe in himselfe any thing defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive? how did he labour for humiliation; for a supply? Did he observe sinnes in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which were not in himselfe? how did he pitty and pray for them, blesse God for himselfe, yea be hereby perswaded that the Lord lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, as through whose goodnesse he was made see and hate such things as are so highly esteemed in the world, and pursued by men of this world, whence he became de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous <note place="margin">
         <hi>This Book (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of M.</hi> Culver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel's <hi>owne hand wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) doe I finde to have beene begun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 40. years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, and to have beene written at severall times, and upon seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, some passages, being night-me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, some ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at dinner or supper, some upon occasion of a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, as others upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of some one or other trouble. &amp;c.</hi>
      </note> the more to love the Lord with all his heart, and to be so delighted in him, that he might esteeme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="8"/>
without him, nor bee carryed away by any thing from him, in whose favour is all fulnesse of joy for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. A faithfull Steward he was of the mysteries of God, and who well knew, how to divide the word aright, and give every man his due portion. Thus much no doubt and much more might be said by any of those which entirely knew him, my selfe having at no time otherwise seene him than in his workes, <hi>this</hi> especially, warranting all that I have affirmed of him. Whatsoever thou art, whatsoever thy condition, thou maiest here have suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter which concerneth thy good. Here may parents learne their duty, children theirs. Here may Pastors
<pb facs="9"/>
learne their duty; people, theirs. Here may all learne, both young and old, rich and poore. This will informe thy judgement, this in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner stirre up thy affections. Thou then who wouldst learn to performe thy duty towards God, thy duty towards thy neighbour: Thou who would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est learne at all times to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy thy time well: Thou who wouldest know with whom thou shouldst converse, and what use to make of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, &amp;c. come here, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy thy hearts desire: What is here offered thee, despise not, but blesse God for the same, accordingly making use thereof to his glory and thine owne good. Farewell.</p>
