   <head>A Preface to the true <hi>Christian Reader.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why this first Treatise beareth the name and title of the <hi>Footepath to Felicitie:</hi> although some, more captious than cunning, pretending notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a singular secrete knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and iudgement, condemne manie Bookes by their outward face, being nothing seene in the bowels of the same, and vtterlie ignorant to what issue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiance of the matter is like to growe. But to leaue them in their owne follie, albeit they would be counted wise, and to touch the name of this present discourse, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The Footepath to Felicitie,</hi> I thinke
<pb facs="6"/>
it not vnnecessarie.</p>
   <p>The present treatise, whereof this, for fault of a better, may be the Preface, is named <hi>The Footepath to Felicitie,</hi> and not without speciall reason. For, to growe in fauour with Princes, Potentates, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of prouinces, we see there is a waie, after the which diligent inquisition and search must be made, and being found, it must be walked in with sinceritie and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes of mind. Some by this gift, some by that ornament, either of minde or bodie, become gratious and acceptable in the eies of their Lords and maisters: in which waie whiles they keepe their feete with integritie and simplenes, they are so much the more fauoured, by how much their good gifts are well and rightlie vsed: and in this grace and liking of their betters they are sure to continue, so long as they make vertue the foundation of their seruice.</p>
   <p>To drawe to our purpose, God is
<pb facs="6"/>
omnipotent, all Princes are impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: he immortall, they mortall: he aboue, they belowe: he Creator, they creatures: finallie, he a cleare fountaine of all goodnes, they fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie puddles of wickednes: is it our wish, is it our will, is it our intent, affection, and desire to please him, and to direct our liues after his good pleasure? then must we know, then must we learne, then must we envre our selues to tread in the Footepath of Faith, which condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth such as walke in it to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall felicitie, and therefore deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedlie hath this denomination or name, to be called <hi>The Footepath to Felicitie.</hi> Now touching Faith, it is such a generall inclusiue, as that it admitteth the exception of no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, either morall or intellectuall, wherewith whosoeuer are indued, they haue furniture enough to enable them to serue both God and man. By this our forefathers grewe famous, this they possessed in full measure and weight, and
<pb facs="7"/>
therewith a supplie of all other good giftes: for Faith hath her traine, she hath her retinue, she commeth not without a companie of confederates.</p>
   <p>To passe this ouer, because it is a point, wherein none (as I thinke) is to seeke: it is to be vnderstood, that this footepath to felicitie consisteth in sundrie particularities, which though they be manie, yet may they be reduced vnto two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall heads, the first concerning God, the second touching man. But cutting off all diuisions &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuisions, for the auoiding of tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, abruptlie concluding this Preface, I submit the title and the matter of the treatise ensuing, to the censure of the wise and discreet Reader, vnto whose iudgement, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter due obseruation of the whole inuention and conueiance, as vnto a sufficient referen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie, I appeale: and now to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
