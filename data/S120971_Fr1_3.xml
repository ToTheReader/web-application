      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His tempest (good Reader) having blowne
downe so many poore Parsons houses, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
their Churches, and overthrowne
their Pulpits, hath wakened mee to behold
the harmes and to consider the danger, least
staying vnder the roofe of a tottering buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
I might, perhaps, bee suddenly overwhelmed with the
ruines. Herevpon I betoke me to examine the foundations
vpon which this house so sore beaten doth stand: I found the
groundworkes good and sure, even Christ and his Apostles
with all the sacred word of God. The walles I perceyved well
strengthened with buttresses of the fayrest and firmest stone,
that the Temple hath bene repayred within these laste times.
I grew secure that howsoever the tiles did fly about our eares,
yet the walles and the substance would abide: Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
I looked about me still for more props, no store being su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
in such extreeme perill, and, by Gods good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
I light vpon this worthy Treatise, very learnedly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and with great judgement, whereby I receyved comfort
and confirmation a fresh. In it I beheld how the vehemencie
of the storme forced things cleane contrary to the current of
our owne lawes; And from hence I conceyved this tempest
would be blown over anon. For can his sacred Maiestie, when
he shall throughly vnderstand how his statutes are abused, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his most loyall subjects to groane any longer vnder such
<pb facs="9"/>
heavy oppression? It cannot bee, but together with his high
Court of Parliament, he will at laste take order that the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of none shalbe of greater force, then his regale decrees.
I have thought good to imparte vnto thee this treasure, that
thereby thou maist learne what the Lawes of the Lande re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
in this case, and maist labour by prayer and by what
dutifull and lawfull meanes thou canst to obteyne remedie.</p>
