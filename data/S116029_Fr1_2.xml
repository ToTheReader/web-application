   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the vsual maner of the most which publish bookes, to dedicate the same to some honorable personage, or to some one of speciall place, partly to shew thankefulnesse for some receiued fauors, partly to procure credite and countenance to their writings, that vnder so good protection, they may the more boldly passe forth to the common view of all men. If I now varie from this generall recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued course, think not I pray thee (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that I do it in some humour, as if I either affected singularitie, or misliked the common custome: but know for a truth that there are these two causes of my so doing: The first is, the obscuritie of mine owne condition, who liuing here in a remote part, haue wanted either wil, or oportunitie, or both, to s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rowd my selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the patronage of some great person: The second is, the nature of this present Treatise:
<pb facs="3"/>
for howsoeuer there be (and that not farre frō the place of mine abode) some of good qualitie, vpon whose acceptance, I thinke, I might haue presumed, yet considering, that this which I haue framed, is but a homely and course dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, meant onely for men of the plainest fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, I thought I should breake the rules of comelinesse and correspondence, if I should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance the inscription of my labour (if I may dare so to call it) to a person of higher degree, then that meane and middle ranke, to the vse whereof, all that these following leaues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, was alone intended. Therefore (friendly Reader) whosoeuer thou be, if thou be a true Nathanael,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.17. Luke. 8.15.</note> a man of <hi>an honest and good heart,</hi> be thy outward condition as it may be, though thou <hi>lye among the pots,</hi>

Psal. 107.10.</note> euen as it were <hi>bound in outward mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> and of base esteeme in the eyes of men, yet thou art he whose patronage I affect, and in the hope of whose good allowance I take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. I know well that he which offereth any thing to the sight of the world, must make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die his backe for the <hi>long furrowes</hi> of euerie byting cēsurer.<note place="margin">Psal. 129.3. <gap reason="foreign">

conscience shall giue this testimonie of mine endeuours, that thy heart is comforted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, in regard that thy iudgement is strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in so necessary a point, then let the most professed and sharpe-toothed carper say what he please:<note place="margin">Iob 31.35, 36.</note> nay though (as <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh) <hi>he should write a booke against me, yet I would take it vpon my shoulder, and bind it as a crowne vnto me.</hi>

Cor. 4.2.</note> if I shall <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue my selfe to thy conscience in the sight of God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If thou now demaund of me,<note place="margin">The summe of the Treatise.</note> what it is which I do here offer vnto thee, know this briefly: It is a Treatise tending to the discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the worth and excellencie of the word preached; teaching thee also, which art a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall hearer, how thou maist by hearing <hi>edifie</hi> thy selfe in thy <hi>most holy faith;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iude 20.</note> as well by <hi>establishing thy heart</hi> in the soundnesse of truth,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.9.</note> that so thou maist not <hi>be caried about with diuers and strange doctrines;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom 6.17.</note> as by framing thy selfe <hi>to obey from the hart vnto the forme of doctrine,</hi> whereunto thou either art or shalt be deliuered. This is the summe.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <note place="margin">The causes of writing it.</note>If thou demaund againe, what hath moued me to attempt this? I answer in as few words. There are two questions common in the mouthes of many, either ignorant, or il-dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed persons, by which the beautie of Preaching is and hath bene much defaced in the eyes of many not so well setled: the one is, <hi>What need all this preaching?</hi> the other is, <hi>Who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whom to beleeue among these Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers?</hi> These two demaunds were first hatched in hell, but since being cherished by Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisticall and Popish spirits,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.16.</note> and by them buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into the heads of <hi>vnlearned, vnstable,</hi> and irreligious people, they are brought vnto a diuellish perfection. Somewhat I can say out of mine owne experience, that through a conceit that these two questions (as they are pressed by some <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ly workemen) are vnanswerable, our Ministery is drawne into contempt, and the calling of a Preacher is deemed of al other professions the most superfluous, and such as may wel be spared without any preiudice to the wel-being of Gods Church. The giuing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to these hellish interrogatories, as it hath many times exercised me in the execution of my publike ministery, so it hath at this time drawne me to the compiling of this present Treatise: both that those of these parts, who to
<pb facs="4"/>
my knowledge haue need, and do desire it also, may haue something by them, whereupon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly to deliberate for the setling of their iudgments, and that others likewise elsewhere, who (it may be) haue experience of the like Satanicall encounters, may (in stead of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter help) enioy the benefite of this that I haue laboured in. This is the maine occasion, this is my chiefe intent in this Tractate: wherin, as I haue freely vttered that which I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is the truth, so will I be ready also either to alter or better my iudgement,<note place="margin">

And though perhaps many know in this matter as much as I or any man can tell them, yet I am sure many are ignorant, and therefore I may well maintaine my course with that saying of <hi>Augustine,</hi>

      <hi>It is better to giue him that hath, then to turne him away which hath not.</hi> It is meeter that they which know should be wearied with many repetitions, then those which are vnskilful sent away empire for want of instruction. As for writers in our times, directly of this subiect I know none. If there be none, I wish there may be; for as the saying is,

         </gap>.</note> and by the more this truth is auouched, the better it is confirmed. If there be that haue laboured in this very kind wherein I now do, yet it can be no preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to my endeuour. The auncient prouerb is, that <hi>One bark cannot beare all passengers;</hi>
      <note place="margin">

      </note> many bookes should be made by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry men in a differing stile, though not with a differing faith.

As there is a difference of stomacks, so of humors and dispositions in men. The same matter diuersly handled, may find entertainement with diuers men; which yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested after one onely fashion, would haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance but with a few.</p>

these I may well complaine. Houshold affaires, and the stirres occasioned by those businesses, cannot but breed distraction: and he which is exercised with the care of a congregation, shall meet with very seldome intermission. I intreat thee therefore, when thou shalt find me to faile in any thing (from which I account not my selfe priuiledged) impute it to this forenamed want; and hope thus of me, that if I had had more freedome and more time, all things should haue bene brought to better perfection.</p>
   <p>I haue troden in an old beaten path, both by old and new writers, by Diuines and Heathen, namely, to frame my matter to the forme of a Dialogue, a very good way (in my seeming) to help the vnderstanding of common men: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it to haue haue eased me much in writing, I doubt not but it shall turne to thy benefite in reading also.
