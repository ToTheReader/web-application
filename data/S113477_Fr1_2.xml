   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough it was my fortune first of all to set a new edge on this businesse; yet my iourneyes to this Fountaine haue not been made without your good companies and association, nor the seuerall tryals had there, and at home, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without your worthy helpes and assistance: nor this little Treatise begun without your instigations and incitements. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I find none so fit and meet to patronize it, as your selues; being able out of your owne knowledge and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation to defend it against all malicious detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To extoll it aboue the <hi>Germaine Spaw,</hi> may be thought in me either indiscretion, or too much partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but why I may not parallele them (being in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and qualities so agreeable) nor I, nor you (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) know any inducing, much lesse perswading ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Wherefore being thus confident, I thought
<pb facs="3"/>
it no part of our duties, either to God, our King, or Country, to conceale so great a benefit, as may thereby arise and accrue not onely vnto this whole Kingdome and his Maiesties louing subiects, but also in time (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter further notice taken of it) to other foraigne nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and countries, who may perhaps with more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, lesse hazard and danger of their liues, spoiling and robbing, better partake of this our <hi>English Spaw</hi> Fountaine, then of those in <hi>Germanie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It were to be wished, that those two famous Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Hunton</hi> and D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Bright</hi> had beene yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, to haue giuen testimony of the great good hopes and expectation they conceiued of it. The former of which did oftentimes request me to publish it to the world: and the other was resolued (in case hee had longer liued) to haue done it himselfe. So carefull were they both to promote their countries good, and <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>udious to procure the health of their Countrimen.</p>
   <p>I am as briefe and plaine, as possibly I may, to the end the Reader may not be wearied, nor the patient deluded; and if for these causes I may seeme to bee censured, yet I am well assured, that to your selues bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity and perspicuity cannot, but bee acceptable. So wishing you all happinesse, I shall euer rest and remaine</p>
