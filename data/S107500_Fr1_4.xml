   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>CHristian reader: I am now to salute thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding with a few lines of exhortation: be thou as willing to embrace them, as they are ready to profit thee: if vnderstāding be thy tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and conscience thy lesson. And here I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire but two things of thee, first to reade with diligence, then to marke with iudgement: for thou canst haue no sicknes, but here is physicke: no sore, but here is a plaister for it. It is like <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder, one end standing on the earth, the other reaching vp to heauen; It begins at faith and repentance, leading thee along in the path of obedience, and so at the length brings thee to glory. I would not that any should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect against the author, and so vse the child the worse for the fathers sakc: but rather consider that the child may be good, though the father be euill. I will make no apologie in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of it: for it is able to speake in the defence of it selfe. And now I must make an apologie for my selfe, why I haue sent this booke forth into the world; one cause is, in regard I was wronged by euill tongues after I had preached the same; wherefore I now send it foorth to make answere for mee. A second cause why I send it foorth, is this: because the matter therein being of great vse; (and a Sermon is but nine dayes wonder,) would not haue the funerall so soone, therefore I thought good to intreate that fauour of the higher powers to put it in print. And now let me intreate thy affections to embrace it, and thy diligence to practise it. Thus I leaue these fewe lines to thy selfe to be obeyed, and thy selfe to the Lord to be glorified.</p>
