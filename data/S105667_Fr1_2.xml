   <p>THe G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

consecrate to their seuerall
Gods, seueral trees: as, to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo
the Laurell, because he
was alwaies fresh in countenance:
The Oake to Iupiter, as being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
strong: the Oliue to Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,
as being alwaies fruitful of som
gallant inuentions: the Firre tree
to Neptune, as President of ships,
alwaies swimming, and neuer sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
the tree called Aesculus to
the three sonnes of Saturn, because
the roote is in the bottome of the
earth, the trūck in the water, &amp; the
top in the cloudes. It behoueth me
<pb facs="3"/>
(likewise) somwhat to the imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them, to yeelde a reason why
I consecrate to your worship this
Pamphlet, not as a massy Tree, but
as a slender fruit of a rooted good
will, though of a short trauaile: in
it, I haue giuen pleasure an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe,
being not able for weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to mannage in the fielde, and
not willing for wantonnesse, to
giue carefull care to the bloodye
notes of the trumpet: and because
it is vnpossible that you should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
the face of one that flyeth
from you, therefore I am constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but not much against my wil,
to present to your worshippe, the
view of pleasures back, vpō which
you may see ingrauen the picture
of hell, howsoeuer her visage doe
represent the face of the firmamēt:
but because you haue expressed
more in a godly life, then I haue
shadowed in a fewe godly lines, &amp;
<pb facs="3"/>
because your zealous conuersatiō
is the image which my thoughtes
haue in this discourse imagined:
therefore, I iudged it most conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to submit this book to your
fauourable construction, not as a
monument of my victorie, but as
a memoriall of your singular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie:
nor as a sufficient counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pain
of your good behauiour, but
as a short abridgement of your am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ues: the friendlie counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nāce
wherwith you haue alwaies
cheared my drooping fancies, was
the loadstarre that drew me on, to
saile so far in this boysterous Sea:
where, if the windes doe threaten
me aboue, and the water belowe,
yet as long as the starre shineth, the
sterne shall not faile. Leander lost
his ankerholde for lacke of light,
and the Tunnies dare not swim
but when the moone doeth shine:
the light that I craue is your fauor,
<pb facs="4"/>
the extinguishing that I am afraide
of, is mine own feare: wherefore,
changing feare with hope, I chāge
wordes with silence: beseeching
God that your vertue may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with your life, and your life
counterpaized with your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Yours to the vttermost of his
power.
