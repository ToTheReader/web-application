   <p>Ignorance, Wealth, and Ease may hold sleight of the argument, but that Wisdome and Experience which hath runne through the test of Affliction, will say it is worthy and necessary: for it will feed the hungry, cloath the naked, and giue soft rest to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; it will appease Mutenies, breede Loue, and make men able euery way to doe and suffer.</p>
