And that the rather, because the same with diuers other things of chiefest importance are liuely drawen in coulours at your no smale charges by the skilfull painter <hi>Iames Morgues,</hi> yet liuing in the Blacke-fryers in London (whom<note place="margin">The chiefe things worthie obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Florida are drawne in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours by la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>Monsieur Chastillon</hi> then admirall of France sent thither with <hi>Laudonniere</hi> for that purpose) which was an eye-witnesse of the goodnes &amp; fertilitie of those regions, &amp; hath put downe in writing many singularities which are not mentioned in this treatise: which he meaneth to publish together with the purtraitures before it be long, if it may stand with your good pleasure &amp; liking. These foure voiages I knew not to whom I might better offer thē to your selfe, &amp; that for diuers iust considerations. First, for that as I haue said before, they were dedicated vnto you in french: secondly because now foure times also you haue attempted the like vpon the selfe same cost neere adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: thirdly in that you haue persed as farre vp into the maine &amp; discouered no lesse secretes in the parts of your aboad, then the french did in the places of their inhabiting: lastly considering you are now also readie (vpon the late returne of Captayne <hi>Stafforde</hi> and good newes which hee brought you of the safe arriuall of your last colonie in their wished hauen) to prosecute this action more throughly then euer. And here to speake somewhat of this your enterprise, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that if the same may speedily and effectually be pursued, it will prooue farre more beneficiall in diuers respects vnto this our relme, then the worlde, yea manie of the wiser sort, haue hitherto ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined: The particuler commodities whereof are well knowen vnto<note place="margin">A collection of the commodities of Virginea.</note> your selfe and some fewe others, and are faithfully and with great iudgement committed to writing, as you are not ignorant, by one of your followers, which remayned there a full tweluemonth with your worshipfully lieutenant <hi>M.

Touching the speedie and effectuall pursuing of your action, though I wote well it woulde demanude a a princes purse to haue it throughly followed without lingring, yet am I of opinion, that you shall drawe the same before it bee long to be profitable and gamefull aswell to those of our nation there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

And this I find to haue bene the course that both the Spaniards and Portugals tooke in the beginnings of their discoueries and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questes. For the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>niards at their first entrance into <hi>Hispaniola</hi> found neither suger-canes nor ginger growing there, nor any kind of our cattel: But finding the place fit for pasture they sent kine &amp; buls &amp; sundry sorts of other profitable bestes thither, &amp; transported the plants of suger-canes, &amp; set the roots of ginger: the hides of which oxen, with suger &amp; ginger are now the chiefe marchandise of that Iland. The Portugals also at their first footing in <hi>Madera,</hi> as <hi>Iohn Barros</hi> writes in his first Decade, found nothing there but mightie woodes for timber, whereupon they called the Ilande by that name. Howbeit the climate being fauourable, they inriched it by their own industrie with the best wines and sugers of the world. The like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding they vsed in the Isles of the <hi>Assores</hi> by sowing therin great quantitie of Woad. So delt they in <hi>S.

And if our men will follow their steps, by your wise direction I doubt not but in due time they shall reape no lesse commoditie and benefit. Moreouer there is none other likelihoode but that her Maiestie, which hath Christned and giuen the name to your <hi>Virginea,</hi> if neede require, will deale after the maner of honorable godmothers, which, seeing their gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sops not fully able to bring vp their children themselues, are wont to contribute to their honest education, the rather if they finde any towardlines or reasonable hope of goodnes in them.
