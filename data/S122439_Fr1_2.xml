      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough TIME and DEATH from our Cradles to our Graues pursue vs swiftly, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Almighties Ordinance, ouertake and seaze vpon our fraile and Terrestriall parts, vpon some sooner, vpon others later: Yet <hi>Excellent Acts</hi> like strong <hi>Eagles</hi> breake from their seazure, and
<pb facs="3"/> soare aboue them in so sublime a pitch as neither <hi>Time</hi> with all his Power and rusty Powder, with which hee blots and rubs out <hi>Brasse</hi> and <hi>Marble,</hi> can quite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure or extinguish them, neither <hi>Death</hi> close in his darke-gaping Mouth (the <hi>Graue)</hi> their Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Witnesse this small yet Auncient <hi>History,</hi> which this last <hi>Summer</hi> I made part of my Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, to put into an <hi>English</hi> Habite.</p>
   <p>That the Story is Auncient, I may well say; for it is 1900. yeeres since <hi>Aristeus</hi> Writ it to his Brother <hi>Philocrates,</hi> which <hi>Aristeus</hi> St. <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Pentatucke</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi>
      <note place="margin">Great Esquire.</note> sayes, was <hi>Hyperaspistes</hi> to <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus Philadelphus;</hi> King of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Syria, Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="3"/> his Conquests (the World) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</p>
   <p>This <hi>Ptolomeus Philadelphus</hi> then a most accomplish'd young Gentleman, vertuously disposed, and so great a louer of <hi>Learning,</hi> as hee had accumulated into his Library according to some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, 1800000. Volumes, Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Argument of the HISTORY.</note> not then risen in our <hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheare,</hi> was by the sayd <hi>Aristeus</hi> a most Noble Person, and a great friend of (the then) captiued <hi>Iewes</hi> (as an Instrument of God) for the liberty and freedome of them, (then his people) practised with <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius Phalerius</hi> to tell the King that his so aboundant Library was but poore, because it wanted the Booke of Bookes, the sacred Volume of GOD, which we call the <hi>Holy Bible:</hi> The King vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously couetous thereof, demanded how hee should best acquire it?
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Aristeus</hi> wayting this desiered oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, proportioned his aduice, that he should first set all the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued <hi>Iewes,</hi> not onely in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but also in <hi>Syria,</hi> &amp;c. at free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: send Ambassadours and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to <hi>Eleazer</hi> their High Priest and Pontiffe. The King willingly accordes thereto, as to the Musick of his desires, and prepares most rich presents, as a Table of Massie Gold, embellish't with Precious Stones, Cups of Gold and Siluer likewise adorned: sets at free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the Captiued by publicke Edict, Embasies, (with these gifts and diuers Talents of Gold and Siluer) <hi>Aristeus</hi> and <hi>Andrea,</hi> Prince and great Captaine of the Guard of his Person.</p>
   <p>They goe, deliuer his Letters of Request and Commends, haue gracious entertainment, returne with the 72. Interpreters <hi>Iewes</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/> Letters, and also <hi>Eleazers</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to the King, and in especiall with the Sacred Volume and Word of God.</p>
   <p>The good King adores the Bookes, feasts the Bringers, who after fall to the Businesse, and Translated it out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Greeke,</hi> the common lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Language of those Times, made famous by the Sword of <hi>Alexander.</hi> And this in briefe is the effect of this <hi>Venerable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> which is by mee thus made yours.</p>
   <p>And though I seeme to Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate thus to you, yet it is as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for in it selfe as you may further see, it is Elabourately and Eloquently Written by the sayd <hi>Aristeus;</hi> and let no man wonder too much thereat, as thinking our Times excels theirs in Eloquence: no; For who euer exceeded <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mostenes</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/> the <hi>Greeke,</hi> or <hi>Cicero</hi> the <hi>Latine</hi> therein?</p>
   <p>Lastly, to speake the Praise of <hi>History. Libri sunt vasa memoriae,</hi> and worthy Historicall Bookes haue in them a kinde of <hi>Diuine Permanency,</hi> and as Eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons should affect Noble actions: so ought they to cherish the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters, as their Honourers.</p>
   <p>For hath not <hi>Plutarcke</hi> made those Gyant <hi>Heroes,</hi> as <hi>Theseus, Romulus, Alexander, Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> and the rest, yet liue? and himselfe more praysefully longer then them all? So as an ignorant swaggering Fellow threatned his Aduersary to kill him if he had as many liues as <hi>Plutarcke:</hi> Did not <hi>Alexander</hi> sigh for an other <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Lastly, (if I haue in honour of the <hi>History)</hi> like one holding a lighted Taper to the cleare noone-shining
<pb facs="5"/> Sunne, made an <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,</hi> shewing the <hi>Antiquitie</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> of the Bookes by the said SEPTVAGINT Translated; and the <hi>Excellency</hi> of their inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Writer, <hi>Moses;</hi> and haue therein beene too prolixious, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don mee, because of the Profoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and Worthinesse of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: So I referre you to that, and the rest; and so rest</p>
