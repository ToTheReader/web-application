      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, this Worke, so long since promised, and now (after much Paine, Cost, and deare Expence of time) in part perfected, comes in al Humility to kisse your Hand: making no doubt of as kind acceptance, as it tenders it selfe in free and vnfaigned affection. It is not vnknowne vnto me, that those seuerall Natiue tongues, wherein all those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do speake themselues, are much more familiar and readie to you, then they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue in English any Ornament by mee. Neuerthelesse, I hope it shall not anie way be distastfull to you, that others may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited by the meanes of your Happinesse: and that which is thus effected for your sake, may (from a perticuler good) extend it selfe to a generall.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>To runne into multiplicity of Wordes, when one onely is sufficient to the Wise, may be but the Badge of my Folly, and an abuse vnto your Generous patience. And therefore, committing this Labour, and my selfe, vnto your Fauourable Construction, with whatsoeuer remaines in mee, by you to bee Commanded, I cease: wishing the Happinesse of you and yours as entirely, as any good that can happen to mee and mine.</p>

      <signed>Your Namelesse Well-willer, desirous to be knowne to none but your Selfe,</signed>
