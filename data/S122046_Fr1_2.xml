   <head>❧ <hi>The Epistle to the</hi> Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quested of a certayne honest mā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prynter of Lōdon, stu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diousse in his vocati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of the commoditie of this our cuntrey, that I wold take in hād to translate this part of the histo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Iewes, to the intent that as there is emongst vs already, in our natiue tong, the originall beginninge of that nacion, &amp; the continuance also for a long space in the Bible, and annexed to the same: so there might be likewise an vnderstanding and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to al men in the English tong,
<pb facs="3"/>as wel as in other, of the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of so famous a commune weal: I both thought it honest to further so good an attempt: yea, and almost dishoneste to repulse his request, oportunitie and ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure seruing me: considering al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so how mani prophecies there be in the scriptures of the destructiō not onely of the citie Ierusalem, but also of the whole cuntry, and no specialtie nor notification in our tong of the fulfillinge of the same. For y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> performance wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, after long weiyng and deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> matter, it was thoughte most cōuenient not to burthē the desierous hereof with the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of so chargeable a volume, as is the great historye of <hi>Flauius Iosephus</hi> that writ the discours of the same to the Romaines, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with many other actes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="3"/>nations nothinge at all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> history of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Iewes: but that we should plenteouslye content mens desires and satisfy our prefixed and aboundauntlye with a farre more briefe: muche lesse costlye, and as sufficiente a commentarye for oure purpose, nothing inferiour to the other in veritye: yea, written by the same <hi>Iosephus,</hi> as the tenure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes of bothe the bookes do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte, although he name him self in thys, <hi>Ben Gorion,</hi> that is the sonne of <hi>Gorion,</hi> and in the other the Sonne of <hi>Mattathias:</hi> whiche is a thynge so commune in the Iewes genealogies, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> men nede not sicke far for the like, for one mā to diduct his discente frō di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers names of father, graund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father or greate graundfather, of the fathers side or of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="4"/>side, now taking the name of the next, now of the most nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his kinred. But howsoeuer the names be vnlike, thistories do so agrie, that they may wel be thought to be written bi one mā: this vnto his cuntrimen Iewes, or for thē that desire no more but a iust rehersal of the thinges cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that onely cuntrey: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Romayns, or for thē that desire to vnderstande of the feats of the Romains in the time of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> age: whiche we thought not to be so necessary for our purpose We determined therefore to take in hande this Ioseph, or rather this his owne epitome or bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his greate boke, yet the whole history of the Iewes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandynge.</p>
   <p>In the translation whereof what paines is taken, not only in
<pb facs="4"/>restorynge diuers wordes that were depraued and corrupted in the latin text: yea, and some hole mēbres of sentēces left out whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch were expresly in the Hebrew, but also that the Hebraicall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of speach so discrepant from our phrase &amp; accustomed maner of speaking, might be reduced vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to our vulgare and familier com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munication, that they mighte be the better vnderstanded: I refer it vnto the iudgement of thē that be expert in the tongs: who if thei list to confer both the textes, they shal-eueriwhere espy a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similitude betwene the woordes of both, and sometime finde hole members of sentēces transposed: yet I trust they shall likewise cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse both that I haue not swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ani thing from the sence and meanyng of the auctour, whiche
<pb facs="5"/>I moste attentifly did alwayes ponder and cōsider, as the thing most profitable for our purpose, &amp; also that it was necessary so to doe, to reduce it vnto our maner of speakyng. For wherunto ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it, if it should not be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed? Were it not as good to remayne styll not vnderstanded in a strange tong, as not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed in our owne? If suche translations, worde for word, be to be counted in our tong, beyng turned into our wordes onely. This therfore was chiefly ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured, that it might be framed and come most nie vnto our vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare tongue, not to our vulgare wordes onely, and yet it shoulde not be disframed, nor disgresse from the true meanynge of the Historiographer.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>Seynge then that it maye nowe be redde in our mother tongue, and vnderstanded also, our hope is that oure trauayle shall not be loste, but that thou likewise for thy parte (gentle Reader) wilte diligently peruse and read this historye, worthye of so great paynes to be bestowed vpon it, bothe for the pleasauntnesse of the matter, and also for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable profite that thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est take thereby. For pleasure: who woulde not be very much delited and desierous to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the ende, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came at lengthe vppon suche a people, that he hathe hearde so muche of, as euerye man hathe redde &amp; hearde of the Iewes in the Bible and otherwise? besides the delectation, in perceiuynge thinges of so great antiquitie.
<pb facs="6"/>Euery man deliteth to behold the pictures of auncient persons, as of <hi>Hercules, Hector, Iulius Caesar, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,</hi> and reuerenceth them as thoughe they were halfe Gods: how much more pleasure should it be to behold the liuely images of their mindes which appeare in theyr actes and dedes whyle thei were here in this life, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we shoulde learne to knowe good from euil, and by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of their dedes vnto our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with considering the euent and successe they had of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we maye take ether an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample or some admoniciō, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to amend our lifes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in besides pleasure, is also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. As when thou seest y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Iewes here afflicted with diuers kinds of misery, because they fell from God: then maist thou be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb facs="6"/>hereby to see the better to thine owne waies, least the like calamities light vpon thee, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thou be so fōd to thinke God will more spare thee, which art but a wild Oliue &amp; but grafted into y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> stock of faith, if thou bring ēther noughty fruit or no fruit, then he did the natural braūches which sprang naturally of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rote it self. Thou shalt read here of terrible and horrible euentes of sedicion and rebellion, yea there was no such cruelti exercised vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by their external enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as they vsed amongst thē selues one vpon an other, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes against their princes, and subiectes against subiectes: in so muche y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> nothing hastened their destruction so greatlye as their own doggidnesse &amp; intestine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred▪ Be thou warned therefore
<pb facs="7"/>by their harmes, &amp; take hede that thou maist auoid y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> like. Cōsider more ouer and marke well, the Iewes were counted Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Romaines contrary his ennemies, as without all doubt, hauing no knowledge of God, &amp; being Idolaters as they were at that time, they could not be gods people: yet for al this, God wold they should preuaile against the Iewes, and subdue them vnder their yoke. Wherbi we mai learn how greatly God is infensed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst iniquitie, in so much that he will rather bring in vpon his own children a nation more wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked: then to leaue them vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, to run forward in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked race. Suche proffitable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samples and lessons are in this history without number: whiche if I shoulde recite all, I shoulde
<pb facs="7"/>bringe the whole booke into the preface. We will therfore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with these fewe at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente, neither as all, nor as the chiefe: desieryng and wisshynge chiefly (good Reader) that thou maiest finde out not the chief on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but all, and not only finde thē out, but note them, and imitate them in thy liuyng and orderyng of thy doynges: which if thou do, then haue we the expected end of our paines and trauail, and thou the profite, wherwith all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may iustly, or wil glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be contented and satisfied.</p>
