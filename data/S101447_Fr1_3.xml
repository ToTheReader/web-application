   <head>TO THE COVRTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ourteous Reader only to banish
melācholy and to wade through
tedious time, tedious in respect
of this place, I gathered a few essayes &amp;
characters, with an intent not to haue thē
seen of any, but to him to whom they
were sent, being on that I might trulie
ground a certainty of, who would excuse
my imperfections, and iudge charitably of
my slendernes of iudgmēt, this coppy by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
came to some of my friends hands,
who hauing perused it wished mee to put
it in print, which I altogether refused,
because I would not presume of my owne
iudgment, or dare to venter to put my selfe
to the censure of so many vnderstanding
readers into whose hands it is subiect to
fall, these perswasions preuailed not,
intreaties were laid aside, and I must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
divulge them, or else loose their loue
this was the first motiue that with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
willingnes caused me to put my
booke to censure. Another was in respect
some obdurate creditors may reade it, &amp;
by reading mollifie their strong harts. The
<pb facs="5"/>
last reason because it may be as a caueat
to young gallants, to terrifie them how
they run in debt, wherein they may know
that imprisonment is of all miseries most
lamentable.</p>
   <p>So hoping that the iudicious will with
laudable censure mittigate my many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
and the other iudge fauorably
of my intention, which if it take
well is better then I can expect,
if otherwise they do not iniury
mee, giuing desert
his reward.</p>
