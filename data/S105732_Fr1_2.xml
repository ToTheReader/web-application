   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very mā that</hi> is of iudgment, &amp; hath a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining of anie vertue, together with a discretion to vse the benefites of nature, will confesse, that we are by as great rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son bounde to encourage and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the industrie of the diligent, as to dispraise and punish the slouth or abuse of the negligent: For if princes doe not aswell rewarde and cherish the well deseruing subiecte, as their Iudges and Magistrates are readie to correct the offendour,
<pb facs="3"/>
the Common Wealth might then quickly be depriued both of the one and the other: I meane that as fast as the sword of Iustice should weede out the one, so fast the scourg of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude woulde chase out the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And so thereby their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions might (in the end) become naked and altogether vnfurnished.</p>
   <p>We see the good huswife is no lesse curious to decke her bees hiue, to rub and perfume it with sweete herbes, to couer and defend it from raine with clay and boordes, and to place it in the warme Sunshine safe from the Northerly blastes: then Shee is readie to wreck her malice on the drones, to smoke and smoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them with Bunte and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
<pb facs="3"/>
to fray and chase them out by soudain noyse, and to kill them and caste them away, as vnprofitable members in her <hi>Microcosmos.</hi> Yea, and with melodie of Basons and Timbrils will shee welcome home her swarme, if at anye time they doe (waspishly) goe astray, &amp; yet at last retourne to their former abyding.</p>
   <p>Thus muche (gentle reader) I haue thought good (Allegorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to write in the behalfe of the right worshipful &amp; my very frend S. <hi>Humfrey Gilbert</hi> Knight, the true authour of this little (yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable) Pamphlet, intituled <hi>A Discourse of a Discouerie for a newe passage to Cataia, &amp;c.</hi> In
<pb facs="4"/>
whose Commendation I woulde fayne write asmuche as hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth, were I not afrayde to bee condemned by him of flatterie: which blame (with my friendes) I vse not to deserue. But surely, ouer and besides that, hee is a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman wel and worshipfully borne and bredde, and well tryed to bee valiant in martiall affayres, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee hath worthely beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted a Coronell and generall in places requisite, and hath with sufficiencie discharged the same, both in this Realme, and in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Nations: hee is also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with sundrie great gyftes of the minde, and generally well gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to th' aduauncemente of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="4"/>
and vertue. All whiche good partes. I rather set downe constrained by the present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, then prompted by any vaine desire to currie fanoure with my friende: For his vertues are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to praise themselues. And it shalbe a sufficient conclusion for my prayses, to wishe that our realme had store of suche Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
   <p>But as the good Gardener doth couer his tender herbes in winter, and cherishe them also in summer: so haue I thought my selfe bounden somewhat to say in the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this present Treatise, and somewhat to answere vnto the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections that might bee made by
<pb facs="5"/>
such as list to cauill at euerie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable enterprise.</p>
   <p>And surely I cannot chuse, but highly prayse the noble minde and courage of the Authour, who more respectinge the publique profit that might ensue by this <hi>Discouerie,</hi> then the delicate life of a Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, well countenanced and fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both by his Prince and all the Nobilitie, had prepared his owne bodie to abide the malice of the windes and waues, and was euen ready to haue perfourmed the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in proper person, if he had not beene by her Maiestie otherwise commanded and imployed in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall affaires, aswell in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as sithence in other places.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>You must herewith vnderstand (good Reader) that the authour hauinge a worshipfull Knight to his brother, who abashed at this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise (aswell for that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had none issue, nor other heier whome he ment to bestow his lands vpon, but onely this Authour, and that this voyage then seemed strāg and had not beene commonly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before, as also because it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnpossible vnto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon capacities) did seeme partly to mislike his resolutions, &amp; to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade him from the same: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he wrote this Treatise vnto his saide Brother, both to excuse and cleare himselfe from the note of rashnesse, and also to set downe
<pb facs="6"/>
such Authorities, reasons, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, as had chiefly encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him vnto the same, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, by the letter next following, the which I haue here inserted for that purpose. And this was done about vij. yeares now past, sithence which time the originall copies of the same haue lien by the authour as one rather dreading to hazarde the Iudgements of curious peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, then greedie of glorie by hasty publication.</p>
   <p>Now it happened that my self being one (amongst manie) behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the said <hi>S. Humfrey Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> for sundrie curtesies, did come to visit him in Winter last passed at his house in <hi>Limehowse,</hi> and
<pb facs="6"/>
beeing verie bolde to demaunde of him howe he spente his time in this loytering vacation from martiall stratagemes, he curteously tooke me vp into his Studie, and there shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me sundrie profitable and verie cōmendable exercises, which he had perfected painefully with his owne penne: And amongst the rest this present <hi>Discouerie.</hi> The which as well because it was not long, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so because I vnderstoode that <hi>M. Fourboiser</hi> (a kinsman of mine) did pretend to trauaile in the same <hi>Discouerie,</hi> I craued at the saide <hi>S. Humfreyes</hi> handes for two or three dayes to reade and to peruse. And bee verie friendly granted my request, but stil seming to doubt
<pb facs="7"/>
that thereby the same might, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his former determination, be Imprinted.</p>
   <p>And to be plaine, when I had at good leasure perused it, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall conferred his allegations by the Tables of <hi>Ortelius,</hi> and by sundrie other <hi>Cosmographicall Mappes</hi> and <hi>Charts,</hi> I seemed in my simple iudgement not onely to like it singularly, but also thought it very meete (as the present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion serueth) to giue it out in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. Wherupon I haue (as you see) caused my friendes great trauaile, and mine owne greater presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be registred in print.</p>
   <p>But since I haue thus aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both his rebuke, and mine owne
<pb facs="7"/>
reproofe, let me thus muche alledge in both our defences.</p>
   <list>
      <item>
         <hi>1</hi> First it is but a Pamphlet &amp; no large discourse, &amp; therefore the more to be borne withall: since the faults (if any be) shalbe the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, because the volume is not great.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>2</hi> Also it was ment by th'au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, but as a priuate Letter vnto his Brother for his better satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and therefore his imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein (if any were) are to be pardoned, since it is very likely that if he had ment to publish the same, he would with greater heede haue obserued and perused the worke in euerie parte.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>3</hi> Againe, it commeth foorth without his consent: So that he had
<pb facs="8"/>
neither warning nor time to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, nor yet to amende anie thing that were worthie misliking.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>4</hi> Furthermore it treateth of a matter whereof no man hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore written particularly, nor shewed ani approued reason for the same. So that not onely his trauaile and paine are very commendable (who out of sundrie Authorities woulde gather one reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture) but also the worke is not to be thought bareine, although it doe not fully prooue somuch as may be expected, since he that plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a flintie fielde, speedeth well if he reape but an indifferent crop.</item>
      <item>
         <hi>5</hi> And last of all it is to bee considered, that of thinges vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb facs="8"/>
the greatest Clerke that euer was could write but probably.</item>
   </list>
   <p>Herewithall, as I haue prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterously answered such obiections as might be made against it, So now let mee say that a great learned man (euen <hi>M. Dee</hi>) doth seeme very well to like of this <hi>Discouerie</hi> and doth much commende the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, the which he declareth in his <hi>Mathematical</hi> preface to th'eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>Euclide.</hi> I. refer thee (Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to peruse the same, and thinke it not strange though I be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by so learned a fore leader, to set forth a thing whiche hee so well liked of.</p>
   <p>To conclude, whereas other <hi>Cosmographical</hi> workes doe but
<pb facs="9"/>
shew vs things already knowen &amp; treated of, this <hi>Discouerie</hi> doeth tend to a very profitable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable practise of a thing to bee discouered. So that I thought it my part, both for great good will to the authour, and for publike perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of a common duetie, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a little Bee somuch commē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, to defend it from the stormes of obiections, with boords and clay of direct answers: To set it in the sunshine (as you see) and to ring it out with my best basons, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter expressing of such ioye &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as I haue therein conceiued.</p>
   <p>All whiche, together with the frendly cōstructions of th'authours trauaile and my boldnes, I cōmend
<pb facs="9"/>
(gentle reader) vnto thy curteous consideration, wishinge vnto thee, much profite by perusing this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, vnto the authour, much prayse according to his deserts, to my kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (who nowe attēpteth to proue the same discouery) happy returne, and to my selfe, some thankes and none ill will, for my presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
   <p>So that the Authour being ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by incouraged, may be the more wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling hereafter to publishe some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well worthy which he hath in readinesse, and whereof hee hath made me alreadie an eyedwitnes. Farewell.</p>
   <p>From my lodging where I march amongst the Muses for lacke
<pb facs="10"/>
of exercise in martiall exploytes, this <hi>12.</hi> of <hi>April. 1576.</hi>
