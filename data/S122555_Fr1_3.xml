   <head>THE PREFACE to the ensuing TREATISE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are oft times admonished in <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> carefully to <hi>seek</hi> GOD: for though <note place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note>
      <hi>he be not farre from every one of us, seeing we live, move, and have our being in him,</hi> as the Apostle speakes, yet are wee <hi>farre</hi> from him: and unlesse we daily frame <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scents</hi> in our <hi>hearts,</hi> and raise <hi>steps</hi> and <hi>greeces</hi> towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and <hi>seeke</hi> him with much
<pb facs="19"/>
labour; we doe but take our journey with the Prodigall, into a Countrey <hi>farre</hi> from our owne, and from our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where wee but feede <hi>swine.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now, briefly to unfold and resolve how these agree, that <hi>GOD i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> not farre from us,</hi> and yet <hi>wee very farre from him:</hi> We say, that <hi>GOD is not farre from us,</hi> because he daily <hi>seeth us,</hi> all things being in his <hi>sight.</hi> He also <hi>thinkes daily of us,</hi> because <hi>he careth</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 7. Heb. 1. 3</note>
      <hi>for us:</hi> and he also daily <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us,</hi> as <hi>bearing all things by his mighty Word.</hi> And againe, we are <hi>farre</hi> from GOD, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we neither doe, nor can <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 16.</note>
      <hi>see</hi> him, <hi>dwelling in inaccessible light,</hi> and we are not <hi>able to thinke any thing</hi> (of GOD) <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>:</note> of <hi>our selves, as of our selves,</hi> much lesse to <hi>touch him,</hi> by any pious affection, or to cleave to him; unlesse he take us up,
<pb facs="19"/>
and <hi>draw us after him,</hi> by his <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 3</note> power. Therefore when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had said, <hi>I have set GOD alwaies before mee,</hi> or in my <hi>sight;</hi> he presently addes, <hi>for</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ps. 16. 9.</note>
      <hi>he is on my right hand;</hi> or (as St. <hi>Jer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>me) me suscepit dextra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tua.</hi> Neither are we onely in these three respects <hi>farre</hi> from GOD, that we can neither <hi>see him,</hi> nor easily <hi>thinke of him,</hi> nor <hi>joyne</hi> to him in <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> but wee easily <hi>forget</hi> him, scarce sounding forth his <hi>name,</hi> by <hi>praise</hi> or <hi>prayer:</hi> the reason is, because wee are entangled and taken up with temporall affaires, which compasse us round, and even overwhelme us.</p>
   <p>This then is the <hi>cause,</hi> why the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in sacred <hi>writ,</hi> (as wee said even now) so often perswades and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes us; to <hi>seeke GOD.</hi> As, <hi>Seeke yee after GOD, and</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ps. 69. 33</note>
      <hi>your soule shall live.</hi> And, <hi>Seeke</hi>
      <pb facs="20"/>
      <hi>the LORD and his strength:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ps. 105. 4</note>
      <hi>seeke his face evermore.</hi> And, <hi>The LORD is good to the</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 25. Esay 55. 6. Sap. 1. 1.</note>
      <hi>soule that seeketh him.</hi> And, <hi>Seeke the LORD while hee may be found,</hi> and <hi>Seeke the LORD in simplicity of heart.</hi> And, <hi>If thou shalt seeke the</hi>
      <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 29.</note>
      <hi>LORD thy GOD, thou shalt finde him, if thou seeke him with all thy heart, and with all thy soule.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>No man, of what <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> soever, is tyed so to give himselfe up to the affaires of the World, as not to refresh himselfe, with meate, drinke and sleepe. And if the <hi>bodie</hi> require such <hi>refreshing,</hi> and repast; how much rather should the <hi>soule</hi> desire food and sleepe, <hi>(Prayer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation)</hi> one being the <hi>meate,</hi> and the other the <hi>sleepe</hi> of the <hi>soule?</hi> and by these two, are <hi>ascents</hi> framed in the heart, by which wee are
<pb facs="20"/>
to <hi>see the GOD of GODS</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ps. 84. 7.</note>
      <hi>in Sion,</hi> even asmuch as hee may be <hi>seene,</hi> in this <hi>vale of teares.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now there can bee no plainer, or more easie way for <hi>us</hi> mortalls to <hi>ascend</hi> to GOD, then by the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his <hi>workes.</hi> For wee cannot properly say, that they <hi>ascended,</hi> which by the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular guift of GOD, were admitted by another way into <hi>Paradise;</hi> and there to heare the <hi>secrets of GOD,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12 4.</note>
      <hi>which are not lawfull to bee spoken or uttered:</hi> but onely, that they were <hi>rapt,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> plainely confesseth, in his owne case.</p>
   <p>But that it is possible for a man to <hi>ascend</hi> to the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of GOD, and <hi>love</hi> of his Creator, by his <hi>workes,</hi> (that is by his <hi>creatures)</hi> the Booke of <hi>Wisedome,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and reason <note place="margin">Sap. 13. 5. Ro. 1. 20.</note>
      <pb facs="21"/>
it selfe, sufficiently prove: seeing the <hi>efficient cause</hi> may bee <hi>knowne</hi> by its effects, as a Man by his <hi>picture</hi> or <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</hi> And there is no doubt but that all Created things be the <hi>workes</hi> of GOD; and holy Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ure teacheth us, that Man and Angels be not onely the <hi>workes,</hi> but the <hi>images</hi> of GOD.</p>
   <p>Being therefore provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and stirred up, with these reasons; and having a little ease and rest from other affaires, I have attempted to make a LADDER, out of the Consideration of the <hi>Creatures;</hi> by which after a sort, GOD may bee <hi>ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> unto: And I have distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished it into fifteene Staves or Steppes, after the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the fifteene Degrees, by which men went up to <hi>SOLOMONS Temple;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Eze. 40.</note>
      <pb facs="21"/>
and of the fifteene Psalmes of <hi>DAVID</hi> his Father, <note place="margin">Ps. 120. &amp;c.</note> usually called the <hi>Gradualls,</hi> or Psalmes of <hi>Degrees.</hi>
