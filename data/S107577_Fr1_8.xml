   <head>THE
TRANSLATOR TO
the Courteous Reader, wisheth all
Sauing health in IESVS CHRIST.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ise Politicians</hi> (fauourable Reader) in their <hi>Institutions,</hi> and
<hi>Gouernnement</hi> of <hi>Common-wealths,</hi> doe hold for an infallible
maxime, that to reforme Corruptions and abuses in <hi>States,</hi>
better course cannot be taken, then often to reduce things
to their primitiue Original; Because Lawes at first enacted
with good and profitable intention, in the Reuolution of
few yeeres, by mens instability and inconstancie of minde,
or the peculiar interest of Auarice by Iniustice, are abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
and neglected. <hi>The Venetians beeing a people at this day celebrous, and famous for
their Gouernement, have a supreame Magistracie, which they call</hi> A Syndicate, <hi>that once in a
few yeeres, suruey all the</hi> Offices <hi>and</hi> Dignities <hi>in their Common-wealth, the</hi> Duke <hi>himselfe
not there excepted, to looke into abuses, and preuent their deepe roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>e and plantation; that so all
things may continue and stand entire, according to the rules and precepts of their first Constitutions
and ordinances.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Also a Garden-plot, though neuer so curiously drawne or distinguished into
borders, and set with all manner of odoriferous flowers, and wholesome herbes, yet
euery showre of raine brings foorth new weedes, the which if they be not careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and dayly supplanted, will soone ouergrow the good plants, and bring the
same to a wilde and sauage plot of ground. And though the ineuitable deprauati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and corruption of mans nature carry so strong a hand in things transitory and
mutable, yet one would thinke they should be more stable and prouident in those
courses tending to eternall saluation, and soules reprobation, in obseruing those
Lawes and Commandements, vttered by GOD himselfe, and recommended to all
Posterities for a square Rule, whereby to measure our faith and actions. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
men are more prone to Declination and Corruption, in that from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
beginning, and first institution of the Law <hi>Mosaicall,</hi> till these present times, that
for many ages haue receiued the cleere and manifest Truth, and doctrine Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall,
<pb facs="10"/>
      <hi>Heresies</hi> haue euer crept in and caried too powerful an hand, as Verity it selfe,
like gold in the bowels and entrals of the earth, is encombred with a wonderfull
deale of oare and drosse, which is not like to be separated till the last fire of tryall,
which shall prooue euery mans worke, and cast out the drosse to be trampled and
troden vnder foote; wherefore (Christian Reader) for the better satisfaction and
generall good of all Gods Church, I haue laboured to translate this curious and
admirable Master peece, most worthy and necessary to be obserued and read: for
thou mayest, as in a <hi>Miner,</hi> cleerely see and discouer the <hi>Birth</hi> and the <hi>Originall</hi> of
this soule Monster <hi>Heresie,</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> euen from the first ages before the written
Law, as also during the force and efficacie of the <hi>Mosoicall</hi> Sacrifices, and now in
these later times more pertinent vnder the Law and precepts of Christs holy Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
wherein are deduced the Authors and Founders of the <hi>Romane Masse.</hi> And
what conformity it holds with the <hi>Ethnicke-Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and how farre a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
it hath made from the doctrine, life, and practise <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> and the ages
of the <hi>Primitiue Church,</hi> wherein the Author euer hath abandoned all passion &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
and in ful proofes, cited none but either approued and authentike Authors,
as the ancient Doctors and writers of the Church, that liued before the present
Inundations of superstitious Traditions.</p>
   <p>Bring them to the Text of Gods Word, compare them with the example of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
obserue the Customes of the Primitiue Churches and thus, by reducing them to their beginnings
it will be, easie to iudge whether they stand still in that v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>emions.</p>
   <p>If thou doest but vouchsafe the diligent and carefull reading hereof, I make
no doubt but it will yeeld great comfort to thy Conscience, &amp; confirmation to thy
Faith, as that which will cleerely delucidate many hidden passages that haue not
hitherto been reuealed: and if it may take this happy effect, I shall thinke
my paines sufficiently requited and recompen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
