      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian <hi>Reader,</hi> if this Treatise may seeme to any to bee superfluous, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending that, which noe good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians deny: yet considering how fruitfull these last times are in bringing forth the spurious spawnes, and monstrous birthes of all kinds of heresies, among which this of the Antinomians, a most pestilent and pernicious sest, is not the least, which denyeth any further vse of the <hi>Morall Law</hi> to belieuers, no not as a rule of conuersation, as of <hi>duty</hi> to be conformed vnto: and seeing also how many counterfeit Christians are ready, &amp; do daily intertaine this <hi>Libertine</hi> doctrine, which lets loosse the raines to all licentiousnesse, as both the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> and <hi>Disciples</hi> of this <hi>Antinomian</hi> heresie, the <hi>Sons of Belial,</hi> do euidently proue in the practise of their lawlesse and gracelesse life: &amp; lastly waighing, how this Antinomian frye is, as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to true fayth, and the power of religion, so a friend to all other heresies now on foote, specially
<pb facs="6"/> to <hi>Popery,</hi> seruing as a way maker for it, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe the wals of the City of God, that so <hi>Romes Troian Horse,</hi> full of traiterous Engines and armed Engineers, may finde the easier reentry for the erecting of their Dagon, instead of Gods Arke: I hope thou wilt not esteeme either my paines lost in writing, or thyne in reading this small tract. And howsoeuer there is small hope, that those, who haue already deepely drunke in this sweete deadly poyson, will easily admit of any Antidote or Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue, or suffer it kindly to worke vpon them, so intoxicated they are with the spirit of giddynesse, and (I feare) many of them iustly giuen ouer of God to a reprobate sense, hauing fallen from the truth of the <hi>Ghospell</hi> once acknowledged of them: Yet I doubt not, but (by Gods grace) this Treatise will be a meanes to preserue all sound and simple-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted christians in the true fayth of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> neuer to be seduced by such spirits of errour, and perhaps to reduce into the way of the truth all such honest-hearted poore soules, as haue beene beguiled by them.</p>
   <p>Onely this let mee premonish thee of: that whereas in the fourth page I promise to affix the Copy of that letter at large, which gaue occasion of
<pb facs="6"/> this Treatise: I haue since altered my minde for these reasons: <hi>1.</hi> Because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> coppy is very large: <hi>2.</hi> Because I haue set downe the substance of it in all the particulars throughout this Tract: <hi>3.</hi> Instead thereof, I haue added (vpon occasion offered, when I had ended this treatise) as a branch thereof, a short discourse toucbing the Sabbath day, the Morality whereof some haue of late impugned, as not binding Christians in the obseruation of <hi>the Lords day;</hi> the diuine Institution whereof they also deny. So as if I haue not made good my promise in a matter of no necessity, nor of much moment: thou wilt pardon mee, if J haue made thee amends, in adding that, which is of farre greater importance and benefit. And if herein also I haue not in all poynts satisfied thy iudgement to the full, concerning the Law of the Sabbath, and of the diuine institution of the Lords day instead of the Iewes Sabbath: I shall (by Gods grace) shortly giue thee further satisfaction in a fuller and ampler Treatise, purposely penned in answere to a booke lately come forth, which would vtterly euacuate <hi>the Lords day</hi> for the Christian Sabbath, and reduce vs to the Iewes Sabbath-day agayne. Which will bee a worke somuch the more necessary, by how
<pb facs="7"/> much this Iewish Sabbatarian findes already many <hi>Maléferiatos homi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>es,</hi> idle and giddy-brained Christians to imbrace his booke, which is written with Amighty, confident, and Gyantlike spirit, as if the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments thereof were inuincible. Jn the meane time inioy this, and pray for mee, that God would assist me in that greater worke, and in all things that may most concerne his glory, and the benefit of his Church. Farewell.</p>
