      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et mee now entreate thee, courteous &amp; tractable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not to stay thy minde vpon the word, Dances: but to make thy recourse thorow the matters, which are deduced vnder that title. For what cause? Otherwise the subiect of this purpose, as I thinke, shall seeme vnto thy iudgement, to be vaine and friuolous, whereas of it selfe, it is altogether serious, and of a great moment. Heare mee a little. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Treatise concerning Dances, doth not lay the foundation of his arguments vpon his owne opinion, nor vpon the fantasticall imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of some others: but vpon the word of GOD it selfe, which is comprehended in the Holy Bookes of the Olde and Newe Testaments.
<pb facs="3"/>The which thing may verie plainely be discerned, by the vnion, or congruitie of this small Treatise, being not framed according to the pleasure of the eye, but for the comfort of the heart: In which comfort these holy men and women (which he hath named, and before our eyes heere erected) magnified the most mightie Creator of all visible and inuisible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, holding it to bee their dutie, not onely pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately to laud and reioyce in him for the victories they receiued: but also to stirre vp the people (which they ruled,) by the actiuenes and agilitie of their bodies in Dances, to praise and laud the immortall worker of their triumphs: Therefore bee thou instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the doctrine heerein contained: and the Lord haue thee alwaies vnder his protection.</p>
