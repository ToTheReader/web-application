   <salute>TO THE ADVEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVRERS, FAVORERS, AND VVELVVILLERS OF THE EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERPRISE FOR THE INHABITTING and planting in Virginia.</salute>
   <p>Since the first vndertaking by Sir Walter Ralegh to deale in the action of discouering of that Countrey which is now called and known by the name of <hi>Virginia;</hi> many voyages hauing bin thiter made at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times to his great charge; as first in the yeere 1584. and afterwardes in the yeeres 1585. 1586. and now of late this last yeare of 1587. There ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue bin diuers and variable reportes with some slaunderous and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full speeches bruited abroade by many that returned from thence. Especially of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery which was made by the Colony transported by Sir Richard Greinuile in the yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re 1585. being of all the others the most principal and as yet of most effect, the time of their abode in the countrey beeing a whole yeare, when as in the other voyage before they staied but sixe weekes; and the others after were onelie for supply and transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing more being discouered then had been before. Which reports haue not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne a litle wrong to many that otherwise would haue also fauoured &amp; aduentured in the action, to the honour and benefite of our nation, besides the particular profite and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te which would redound to them selues the dealers therein; as I hope by the sequele of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents to the shame of those that haue auouched the contrary shalbe manifest: if you the aduenturers, fauourers, and welwillers do but either encrease in number, or in opinion continue, or hauing bin doubtfull renewe your good liking and furtherance to deale therein according to the worthinesse thereof alreadye found and as you shall vnderstand hereafter to be requisite. Touching which woorthines through cause of the diuersitie of relations and reportes, manye of your opinions coulde not bee firme, nor the mindes of some that are well disposed, bee setled in any certaintie.</p>
   <p>I haue therefore thought it good beeing one that haue beene in the discouerie and in dealing with the naturall inhabitantes specially imploied; and hauing therefore seene and knowne more then the ordinarie: to imparte so much vnto you of the fruites of our labours, as that you may knowe howe iniuriously the enterprise is slaundered. And that in publike manner at this present chiefelie for two respectes.</p>
   <p>First that some of you which are yet ignorant or doubtfull of the state thereof, may see that there is sufficiēt cause why the cheefe enterpriser with the fauour of her Maiestie, notwithstanding suche reportes; hath not onelie since continued the action by sending into the countrey againe, and replanting this last yeere a new Colony; but is also readie, according as the times and meanes will affoorde, to follow and prosecute the same.</p>
   <p>Secondly, that you seeing and knowing the continuance of the action by the view hereof you may generally know &amp; learne what the countrey is, &amp; ther vpon cōsider how your dealing therein if it proceede, may returne you profit and gaine; bee it either by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitting &amp; planting or otherwise in furthering thereof.</p>
   <p>And least that the substance of my relation should be doubtful vnto you, as of others by reason of their diuersitie: I will first open the cause in a few wordes wherefore they are
<pb n="6" facs="5"/>so different; referring my selue to your fauourable constructions, and to be adiudged of as by good consideration you shall finde cause.</p>
   <p>Of our companie that returned some for their misdemenour and ill dealing in the countrey, haue beene there worthily punished; who by reason of their badde natures, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue maliciously not onelie spoken ill of their Gouernours; but for their sakes slaundered the countrie it selfe. The like also haue those done which were of their consort.</p>
   <p>Some beeing ignorant of the state thereof, notwithstanding since their returne amō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest their friendes and acquaintance and also others, especially if they were in compaine where they might not be gainesaide; woulde seeme to knowe so much as no men more; and make no men so great trauailers as themselues. They stood so much as it maie seeme vppon their credite and reputation that hauing been a twelue moneth in the countrey, it woulde haue beene a great disgrace vnto them as they thought, if they coulde not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue saide much wheter it were true or false. Of which some haue spoken of more then euer they saw or otherwise knew to bee there; othersome haue not bin ashamed to make ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute deniall of that which although not by thē, yet by others is most certainely ād there plētifully knowne. And othersome make difficulties of those things they haue no skill of.</p>
   <p>The cause of their ignorance was, in that they were of that many that were neuer out of the Iland where wee were seated, or not farre, or at the leastwise in few places els, during the time of our aboade in the countrey; or of that many that after golde and siluer was not so soone found, as it was by them looked for, had little or no care of any other thing but to pamper their bellies; or of that many which had little vnderstanding, lesse discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and more tongue then was needfull or requisite.</p>
   <p>Some also were of a nice bringing vp, only in cities or townes, or such as neuer (as I may say) had seene the world before. Because there were not to bee found any English cities, nor such faire houses, nor at their owne wish any of their olde accustomed daintie food, nor any soft beds of downe or fethers: the countrey was to them miserable, &amp; their reports thereof according.</p>
   <p>Because my purpose was but in briefe to open the cause of the varietie of such spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; the particularities of them, and of many enuious, malicious, and slaūderous reports and deuises els, by our owne countrey men besides; as trifles that are not worthy of wise men to bee thought vpon, I meane not to trouble you withall: but will passe to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, the substance of that which I haue to make relation of vnto you.</p>
   <p>The treatise where of for your more readie view &amp; easier vnderstanding I will diuide into three speciall parts. In the first I will make declaration of such commodities there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie found or to be raised, which will not onely serue the ordinary turnes of you which are and shall bee the plāters and inhabitants, but such an ouerplus sufficiently to bee yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or by men of skill to bee prouided, as by way of trafficke and exchaunge with our ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne nation of England, will enrich your selues the prouiders; those that shal deal with you; the enterprisers in general; and greatly profit our owne countrey men, to supply them with most things which heretofore they haue bene faine to prouide, either of strangers or of our enemies: which commodities for distinction sake, I call <hi>Merchantable.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In the second, I will set downe all the cōmodities which wee know the countrey by our experience doeth yeld of it selfe for victuall, and sustenance of mans life; such as is vsually fed vpon by the inhabitants of the countrey, as also by vs during the time we were there.</p>
   <p>In the last part I will make mention generally of such other cōmodities besides, as I am able to remember, and as I shall thinke behoofull for those that shall inhabite, and plant there to knowe of; which specially concerne building, as also some other necessary vses: with a briefe description of the nature and maners of the people of the countrey.</p>
