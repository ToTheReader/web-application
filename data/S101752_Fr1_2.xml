   <head>TO THE RIGHT EXCELLENT AND HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Lord, the Lord Robert Dudley, Earle of Lecester, Baron of Denbigh, knight of the most noble order of the garter, Master of the Queenes Maiesties horse, and one of her graces most Honorable priuy Counsell, Iohn Harmar wisheth all godly felicitie, continuaunce of health, encrease of Honor, &amp; graces eternall.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> WAS REQVESTED, RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, by manie of my friends, to emploie the time of this last vacation of mine from my publique readinges in the Vniuersitie, in the translating of Master Bezaes Sermons vpon the Canticle of Canticles, which I had a little before receaued from the Francfurt Mart in French, into our vulgare and Mother tongue. The desire I had of aduancing and promoting the glorie of God, which is then especially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased and farthered, when his word, the mirrour of his wil, is no longer a sealed booke vnto the simple and ignorant, but a volume laid open in clear and capital letters, that he that runneth may read it: enforced mee princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to vndertake vpon my present leasure, this more painful, then happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thankful work of translating.</p>
   <p>Wherein, for the vtility and profite of manie, as wel the learned as the vnlettered who haue not the vnderstanding of the French tongue, I did the more willingly emploie both my leasure and my paine, because I would haue somewhat to present your Lordshippe withal for a token and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my thankful duety, and dutifull thankfulnesse, vpon so manie, so memorable, so vtterly vndeserued benefits of your Honor, not so much col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, as congested, &amp; heaped from time to time vpon me. For extend I the cogitation of my mind to the farthest part of my infancy and childhoode, and drawe it foorth as in a continuall and euen threed vnto this present time, what part of my age hath not beene honored with the patronage of your Lordships fauor and goodwil towardes me? The ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my first studies laid in Winchester by your honours onely meanes, in obtaining her highnesse letters for my preferment vnto that schoole; the rearing of the farther frame of them in this Colledge, wherein placed by your Lordships fauor, I yet continu; my time spent to my great desire &amp; contentment in the parts beyond the Seas by your Honours intercession; my roome and degree I doe nowe enioie in the Vniuersitie beeing one of her Maiesties publique professors, purchased by your Lordships fauourable mediation, doe euerie of them in particular deserue a volume of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements
<pb facs="3"/>
in al thankfulnes and humble deuotion towards your honour. And therefore, that I might not seeme vnmindful of your Lordships grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous respect and fauour towards me, or drowne so manie benefites receaued in the flud of forgetfulnes and vtter obliuion, I was bould to aduenture the deliuerie of these my simple labours in this so smal a woorke of translation vnto your Honors patronage.</p>
   <p>What common profit &amp; emolument the worke it selfe maie bring vnto the Church of God among vs, maie be easily esteemed of them, who shall aright consider both the argument it selfe deduced in this present treatise, as likewise the autor whose deduction and exposition it is, and lastlie both the manner hee hath vsed in the handling thereof, and the principall end whereunto he hath directed it.</p>
   <p>The Argument therefore or subiect thereof, I meane the Canticle it selfe, entituled by an eminency of speach, the Song of Songes, that is the onely Song as it were in the holy Scripture, and of the most heauenliest &amp; excellentest ditty, concluded in termes and phrases of speach altogether enigmaticall and allegoricall, and containing the great mysterie as the Apostle calleth it of our saluation, the mystical coniunction of Christ with the faithfull his members, and the whole order of the spirituall fraunsailes and marriadge match it pleaseth Christ to contract with his Church, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwaies reputed so darke and obscure, so hard and difficult, that many aswell of the auncient as of the later Church haue thought this arme of the maine Ocean of holy scriptures, the waters of life, fitter for the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant to swimme, then for the Lambe to wade in: that is, according to the phrase of the Apostle, rather strong meate for such as are growen vnto a perfect man in Iesus Christ, then milke for such as are still babes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in vnderstanding: it can not be denied but that the sound interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof according vnto the sense &amp; meaning of the holy Ghost, the vniformitie and consent of other scriptures, the proportion and analogie of christian faith, must needes bee profitable and auaileable to the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of God, the congregation of saintes. For what admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comfort, &amp; consolation vtterly incomprehensible, the reading of this part of Scripture may bring euery Christian, what peace and tranquillity it may breede in the afflicted minde and conscience, what incomparable ioy it may worke in the harts of the beleeuing, it is easie to consider by the spouse her selfe in this place representing not onely the whole but euery part &amp; member of the Church of God. My beloued, saith she, is mine, and I am his. Loe the ground of our holy assuraunce of the fauour and loue of God towardes vs. The which words making and plighting in most formal sort a reciprocall donation of the Bride to her Bridegroome, of Christ to his Church, serueth as it were for the burden of this holy &amp; sacred nuptial song. Now this ground being of it selfe so comfortable and so plaine, dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thoroughout by the way of mutuall speach in many darke and allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall termes and similitudes, implyeth a singular degree of consolation in the rest being soundly and perfectly vnderstoode.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>And albeit many haue trauailed in the exposition of this most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable part of holy scripture, among whom some of our own countrymen haue well deserued of the Church of God for their painfull labours in this behalfe, notwithstanding if I be not deceaued with the loue and affection I beare the authour, in whose translation I haue laboured (a man to bee embraced and loued of all who loue the Lord &amp; embrace his truth, but in particular to bee honoured and reuerenced of my selfe, who found him no lesse then a father vnto me in curtesie &amp; good will, when I liued as a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Geneua, and enioyed the benefite of hearing of him in lectures and sermons) there is none that hath so plainely, so perfitely, so distinctly sette downe and expounded it, as hee hath done. Wherein let Mounsier Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brard himselfe be iudge, whether Master Beza vnderstand this Canticle or no, and leaue to accuse with such shamelesse impudencie his ignorance and impietie.</p>
   <p>Nowe for the profite and benefite of the Church of God in common, how could it be more plainly and familiarly, more largely and plentifully, more distinctly and particularly handled, then by this way which he tooke for the behoofe of his particular flocke and charge, the people of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua, to expound the whole Canticle by particular sermons, and so to drawe from thence for instruction and doctrine, rebuking and reproouing, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and exhortation, comforting and consolation, what ground and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes soeuer might be offered? VVhich howe aptly and fitly it is done by Master Beza in these sermons, there is no man so ignoraunt which in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding shall not perceiue: especially obseruing those speciall notes which containe the summe of all that which in the sermons following he hath particularly deduced and handled, euery section aunswering by the like fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure vnto that which is premitted in those summary contentes, which may serue both in steede of marginal notes, and an exact table vnto the whole worke. And in these who so list may summarily and shortly see in what sort the Authors whole discourses are framed and directed, according vnto the naturall importance of the text it selfe, against the aduersarie.</p>
   <p>And this is it whereat principally Master Beza hath in these sermons of his aimed, namely, to the conuincing of the aduersary in the chiefest &amp; most fundamentall pointes controuersed betweene the Papistes &amp; vs, and especially touching the principall points concerning the true Iesus Christ (for there are false Christes gone out into the world, and many say, here is Christ, and there is Christ, but beleeue them not) and the true Church (for there is a false Catholique Church too, resembling the true onely in name) and the certaine and infallible markes both of the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which are the questions especially debated betweene our aduersaries and vs at this day. As in deede this is the principall ende and scope which Salomon himselfe respected in this song of his, namely, to paint forth vnto vs in most liuely coloures, aswell the true and essentiall qualities of this Bridegrome, as also the natiue and liuely portraite of this spouse, which is his Church. And therefore fiue of the sermons of this volume, which goe
<pb facs="4"/>
no farther then the thirde Chapter of the Canticles (for the rest Master Beza hath promised if God wil hereafter, and my selfe by the assistance of the same God will according to my leasure performe the translation of them when I shall receiue them) concerning the description of Salomons Coche, and the crowning of him with a crowne by his mother in the day of his fiaunsailes, are wholy touching the vsurped tiranny of the Church of Rome ouer all Christendome, and the falsification, which the heade thereof, who nameth himselfe the Lieutenaunt generall in earth vnto this king which is here crowned, vseth, in all the ordinaunces and lawes of God. And first in the law morall, throughout euery commandement, first, second, third, fourth, fift, sixt, seuenth, eight, ninth, and tenth: and then in the law ceremoniall, thirdly in confounding the law with the Gospell, and causing men, to seeke after their saluation in that which inditeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth them, shewing and proouing after this howe Christ is degraded from all his estates &amp; offices by this Apostaticall See. And first of his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity royall, then his state propheticall, thirdly his Priesthood. The same both touching these and other points debated betweene the Papistes and vs, is likewise performed throughout his whole sermons, that the diligent reading of them may furnish euery one of the simpler and ignoraunt sort, with store of weapons defensiue &amp; offensiue against the aduersarie.</p>
   <p>Some fewe thinges, beeing personal matters, I must confesse vnto your Lordship, I haue omitted in the printed translation, which are pointed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by a little star, that who so list to see them maie by that meanes consult the autor himselfe. I thought it for my owne part not conuenient, as many good men also with me, to hinder the Church of so great a commoditie, as I doubt not this woorke will bring it, by occasioning anie offence through some few wordes which might happily breede some grieuance. And herein as I doubt not, but the autor himselfe, for his loue towards me, wil pardon me: so I hope al the godly wil hold me excused.</p>
   <p>It remaineth I beseech your Lordship in all dutie and humility fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie to accept of this simple present of mine, no requital or recompence of your Honors bountie and liberality alwaies exhibited vnto me, but a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie and signification of my grateful and thankful mind most affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natelie deuoted vnto al seruiceable duty towardes your honour.</p>
   <closer>THE Lord of Lords and God almighty, guide you euer, and direct you in al your honourable actions with his holie spirite, and continue you long in al honour vnto his honour: for the welfare of his Church, the benefite of our common Weale, the patronage of our Vniuersitie, the ioy of all such as pray for your Lordships health and prosperity. Amen.</closer>
