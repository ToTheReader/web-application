   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving seene (by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience)
in the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of my life, all
the rules of this book,
I was of opinion, that
I should doe more good, if I did
translate, out of the <hi>Italian Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teo,</hi>
these things, which ought to
be considered of, in the time of
our youth, and to adde other
stories, and things, tending to
this purpose, which I have seene,
and heard: which might be insteed
of dainties, and sweete language,
to make us passable, without an
ill savour: the guilded Pills of a
loving reprehension, which are
<pb facs="9"/>
conteyned in this booke, though
they bee cloathed in Tales, and
jestes, doe not cease to profit any
that stands in neede of these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions:
if his mouth bee not
so bitter, and his tast so distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered,
that nothing can please him;
but for others, that are not such,
as are deciphered, in this Table,
they may tast much of their owne
neatnesse, and good judgement, and
if any tittle of this, concerne them,
they may bee admonished thereby,
and amend their fault, without any
trouble of any, with the bare rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and observation of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.
I know well, that some will
say, that I have ill acquitted my
selfe, by these instructions, though
I make my selfe master of them: but
I answer with the same <hi>Galateo,</hi>
where he sayth, that the rather, as
one that takes warning from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
in them, doe I now set them
forth, that others may not fall so
unadvisedly as I have done, and
<pb facs="9"/>
so I am excused; Alleadging for
my principall discharge to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
thereby, to a matter so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for me, and at such a time as it
cannot be taken for a reproofe, but
an admonition. For that when I
come of discretion, I consider I shall
receive content, in that I have bin
admonished; for although I have
procured others to to live respected
of all, yet might I have bin more
wary of my selfe. This I offer to the
curious Reader, but my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is to serve him, subjecting my
selfe, to receive with love, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
he can give me.</p>
