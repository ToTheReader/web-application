   <head>THE INTRODVCTION OR PREAMBLE, PREPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Reader</hi> for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the following WORKE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing by Gods Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (who swayeth vs as it pleaseth him to our seuerall places of being) gained a charge of soules in the Aduenture of the honourable Company of Merchants trading to the <hi>East-Indies</hi>: It happened that I was transferred from my Charge aboard the Shippe, to reside in their prime Factorie in <hi>Guzzarat,</hi> in a place called <hi>Surrat,</hi> with the President ouer their affaires in that place M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Thomas Kerridge</hi>; where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the busie obseruance of Trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, inquiring what noueltie the place might
<pb facs="7"/>
produce, a people presented themselues to mine eyes, cloathed in linnen garments, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what low descending, of a gesture and garbe as I may say, maidenly and well nigh effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; of a countenance shy and somewhat estranged: yet smiling out a glosed and bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full familiarity, whose vse in the Companies affaires occasioned their presence there.</p>
   <p>Truth to say, mine eyes vnacquainted with such obiects, tooke vp their wonder and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and this admiration the badge of a fresh Trauailer, bred in mee the importunity of a Questioner: I asked what manner of people those were, so strangely notable, and notably strange? Reply was made, they were <hi>Banians,</hi> a people forraigne to the knowledge of the Christian world; their Religion, Rites, and Customes, sparingly treated of by any, and they no lesse reserued in the publication of them: but some opinions they deriued from the Philosopher <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> touching Trans-animation of soules. It was thought the nouelty would make the discouery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, gratefull and acceptable to some of our Countrey men, that some of my Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors had beene scrutinous to bring this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to light; but whether deterred with the Fictions and <hi>Chymeraes,</hi> wherewith <hi>Banian</hi> writings abound, that might make it vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of acceptation, or the shynesse of the <hi>Bramanes,</hi> who will scarce admit a stranger
<pb facs="7"/>
conuersation, the worke was left to him that would make a path through these impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
   <p>The President, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Thomas Kerridge,</hi> was vrgent with me, to redeeme their omissions, and to see if I could worke somewhat out of this forsaken Subiect. The truth was, I was willing to earnest his loue to mee by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, who to giue this vndertaking the better promotion, interested himselfe in the worke, by mediating my acquaintance with the <hi>Bramanes,</hi> whose eminence of place, was an attractiue to draw on this discouery and manifestation.</p>
   <p>I that thought my obseruance would bee well tooke, if I could present my Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with any thing new from these forraigne parts, begun my worke, and essayed to fetch materials for the same out of their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts, and by renewed accesse, with the helpe of Interpreters, made my collections out of a booke of theirs called the SHASTER, which is to them as their Bible, containing the grounds of their Religion in a written word.</p>
   <p>If any therefore bee affected to peruse or reuise the Religion, Rites, and Customes, of the said <hi>Banians,</hi> leauing out for the most part such prodigious Fictions as seeme inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on sense and reason; here they shall meete with the best Essence and ground of
<pb facs="8"/>
this Sect, digested into such a forme, as shall best cleare the knowledge thereof, and such as I presume neuer had a like discouery by any yet in the Presse. So handfesting the Reader with as good hopes, as may bee expected from a Subiect of this nature, I referre them to the proofe of the following Chapters.</p>
