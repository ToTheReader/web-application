   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N sacred Scripture (gentle Reader) among others we finde this lawe full of Christian Loue and Charitie: <hi>Thou shalt restore againe the wandering or straying▪ Oxe or</hi>

      <hi>Asse of thy neighbours vnto him:</hi> By which law the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God would as by an euident argument confirme and establish amongest vs mutuall loue and amitie. For if in this sorte Gods lawes doe commaund vs to take care of the straieng cattle of our enimies: how much more then do they will vs to helpe the miserable ease and great dangers of the bodies of our friends, and to restore their health? Wherefore when as I (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Theophrastus Paracelsus</hi> and other excellent men) vnderstoode the errours of manie Phisitions of our time, I beganne to deuise with my selfe by what meanes I might attaine to the knowledge of true phisicke, which is deriued out of the light of nature, not out of the darke writings of the heathen. And I iudged it to be necessarie to trauell, and to go vnto far places, to seek out learning and knowledge, and not to hope or looke for it, sitting at home idlelie. I prepared my selfe therefore to my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, and with long trauell and labour haue searched out and learned those things, which for christian loue sake I can no longer keepe silent, that I might call backe the wandering children into the path of true doctrine, and hauing declared my iournie and labours, they also being excused and defended, which are laid open vnto al maner of slaunders, by those which so greatly commend the heathenish phisicke, whose deceits in som part I wil indeuor to disclose; I wil afterward declare what those that are desirous of true and naturall phisicke, are to looke for at my hands, and what Bookes of true phisicke I haue gathered together in sundrie places, being mooued with compassion towards those that go astraie, I wil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate and set forth for their publike profit and commoditie. But first the matter so requireth, that to auoide the hatred of the common sort, as well from my selfe, as from al other fauourers of the Arte of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I should dulie answer vnto the aduersaries, whose frowardnesse and malice is such, that they wil with proude wordes annihilate, reiect, and condemne others inuentions, which they themselues see and perceiue they may vse with great successe and profite. And yet they in the meane season arrogate vnto themselues the commendations due vnto the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and with a lying kinde of st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>alth robbe the inuenters of Artes of their due honour; which is a subtil kind of craft, springing out of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
<pb facs="3"/>
of the olde serpent. For when as reports are spread of the straunge cures of sundrie grieuous diseases, which are wrought by the benefite of tinctures and vegetall and minerall spirites, by the cunning and labour of those whom the common sort at this day cal Chymists or Alchimists: by and by on the contrarie part they crie out that those colliar phisitions can do no good but kil al men that put themselues into their hands with their venemous medicines, so that they ought to bee driuen out of the commonwealth, and that they are deceiuers, and that their extractions and preparations, their subtile and thinne spirit wil profit nothing, and that the spirit of Vitriol is poison, the essence of Antimonie and Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is nothing, the extraction of Sulphur is nothing worth, neither the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of gold: and to be briefe, that al things are contrarie to the nature of man, and more to be auoided then the eies of a basiliske. And yet they in the meane time like cunning and crastie theeues priuily, and with fair promises picke out from the poore Chymists the secrets of Phisicke, and secretly learne those things that they forbid the common people as poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, afterwardes challenging them for their owne practises. And by this wicked iniury they deriue vnto themselues the fauour, friendship, praise, gifts and rewardes of men, which by good right are altogether due vnto those that by their labour, sweat, watching, and diligent search in natural things by Vulcans arte haue found out such things, and published them for the common commoditie of man. And yet not contented therewith, they also publish great volumes filled with toyes, lies, &amp; sophistications; going about as much as in them is, to suppresse, ouerthrowe, and vtterly to extinguish the light with darkenesse, and the trueth with lies, &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise (the most plaine and manifest workemistresse established euen by trueth it selfe) with a vaine fained theoricke, deuised by their owne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile braine. I say to thee (thou notable Doctor, that so backebitest <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus)</hi> how canst thou by any meanes with thy trifling wordes deface the worke it selfe, or with thy theoricke refell the practise? Art thou so great a doctour and knowest not, that thou hast profited so much, as by thy worke thou canst bring aught to effect? <hi>Paracelsus</hi> teacheth that the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sickenesse is to be cured with the spirit of Vitrioll, and performed it, and the worke it selfe declares it daily: prooue thou the contrarie, and cure the same disease with thy pilles, sirropes, and electuaries, then shalt thou haue the victorie. It is not sufficient for thee by bringing thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to proue that metalline medicines are not agreeing for mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither that metals may be so prepared that they may heale. Why? Thou deniest that which indeede is performed, and openly seene with eies. It is a foule thing to be ignorant in that that euery man knoweth. For out of all doubt you haue all heard, that most daungerous diseases haue bin cured with metaline tinctures, yea, with such as haue not been rightly prepared by counterfeit Paracelsians, as with <hi>Vitrum Antimonij,</hi> which doth plucke vp sodainely at once by the rootes the impurities of the feuer, although not without great weakening of the powers, yet it healeth: And yet we alow not such perillous cures. And so likewise of others. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 span">

      </gap> Mineralles worke this, not being rightly prepared,

what thinke you will they doe being rightly prepared and purged from their venome and poison?</p>
   <p>And how can you with a safe conscience reiect those things whereof you haue no knowledge? It is not sufficient to affirme an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e thing except it be confirmed by probable and grounded reasons. Euerie man will play the Censor of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> whom it is more easie to reprehend, then to follow. And whilest euerie man desireth to seeme, or to be thought more learned then other, no man wil learne of another. I say euery Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelsian which doth but onely carry coales vnto the worke, can shewe you by eie three principles of <hi>Theophrastus</hi> physicke. Haue you tasted the most sharp salt? or the most sweete o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ke doeth consist, by no meanes can be found out, neither what force they haue or fellowship with mans nature, but only by fire, for as fire did first shew that the smoake of Mercurie was poison to mans nature without an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e subtile speculation, but thou didst neuer handle coales, neither canst draw any so smal a baulme out of the Vegetals therfore being ignorant in metalline physicke, thou canst not so much as once ghesse what it is▪ and therefore doest iudge of things vnknowen, as the blinde man doeth of colours. Is it not a great folli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> to write against a thing, and not to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it wel before? Such as are addicted to <hi>Paracelsus</hi> doctrine, when they perceiue you haue no stronger weapons then those you haue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto gathered, they will conclude that you rather confirme and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish <hi>Paracelsus</hi> physicke, then confute it. It is not enough to say a thing is false, except there be morè probable and better shewed. Hereby it appeareth that ye nourish a secret ignorance of naturall things in your selues.</p>
   <p>What, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> you those great physitions and excellent philosophers? How commeth it then to passe that the force of drugs are hidden and vnknowen vnto you? Do you not in this point come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

Hovve vaine is this reasonable phisitian, which prepareth his medicines with reason and not with the hand? He is the very phisitian that with his own hand purgeth his medicines from their venome, and being so prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with sharpe iudgement doth applie them to their proper diseases, that the seede of the disease may be pulled vp by the rootes, and so must the speculation and practise, reason and the worke concurre and ioyne together, because iudgement without practise is barren. Tell me, hovve commeth it to passe that mercurie healeth the French pox and the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie scabbe?

And there I vnderstoode that Kinges and Princes were deceiued by vnskilfull practisers, which did vtter and sell their sophisticate Chymicall artes, which they had begged and scratched together out of all corners, with a pompous shew deceiuing the princes of their money, whereby it commeth to passe, that dailie a great number of sophisters, and sophisticators doe daily rise and spring vp, through which, not onely the most commendable art of Alchymie receiueth great detriment, is oppressed, and adulterate, and the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistes themselues made hatefull vnto all men, consuming their life, time, and goodes vpon vaine workes and practises: but also there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth most great hurt and domage vnto the common wealth. For there are many deceiuers so craftie, that with a dissembled experience in the Chymicall arte, and with fained friendship and great promises they doe craftily learne of others their cunning, which they challenge for their owne, esteeme of great value, and carry them about to bee solde. As vpon a time certaine knaues by craft gote from mee certaine written bookes, and solde them for a great summe of money. Common wealths and the Chymicall art should be very well prouided for, if that such knaues might bee punished and restrained by the magistrate, so should the studious of the Arte be lesse deceiued, and in short space the true and pure Arte would appeare from those shadowes and sophistica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Wherefore to the ende that such as be desirous of the Arte may haue some pledge from mee, wherewith they may make this science more plaine, I will shortly (God willing) set foorth three bookes of the philosophers stone, written by diuers Authours, whereof the first was drawen out of certaine characters by a noble Brytaine, wherein all the darke speeches of the philosophers are most plainly expounded, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I will annex two hundred certaine infallible and true philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call rules, whereby those that doe erre and doubt touching the matter of the stone, shall be confirmed. The second booke <hi>is, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

   <p>And because that all nations, specially the Germanes, haue written

      </gap>te of many preparations and speciall medicines tried by me, and others, also of diuerse elyxirs of the philosophers, extractions of mercuries and mercuriall waters, of many and diuerse dissolutions, I will also adde the interpretations of sundry Characters wherewith the bookes both of the olde and newe writers are written to couer and hide the Art. Also the exposition of a certaine Alphabet, without the which the worke can hardely be vnderstoode. And two treatises, the one of the vertues of the vegetall and minerall oiles, the other of the saltes and properties of many vegetals and minerals: whereunto I will also ioyne two treatises of philosophicall mines, and of making of vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the which my labour and studie, if I see it acceptable vnto those that are studious of that Art, I wil shortly set forth greater things, which many with their whole heartes doe wish and desire. In the meane time, take in good part this little worke. That which wee haue hitherto spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is spoken onely vnto those that doe so deadly hate the Chymicall physicke, which thinke nothing can be well or profitably taught in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke that the olde harpe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

As though that nature were not more then <hi>Galen,</hi> or that all the learning of Physicke were to be drawne from the heathen, or that they alone had published the art, and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed it with such sound arguments. Why do you not out of those authors confute those excellent men which are folowers of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> amongst whom that great Doctor <hi>Petrus Seueri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

Why do you not aunswere to the monarchie of the Trinitie of that learned doctor and Phisition <hi>Gerard Dorne?</hi> Why doe you not confute the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of that famous Phisition <hi>Turnesser,</hi> beeing confirmed with the truth of practise. But for your sakes which daily cal <hi>Galens</hi> doctrine vnto examination, and with exact iudgement do consider of it, giuing place vnto <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> acknowledging and exercising his preparations and practise, I doe reioyce, and shortly more shall come out against the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, which shall bite them better.
