   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Lato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the profoundest of
their times, thought the best educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to bee defectiue, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in Musicke, and <hi>Cicero</hi> reporteth,
that although <hi>Themistocles</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with many graces, yet was hee
the lesse esteemed, being ignorant
thereof, and such regard hath all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
had thereto that wee not onely find them to loue, but
practise it, for amongst the rest, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> recordeth
that S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> Bishoppe of <hi>Millan,</hi> who ouerwatcht the
Church, (then vnder persecution of the <hi>Arrians</hi>) intertainde
<pb facs="3"/>
the time with songes and Musicke, and though the death of
<hi>Nero,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Tacit.</note> was exceeding ioyfull to the people, yet was it much
lamented, that his excellency in Musicke, should perish with
him: which when I consider (Right Honorable) together
with the worthy approbation you haue giuen to many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of the same. I am not onely encouraged, still to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
but willingly to publish these songes, (as the badges of
my affection) to all posterity: And for, because those things
are most embraced; which men find approued, by the voice
of greatnesse, I therefore, ambitiously thought it best, to
single out your Honor, being best able to protect them, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
assuring my selfe, that your spirites, (which are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
with many cares) may a little bee delighted in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of these songes, which if they may attaine, I your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
humble votarie, shall be highly fortunate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the rather perswaded to liue and die,</p>
