      <hi>TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY Prince CHARLES, by the grace</hi> of God, King of great Brittaine, <hi>France and Ireland, Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Faith, &amp;c.</hi> ({inverted ⁂})</head>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Ebt is a thing which hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised the minds of most men in all ages, but the pennes of verie fewe in this kind wherein I han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle it. The Ciuilians I know tell vs what it is, and determine the cases in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to their facultie worthily and
<pb facs="3"/> skilfully; but to shew how Debt not duly and seasonably paid, falles heauy vpon a mans outward estate, yea, and reflecteth bitterly, sometimes vpon the conscience, this few or none (that I know) haue hitherto vndertaken. And yet we see not any thing more frequent in experience, then the dismall effects, which Debt produceth in the life of man: some it pierceth with perpetuall cares, some it impouerisheth, som it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoneth, some it banisheth, to some it cleaueth, and to their seede for euer, like the leprosy of <hi>Naaman,</hi> to <hi>Geha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie,</hi> till they he consumed vtterly. It stayeth not heare but in some cases; it staineth and polluteth mens consciences. The wages of the hireling, the portion of the Labourer in the Lords haruest, the patrimonie of the fatherles, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes right, kept backe by force or
<pb facs="3"/> fraud, are due Debt: the cries whereof as they are entred into the eares of the Lord, so can they not chuse but pierce the consciences of the vniust detainers of them vnless they be seared or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise sealed vp by some iust iudgement of God leauing them to their wilfulnesse and obduration.</p>
   <p>The ordinary silence of Ministers in this argument may make men thinke, perhaps, that we iustify, either the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of those who willingly continue in the bonds of Debt, or the sinfulnesse of those who pay them not at all. The sinnes of the times and the vices of the seuerall ages of the world haue beene imputed, for the most part, to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Ministers of those ages and times, who by holding their tongues haue seemed to consent thereunto: though it may bee they mourned for
<pb facs="4"/> them in secret. This hath made me wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to say somewhat in this thing, to free myselfe and others, whom it doth concerne, from the censure of poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for seeming by silence to giue way to that which clogges a Christian life otherwise comfortable, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable troubles and molestations; and to draw on others, who are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to giue their counsaile and directions for the preuenting or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of this miserie of Debt which hath wasted the state, and perplexed the soules of manie thousands in the world.</p>
   <p>This Treatise I haue desired not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your Gracious permission to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto your Maiesty, as the ablest instrument of God, by iustice to reforme the vnrighteous dealing of such as will not pay their Debts, and by Law to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
<pb facs="4"/> the grieuous exactions of vsuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lenders, and by mercy to relieue the misery of such as in the businesse of Debt are not willing doers, but vnwilling suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers: such I meane as either by the hardnesse of mens hearts are constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at their need, to borrow vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to them intollerable, or as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get their owne though neuer so due, without spending more then the thing is worth, in trying a doubtfull issue for an vndoubted right, which is the case of almost all the inferior Ministers of the Kingdome, who cannot without such cost as they are not able to beare, recouer their due, if a couetous or craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or wilfull opposite will denie it. It might possibly haue seemed fitter for one of my coate to haue handled some matter of Faith, or tending to mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or some controuersy of the times,
<pb facs="5"/> these I know are more properly perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to my calling, had not other men of better gifts done them abundantly with good successe and approbation; but this argument of debt as a barren soyle, hath lyen vntilled like a desolate wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse: no man regarding to reduce that into order, which hath disordered and put out of frame the thoughts and actions of the wisest men in the world. In managing wherof if I haue done the office of a faithfull Minister, let mee passe vnder the protection of your Gracious countenance; if in any thing I haue failed (as easily a man may doe) I humbly craue pardon, but no protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Pardon alone will serue his turne, who will throw the first stone at his owne error when he sees it.</p>
   <p>In an argument of this nature its ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier to speake pertinent things to men of
<pb facs="5"/> lowe degree, then to Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates; the state of Kings is aboue pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate capacities, and reasons of State beyond common rules, yet my hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and prayer to God shall be that the cares of your Kingdoms (impossible to be gouerned without a most excellent spirit in your Maiesty, and speciall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine assistance from God) may not bee aggrauated with the snares of Debt. Debt is a burden to a free spirited man, bee hee otherwise neuer so well able to beare it.</p>
   <p>And though it stand with the power and magnificence of great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces freely and daily to grant iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, and bee also a more blessed thing to giue then to receiue, yet ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily it is counted a more necessary, iust, and conscionable act to pay Debts, then to giue gifts: If the one at any
<pb facs="6"/> time but preiudice to the other; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in them both, goodnesse and greatnesse, worke together: yet the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of gifts is more properly a fruit of power and greatnesse, payment of Debts an act of goodnesse, and true goodnesse will then stand in greatest perfection, when all earthly greatnesse will bee laid in the dust.</p>
   <p>The Lord of heauen blesse your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty with a religious, aprosperous and long Raigne ouer vs, and make you as supreminent in goodnesse, as you are glorious in greatnesse; that you may not onely long inioy these earthly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, but a Crowne of Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, a farre most excellent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding weight of Celestiall glory, by the onely merit of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> to whose blessing and grace I shall as humble
<pb facs="6"/> duty bindes mee, commend you while I liue in my truest Affections, and heartiest Prayers.</p>
