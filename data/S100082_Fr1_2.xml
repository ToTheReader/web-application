It is in vaine; for hee is harder to be found then the parents of Popes were in the old times: yet if thou haue an itch of gessing, receiue from me so much, as a friend of his, to whom he sent his booke to bee read, writ to me. <q>The Author was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to haue this booke published, thinking it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit both for the matter,
<pb facs="4"/>
which in it selfe is weighty and serious, and for that grauity which himselfe had proposed and obser ued in an other booke for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly published, to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to this kinde of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. But I on the other side, mustred my forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and produced reasons and examples. I proposed to him the great <hi>Erasmus</hi> (whom though <note place="margin">In Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

         <hi>Seribanius</hi> the <hi>Iesuit</hi> cal him <hi>one of our Preachers.</hi>) yet their great <hi>Coccius</hi> is well content to number him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his Authors. And to his bitter iestings and skirmishings in this kinde, our enemies confesse, that
<pb facs="4"/>
our Church is as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden, as to <hi>Luther</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, who fought so vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly in the maine battell. I remembred him also how familiar a fashion this was amongst the <hi>Papists</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; and how much <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullus</hi> that <hi>Run-away,</hi> had done in this kinde, as well in those bookes, which he cals <hi>Salmonees,</hi> as in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he entitles, <hi>The Cabal of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> of which booke, if he were not the Author, hee was certainly the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist,</hi> and defender. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was that man, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hee bee, which cals himselfe <hi>Macer,</hi> inferiour
<pb facs="5"/>
to <hi>Reboul</hi> in this kinde, when hee dedicated to <hi>Laughter,</hi> &amp; to <hi>Pleasure,</hi> his disputation of that horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Excommunication of <hi>Paulus 5.</hi> against the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and of other matters concerning the saluation of soules. Both which, not contenting themselues, as this Author doth, to sport and obey their naturall disposition in a businesse (if you consider the persons) light inough (for what can bee vainer then a <hi>Iesuit?</hi>) haue saucily risen vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Princes,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Lords Anointed</hi> I added moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that the things deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this booke, were by

many degrees more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, then those which themselues, in their owne ciuill warres, do daily vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit forth, when they but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher and mangle the fame and reputation of their <hi>Popes</hi> &amp; <hi>Cardinals</hi> by their reuiued <hi>Lucian, Pasquil.</hi> At last he yeelded, &amp; made mee owner of his booke, which I send to you to be deliuered ouer to forraine nations, <note n="a" place="margin">Proculum &amp;</note> farre from the father: and (as his desire is) <note n="b" place="margin">posthum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="6"/>
of all parts. This Booke must teach what humane infirmity is, and how hard a matter it is for a man much conuersant in the bookes and Acts of <hi>Iesuites,</hi> so throughly to cast off the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> as that he contract nothing of their naturall drosles, which are <hi>Petulaucy,</hi> and <hi>Lightnesse.</hi> Vale.</q>
