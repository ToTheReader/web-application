   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or to you also
(though of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
sexe) this
booke belongs,
to whom the sacred subject of
it brought the same eternall
benefit, shee did to her owne
kinde. Neither doth she one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
require your Gratitude, but
your Imitation, whose mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
perfection farre excels all
<pb facs="14"/>
your so long vanted masculine
merits. I doubt not but by the
more, and lesse knowing of
you, I shall be diversly judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The first will argue mee of
indiscretion in that I chose not
a Matter of a higher nature
whereby to make a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of my sufficiency. To
these I shape this answer, that
my Invention could not soare
higher, for whether wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
her person, or her divine
Gifts, shee is in Dignity next
God himselfe. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of so sublime a straine as
Vertue, which enters Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb facs="14"/>
when Subtility and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
are justly excluded▪ It
is vertue must save us; for in
knowledge the Divell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
farre exceeds us. There is
no Argument, as I take it, so
important, or concernes us so
much as that of our salvation.
These men would have mee
busie my selfe in the Physicks,
to finde out of what, not
wherefore I am made: Or in
the Mathematickes, to learne
how farre it is to Heaven, not
how to come thither: Or in
Divinity, to bee inquisitive
whether or no Christs mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
<pb facs="15"/>
feeding of so many, was
by augmentation, or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the Loaves and
Fishes: Whether or no they
who were born with sight, &amp;
afterwards lost it, being resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to it againe by Christ, saw
better after the Cure, than
they did before their blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
And whether or no the
Dead, who rose with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
ascended with him, or
were againe reduc't to dust.
To these needlesse accute fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
I aspire not. How many
are there now in Hell, who
while they liv'd here, were
<pb facs="15"/>
esteem'd the Organs of the
Sciences, the Temples of
VVisedome, nay Oracles, as
if they had beene form'd in
Heaven, and sent downe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
full fraught with Gods
owne secrets, yet now detest
their former vaine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as much as the Darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
they lived in? But in this
kingdome of Woe and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
none of vertues subiects
ever resided. Let them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
censure on, they shall not
so much as shake my security;
for I know it fares with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
Learning, as with the
<pb facs="16"/>
Vniverse, wherein there are
more Delinquents then Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
The opinions of these I
can well tollerate, because they
proceed from Science, though
erronious. But there are some
whom I have heard to passe
their casting verdicts on the
most meriting Authors, who
deserve themselves to bee
hang'd for so often violating
their owne mother tongue,
did not their ignorance pleade
their pardon. Let these poore
wretched things, who what
they heare in the last compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
vent for their owne in the
<pb facs="16"/>
next, share amongst them my
scorne, and pitty, as being far
below my anger. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that he who feares the
pale meager Family of the
Zoili, must onely write to his
owne <hi>Lar.</hi> If to the truely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
the truely understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
I can approve these my
humble indeavours, and draw
any one soule, but one degree
nearer to goodnesse, my holy
ambition, and my no small la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
shall receive an ample
satisfaction.</p>
   <p>It now remaines that as to
these latter, I seeke to approve
<pb facs="17"/>
all my actions, so to them I
likewise essay to iustifie this
present worke. I am the first
(to my knowledge) who hath
written in our vulgar tongue
on this our blessed Virgin,
drawne thereto I confesse by
the strength rather of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than of ability. Yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
I professe that I am her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer,
not her Idolater, and
that I no way allow of their
profane custome, who robbe
God of his Honour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
it on her. But this I will
say, that though I impute not
the late troubles and afflictions
<pb facs="17"/>
of the Protestant party in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
to the small reverence
there paid her (many of Gods
iudgements according to
Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> being secret, none
uniust) yet truely I beleeve
that the undervaluing of one
so great, and deere in Christs
esteeme, cannot but bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
to him, and that the
more we ascribe to her (set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Invocation apart) the
more gratious we appeare in
his fight. I have beene as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
in the penning of this
Treatise, as possibly I could,
and (in imitation) of Vertues
<pb facs="18"/>
owne selfe) have kept the
meane. But all pretenders to
Divinity know, that without
the helpe of Ecclesiasticall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
we can speake little of
her life, or death, so sparing is
the holy Writ in the mention
of her. The scholasticall and
Ecclesiastical Writers inserted
in this Booke to trust, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
too much, is alike erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and therefore I referre all
to the discretiō of the Reader.
I will onely adde this; that
since the finishing of this sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
I have read a booke of the
now Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
<pb facs="18"/>
      <hi>Apparatus, &amp;c.</hi> and
am glad to finde that I have
not digressed from him in any
one particular. I conclude
with this protestation, that if
I have swerved in any the least
point from the tenents recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the English Church, I
shall bee most ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
my selfe a true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent. Farewell.</p>
