   <p>Your case, as it is most miserable, so it is most compassionable, for it seemethe, you in harte desire to serue god, &amp; yet this desyre is ouerweyed, with the desyre to enioy the worlde. Your case I said was moste miserable, because exiling oute of the Churche, you are like the straying shepe erringe in the desert mountaines, exposed to the pray of all rauening wolfes. You haue no weapons to defend your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, depryued of the sacraments, spoy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led of the communion of Sainctes, the incessant prayers &amp; Sacrifice of Christs faithfull flock. Alas what will befall you? either the wylde &amp; sauage beasts wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>l deuoure you, or for lack of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall foode, you shall dye in those vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frutefull soyles. What can the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes Churches afforde you? Ah infected sermons, corrupted with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies. What prayers? Alas, howe will god heare them who will not here him? The Communion, o poysoned
<pb facs="25"/> cupp, better it weare for you to eate so much ratsbane, then that polluted breade, &amp; to drinke so much dragons gall, or vypers blood, then that sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious wyne. Noe doubte, but after that breade, entreth in Sathan, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that cuppe, some of the infernall crew. This you know &amp; in youre har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted confesse, &amp; therfore your sinne is questionles the greater. You fauoure Catholicks and in what you can, doe them good. <hi>Ah, quid prodest homini, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

   </p>
   <p>For what dothe it profitt a man if he gaine the whole worlde, and susteine the damage of his soule? What will it auayle you at the day of Iudgment, to haue fauored Catholicks, when you shall be condemned youre selues for half heritikes? What good Catholick is theare in england, that woulde not loose with all his harte, your tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fauours, for your spirituall good, &amp; wishethe not rather that you wear fauored of God, then gracious before men? If all the fauoures, riches, and
<pb facs="26"/> sures of the worlde, weare summed in one mannes dominion, yet who doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth but that it weare better to receiue once deuoutly the blessed Sacrament, then to possesse them all. Therfore you may see what detriment your soule sufferethe, for the smale fauoures you minister vnto Catholickes. Ah feare not that they shall be destitute either of spirituall graces or tēporall fauours.</p>
   <p>Cast your eyes vpon Goddes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, &amp; you shall see him tendering them, as the christall humoure of his eye. Abandon for Christe Iesus sake their excernall conuersation in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whose company internally you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teste. For in very deede moste of the protestants hate you, the catholickes mislyke you, the deuils laugh at you, &amp; <note place="margin">Apoc. 3 Eccle. 4</note> god doth vomit you owt of his mouth. Woe be to that man that goeth with two hartes, that walkethe two wayes, that intendeth to serue bothe God &amp; <note place="margin">Mat. 6</note> the deuill, to be Christes disciple, &amp; a fauoryte of the worlde.</p>
   <p>I wonder howe the verye hell you feele in your soules, the horrible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="26"/> of youre consciences, enforcethe you not to leaue that hellish Sinagog?</p>
   <p>In good sooth if euer you enter into your selues, &amp; consider your presente state in what perills &amp; laborinthes you haue caste your selues into: I meruel you either congeale not with feare, or pyne not away with melancholy, or your hartes burst not with desperation.</p>
   <p>For in your owne conscience, you lyue in continuall, horrible, &amp; sclan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous sinne. The houre of your death is euer imminent, the seuere Iudgmēt of God, you are assured you shall not escape, the eternall paines of hell you are certaine expecte you: &amp; yet can you lyue merily, laugh, &amp; passe youre tyme careleslye? This sinne of youres I take to be a sinne against the holy Ghost, and a fynall impenitency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e hartes you haue deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, so longe as this rigour of lawes &amp; punishment of Catholickes indureth you will perseuer in your accustomed irreligious profession of protestancy, from which, I say no more, but Christ Iesus deliuer you, for whose reclaime
<pb facs="27"/> I will not cease to pray.</p>
