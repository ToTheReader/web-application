   <head>The Epistle to the courteous Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now sixe yeeres passed (courteous and gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) since importuned by the earnest requestes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers my especiall friendes, (more presuming on that they conceiued to be in me than of the veritie it selfe, that thereunto might induce me.) I tooke vppon mee in satisfaction of their great importunitie, roughlie to laie out a platforme or Methode, for the inditing and framing of all maner of Epistles and Letters, insomuch as for the confirmation of the necessitie of the worke, &amp; the matter of their demaund, they had then shewed me manie like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoods and reasons, howe much the same might profite, and how well of diuers fortes of people the trauaile might be accepted.</p>
   <p>The worke beeing then superficiallie begun, without additiō either of any regard or industrie to the performance therof (my self hauing grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter desire to learne of others, then to become a speciall eye-marke to be noted of all others) as times and seasons altered, so the fancie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit therof in me quicklie changed, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of other exercises for the present more auailable, made me to forget, what therein I had before time promised, whereby the deuise lay dead, and as matter of noe account was euer
<pb facs="5"/>
sithence turned in obliuion.</p>
   <p>Neuerthelesse about one moneth afore Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas last, the vacation hauing been long, &amp; little to doe, I ransacking diuers bundels of olde papers, among the rest found out this formost &amp; for worne beginning, and the Printer as then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, and perusing what it was, told me also his opiniō of the matter, &amp; that he deemed the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile thereof to be more then thanks-worthie, &amp; therewithall assured me would approue verie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, whereupon his desire &amp; perswasion was (as one greatlie affecting the benefite of his coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie) that I would proceed on so good a ground, and so roundlie went the progression of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments forwarde, that it was at length conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; I faithfullie promised, to finish some part thereof to bee published in this instant terme.</p>
   <p>But considering afterwards of the labour, and well perusing what before time I hadde therein done, the order therof so far misliked me, as that I altogether resolued to alter the forme thereby cōtinued, &amp; by such resolution enforced my self to begin anew, by occasion of which, the latter grew greater then before, and I was compelled by my faithfull worde and promise now to finish vp that in hast, which before I coulde not frame my selfe to compasse, vpon long continued ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Manie no doubt shal you find the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions herein, which aswel my self by ouer-great hast (not hauing so well as I might and would, if leisure had serued me) perfectly perused the same
<pb facs="6"/>
haue happily omitted by lack of foresight, in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Printer a work, wherby I was (I protest) forced as fast as I could to scrible out the coppy, and to deliuer it to presse, least therby he should be compelled to stay and hinder his worke: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by like default of ouer speedie dispatch in the Printer, therby misplacing diuers figures quoted in the magent, where they are either mistaken, or sometimes not vsed in those places at all. In oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence whereof I desire the learned Reader, as he shall find to correct, and the other vsers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to beare withal, promising that in the next set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting foorth, the same with better regard shall bee considered, and God sparing life with more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection deliuered, the residue of the faults being not manie are in the page after this placed down and corrected.</p>
   <p>And nowe touching the order of this booke folowing, I must aduertise him that is desirous to take profite thereby, that he first do circumspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie consider with himself, the seuerall rules in the particuler chapters, preceeding the orders of these EPISTLES, in such sort as afterwardes they are distinguished, and therin see, what to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordering and principall direction, of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he shall take in hand to write, is therfore for his better instruction enioined.</p>
   <p>Next also by diligent animaduersion therof, hee shall the better vnderstande the seuerall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and properties, that in the partes of euerie EPISTLE, are ordinarily to bee required, besides
<pb facs="6"/>
the vse of them in their seuerall places, and what force they bear, being so sorted out, according to their speciall purposes and directions.</p>
   <p>Next for the better inducement &amp; leading the learner into a plaine &amp; perfect platforme of this METHODE following, and to the intent hee may as neere as may be, or as his capacitie at leastwise may any wayes reach vnto, know skilfullie &amp; not by rote, how or in what sort he shal happen to do either well or ill, I haue first (in a preamble or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed discourse, either proceeding or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably passing, before or with the kindes of the sūdry exāples of euery EPISTLE) declared the properties &amp; vse of those EPISTLES, vpon what parts and places, they and euery of them do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, with what vehemencie or lesse application they are to be inferred or quallified, so that hee who seemeth to haue lesse knowledge at al (be it that he haue perseuerāce to cōceiue or to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the parts he seeth there laid out before his eies) may with great facilitie, and without anie shewe of difficulcie at all, attaine to whatsoeuer, herein prescribed, or by the circumstance therof intended to be in any sort deliuered.</p>
   <p>To the greater ornament whereof, I haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed such FIGVRES, SCHEMES, and TROPES in the margent of euerie EPISTLE, euen with the places where they are vsed. And at the finishing vp of this worke, haue determined in the ende therof (which in the next terme shal as a second part hereunto by gods grace be published) to set
<pb facs="7"/>
them altogeather, and there to explane to the Learners view and for his readier vse, their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular natures and qualities, that they who (being vnlearned, and hauing a pretie conceit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them selues) haue heeretofore vnknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done well, may see howe with skill and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion hereafter to pursue the same, and the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant also hereof, whose reach hath not byn so ample as others, may be thereby informed what vnto well doing is most consonant &amp; agreeing.</p>
   <p>Now for the readier finding of those EPISTLES as each of their kindes are suted forth in sundrie EXAMPLES: Peruse but the head of euerie page, and vnder the title of the booke, you shall finde what in the same Page is cōtained, viz. Wher the EPISTLES be, you shal haue them noted in their kindes, as Epistles HORTATORIE, DEHORTATO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIE, SVVASORIE or DISSVVASORIE, &amp;c. &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the admixtions, you shall finde, PLACES or PARTS HORTATORIE, COMMENDATORIE, PETITORIE, &amp;c. as they fall out to bee hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
   <p>This booke shewing these partes before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, I haue termed by the name of THE ENGLISH SECRETORIE, being in the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof nothing ignorant what great perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to bee required in suche a one, by whose title the same is christened, neither supposing the matter heerein contained to appeare so su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficient, as perfectly therby to enable what in the same function is to be required, but because the
<pb facs="7"/>
orderlie writing of Letters, being a principal part belonging to a SECRETORIE, is by the ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THODE heereof deliuered to any Learners capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, whereout the scholler or anie other that is vnfurnished of the knowledge thereof, may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ayde and furtheraunce, the better by suche means thereafter (if his industry serue therunto) to become a SECRETORIE.</p>
   <p>And for so much as this, beeing but the first part thereof, is also the first worke in shew that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I deliuered, I determined as vntimelie fruite by occasion of the hastie gatheryng of the same, to put it foorth in common tast, the rather to be satisfied what liking it carrieth. The relesse wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of beyng of the discrete and skilful sort allowed, to furnish a place in any one corner of their ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet: The other part heerefater shall I trust with better liking return, in the after publishing, &amp; to the followers thereof, ryght pleasing and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
   <p>Heerein (ouer and besides the Chapters gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng instruction as aforesaide to the METHODE of these Letters) is only two kinds of EPISTLES wyth their seuerall partes particularly handeled, that is to say, DEMONSTRATIVE &amp; DELIBERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVE. The second part shall containe IVDICIAL and FAMILIAR LETTERS, and at the end of the same, the descriptiōs of the FIGVRES, SCHEMES and TROPES, as before I haue noted, and lastlie thereunto annexed a Discours of the partes and office of a SECRETORIE, all which Godwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

Presenting in the meane time what here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in set downe to the generall and friendlie regard of all men, beseeching that in courtesie they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of my trauels, as formost of all other things I therein respected a pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
