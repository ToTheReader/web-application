   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O great always</hi> hathe Gods louyng kyndenesse and care bin ouer his beloued Church: that besides the vvashing and clē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng thereof in the fountaine of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, thorough the most precious bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed of his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and deare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued sonne, and the reconciling of vs too him selfe by his death, vvhen vve vvere yet his vtter enimies and the children of endlesse vvrathe and damnation by oure naturall birthe from our firste father Adam: hee hath not only giuen vs the spirite of adoption, vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by vve assuredly feele, and freely and boldly protest him too bee oure Father: but also clothed vs vvith Christes rightuousnesse, vvherthrough vve rising vp to nevvnesse and holines of life, do get the vpper hande
<pb facs="3"/> of sinne, death and Satan, by mortifying the old Adam vvith the lusts and likings therof through liuely faith, driuen avvay the mist of ignorance and misbeleef from our mindes by the lyght of his gracious Gospell, that vve myght vvalke vvithout stumbling as in the open daylight: and finally taughte vs all thyngs necessarie as vvell to the atteynment of the immortalitie to come, as to the leading of a godlie, quiet and happie lyfe heere, by exercising the dueties of mutuall loue and charitie among our selues: but also (lest any thing might vvant to the strengthning and incouraging of vs to goe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and to hold out cōstantly to the end of our race) hath armed vs ageinst all temptations, hart bytings and stumblingblocks, by vvarning vs aforehād vvhat thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges should happen to his Churche from tyme to tyme too the ende of the vvorlde, vvhat revvardes are layd vp in heauen for the godly, and vvhat punishementes shall finally fall vppon the vvicked. For he knovving both the vvilinesse of the olde serpent raging and ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping lyke a hungerstaruen Lyon disappoynted of his pray, and the spitefull malice of the vvorld vvhiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sette altogither vppon naughtinesse fyghteth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually vvith tooth and nayle ageinst the truth and the professers therof: and thervnto hovv fraile and vveake vvee be of ourselues, insomuch that although there be a vvillingnesse in vs to persist in his seruice through the vvorking of his holie spirite, yet vve fynde no povver and abilitie to performe that desire, furtherfoorth than vve be vphilde and maynteyned by his mightie hande from aboue: He (I say) knovving all these things vvel ynough, hath alvvayes like a most prouident houshol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="3"/> and foreseeing vvatcheman, foretold his seruaunts of the inconueniences to come, that they mighte not be so astonished or amazed vvith the suddaynnesse or gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uousnesse of them, as to quayle or shrinke at any perill, persecution, or misfortune, but alvvays comfort them selues vvith the certaintie of Gods prouidence and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his helpe. This did he vvhen he told Abraham that his seede shoulde be a soiourner in a strange lande, vvhere they should be brought in bondage, and misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated. 400. yeares. This didde hee vvhen hee tolde the people of Iuda and Ierusalem that they shoulde bee caried avvaye too Babylon, and there serue the Chaldeis. 70. yeares. This did he vvhen by the mouth of his chozen vessell Saint Paule he tolde the ministers and elders of the Churche of Ephesus that greeuous vvolues and speakers of levvde things should rise vp, vvhiche should not spare the flocke. Finally, this hath he done through all ages and all times bothe vnder the lavve and vnder the Gospell, as vvell in the olde Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament as in the nevve: and specially in this presente Reuelation to his holie seruant Saincte Iohn, vvhiche according to the name thereof, conteyneth a mysticall discouerie of the vvholestate of the Church, from the first setting foorth ad preaching of the Gospell, euen vnto the ende of the vvorlde. VVhiche thing surely is so muche the more needefull, bicause that mannes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grovving dayly more and more into decay vvith the perishing vvorlde novve hasting too his ende, is more subiecte too corruption, and lesse gyuen too Godlynesse and vertue than euer it vvas: and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell perceyuing his kingdome vppon earth to dravve
<pb facs="4"/> apace too vtter ruine, laboureth the more earnestly to vvorke all the spight and mischief he can to Christ and his members. And therefore Christe oure Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, high Priest and King, being not ignorant of the perillousnesse of these latter days, vvherin the fury of Antichryst shoulde rage farre extremelyer than euer it had doone since the first creation of things: not onely forevvarneth, but also armeth vs in this booke, that vve mighte haue continuall comforte and patience by his Scriptures. Novv although the Commentaries of that learned and godlie father doctour Bullinger opening and expounding these mysticall reuelations, haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore bin translated, and be alredy stil extant in our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish tung: in respect vvherof it might seeme that this labor of myne might the better haue bin spared in that behalf: yetnotvvithstanding forasmuch as Gods spirit the fountaine of all knovvledge and vnderstanding, sheadeth himself into vvhome hee vvill, and in vvhat maner and measure he vvill, and vseth the sundrie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of mens vvittes diuersly too the furtherance of Chrystes kingdome, and the aduancement of Gods glorie: I doubt not but that this vvorke vvill be found to be both profitable and necessarie, to such as reade it vvith a christianly mynde of beeing edifyed to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and not vvith a curious fansie of seeking straunge and vncouth things. For the vvord of God serueth too feede mens soules vnto eternall lyfe, and not to delight their eares vvith transitorie pleasantnesse. And maister Marlorat that peinful labourer in Gods vineyard, vvho in the end sealed vp the testimony of Iesus Christ vvith the expence of his ovvne bloud, hath briefly conueyed
<pb facs="4"/> into this his vvorke, the vvhole substaunce of matter, vvhich all the late vvriters of our times haue set dovvn in vvriting for the better opening of this present Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And vvhere as hee to auoyde tediousnesse, and to bring his booke into the lesse rome, had referred the reader to other places of his former expositions vppon other partes of the Scripture: I to ease the reader of his labour in seeking them vvhere they be translated, and to supply his vvant of them vvhere they be not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated, haue sought oute those places, &amp; from thence conueyed bothe his matter and vvordes into this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, and set them in their proper roomes, as largely or briefly as the presente purpose seemed to require, Novve therefore it may please your honour of youre accustomed goodnesse tovvardes mee, or rather of youre loue to the setting foorthe of Gods glorie (vvhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is vvell knovvne to be moste earnest and vnfained) too accept this trauell of myne, vvhich being dedicated to your name, is set foorth to the stablishment of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes kingdom and common vvealth in this realme; and to the speciall comforte of suche as are vnder the crosse, and fynde not any succour or reliefe at the handes of men. Finished at my lodging in London the last day of August. 1574.</p>
