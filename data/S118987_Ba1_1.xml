Therefore to preuent this euill, I haue rather laboured to tell them what they should be, then to lay open what they are, for loue hopeth the best, till it see the worst. And this I assure both thee &amp; them, that no man euer was more forward and strict in outward obseruations, nor more ready to contend about the forme and manner of religious exercises, and carnall washings, and all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Kingdome, then the very hippocrite, that neuer intended the purging of his heart, nor yet to partake in her peculiar things, though vnder the cloake of the one, he doth pretend the greatest part in the other. Make cleane then the inside first, and the out-side shall bee cleane; for whosoeuer is cleansed in heart, neede not bee taught to wash his hands.</p>
