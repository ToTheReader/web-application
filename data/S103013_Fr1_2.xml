      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ereafter foloweth a booke called in
Latin <hi>Imitatio Christi,</hi> that is in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe,
the folowing of Christe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
be cōteyned foure litle bookes.
VVhich booke, as some men affirme,
was firste made and compyled in Latin by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Clerke master Iohn Gerson, Chauncellour
of Paris. And the sayed foure bookes be nowe of
late newly translated into English in such maner
as hereafter appeareth. And though three of the
first bookes of the sayd foure bookes haue bene
before this time right well and deuoutlie trāsla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into Englishe by a famous Clerke called
master VVilliam Atkinson which was a doctour
of diuinitie, Yet for as muche as the sayde tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slatour
for some cause him mouinge) in diuers
places left out muche parte of some of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters,
and sometime varied from the letter, as
in the thirde chapter, and in the. 18 and. 19. cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters
of the first booke, and also in diuers other
chapiters of the sayde three bookes will appeare
to them that will examine the Latin and the sayd
first translation together: Therefore the sayed. 3.
bookes be eftsones trāslated into English, in such
maner as hereafter foloweth, to the intent that
they that list maye at their pleasure be occupied
with the one or the other, after as their deuotion
shall stirre them when they haue seene thē both.
And after the sayde three bookes foloweth the
fourth booke, which was first translated out of
Frenche into Englishe, by the right noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Princes Margaret late Countesse of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondo
and Darbye, mother vnto the noble
Prince of blessed memorie Kynge Henry the. 7.
<pb facs="2"/>
father vnto our late Ioueraine Lord Kinge Henry
the. 8. And for as muche as it was translated by
the sayed noble Princes out of Frenche, it coulde
not folowe the Latin so nigh nor so directlie as
if it had bene translated out of Latin. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is nowe translated out of Latin, and yet
neuerthelesse it keepeth the substaunce and the
effect of the first translation out of Frenche,
though sometime it varie in wordes, as to the
Reader will appeare. And in the latter ende, after
the fourth booke, is a short morall doctrine,
which is called The spirituall glasse of the soule.
And it is right good and profitable to euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
ofte tymes to looke vpon it.</p>
