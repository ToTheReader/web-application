   <head>The Epistle to the Reader,</head>
   <p>VVell affectionated Reader. It is (as thou knowest) a divine precept, that we should <hi>giue Honour to whom honour is due:</hi> Jmplying therein, that no honour is due either to Persōs or things, but in a lawfull and right way. And hence it is that many of Gods deare Servants both haue and still doe, refuse to yeeld any Reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Honoor, Service, &amp;c. vnto
<hi>Archbishops Bishops:</hi> and their dependent Offices; I say, as they are <hi>Ecclesiasticall persons</hi> &amp; doe administer in their
<hi>Spirituall Courts</hi> as they terme them: in regard they have assumed such a <hi>State</hi> as is to speake properly and truely of it, neither
<hi>Iure Divino</hi> nor <hi>jure Humano,</hi> warrented by the word of God. But of this I shall not need to say any more, in regard thou shalt find what here I say cleared &amp; proved sufficiently: viz. that their calling is not frō God, either in <hi>a divine or humane respect,</hi> but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the scripturs after mentioned: altogether &amp; every way from the Devill. And therfore look unto it whosoever thou art, that thou (like
<hi>Mordecay</hi>) bow not the knee to any of these <hi>Amaliks,</hi> but on the contrarie <hi>Feare God and honour the King,</hi> and give reverence Only to such ordinances as God binds thy Conscience too, either in respect of nature or grace, and soe doeing thou shalt <hi>Give vnto Caesar the things that are Caesars, And give vnto God, those things that are Gods.</hi> And that thou mayst so doe, the Lord sanctsfie both this and all other good meanes and helps to thee.</p>
