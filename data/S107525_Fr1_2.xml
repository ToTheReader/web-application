   <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>GOOD READER,</hi> Thou mayst vnderstand, that some yeeres past there was printed a little English translation out of French, concerning a Conference in France, betweene a Father of the <hi>Societie</hi> and a Minister of <hi>Amiens;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the learned Iesuite by tying the Minister to his owne prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of prouing the Points controuerted from the written Word alone, did in the presence of many, mightily confound the Minister. This short English translation (as experience hath shewed) hath wrought much good vpon diuers. But being aduertized, that the Copyes of it are almost spent, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by losse of many, and partly otherwise; Therefore I haue here taken some small paynes to set downe in a short Discourse the said Method, in effect, holden in dispute by the former Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite, but in seuerall points enlarged, altered, and moulded anew. For omitting the French Confession of Fayth (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing different in many articles from the doctrine of our English Protestants) whereunto the former English Translation by discussing seuerall points of Faith there maintayned, had spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reference; I haue first premised certayne obseruations for the better conceiuing of the Method here prescribed.</p>
   <p>Secondly, the Method it selfe of answering is more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, where the Minister in the foresaid Conference much relyed vpon conference of Scripture, it is here shewed, that conference of Scripture, euen by the acknowledgment of diuers learned Protestants, is altogether insufficient for proofe of any Article.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, the Argument is here fully answered, which may seeme to be taken by retorting vpon vs the Method here pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized, when we vndertake the <hi>Opponents</hi> part and office against the Protestant.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p> Fiftly, whereas in alleaging of only Scripture, the sole drift of the Protestants, is to appeale to their owne interpretation of it, reiecting herein the interpretation of the Primitiue Church; therefore I haue here alleaged the iudgements of diuers most eminent Protestants, accordingly condemning the Primitiue Fathers of flat Papistrie; and consequently, of their supposed false constructions giuen with vs of the Scripture.</p>
   <p>Sixtly and lastly, here are presented to the Reader certayne forcible arguments of <hi>Credibilitie,</hi> priuiledging the Fathers aboue the Protestants in interpreting Gods sacred written Word: all which seuerall passages are wanting in the foresaid English Translation. And thus, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader,</hi> farewell, and vse this my small labour to the spirituall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of thy Soule.</p>
