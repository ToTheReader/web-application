      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Race mercye &amp; peace, from God the father, and from our lord Iesus christ his son, be with thee good Christian reder, and with all those that loue the lord vnfainedlye Amen. Callinge to remembraunce the saying of Iesus the Son of Syrache in Ecclesiasticus the 20. Chapter. Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that is hyd, and Treasour that is whordyd vppe, what profyte is in them bothe? Thought it no lesse, then my boūden dutye (after I had perused this worke) to do my indeuor, that the same might be put in printe, whereby others might be part takers with me therein. For after I had red the same, and fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng therein, so heauenly doctryne, so consonant and agreynge wyth goddes booke, and so mete for thuse of all esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and sortes of people (beynge christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) thought I should do iniury to god,
<pb facs="3"/>
and wronge to my Christen bretherne, yf I shoulde anye lenger deteigne the same from them. And as I knowe not the author thereof, no more founde I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny title or name geuen vnto the booke. But for that the author tooke (as it were for his theame) the beginninge of the 7. Chapiter of Iob where hee say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. The lyfe of man is a warfare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the earthe and hys dayes lyke the dayes of an hyred seruaunt. Wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he hath most lyuelye set before our eyes, as well howe we are incessantlye assauited and assayled, by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all flatteringe promyses of the worlde, the carnall allurementes and entyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of our domesticall enemye the fleshe, and craftye temptatyons, and prouocations, of our olde ennemye the dyuell (wyth three ferce and cruell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes, neuer cease daye nor nighte to inuade vs, and what they can to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vs, to fall from God) as also oure duties bothe in the resistence of synne, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

armure and weapon, bothe how to beare of the sodein inuasions of those our enemyes, and also to repulse them, when they shall assayle vs.</p>
   <p>Wherefore that the name of the booke might agre with the worke, I thought it good to attribute to the same suche a name, as the worcke desired: (that is to saye) godly and necessary rules to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised and put in practyse, by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes souldyers, lyuynge in the campe of this worlde. And in the diligent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge of this worke, and disgestinge of the same: thou shalte well perceaue (deere reder) that the lyfe of a very chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian (of what estate or degree so euer he be) to exceade and far passe, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfayte lyues of cloyning cloysterars, of mummynge monkes, fonde fryers, or of hypochrytical heremytes, and that we nede not ronne to seke a strayte lyfe among the Chart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>rhouse monkes, for the parfection of a christian lyfe, but as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same is most perfitly set forth in God his booke (I meane the sacred Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res) so it is to be followed of al Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (yf we wilbe christians in dede) for it is not the name of a Chrystyan, that
<pb facs="4"/>
maketh vs Christians before God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we haue also the dedes of Christy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as Christe sayeth in Mathewe the 7. Not whosoeuer sayethe vnto mee Lorde Lorde, shall enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, but he that doeth the wil of my father. And in the 6. of Luke he sayeth. Why call ye me, maister &amp; Lorde, and do not that I byd ye. And Saint Iohn sayeth in his first Epystle and 2. Chapyter. He that sayeth I knowe him, and kepethe not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes is a lyer, and the truth is not in him. So that as the name of a Iewe maketh not a Iewe. Romayns 2. Nomore doth the name of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an make a christiā except we also shew forth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> workes of a christian. That our christiā lyues might shyne in puryty, in clennes, in sobryet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>, in pacyence, in charitye, in longe sufferyng, that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes of the ghospel, seinge our god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye conuersation, mighte bee wonne by thesame to the ghospell. As Christe sayeth in Mathew the 5. Let your light so shyne before men, that they seynge your good workes may glorify your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heauen. And that they
<pb facs="4"/>
haue no cause iustlye to reporte euill of vs, folowyng the counsell of Seneca in his booke <hi>de mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>bus,</hi> where he hathe this pithy sayinge. Haue peace with all men, but be at defyaunce with syn, (God graunt that this Heathen philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher rise not at the Iudgemente, to condempne a nomber of vs Christians for oure negligence.) So that now I hope) it is apparant to all eyes that wil not wilfully be blynd: that it is the duty of al christians to liue so straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in this worlde, and so earnestlye to wrastle againste vyce, and sinne, as the weaknes of our fleshe shal or can beare in oure myndes detestynge and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge synne, and from the bottome of our hartes to wyshe that we coulde not sinne. For it is our partes to wrastle against the same, and therein hath the holye ghost by his elect vessell Saynct Paule comforted vs saying in the 1. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Corinth. 10. God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full whiche shall not suffer you to bee tempted aboue your strength, but shal in the myddest of temptacion, make a waye that ye maye be able to beare it.
<pb facs="5"/>
And what we are not able to doe, by reason of our weaknes, that hath christ fulfilled for vs, as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same apostle saith also to the Romaynes the. 8. For what the lawe could not do in as muche as it was weake, bycause of the fleshe, that performed God, and sente hys sonne in the similytude of sinfull flesh. &amp;c. And in the beginning of the same Chapiter he sayeth. There is then nowe no dampnacion to them that are graffed in Christ Iesu. What? to do what they lyst? and to ronne carelesly hedlonge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to synne? Naye he addeth: Whyche walke not after the flesh but after the sprite. As God himselfe sayeth in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. 15. Be ye holye for I am holye. So that the lyfe of euerye true Christian, oughte to be suche as no man worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can rebuke: whiche thynge is moste pientifully, and at the full, set forth in this godly worke. And thys I write, onely to stoppe the mouthes of suche, as slaunderously reporte and saye that these newe preachers (for so it pleaseth them to tearme, suche as moste syncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye preach Gods trueth) would haue no
<pb facs="5"/>
good workes, but preach lyberty, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye. Who (in dede) meane nothynge lesse: but bycause they seeke to plucke thē from their fond trust in their vayn meritor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>us workes, taughte them by the papistes (thereby makinge Christe but halfe a Sauioure) and sette forthe the perfection of a trewe faithe whiche is most playnly taughte vs, in the. 17. of Luke by Christe himselfe, by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the seruaunte comminge from the ploughe, whiche parable he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with thys sayinge. So ye also when ye haue done all that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded you, say we are vnprofitable seruantes, we haue done y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> whiche was our duty to do. And therfore sayeth S. Paule in the 2. to the Ephesians. For by grace are ye saued, through faythe, and that not of your selues. For it is the guyfte of God, and not of workes, least any man should boaste. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, that we shoulde not mystake S. Paule, and thinke that the opinyon of faith were inough &amp; therfore we might be ydle, and liue careleslye, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier or regarde of vertue, he immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye addeth sayinge. For we are his
<pb facs="6"/>
workmāship (saieth he) created in christ Iesu vnto good workes, whiche God hath prepared, that we shoulde walke in them. So that it is most manifest, what impudent and vnshamefast lyers and slaunderers, the papistes &amp; their ad herentes are vpō god his preachers and his mynysters, for neyther they, nor none other at any time, hard any other doctrine out of anye of those preachers mouthes (whome it hath pleased them to cal new preachers) but thei and their doctrine (I meane the papistes) maye be called this dayes bakinge in compary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the auncienty of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> doctrine whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is taughte by those newe felowes, then this that I haue aboue written. Which in dede most aboundantly, and plentifully is setts forthe in this little booke: bothe godlyly, and learnedly. Where by it maye well be perceyued, that though the tyme of darkenes hath bene muche in the world, by reason the same hath bene so obfuscated and ouer whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="6"/>
was it not hidde from all men but at al times, and in all ages, there euer haue bene some, that sawe and knewe the trueth, and left the same in wrytyng to their posterity, as appeareth by this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worke, whiche came to my handes written, and when I had red the same, considerynge the antiquytye thereof, I remembred the aunswere of God made to Elyas the Prophete 3. Reg. 19. I haue lefte me (sayeth God) 7000. men in Israell whose knees, neuer vowed before Baall nor kyssed hym with hys mouth. So that god alwayes as appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth (thoughe they be not taken of the worldlynges) hath his churche and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the worlde, thoughe (in dede they be very few, and so haue alwayes bene (in respecte of the contrarye parte) and oftentymes exercised vnder the Crosse, and afflyeted by the worlde. For if we should consider the estate &amp; condicion of gods church from the beginnyng of the world, euē vntyll our time, we shal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same, alwaies to be very few in comparison of the residue of the world and that for the most part afflyeted) for

anon after that Adam and Eue were cast out of paradice, Genes. 3. Dyd not wicked Caine kyll iust Abel, Genes. 4. And after as the worlde increased, so did wickednesse habounde and synne wared rife, and God so put in oblyuion that. 1556. yeares after the creatyon of the world (in the whiche the deluge or vniuersall floode came whereby all the world was drowned) there was no more found God his people, and God his churche, in all the worlde, but eight persōs that is to saye Noy, his wife, his 3. sonnes, and theyr wyues which were saued and skaped the floode. As appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in Genes. the 7. And after the floode was passed &amp; Noy and his hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde come out of the arke, the worlde beyng deuided among his thre sonnes, Sem, Cham, and Iaphethe, and that the people began eftsones to multiplye and increase, the worlde was so forgro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wē in wickednes, that there was none found, that truely worshipped god, but Phare Abrahams father, and his hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, as may appeare to the diligent reader from the. 9. to the. 12. of Genes.
<pb facs="7"/>
and after the death of Phare, god cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Abraham from among the chaldeis least he shoulde haue him plucked from the true worshipping of god to idolatry which then was ryfe, among the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyans, and flowed also ouer all the worlde. Abraham obeyed god his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling toke with him his wife Sara, &amp; al his houshold and Lot his brothers son, and so departed from Haram where Abrahams father dyed, into the lande of Canaan, which afterward his posteritie enioyed (after muche tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion) as from the 12. of Genes. and so the 5. bokes of Moyses and Iosue, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye sette forth, and at large dyscribed. And so to see the whole course of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from Abrahams comming from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Chaldeys, vnto Moyses de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="8"/>
the gouernance of their common welth vnder Iudges, and from Iudges vnto kinges, and from kinges vnto priestes, after the captiuytye of Babylon, euen vntill Christes tyme. And it shall be well perceyued that euen amonge the Iewes being gods peculyar people (all the world besides, being altogether ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ydolatry, and knowing not god) that God hys people were alwayes the least in number, and the true worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge of God was in very fewe. And that alwaies the greater sort, and more in number were suche, as folowynge their owne dreames &amp; inuencyons, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soke the true worshippinge of God, and with most cruelty put to death the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors thereof, and slue the prophetes, which tolde them Gods will, &amp; rebuked their sinnes and ydolatry as in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures is most plentifully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. As for ensample. Of syx hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth thousande which came out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipte vnder Moyses, there entred but two, namely Iosue and Caleb, into the land of promis. And when that Moyses (by the cōmandement of god, sent forth

12. of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> people of Israel (out of eche tribe one) to vew the promysed lande. After they hadde bene out 40. dayes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned: of the 12. which were sent two parsons onely (that is to say Iosue and caleb) tolde the trueth and tenne of the twelue were lyers, and perswaded the people, from going into the lande, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che god had promised. Ye and such hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burly was amongste them, that not onely Moyses and Aaron, but also Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue &amp; Caleb, the true messengers were like to be stoned, and would haue made themselues capitaines, and so haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back into Egipt. What plague folowed them? rede the place, Nume. 13. Not one of theym entred the lande (no more any rebellours againste God hys truth and his true preachers which are signified by Iosue &amp; caleb shal enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our promised land, which is the king dom of heauen, purchased by y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> precious death and bloudshedding, of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late lambe Iesus christ our onely saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our &amp; aduocate) again was not Micke as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> prophet of god against 400. false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of Baall whiche promised Achab victory i his affaires: but Micheas tolde

Strayte is the gate and narow is the waye whiche leadeth vnto life, and few there bee that fynde it. And in the. 20. Many are called, but fewe are chosen. And christ calleth them his little flocke, saying in the. 12. of Luke. Feare not lytle flock, for it is youre fathers pleasure to geue you a kingdome. And saint Paule in the 10. to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

Thus muche haue I writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to answer such as haue this reason in their mouthes, wil god suffer so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to perishe? and to be led blynd so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hūdred yeares. What shal I speake of hundrethes of yeares? Was not the worlde from the beginninge therof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll after christes ascencion (setting the Iewes aparte, which were but a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in comparison of the whole worlde besides) altogether, not onely without the knowledge of god, but also worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped dyuels and creatures, euery manne after his owne fantesy, some the Sun, some the moone, some the starres, some the fier, and some the similitude of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, and some of men, and as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued benefytes of men, so after their deathes, they worshipped them for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, as because Bacchus firste found e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them the meane to make wine: therfore after his death they made hym a god (if creatures maye make gods as the pope maye sayntes) and called him the god of wine. Mars first found out armure and weapon, when he was

deade, they made him a God, and called him the god of warre. Ceres a woman she first founde the meane, to plowe the ground and to so we corne, &amp; so to make breade (where before they eate accorns) and when she was dead th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

assencyon (whyche was the space of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer thousand yeares or there aboutes) vntill Sainct Paule and other the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles preached the ghospel ouer al the worlde.

And now ye see, how farre those fond reasons of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye wysedome, is from God, and howe quyte it is ouerthrowne. And I pray you how farre dyssented our Christya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie from their gentilitye? They had for euery thynge a sundry God, we had for euery thinge a sundrye Saynct, we had S.

Saynct Barbara for thunder, Sayncte Sithe, for our keyes, Saynct Anthony, for oure pygges, Saynct Loye for oure horse, Sainct Agatha for the to the ake, Saynct Leonards was good maister to theues, oure Ladye for women wyth chylde, and a number of suche abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and stynkynge ydololatrye yea

and because we woulde be nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour vnto them, we woulde haue for their drōken Bacchus, a drōnken mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin. So that we hadde nothynge but the names of Christians, for in our ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and Ceremonies, we were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heathenish.

<pb facs="14"/>
vs to resists the manifest trueth of god his moste sacred Scryptures, and as I haue somwhat saide before, to stop the mouthes of suche as cleaued to number of yeares, and multitudes of people▪</p>
   <p>So I thinke it good to writte somwhat also of forefathers to aunswere those fonde people which haue these reasons in their mouthes, we will doe as oure forefathers haue done, &amp; what I praye you (saye they) are we wyser then they, were there not as greate learned men, as wise menne, as good men in times passed, as nowe, and why then shoulde we not credit them, and do as they did? I praye you lette me also aske you this questyon, yf the Apostles shoulde haue made christ that aunswer when he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, if the Romains, Corinthiās, Thessolonians, Ephesians, galathiās, and all the whole world besides, should haue made the apostles &amp; gods messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that aunswer (whiche they might more iustly haue done, if eyther conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of yeares myghte haue serued, for they had bene nose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ed in their gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitye, aboue foure thousand yeares, or
<pb facs="14"/>
els if worldly wise and learned heades, for they had within that space rysen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mōgst them, Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, and a number of other wise, witty, and learned Philosophers) when they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched christ vnto them? O Lorde, when shoulde the apostles or we haue come to the knowledge of Christ. So that now ye see howe stronge a foundacion you stande on, which wil nedes stick to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, that is so sone ouerthrowne and blowen vp, euen from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. But because I will not followe the steppes of your forefathers (whiche grounde themselues altogether vppon humaine reason, without gods word) I wil also allege some scriptures against ye. So that if ye may by any meanes be plucked frō antechrist (y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Pope I meane &amp; al popishnes) I will do my best, bothe now and at all times (god willing) to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vttermost of my power, according to y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> small talent which god hath lent me, &amp; yet herein nothing but my duty. And as S. Paule said to the Corinthians 2. Epistle &amp; 12. chap. I seke not yours, but you. So (I take god to record) do I write
<pb facs="15"/>
this onelye because I woulde (what in me lay) kepe you from oure enemy the deuyll, and to bring you to God. Well harken what god himself sayeth in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. the. 18. Do not ye as they whiche were before you, and be ye not defy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ed in them, I am the Lorde your god▪ kepe my commaundementes. And in the 2. of Amos the prophet he saieth. Thus sayeth the lorde, for thre and foure wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesses of Iuda I wil not spare him: because he hath caste aside the lawe of the lord, and not kept his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for theyr idolles haue disceyued them, after whome their forefathers went. And therfore sayeth god in Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronomie. 12. Whatsoeuer that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde you, that take hede ye doe, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto the lorde, and put thou nothing therto, nor take ought there from, and therefore sayeth Salomon in the. 30. of the prouerbes. The worde of god is a fiery shield, vnto al them that put their trust in him, put thou nothing vnto his wordes, least he reproue thee, and thou be founde a lyer. So that now we see, that this reason of forefathers is cleane
<pb facs="15"/>
ouerthrowne, and nothing left vnto vs to folowe, but the sacred scriptures. Yf this will not auaile, nor profit such as haue that fonde and vaine toye in their heades, I knowe not what to say vnto them. but I may well allege the saying of O see the prophet against them in the 8. Though I shew them my lawe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so much, they accōpte it but strange doctrine. In dede such is the blyndnesse of the world, and of mans nature that they can not see the veritie without the special gyft of god, which is bound nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Doctors hoode, nor yet to bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops myter, for the holy ghost sayethe in the first chapiter of the booke of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Wisdome shal not ēter into a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward soule, nor dwell in the bodye that is subdued vnto synne, and therfore he sayeth a little before in the same chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For he will be found of them that tempt him not, and appeare to thē that put their trust in him, &amp; therfore saieth god by y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> prophet I say in the. 66. chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Upon whom shall my spirite rest? but vpon the humble &amp; contrite spirite, and such a one as stādeth in awe of my
<pb facs="16"/>
wordes. With whom agreeth S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the 2. Epistle 1. saying. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto geue all diligence, in your faythe, minister vertue, in vertue, knowledge &amp;c. And then he concludeth, saying: If these thinges be with you, and be plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, they will make you that ye ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shalbe ydle nor vnfruitefull in the knowledge of our lord Iesus christ, but he y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> hath not these things, he is blinde, groping the way wyth hys hande, hath forgotten himselfe, to haue bene pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from his olde sinnes. And hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to agreeth S. Paule in the 1. chapiter &amp; 1. Epistle to the Corynthians, rede the place. So that where those vertues be, there doth god in dede open his secre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/> tes by his holye sprite. I write not this that I meane therby to dyscourage any from learning, but rather I exhorte all men to set their children thereunto, and speciallye to the vniuersities, whereby good litterature maye be maynteyned in the youth, whiche are the sede of the common wealthe of thys realme, and god his trueth syncerly preached. But
<pb facs="16"/>
I onelie inuaye against those papistes, whiche saye that suche learned men, as mayntayne their errors, are learned, they are Bushoppes: they haue study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the scriptures, so manye yeares and so many yeares, and how can it be, but that these must nedes vnderstande the scriptures? Ye, and some saye, it is not possyble for anye man to vnderstande the scryptures, vnlesse he were a grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate of the vnyuersytie, but whether this impossibilytye be true or no, bothe the scryptures aboue recyted and also experyence in these our dayes (thankes be to God) dothe proue the contrarye, for that there be diuers whiche neuer came in the vniuersities, yea, and some suche as haue no more but their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tonge, doe vnderstande the scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and able to teache good &amp; sounde doctrine. But howe those men vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the scriptures (whiche bragge so muche of their doctryne, and contynu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of theyr studye) by their doctryne is apparaunte, for seke they oughte in all theyr preachynges and doynges other
<pb facs="17"/>
then their owne praysynges, and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of their own tradicions, yea, and extolling and preferringe the same aboue gods cōmaundementes, as when papistrye raygned, howe little was the terrible swearinge and tearinge of god spoken against, howe was whoredome wynked at, which are vtterlye againste goddes commandementes, and by god his lawe punished by death. But yet so litle regarded with them, that rather it was winked at then spoken against. If a man hadde sworne neuer so great an othe in tearing of God, ye shoulde haue had that marke (the popes shauelynges I meane) syt by and say neuer a worde. But if one hadde sworne by theyr styn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king &amp; idololatrus masse, by &amp; by Syr Iohn woulde haue bene busye, for so misusing his occupacyon. Agayne, if one of their vowed priestes (repentynge his errors and minding to liue in gods lawes) hadde chaunsed to haue mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wife (leauinge the takinge of other mens wiues and daughters forsakinge their liberty. <hi>
