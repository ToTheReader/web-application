I haue (being ouercome with their perswasions) condescended to their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest demaund, although very vnapt and exceedingly vnworthy for the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of so worthy a matter. Wherefore I haue made choyse (crauing pardō for my presumption herein) of your well disposed worship at this time (being the <hi>Alpha</hi> of my tender and slender ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours) to sound in your sacred cares this last and generall trumpet, &amp; to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to your worship the same: both in regard of the demonstration of my true vnfamed, and lasting thankfulnesse to your benigne worship, (for saith <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca: Beneficium hominem gratū semper delectat, ingratum semel: id est:</hi> A thankfull man will alway re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a benefit, but an vnthankfull person wil soone forget it) for your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Kindnesses bestowed vpō me, <hi>Absque vllo demerito,</hi> without any desert in the world: as also in regard
