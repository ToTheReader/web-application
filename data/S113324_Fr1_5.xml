hearing or serious
reading of the same Word,
deliberate consideration of
the truth and infallibility of
Gods promises contained
therein, and the assured
performance of them, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
their future blessed
and glorious being after
this life, whereof the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
heart being assured
through the testimony of
Gods holy Spirit, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in nothing so much
as continually to thinke
and meditate of the same
according to the words of
<pb facs="11"/>
Christ; <hi>Where our treasure
is, there are our hearts,</hi> and
thereof wee continually
thinke: DAVID had his
heart set vpon his treasure
hid with Christ aboue,
which made him to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
&amp; cheerefully to sing,
<hi>O, how loue I the Law of the
Lord? It is my continuall
meditation;</hi> yea, <hi>I will me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
in thy precepts, and
consider thy waies.</hi> So did
<hi>Salomon</hi> cry out, <hi>Blessed bee
the Lord God of Israel, who
spake with his mouth to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
my father, and with
his hand hath performed it; 1
King.</hi> 8. 15, 16.</p>
      <p>
         <pb facs="12"/>
All the promises of God
in Scripture doe administer
vnto the faithfull, matter of
continuall meditation and
serious consideration; and
among many of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
his promse of defence
and deliuery of his in the
time of danger, trouble,
and affliction, is to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
considered, for that it
concerneth especially the
children of God that are
most afflicted: who consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<hi>the waies of God</hi> to
be <hi>mercy and truth,</hi> and that
what he promiseth he will
assuredly performe, cannot
<pb facs="12"/>
but worke patience, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
hope; and how can
he bee without continuall
holy Meditation, whose
heart is with God, from
whom he hopeth his helpe
will come, but in Gods
owne time; and therefore
though wee hope, we may
not make haste; though he
promise to defend vs from
danger, &amp; deliuer vs in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he will not so answer
our expectations, as if wee
knew the time when, or the
manner how to be releeued
or defended, better than he.
He will exercise his owne
<pb facs="13"/>
children awhile to proue
their patience, faith and
obedience, to cause vs to
meditate and ponder his
word and promise, till hee
haue sufficiently tried our
constant assurance of his
timely deliuery, for it is his
property to come to helpe
his, when they thinke hee
hath most forgotten them.</p>
      <p>How suffered he <hi>Dauid,</hi>
a man chosen after his
owne heart, to bee enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with infinite dangers,
in so much as he thought
God had forsaken him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
and forgotten
<pb facs="13"/>
him, and therefore cries
out, <hi>How long wilt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
me Lord, for euer?</hi> and
againe hee confessed that
God had giuen him his
hearts desire, and that hee
had not denied the request
of his lips, whereby appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that the sorce of liuely
faith, holy meditation, and
diuine prayer, are able to
make (God offended) God
appeased suddenly, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
sorrow, and so bring
ioy.</p>
      <p>God hath promised to
be a defence to the faithfull
in whatsoeuer dangers, yet
<pb facs="14"/>
if we wel weigh and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the course of Gods
dealing with his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and duly meditate of
his power, prouidence and
wisdome; wee shall finde
that hee doth not alwaies▪
come immediatly at the
call of his dearest chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
DAVID was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
and persecuted
long, <hi>Ioseph</hi> was impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
long, they both pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for deliuery, yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in a hard estate, which
was an argument in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
reason that God ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not for them: and
<pb facs="14"/>
aboue them both was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<hi>Iob</hi> long and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
waies afflicted, God
saw his miseries and heard
his prayers, but he left him
yet to be an example to vs
of like expectation of Gods
timely releeuing vs, and in
his good time he made <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
a King, and <hi>Ioseph</hi> the
chiefe vnder <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> and restored <hi>Iob</hi> to
his former, yea, to farre
greater glory.</p>
      <p>Thus doth God try his
dearest children, to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
them to know and
acknowledge, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<pb facs="15"/>
hee seeme to absent
himselfe from them in their
deepest dangers, and to
seeme deafe (as it were) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their prayers, he yet hath
an eie both on them and
their enemies: hee was a
shelter vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<hi>Saul;</hi> he saw <hi>Ioseph</hi> in
prison, but with his liberty
prepared his aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He saw <hi>Iobs</hi> afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but kept a hooke in
Satans nosthrills, that all
that he did against <hi>Iob</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to his finall comfort.</p>
      <p>Though therefore it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the faithfull to be strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="15"/>
and enuironed with so
many and mighty ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and troopes of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
that there appeareth
no euasion, no deliuery, by
any visible meanes; yet
there remaineth holy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
patient deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods wonderfull
deliuerances of his, in all
like dangers: <hi>Consider Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
and all his troubles,</hi> and
you shall finde hee fainted
not, but depended onely
vpon the promises and
prouidence of God, with
a godly resolution, to wait
<pb facs="16"/>
the issue of his hope, onely
meditating on Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and considering his
waies, and how he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dealt with <hi>Abraham,
Izaak, Iaacob, Noah, Lot,
Moses,</hi> and other faithfull
fathers before him; the
meditation and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of whose wonderfull
deliueries cannot but work
assurance in any beleeuing
heart in like manner,
though by vnlike and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
meanes, in good time
to be deliuered; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saith <hi>Dauid,</hi> by way of
meditation and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="16"/>
of his, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our faith in God, <hi>Our
Fathers trusted in thee, they
called vpon thee, and were
heard, they prayed vnto thee
and thou deliueredst them
out of all their troubles;</hi> as
if hee should say in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
by way of Meditation,
I finde by the Word of
God, that he hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
many before my time,
that trusted in him &amp; called
vpon him, in greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
than I am in, why then
should I doubt or despaire
of like deliuery? I trust in
him as these fathers trusted:
<pb facs="17"/>
I call vpon, and pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him as they did, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
surely hee will heare
me, and helpe me in time
conuenient; thus did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
meditate in his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
      <p>God commanded <hi>Iaacob</hi>
to returne from <hi>Laban</hi> his
Vncle, into his countrie
and Kindred (from whom
and whence he fled) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
to doe him good,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 9. Could <hi>Iaacob</hi>
doe lesse than meditate and
t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>inke seriously of this
command and promise of
God, considering hee was
<pb facs="17"/>
to returne to his desperatly
malicious brother <hi>Esau,</hi>
who sought to murther
him? yet vpon due Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and consideration of
Gods faithfull promise of
defending him and doing
him good, hee ouercame
feare by faithfull prayer,
and the Lord appeased his
brothers malice towards
him.</p>
      <p>Examples of like nature
are plentifull in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as of <hi>Mordecay</hi> and
the <hi>Iewes, Ester</hi> 7. of the
<hi>Bethulians, Iudith</hi> 7. and
many others.</p>
      <p>
         <pb facs="18"/>
Holy meditation is most
necessary, and an especiall
Motiue to faithfull prayer,
and prayer can neuer be so
powerfull as vpon holy
premeditation, though
short, so it be serious, for
as rumination precedes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesture
in cleane beasts; so
holy Meditation goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
effectuall prayer in
Christians.</p>
      <p>Seeing then that there is
no k<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>nde of trouble, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
misery or affliction
that can befall Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
but there are exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in the holy Booke of
<pb facs="18"/>
God; wherein may bee
seene Gods outward deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
or inward comfort in
euery kinde, what need the
faithfull to faint in any?</p>
      <p>Search therfore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
meditate in them,
consider the ends and is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues,
the patience and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
of former godly men;
and let their faith, patience
and prayer, be paternes for
our imitation. Then if our
knowledge by reading and
hearing of the Word, our
continuall meditation in
the Word, doe worke in
vs through the same spirit
<pb facs="19"/>
that guided them like assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and faith; we cannot
but adde preuailing pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which being without
doubting or wauering, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but in force (as it were)
at Gods hands (who is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
powerfull) like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liueries
out of dangers and
timely releefe or release, in
troubles. And he that is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
obseruer of Gods
dealing for the defence of
his, and confounding his
&amp; their enemies at this day,
cannot but see &amp; approue
God to be the same God in
power, wil, prouidence, and
<pb facs="19"/>
readinesse to helpe his, as
he was in any former age
to our fathfull fore-fathers;
Then search the Word,
meditate therein as <hi>Dauid</hi>
did day and night, pray
zealously and faithfully;
and this God, euen the
euerliuing and all-sufficient
God, shall effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
in his good time,
whatsoeuer hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
and we pray for.</p>

all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
perills, &amp; troubles, and an
armour of tried defence against
sin and Satan; yet few there be
that vse it, especially as they
ought; some not at all. Many
there are that either <hi>say in

as</hi> Psal. 53. 1. or that <hi>deny
the power of God, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
<pb facs="20"/>
him to be God,
and so cannot glorifie him as
God,</hi> Rom. 1. 21. Some also
are or haue beene so impious, as
they absolutely haue denied him,
as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 5. 2. <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib,</hi>
2 King. 18. 13. to 30.
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 3. and
others, assuming as it were the
name of Gods vnto themselues.
They praid to none, but they as
Gods were praid vnto; whose
examples are to be detested as
abominable, blasphemous, and
deuilish; whose ends may onely
serue to terrifie such (though
neuer so mighty, preuailing in
their tyranny awhile) as either
forsake the liuing God, and trust
in or pray vnto them, or that
that are no gods: such are not
<pb facs="21"/>
to be feared of them that truly
trust in and pray vnto the God
of hosts, as holy <hi>Dauid</hi> did,
whose example of faith, prayer,
and holy resolution in all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
may encourage all faithfull
in all their troubles, to imitate
and practise the same.</p>
      <p>The onely and chiefe refuge
that this most godly King had,
and the principall weapons
wherewith he resisted and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
his enemies, was feruent
prayer in a liuely faith.</p>
      <p>Faithfull prayer to God is
such a defence against whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
danger as no enemy, be hee
neuer so mighty, malicious, or
carnally politike, can preuaile
against it; for howsoeuer a man
truly fearing God be beset with
<pb facs="21"/>
(euen multitudes of) enemies,
so as no visible helpe can haue
accesse to rescue him or to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
him; yet if hee send this
Messenger, <hi>faithfull</hi> prayer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and wauer not in his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
outward succour, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
comfort, will assuredly and
timely appeare. It was <hi>Dauids</hi>
refuge in euery danger, when
his perfidious Counseller <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel,</hi>
whose counsell was as
it were, the Oracle of God,
addressed his traiterous aduice
to rebellious <hi>Absolom,</hi> he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
praied to frustrate it, and
his depest wisdome turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
folly, 2 <hi>Sam. 15. 31. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>
in danger of the King
of <hi>Ashur,</hi> vsed onely prayer to
God, and the Lord slew his
<pb facs="22"/>
enemies one hundred fourescore
and fiue thousand in one night,
2 <hi>King.</hi> 19. Examples are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
of the force and effect of
prayer, in so much as there is
nothing that the faithfull want,
but <hi>Prayer,</hi> if it be faithfull and
feruent may obtaine, if God in
his wisdome thinke it fit for vs
to receiue.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Prayer</hi> is it whereby we speake
vnto God in a heauenly kinde
of familiarity, and whereby
God is, as it were, inforced to
cast away his rod, and to alter
his purpose of punishing.</p>
      <p>Great is the force and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of faithfull prayer, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is the loue of God towards
vs, in admitting vs so freely
and boldly to come vnto him
<pb facs="22"/>
with our petitions; nay, so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
he is, that he allureth vs
saying, <hi>Call vpon mee in the
day of trouble, and I will
heare thee and deliuer thee,
and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Here is sufficient warrant
and encouragement for vs to
flie vnto God by prayer, in
whatsoeuer trouble, misery,
danger or affliction. And the
examples of deliuery and helpe
in euery kinde are so infinite, as
who so is conuersant in the old
and new Bookes of God, cannot
be ignorant of the force and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of faithfull Prayer, euen of
such as haue beene subiect to
like passions as we are: <hi>Ioshua</hi>
prayed, and the Sunne and
Moone stood still, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 10. 12.
<pb facs="23"/>
         <hi>Elisha</hi> prayed, and his enemies
were strucken with blindnesse,
2 <hi>Kings 6. 18. Eliah</hi> prayed,
and fire fell from Heauen and
destroyed them that came to
take him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
      <p>Faithfull Prayer doth as it
were ouercome God, in somuch as
when he hath a purpose to punish
a people, or a person, he wil forbid
the faithfull to pray for them,
lest he should be ouercome with
their prayer, and so be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to spare them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 10,
11. If the prayer of one faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
man may restraine God, as
it were, from executing his
iudgements vpon the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
how much more may faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
prayer preuaile for the good
of a faithfull man?</p>
      <p>
         <pb facs="23"/>
What should then hinder our
Prayer to God in our owne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
and dangers? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but impatience and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
for if in a true and liuely
faith, and holy intention, wee
present our humble supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
vnto God through Christ,
according to his will reuealed in
his Word, and wauer not,
Christ himselfe assureth vs to
obtaine what wee pray for;
<hi>Whatsoeuer yee aske</hi> (saith
he) <hi>the Father in my name,
hee will giue it you,</hi> Iohn
16. 23.</p>
      <p>Let vs not then be cast downe
in our spirits, but let vs lift vp
our hearts to him that seeth vs,
and taketh care for vs, and
hath both will and power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
<pb facs="24"/>
vs. Hee hath a time in
his wisdome to humble vs, and a
time in his mercy to helpe vs;
a time to debase vs, and a time
to relieue vs in despight of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
and his most malicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments;
he had his time to
afflict <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and
<hi>Dauid;</hi> and in his time againe
he deliuered them. Let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in all our trialls, troubles
and afflictions call vpon God in
the Name of his Sonne, and we
shall finde that euen in our holy
Meditations he will thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs, but before we speake, he
will answer vs: and while wee
are yet praying, hee will heare
vs and helpe vs, and we shall
giue glory vnto his name.</p>
      <p>The faithfull onely haue the
<pb facs="24"/>
promise to bee heard and relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
when they call faithfully,
and perseuere constantly, on the
true God. What true comfort
then or hope can they haue in
their prayers, that in stead of
calling on the liuing God in
Christ, cry vnto, and trust in,
false gods? They may cry and
knock their breasts, and cut
their flesh, and afflict their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
like <hi>Baals</hi> Priests, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
profit: though they may
prosper and preuaile a while to
the hardning of their hearts,
in the end they shall be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and perish at the rebuke of
the God of hosts, as were <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
that great King of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyt,</hi>
that contemned God, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus
14. 27, 28. Senacherib</hi>
         <pb facs="25"/>
that blasphemed God, 2 <hi>Kings
9. 35. Antiochus</hi> that wicked
root, <hi>Mac.</hi> 1. 11. and all such
wicked Tyrants, that despising
the liuing God, trust in their
owne strength, and hunt after
the children of God to shed their
innocent bloud; let them alone,
their confusion sleepeth not.</p>
      <p>The strength of an army is
faithfull prayer to the God of
armies; an host of men, muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and militarie furniture,
are necessarie meanes; but
without deuout and feruent
prayer to God, best counsell is
vaine, aad strength feeble:
But where God is present in
both, affording a blessing to
both, there is certaine and true
victorie.</p>
      <p>
         <pb facs="25"/>
We are not indeed to expect
miraculous deliueries, and to
neglect the meanes; but where
ordinary meanes faile (of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity)
there may wee safely pray
and expect extraordinary. Our
owne experience doth approue
this to be true in two principall
late deliueries, wherein neither
the force nor wisdome of man
can bee said to haue the first
place; but God alone by his
owne wisdome found out the
preuention, and gaue such issue
to the inferiour execution, as is
maruellous in the eies of all men,
admired euen of our enemies, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom God himselfe shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himselfe an enemy: which
may teach and encourage vs
and all posterities to bee confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb facs="26"/>
constant and conuersant in
feruent prayer to him that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vs, and discouered and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
those that rose vp
both openly and secretly, to haue
as it were▪ swallowed vs vp
quite.</p>
      <p>And by these our deliueries,
we may well see and vnderstand
that if we call vpon him, he can
worke for our preseruation, as
well without meanes as by
meanes; yea where ordinary
meanes faile, he is able to raise
extraordinary, as hee did in
parting the waters for his owne
people to passe, and with the
same waters drowned their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
for he is the same God he
was then, and he that saies that
God neither can nor will worke
<pb facs="26"/>
extraordinarily at this day, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
him to be God at this day;
but as faithfull prayers were
auaileable in our fore-fathers
daies, as when <hi>Moses</hi> prayed
feruently, the Israelites preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
and when hee waxed cold,
the <hi>Amalekites</hi> had the better,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 11. euen so are fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
and faithfull prayers effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
at this day.</p>
      <p>We must yet beware, lest while
we pray with our tongues, that
our hearts and hope bee not set
vpon carnall meanes; for then
will God haue no respect vnto
our prayers, God will be either
the whole or no obiect of our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
he will part his owne
glory with none.</p>
      <p>He may and doth afford his
<pb facs="27"/>
most faithfull children visible
meanes; and if by them we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
we may not attribute our
good successe vnto the meanes,
but vnto the sword of the Lord,
not to <hi>Gideon:</hi> wee may not say
this man did, or without that
man wee had beene ouercome;
man may doe valiantly; but the
victory is onely of God who bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the meanes; neither are we
to neglect outward meanes and
so presume vpon God; it is a
tempting of him, and argues no
true confidence in him, neither
may we contemne the meanes, be
they neuer so seeming weake, for
Gods power is seene in weaknes,
and his wisdome in our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
      <p>Therefore whether our means
<pb facs="27"/>
seeme likely or vnlikely of good
successe, let them neither lift
vs vp or cast vs downe, neither
make vs presume or despaire,
for God can saue as well by few
as by many, as appeareth by <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi>
who with three hundred
men ouercame a huge host of
the <hi>Medianites, Iudg.</hi> 7. 13
He can supply our occasions as
well by little as by much: <hi>Elijah</hi>
with little food trauelleth forty
daies and forty nights, 1 <hi>King.</hi>
19. 8. Many examples might
bee produced, but no man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant
in holy Scripture is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant;
and therefore our faith
should not bee the more assured
through the greatnesse, nor the
more dismaid at the weaknesse
of visible meanes, but to depend
<pb facs="28"/>
onely on the prouidence of God
in prayer, wherein we are to vse
all reuerence, knowing that we
are in the presence of an <hi>infinite
Maiesty.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Our prayers also must be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
without hypocrisie, for hee
is a God that searcheth the
heart, he is iealous, he will not
be mocked, nor can he be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by outward conformity, for
he can finde out a counterfeit;
though <hi>Izaak</hi> could not discouer
<hi>Iaacob</hi> from <hi>Esau: Ahijah</hi> the
Prophet, by the Spirit of God
could discouer disguised <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi>
wife, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 6.
Therefore must our prayers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a sincere, vpright, and
faithfull heart, beleeuing that
God is willing to beare and able
<pb facs="28"/>
to performe what he promiseth:
otherwise we make him a God
without mercy, that can and
will not heare; a God without
truth that can and will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
his promise; or a God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to doe it.</p>
      <p>Pray therefore in faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
humility, and true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion,
pray with the whole
heart without wauering or
doubting, without limiting <hi>the
holy one of Israel,</hi> either in the
time when, the thing what, or
the manner how hee should doe
the thing thou desirest; for hee
knoweth best what, when, and
how to doe all things for thee:
therefore as <hi>Moses</hi> said vnto
the Israelites, <hi>hold you your
peace, and see the saluation of
<pb facs="29"/>
God.</hi> Then pray and be heard,
aske and receiue, seeke and thou
shalt finde fauour with God at
all times, in all places, and vpon
all occasions, euen thy God will
bee ready to helpe in greatest
time of need, which God for his
Christs sake grant, so be it.</p>
