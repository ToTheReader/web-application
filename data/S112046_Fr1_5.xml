                 <title>A treatise of the two sacraments of the Gospell: baptisme and the Supper of the Lord : Divided into two parts. The first treating of the doctrine and nature of the sacraments in generall, and of these two in speciall; together with the circumstances attending them. The second containing the manner of our due preparation to the receiving of the Supper of the Lord; as also, of our behaviour in and after the same. Whereunto is annexed an appendix, shewing; first, how a Christian may finde his preparation to the Supper sweete and easie: secondly, the causes why the sacrament is so unworthily received by the worst; and so fruitlesly by the better sort: with the remedies to avoyd them both. By D.R. B. of Divin. minister of the Gospell</title>

   <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, I could not but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise thee of some cautions in the method and manner of thy reading of these Treatises: and here I would frame my speech to two sorts; the one weaker and more ignorant; the other such as would think themselves more judicious. To the former I say this: First, that whereas weake ones lighting upon a booke of this nature, cloven in two and divided; are ready to enquire whether part is more necessary, and as they fancy, so to take what they list, and leave what they please; falling upon that part which they thinke neerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est joyned with practise, passing by the other as lesse needfull. Therefore I advise all such to use a better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in their reading, and (as <hi>Iosephs</hi> servants did in the search of the sackes,) to begin with the eldest and first, and to end with the last; to reade in order, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>mer Part, to the end of the latter: by which meanes it shall come to passe, that understanding their grounds distinctly and wisely, they shall proceede
<pb facs="12"/> to practise with farre greater light and savour, than otherwise they should do by their confused reading. I observe also another folly in weake ones: That when the occasion of the Sacrament is offered, they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly catch up some booke of that Argument, and while the pang lasteth, spend their devotion upon it, till they be weary; but no whit bend themselves to reade those things which chiefly concerne them: and although they should light upon some such point, yet the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course being coherent, and they very unsetled, can scarse reade over halfe one point: Therefore my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell to such is, To turne their sudden pangs into an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary habit; that is, to devote themselves to a diligent reading and coherent perusall of the things, as they are handled, without slightnesse and needlesse interruption; whereby they shall both meete with such things as doe most concerne their estate, and shall be able (by taking note thereof) to turne to them at their neede, and not to be to seeke of them, nor wander in their reading at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties; which will cause their reading to be sweete, when they feele gaine to ensue thereby.</p>
   <p>The latter caution to the more judicious is this, That whereas some of them affecting to be thought so, when they meete with a booke of this nature, partly contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning contemplation, partly practise: These (I say) are in another extreame, and thinking the latter to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their curious braines, do quite passe it over, and if they thinke to get some new point, of deeper nature than ordinary, or some distinction formerly unknowne to them, out of the contemplative discourse; that they will fasten upon and study hard: labouring indeed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pride themselves with ostentation of some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties
<pb facs="12"/> or depths, than to edifie themselves with any practicall and savory truthes, as they are in Iesus. To these I say this: That although I have beene willing to handle the Theory of this point of a Sacrament, (both because its little looked after, and also for satisfaction of sober desires of knowledge;) yet my cheefe scope was, rather to draw men to love and embrace the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for their true gaine and spirituall commodity, than to humour any frothy braine in meere discourse, to puffe men up withall. In a word, if the well min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Reader shall purchase any thing towards more sound understanding, by these my Collections, I shall be glad; but much more glad, if I should finde, that this knowledge of theirs, did drop as dew, and soake into their hearts and affections, to season them with a pious and conscionable regard of the Sacraments, a more due reverence in preparing themselves to the Table of the Lord, and a more carefull survey of themselves after their Receiving, that so their whole course might bee much better, and their former errors rectified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
   <p>Now as touching the scope of this latter part; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that looke what in my former preface and Treatise, I have endeavored, for opening the Doctrine; that I desire to do in this part, for the stirring up of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise in men, in due preparing themselves, and meete receiving of the Supper. And seeing it is so holy, solemne, and hazardous a worke, it imports us to looke well to our selves in our partaking thereof. Sacraments (my brethren) are no morrall acts, such as the managing of our earthly affaires, buyings, sellings, companies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations and callings are (which yet are holily to bee
<pb facs="13"/> performed) but holy things in their nature, eminently spirituall and religious in themselves. They containe Christ Iesus for the sealing up of birth and prosperity of the soule. As the grace is exceeding spirituall, which they exhibit to beleevers: so is the curse as poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, which they threaten to the abusers. In no one thing doe wee either more aboundantly advantage; nor in any one more endamage our selves, as wee goe to worke. Spirituall ordinances are both spiritually vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and spiritually punished. Hoping that this short item, through mercy shall prevaile as much as a longer with the wise, and craving grace from heaven upon us both, I bid thee farewell.</p>
