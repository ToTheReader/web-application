The right vertuous

FRANCIS, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse
of Warwicke, and
wife to the Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Lord, ROBERT
Earle of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,
&amp;c.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>Right Noble Lady;</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y attempt may
seeme a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but where
<hi>IVDGEMENT</hi>
searcheth out the cause,
and Prudence guideth
Wisdome to weigh the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
the conceit of
wondermēt ceaseth. What
hath induced mee to ioyne
you with your Honourable
<pb facs="4"/>
Lord, needs no long relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
God hath cemented
and combined you together
with the neerest &amp; strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
bands, and therefore I
in my due honoring of both,
presume to conioyne you
both in this one Dedication.</p>
   <p>What is conceiued and
reported of your Honours
worth, thorow all our
Countrey, I must passe
ouer in silence, for well I
know your excellent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie
will not suffer such
(though deserued) a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Your Honour rather
affecting to doe things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
Fame, than Fame
it selfe: And like the fixed
starres, the higher God
hath set you, the lesse you
desire to seeme.</p>
   <p>I confesse I am (as yet)
but a Stranger in these
parts, yet must he be more
strange that meeteth not
with the report of your
Honours vertues: whose
diligent paines in gaining
knowledge of holy things,
and conscionable practise
of what you know: whose
<pb facs="4"/>
humble, sober, wise, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and modest cariage
(rare vertues to be found
in Ladies of so high a place
and ranke) are so many
tongues, and mouthes, and
pens, without mine, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
your due praises.</p>
   <p>And though through the
corruption of these times,
this age is growne so base,
as that one cannot thinke
any to be the better or the
worse for the report that
flies of them, vnlesse they
be eye-witnesses either of
their good or ill; yet where
the sound is all so honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
I dare be confident of
an holy inclination, &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
disposition; which
hath giuen me such encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
as that I haue
little need to misdoubt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your Honours accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of this Treatise, or
to aduise your vse: for I
perswade my selfe that you
wil not only view the title
and Epistle (as the fashion
of most Patrons is) but the
whole book also in some of
those houres which your
<pb facs="5"/>
Honour redeemes (I dare
say) for soule employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
from those idle and
excessiue customes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
too many Ladies please
themselues and none else.</p>
   <p>But I know that your
Honor will be better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
if I turne praises into
praiers: therefore I will
endeuour to supply that
want, this way; beseeching
the God of Maiestie and
mercy, to sanctifie your
heart, yet more and more;
who with the New-yeere
giue you new supplies of
the graces of his Spirit,
and gratiously to encrease
in you the ground of all
true Honor, <hi>Goodnesse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Let me not offend in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
so meane a worke to
so worthy a Personage: the
weaker it is, the more need
hath it of a worthy Patron,
therefore</p>
   <p>
      <hi>I humbly betake it to your Honours fauourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection:
And so your Honour to the protection
of the Highest.</hi>
   </p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your Honours humbly and officiously
deuoted in all dutie,
NEHEMIAH ROGERS.</signed>
