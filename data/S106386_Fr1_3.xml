      </note> the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> by his writings, made account, that the faithfull might reap benefit, euen after himselfe was dead and gone. This considered, I deeme them not vnworthy due commendation, that preserue from perishing, and publish for the vse of posteritie, the works and writings of those, that either in Diuinitie, or other vsefull learning, haue taken paines to some good purpose. As on the other side, I hold them iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, both to the present age, and to future times, that enuie or denie such things the publike, and either fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their owne priuate nests onely with them, or let them lye idle, by them, for wormes and mothes to make meat of. Hauing therefore committed to me, to pervse, and review, some part of the writings of
<pb facs="5"/>
that godly, learned, and iudicious Diuine (now with the Lord) <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> W. Bradshaw,</hi> and finding them to be, not vnlike their Author, full fraught with true piety, sound iudgment, and good schollership; his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations naturall, not coact or far-fetched; his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention rare and not ordinarie; his phrase, though not swelling, yet emphaticall, full of spirit and life; his discourse not extrauagant, but keeping close to the point, and tending mainly to the improuement of piety and godlines: in regard whereof, they seemed neither vnworthy to see further light, nor vnable well to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the light; I was not vnwilling (notwithstanding mine owne occasions and distractions otherwise) out of my loue to the deceassed, and desire of aduancing the common good, to take some paines about the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing and perfecting some of them, and so fitting them for the Presse, And, among the rest, perceiuing these his Meditations on that Second to the Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, to be both pithy and compendious, handling an entire parcell of Scripture, that in our language few haue formerly delt with; as also that himselfe had begun to write them out more fairely and largely, then ordinarie, as intending some such thing, I thought good to breake the ice with them: And so beginning at the entrance into the Second Chapter, where he had left transcribing, out of other his owne notes containing a continued Commentarie to the end of the Epistle (some defects onely supplied) haue I made vp the whole worke. Which if it shall finde such good acceptance, as my desire is it should, and as the worke it selfe (I doubt not) will deserue, I may receiue thereby incouragement to take further paines, about the finishing and fitting
<pb facs="6"/>
for publike view, some other of his labors, that as yet remaine with me, for the good of Gods Church, and the benefit of his poore Wife, and foure fatherles Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans. Had he himselfe, while he liued, put the last hand to the two latter Chapters, as he had done to the first, the whole worke had bin more consummate and exact then now it is. Yet as it is, though not altogither so artificially compact and put togither, and so wanting some of its grace that way, it is for the maine matter of it, in all likelyhood, no other then it would haue bin, had he procceded to perfect it, as may appeare by comparing his second transcript with his first draught, in that that he had finished. That blessed Spirit accompanie the publishing of it, by whose immediate inspiration the Epistle it selfe was at first endited, and by whose gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious assistance, these Meditations on it were formerly conceiued and deliuered; and through his blessing it may proue beneficiall and comfortable to not a few in the reading of it, as in hearing it hath bin the like to many already. To Him commending it and thee, I rest,</p>
