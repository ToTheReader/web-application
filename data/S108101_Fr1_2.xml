      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue followed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of many excellent learned men, which in times past did vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dedicate theyr paynefull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and trauels, according to the worthines thereof, some to Kings, some to Queenes, Princes, Nobles, and other great personages, partly as testimonies of their owne vowed affection and duty toward such worthyes, and partly, as petitioners for protection to their labours vnder their happy patronage: who were therefore as fortresses of defence to support them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such, as then (and the like whereof we want not at this day) lay snarling, and scornefully prying into other mens doings, to blemish and deface the same as much as in their power consisted. In which respect, it was most truely sayd of a learned man, that he may be called a very good Cooke, that is able to make one sawce to serue euery mans taste. Or that man may be called a most perfect and rare man, whose works being published to the viewe of all men, can please euery mans humor, especially in these dayes, wherin, are so many daynty cares, and so many queasy stomacks, with no want of rayling toongs, which <hi>Horatius Morus,</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Ierome Comfort,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of Physicke, declareth, saying: <hi>Is there any thing so</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>sounde, or so passing well handled, which can escape the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tongues of such as would sting</hi> Homer <hi>himselfe, if he were liuing at this day?</hi> Wherfore my louing brethren and freends, (I meane none but you that are the true professors of Chirurgery) vnto you do I most willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer these my simple labours and trauels, as heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore I haue done, hoping also you will as willingly receiue it into your good Patronage, and to defend it with your friendly supportation, and that is all I craue: and that you will accept of it, as did King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the cup of cold water at the hands of poore silly <hi>Sinae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> Then, as for the intemperate eares of the malitious sort, who make no difference between good and bad, or truth from falsehood: yet I trust, they shall do me no more discredit nor hurt, then had <hi>Prometheus</hi> of <hi>Thessalia,</hi> who receiued by the Sword of his mortall enemy, a great wound in his brest, for a full purpose and determination of his death thereby, but contrary to expectation, the same did cure <hi>Prometheus</hi> of a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered sore, which before did greeuously trouble him, so the hand that meant to hurt, did heale, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked determination of an ill digested minde, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his expectation, had a good and happy ende, no more hurt (I hope) nor no lesse good, shall my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies toongs, neither hands procure vnto me.</p>
   <p>And now my friends and Brethren, to whome I so willingly dedicate these my labours, vnderstand you, that my present purpose, through Gods assistance, is to deliuer, for the benefit of all young practizers of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery, certayne obseruations and notes of some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall cures, by my selfe accomplished, with diuers needfull and necessary remedyes, prooued most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
<pb facs="3"/>
not onely for burning with Gunpowder, but also for woundes made with Gunshot, Sword, Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, Harbard, Pike, or Launce, all which, I haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of diuers learned Authors, and by my selfe augmented with an addition also of a most excellent learned Worke, written by <hi>Iohn Almaner,</hi> a Spanish Physition, that doth intreate of the French Disease. Which Treatise, was deliuered me by a good freend and a well willer, vnto all the young practizers of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery, for whose sakes he Translated the same out of Latine into English, and required me to publish it foorthwith: the which, (courteous Reader,) I haue most faythfully set downe, and adioyned it vnto these mine obseruations, with certayne Aphorismes both in English and Latine, very profitable for all young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which are desirous of learning and knowledge.</p>
   <p>In which discourses, if I haue slipped or ouershot my selfe in my penning, I craue pardon, for I knowe, I shall make a rude perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of a good meaning, the which I commit in the end to thy consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and my selfe to thy courtesy.</p>
