      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now (Syr) long time since I not onely desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but fully de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>termined, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of my dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes you, by some peece of my trauell, in this present kinde of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise. The bringing whereof to passe, although I haue oftē sought by perusing many bookes: yet could
<pb facs="4"/> I not light vpō any to answere my contentment (which stood alwayes on the choyce of some such matter, as J thought myght best like you) vntil there chanced into my hands this little frenche aduertisement: The which I had no soner read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but by and by there was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in me a certaine desirousnesse to take it in hād, partly for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumēt therof, which caryeth great cause of likelyhoode to please the reader in generall: but chiefly for my perticular purpose to delight you, whom I know to haue a special inclination to heare and reade the
<pb facs="4"/> discourses of the frenche affayres, bycause you youre selfe in youre yong dais, hauing serued the kings Grandfather <hi>Francis</hi> of Valoys, in his Courte, and trauayled that countrey, haue had good occasion to be acquainted with the customs thereof, and with the nature of the people there. And I doubte not but it will like you so much the better, for the varietie of foraine histories, applyed most aptly to the groūd of the present mater, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is, I say not poudered or fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but fraughted. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, althoughe my liking of the
<pb facs="5"/> worke did hale forward my labour to the translating thereof: yet I must needes say, that after I was somewhat entred thereinto, strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes there stoode vp such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of doubts, and so huge a heape of imperfections to withstand me, as had not my desire to pleasure you preuayled againste all those stoppes and stayes: my trauell and deuotion therein had lyen in the dust, before my race had halfe bin runne. But yet notwithstandyng, the reasons aforesayd, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire I had to do the thing, and the delight I tooke in doing it, wrought
<pb facs="5"/> such persuasion and incouragemēt in me, and did so keepe me still in breath, as I neuer gaue it ouer, till J had turned it into Englishe, in suche sorte, as you my good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may nowe vouchesafe to see: to whome, J moste humbly present it as a newyeeres gift. Therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hartely wishing, that your ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest zeale towardes all wise, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and vertuous proceedynges, (whereof neerenesse in bloud for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth me to speak according ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to your desert, or to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, desire, and duetie) may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, to Gods glory &amp; the profit
<pb facs="6"/> of your countrey. And the same God prosper you and all youre do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges, and blesse you with manye moe newe yeeres, to the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of your owne harts desire.</p>
