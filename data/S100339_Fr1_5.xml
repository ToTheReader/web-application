   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Antiquities of the
first age (except those
we find in sacred Writ)
were buried in obliuion
and silence: silence was succeeded
by Poeticall fables; and Fables a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
were followed by the Records
we now enioy. So that the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and secrets of Antiquity were
distinguished and separated from
the Records and Euidences of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
times, by the vaile of ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which interposed it selfe and
came betweene those things
which perished, and those things
which perished, and those which
are extant. I suppose some are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that my purpose is to write
toyes and trifles, and to vsurpe the
same liberty in applying, that the
Poets assumed in faining, which I
might doe (I confesse) if I listed,
<pb facs="6"/>
and with more serious contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
intermixe these things, to
delight either my selfe in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or others in reading. Neither
am I ignorant how fickle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant
a thing fiction is, as being
subiect to be drawen and wrested
any way, and how great the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
of wit and discourse is, that
is able to apply things well, yet so
as neuer meant by the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
But I remember that this
liberty hath beene lately much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused;
in that many to purchase the
reuerence of Antiquitie to their
owne inuentions and fancies, haue
for the same intent laboured to
wrest many poeticall Fables. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath this old and common va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
bene vsed onely of late or now
and then: for euen <hi>Crisippus</hi> long
agoe did (as an Interpreter of
dreames) ascribe the opinions of the
<pb facs="7"/>
Stoikes to the ancient Poets; and
more sottishly doe the <hi>Chymicks</hi>
appropriate the fancies &amp; delights
of Poets in the transformations of
bodies, to the experiments of their
furnace. All these things (I say)
I haue sufficiently considered and
weighed, and in them haue seene
and noted the generall leuity and
indulgence of mens wits about Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories.
And yet for all this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish
not my opinion. For first
it may not be, that the folly and
loosenesse of a few should alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
detract from the respect due
to the Parables: for that were a
conceit which might sauour of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse
and presumption: for
Religion it selfe doth somtimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in such vailes and shadowes:
so that who so exempts them,
seemes in a manner to interdict all
commerce betweene things diuine
<pb facs="7"/>
and humane. But concerning hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
wisedome, I doe indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously
and freely confesse, that
I am enclined to imagine, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
some of the ancient fictions lay
couched certaine mysteries and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories,
euen from their first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention.
And I am perswaded
(whether rauished with the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Antiquity, or because in
some Fables I finde such singular
proportion betweene the similitude
and the thing signified; and such
apt and cleare coherence in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
structure of them, and propriety
of names wherewith the persons or
actors in them are inscribed and
intitled) that no man can constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny, but this sense was in the
Authours intent and meaning
when they first inuented them, and
that they purposely shadowed it in
this sort: For who can be so stupid &amp;
<pb facs="8"/>
blind in the open light, as (when he
heares how Fame, after the Gyants
were destroyed, sprang vp as their
yongest Sister) not to refer it to the
murmers and seditious reports of
both sides, which are wont to fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
for a time after the suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of insurrections? Or when he
heares how the Gyant <hi>Typhon</hi>
hauing cut out and brought away
<hi>Iupiters</hi> nerues, which <hi>Mercurie</hi>
stole from him, and restored againe
to <hi>Iupiter;</hi> doth not presently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
how fitly it may be applyed to
powerfull rebellions, which take
from Princes their sinewes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and authority, but so, that by
affability of speech, and wise edicts
(the minds of their subiects being
in time priuily, and as it were by
stealth reconciled) they recouer
their strength againe? Or when
he heares how (in that memorable
<pb facs="8"/>
expedition of the Gods against the
Gyants) the braying of <hi>Silenus</hi> his
Asse, conduced much to the profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Gyants; doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
imagine, that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
to shew, how the greatest
enterprises of Rebels are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
dispersed with vaine rumors
and feares?</p>
   <p>Moreouer, to what iudgement
can the conformitie and significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Names</hi> seeme obscure?
Seeing <hi>Metis</hi> the wife of <hi>Iupiter</hi>
doth plainely signifie councell: <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi>
insurrection; <hi>Pan,</hi> vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality;
<hi>Nemesis,</hi> reuenge, and the
like. Neither let it trouble any
man, if sometimes hee meete with
Historicall narrations, or additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for ornaments sake, or confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of times, or something transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from one fable to another, to
bring in a new Allegory: for it
<pb facs="9"/>
could be no otherwise, seeing they
were the inuentions of men, which
liued in diuers ages, and had also
diuers ends: some being auncient,
others neotericall: some hauing an
eye to things naturall, others to
morall.</p>
   <p>There is another Argument (and
that no small one neither) to prooue
that these Fables containe certaine
hidden and inuolued meanings,
seeing some of them are obserued
to be so absurd and foolish in the
very relation, that they shew, and
as it were proclaime a parable afar
off: for such tales as are probable,
they may seeme to be inuented for
delight, and in imitation of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And as for such as no man
would so much as imagin or relate,
they seem to be sought out for other
ends: For what kinde of fiction is
that, wherein <hi>Iupiter</hi> is said to
<pb facs="9"/>
haue taken <hi>Metis</hi> to wife, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
that she was with child, to
haue deuoured her, whence him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
conceiuing, brought forth
<hi>Pallas</hi> armed out of his head? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I thinke there was neuer dreame
(so different to the course of cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and so full of monstrosity) euer
hatcht in the braine of man. Aboue
all things this preuailes most with
me, and is of singular moment, that
many of these Fables seeme not to
be inuented of those by whom they
are related and celebrated, as by
<hi>Homer, Hesiod,</hi> and others: for
if it were so, that they tooke begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in that age, and from those
Authours by whom they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
and brought to our hands;
My mind giues me there could be
no great or high matter expected,
or supposed to proceed from them in
respect of these originals. But if
<pb facs="10"/>
with attention we consider the
matter, it will appeare that they
were deliuered and related as
things formerly beleeued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
and not as newly inuented
and offered vnto vs. Besides, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are diuersly related by
Writers that liued neere about one
and the selfe same time, we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
perceiue that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
things, deriued from prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
memorials: and that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
various by reason of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
ornaments bestowed on them
by particular relations. And the
consideration of this must needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in vs a great opinion of
them, as not to be accounted either
the effects of the times or inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Poets, but as sacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
or abstracted ayres of better
times, which by tradition from
more ancient Nations fell into the
<pb facs="10"/>
Trumpets and Flutes of the Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
But if any doe obstinately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that Allegories are alwaies
aduentitially, &amp; as it were by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
neuer naturally and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
included in Fables, we will not
be much troublesome, but suffer
them to enioy that grauity of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which I am sure they affect,
although indeed it be but lumpish
and almost leaden. And (if they
be worthy to be taken notice of)
we will begin afresh with them in
some other fashion.</p>
   <p>There is found among men (and
it goes for currant) a two-fold vse
of Parables, and those (which is
more to be admired) referred to
contrary ends; conducing as well
to the foulding vp and keeping of
things vnder a vaile, as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning
and laying open of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurities.
But omitting the former
<pb facs="11"/>
(rather then to vndergoe wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and assuming ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
as things vagrant and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
onely for delight) the latter
must questionlesse still remaine, as
not to be wrested frÅ vs by any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of wit, neither can any (that
is but meanely learned) hinder, but
it must absolutely be receiued, as a
thing graue and sober, free from
all vanitie, and exceeding profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and necessary to all sciences.
This is it (I say) that leads the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of man by an easie and
gentle passage through all nouell
and abstruse inuentions, which
any way differ from common recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
opinions. Therefore in the first
ages (when many humane inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and conclusions, which are
now common and vulgar, were
new and not generally knowen) all
things were full of Fables, aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes,
<pb facs="11"/>
parables, and similies of all
sortes: by which they sought to
teach and lay open, not to hide and
conceale knowledge, especially, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the vnderstandings of men
were in those times rude and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient,
and almost incapable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
subtilties, such things onely
excepted, as were the obiects of
sense: for as <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
letters, so parables were more
ancient then Arguments. And
in these daies also, he that would
illuminate mens minds anew in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
old matter, and that not with
disprofit and harshnesse, must abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
take the same course, and
vse the help of similies. Wherefore
all that hath beene said, wee will
thus conclude: The Wisedome of
the Ancients, it was either much
or happy; Much if these figures
and tropes were inuented by studie
<pb facs="12"/>
and premeditation. Happy if they
(intending nothing lesse) gaue
matter and occasion to so many
worthy Meditations. As concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
my labours (if there bee any
thing in them which may do good)
I will on neither part count them
ill bestowed, my purpose being to
illustrate either Antiquity, or
things themselues. Neither am I
ignorant that this very subiect
hath beene attempted by others:
But to speake as I thinke, and that
freely without ostentation, the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
and efficacy of the thing is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
lost by these mens writings,
though voluminous and full of
paines, whilst not diuing into the
depth of matters, but skilfull one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in certaine common places, haue
applyed the sense of these Parables
to certaine vulgar and generall
things, not so much as glancing at
<pb facs="12"/>
their true vertue, genuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie,
and full depth. I (if I be
not deceiued) shall be new in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
things. Wherefore leauing
such as are plaine and open, I will
ayme at further and richer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
