   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LBEIT that all Christians who now inhabite the world beleeue in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Iesus Christ, beleeue the holy scriptures, yet they be seuered into two parts. The one doubteth not to receiue the sence of the sacred text as the Church doth propound &amp; teach, &amp; heereto they conforme their faith: And these be calde Catholiques. The other part supposing the authoritie of the Church to be falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; obnoxious to errors, teacheth that ech Christian may, yea ought in matter concerning faith censure the doctrine of the whole church by the sacred scriptures, &amp; so either receiue or refuse the same: &amp; these, euer were &amp; are now at this present, branded with the name of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</p>
   <p>which error in regard that many learned diuines haue clearlie confuted and confounded both by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of sacred Scriptures as also by that of councels, fathers &amp; other arguments tending to the purpose; I intend not in such a sence to debate this question, but only to note &amp; sett doune what absurdities doe necessarilie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sew the said rule of beleefe which misbeleeuing Christiās as Lutherans Protestants Puritans &amp;c. haue forged to them selues in the shopp of their self conceite to found
<pb facs="3"/>
their faith there-vpon; which howbeit many haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before mee, yet (if I be not mistaken) no one, hath on sett purpose treated of the same; Therefore I deeme not my labour ill spent (though otherwise busied in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of imporrance) to imparte tyme to this worke which I will doe in as few words as may be; And this (as all things els) for the honour &amp; glorie of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ &amp; his most holie mother, to whom (not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of their benefitts) I haue vowed, whatsoeuer I sett downe in writinge, though neare someane &amp; small. Fare well freindly reader &amp; recommend mee in thy prayres to God.</p>
