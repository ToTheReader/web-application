      </hi> (sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one well) <hi>should bee, not so much bookes packt vp with paper, and blackt ouer with inke, as Treasuries replenisht with variety of choysest learning:</hi> Nor (as I conceiue) empty coffers filled with the fome and fume of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle heads, nor dead mens coffins pestered with the rotten carrion of prophane, filthy, and corrupted hearts, nor olde chests stuffed with rusty iron, thread bare rags, and refuse geare; but rich cabinets, at whose opening the Reader might finde store, new and old, of the best and rarest things which <hi>Canaan, Greece,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> doth yield. With which varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I do too well know, that it is beyond my scant store to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the table, and entertaine my guests. I am therefore well content to sit still, and chuse rather to feed vpon the sweet and wholesome hony which other industrious Bees gather and bring vnto the hiue, applauding their well furnisht and well polisht works; then to come vpon the publique stage to do that which needs not, or attempt that which I cannot, either with iust shame for my Bayardlike boldnes, or euen from the most fauourable, with more pity for my well mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then prayse for my well deseruing. Notwithstanding, lighting vpon this Sermon of that both learned and godly Diuine, <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Paul Baine</hi> (of whose gracious ability in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Gods word, somtime your owne eares, &amp;, I perswade my selfe, your harts also were witnesses) as a poore orphane babe of a deceased friend, as for the memory of its Author, which will euer be deare vnto mee, I did gladly embrace and entertaine it: so induced by the example of others, who with good acceptance and seruice to the Church, publish both
<pb facs="3"/> larger Treatises and briefe Sermons of his making; I haue ventured to shew my selfe so farre on this Theater, as to set it forth to publike view, and make it common vnto others with mee. Wherein good men, I presume, will both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my good meaning, to doe that for them by the labours of other men, which I cannot by mine owne (that is to set forward their knowledge in the great mysterie of godlinesse) and conne mee thanke, who haue set vp for them such a faire and cleere light, to discouer that abstruse mystery, and to light them onward in that way. For, there is scarce in the Book of God, a Mine that is more rich and aboundant in diuine metall and mystery, then the Text handled in this Sermon. In which at one viewe, as in a cleere mirrour, there is presented to vs the fountaine (Gods eternall loue) from which all good blessings issue and flowe forth vnto vs; the common cisterne (Iesus Christ, the onely begotten of God, bestowed on vs) in whō al these blessings (as al wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Sea) are gathered together, and inclosed; the bucket (Faith) whereby wee may draw out of this Well whatsoeuer grace wee doe neede; Lastly, the most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and sweet waters, which are heere in plentifull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for vs to draw and drinke of: that is, euerlasting blisse and saluation of soule and body. It is much then to bee wished, that as this Scripture is familiar in the mouthes of many; so the mysteries thereof were well vnderstood and close applied to their hearts. Whereunto this Treatise, I dare promise, will affoord some good helpe to those that will deigne diligently to peruse it▪ For, herein the foresaid points are discussed and discoursed, with that equall mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of learning and pietie, that both the learned shall meete with some things not very common perhaps not to increase,
<pb facs="4"/> yet to renew his more secret knowledge, and whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept therefore (much respected Sirs) this slender present which I offer you, as the best acknowledgement which I can make of your constant loue and kindnesse, whereby I haue had speciall comfort in the place where I liue. It were happely more credit for mee to make this whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer satisfaction out of mine owne stocke: but it will bee your greater gaine, that I doe it out of anothers purse: Mine owne would proue but short pay, and copper coine;
<pb facs="4"/> whereas what heere I haue borrowed to tender vnto you, is currant and pure gold of Gods sanctuary: which, if it please you to put it vp, will adde some good increase to your spirituall treasure of sauing knowledge. What on my part is wanting in performance, I will make vp with my harty desires and prayers for your prosperous state in the world, and spirituall welfare in the Lord.</p>
