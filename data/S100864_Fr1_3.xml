      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Lutarch</hi> in a Treatise, wherein he sheweth how a man may winne profite by the malice of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, doeth manifest his drift and purpose with this conuenient simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: That men of olde, in their encounters with saluage and wilde beasts, thought to haue made a great hand, if they coulde but saue and defende themselues from their iniuries and violence: But the succeeding ages proceeded further, conuerting the flesh of them vnto foode, their haire to the vse of garments, and their very gall, and other partes of them, to sundry most wholesome medicines: Yea the whole outward proportion of their fearefull
<pb facs="3"/>
shape, I meane their skinnes, which before had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man nothing but death, he afterward addressed to be conuenient Armour to saue him from harmes, and defend him from destruction. So that the life of man which to the foregoing Ages seemed to be miserable by hauing wilde beastes, to their Posteritie following should haue appeared in part miserable, if they had wanted wilde beastes. And Plutarch alleageth <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> to haue beene of this iudgement; That although some man can content him to escape the iniuries of his enemies; yet is it the part of the wise and valiant min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make profite of their malice, by vsing such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie in attending his owne wayes, and marking his aduersaries, that the whole course of his life shoulde seeme nothing so happy and commendable, were it so in deede that vtterly he had none enemies at all.</p>
   <p>Much in like sort, (my very honorable good Lord) fareth it with our Nauigators; who at the first aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to forsake the maine land, betaking themselues to the wide Ocean Sea, vpon the credit and fidelitie which they reposed on the Sailing Compasse; constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeuing that it had euery where shewed the true North and South, and semblably all the other windes. But dangerous and dolefull experience within short time made it plaine and manifest, that where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed greatest trust, there was some treacherie: For the vpholder of their life and safetie, did sometimes mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leade
<pb facs="3"/>
them into destruction, and caried them in the proceeding of their course farre distant (they knew not whither) from that he in the beginning pretended. This vncertaintie therefore being so dangerous an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of their new practised arte, with might and maine they encountered: And hauing at length found out some tolerable meanes to auoide it, they thought them selues to haue done ynough, and rested therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. But in this pregnant Age wherein we liue, the expert and skilfull Nauigators haue proceeded yet further, and made of that (as it were) venimous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of misleading an Antidote against it selfe; yea they vse it in steade of an armour and defence against error and perils. So that though in the rude beginnings of former times, men were drawen by it into many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities: yet in the setled experience of these our dayes they reioyce therein (being vsed and ordered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly) as in a thing greatly concerning their good and welfare. But this is a principall secret, onely kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen vnto those that are of greatest skill among them.</p>
   <p>A memorable example hereof fell out Anno 1586. when Sir Frances Drake, a Gentleman of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, in his VVest Indian victorious voyage, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the harbour of Cartagena, arriued some small time after at the VVestermost point of Cuba, called <hi>Cape S. Antony,</hi> and hauing stayed there some fewe dayes, put to Sea for <hi>Virginia,</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
<pb facs="4"/>
of our Countreymen that were there in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and distresse: Hauing continued at the Sea six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes tossed with variable windes, they came at last within sight of land: but by no meanes could they discerne, or giue any probable ghesse what lande it should be. So it was, that one of Southhampton, being an expert and skilfull Nauigator (though of other conditions not so good, but better might haue bin wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed) for his frowardnesse, hauing receaued disgrace before, was notwithstanding vpon this necessitie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto conference: where, after Sir Francis had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on him some part of his eloquent perswasions and faire promises, at length he vndertaketh to doe his best. And hauing made his obseruations according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Arte, he pronounced in laughing and disdainefull maner (because his aduise was not taken in the setting of their course) that looke what land they had bin at sixteene dayes before, the very same precisely was the land that now they were at againe. VVhich assertion of his being reiected, as a thing impossible, by all those of skill in the company, and especially by Sir Francis himselfe not without reprochfull wordes; he still per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuered therein, and assured them, that vpon his life they should finde it so: like as in the ende they did.</p>
   <p>This coulde he neuer haue done without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Variation of the Compasse; as the partie himselfe more then once with great earnestnesse hath
<pb facs="4"/>
protested vnto me in conference that I haue had with him concerning those matters. Yea besides the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar knowledge of Places, the expert Nauigator stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in great hope hereby to attaine vnto good helpes for the finding of <hi>Longitudes,</hi> and according vnto the Poet, <q>Non fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem Cogitat: vt speciosa dehinc miracula promat.</q>
   </p>
   <p>But this is a matter somewhat daintie among the chiefest of them: As for the rest, in all their conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the <hi>Variation,</hi> they may as yet (for all their faire shewes) be well likened vnto Chapmen, that are merchandizing for the skinne of a wilde beast, before the beast be taken.</p>
   <p>The great necessitie hereof, and the singular loue that for many yeres I haue borne to that laudable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, and to the industrious practisers thereof, hath at length perswaded me, not onely to contriue certaine Instruments fitted for sundry their purposes, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for taking the Variation of the Compasse; but also to set foorth diuers other principall vses of them, together with the Descriptions of the Instruments themselues. All which I doe the rather Dedicate to your Honorable Lordship, both in regard of my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate duetie, as also of an earnest desire to doe them the more good: who by that meanes (I am right sure) will the sooner be induced to peruse these short Treatises
<pb facs="5"/>
with the more willingnesse, and to consider of them with the lesse preiudice. So that my good hope is, fewe of them will be founde, in whom reason shall haue so weake ankerhold, as to thinke that a man of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession would seeme to intrude himselfe into the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of their Arte; and especially belonging to your Lordship, durst offer to the viewe of the world vnder your Lordships name, any thing that he knewe not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly to stand grounded vpon infallible certainetie of trueth.</p>
   <p>Touching experience in these matters, of my selfe I haue none: For, (besides the diuersitie of my calling,) by naturall constitution of body, euen when I was yong and strongest, I altogether abhorred the Sea: howbeit, that antipathie of my body against (as the Italian ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it) so barbarous an Element, could neuer hinder the sympathie of my minde, and heartie affection tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards so worthie an Arte as Nauigation is; tied, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, to that Element, if you respect the outward toile of the hand, but clearely freed therefrom, if you regard the apprehension of the mind: And in the minde onely, pure and true Arte, refined from the drosse of sensible or experimentall knowledge, is to be found. VVhich when I perceaued must needes so be, and that the great skill of our Seamen was not performed either by rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of chaunce, or strangenesse of miracle, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to certaine vniuersall precepts or documents,
<pb facs="5"/>
deriued from the fountaines Mathematicall, being the substance of that Arte; so farre as the studies of my profession, and other my necessary affaires would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, I endeuoured by little and little to vnderstande somewhat thereof: And that which I thus learned by speculation, I haue conferred off with some of the skilfullest Nauigators of our Land; with such as haue bin principall Actors in our furthest Northeast and Northwest discoueries; with such as haue bin in the South Sea, and at the Cape of <hi>Bona Speransa;</hi> and also with Naturalists of the East Indies. I haue ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the consideration of the making of all their Instruments, together with the maner of their obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by them both on Land and Sea: And as I haue by conferring with them from time to time learned what they most desired and stoode in greatest neede off so framed I mine instruments accordingly; answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for all purpose of practise vnto theirs, but for commodiousnes thereof, somewhat better, I doubt not, (if sincere triall be made) and for certaine points of chiefe importance, perfourming that, which all theirs hitherto in any common vse neuer could doe. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I haue already the allowance of some among them, whom I haue esteemed to be of the greatest skill and practise: And very willing am I to stand to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the rest of like skill.</p>
   <p>A true prouerbe it is; he which buildeth in the
<pb facs="6"/>
market-place, shall be sure of many controwlers of his worke. And that made me stand long in suspence, whether I should suppresse, or set foorth these conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of mine. Of their trueth, their commodious vse, yea and of the good acceptance of them among those of the better sort, I nothing doubted: But how strange it would seeme vnto some, that a man of my calling should deale in this Argument; that in deede did a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle trouble me; easily coniecturing that many woulde thinke I haue forgotten my selfe, and walked herein beyond the bounds of my profession.</p>
   <p>As for my profession, I thanke God, I haue exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the preaching of the Gospell nowe these twentie yeeres, in a Countrey where both Preachers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell haue some store of aduersaries: And I trust that my trauaile therein hath not bin such, that I greatly neede be ashamed thereof, or can iustly be chalenged, that I euer, as a man carelesse, neglected my calling. But recording with my selfe, that the dispersion of Nations came by the confusion of Languages: vpon which occasion, they spread themselues ouer the face of the whole earth; yea and planted themselues (a thing most strange vnto our Capacitie) in many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding remote Ilands in the Ocean Sea: and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the knowledge of languages groweth by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse and mutuall accesse; I perceaued that God nowe towardes the ende of the worlde, had ordeyned
<pb facs="6"/>
the sayling Compasse to be the notable meanes and Instrument of this entercourse; euen thereby to ioyne dispersed Nations, not onely into the Ciuill or rather Cosmopoliticall vnion of humane societie; but also (as Christian hope bindeth vs to thinke) through the knowledge and faith of the Gospel, into the spirituall and mysticall fellowship of that Heauenly Ierusalem: And so by meanes hereof to make mutuall amitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene people and people, though neuer so farre sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; and to giue this as a leading guide, to carrie the sound of the Gospell, as the band of loue, into all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed Islands and out-Angles of the world. (For God (as the Apostle speaketh) hath made all mankind of one blood, to dwell vpon all the face of the Earth; and hath assigned the times which were ordeined before, and the boundes of their habitation, that they might seeke the Lord:) weighing (I say) this with my selfe, that God of his infinite wisedome and vnspeakeable loue toward mankind, had appointed this simple In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument in shewe, to performe matters of such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable importance; that the wisedome of man wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this one, with all the other Instruments of the world coulde not possibly haue done, I did therefore iudge it a matter not vnfit for a Preacher of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, to set to his helping hand for aduaūcing a Faculty that so much tendeth to Gods glorie in the spreading of the Gospell. Nowe if this be not against Diuinitie,
<pb facs="7"/>
doubtlesse to preserue men from danger, and to direct the wanderer, cannot be against humanitie: Against the duetie of a Subiect it cannot be, to further that knowledge, by which her Maiesties power is augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and her Royall name continually caried to all the quarters of the world. Finally against my duetie in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall towards my natiue Countrey it is not, to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour what in me lieth, the good encreasing of that skill, whereon dependeth a great part of the prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this Realme.</p>
   <p>And if this were a worke that in the highest degree performed all these, my part it were, (though I were a mere stranger,) of very right to present and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate it, rather vnto your Lordship, then to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Because your sincere loue towardes our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, your duetifull and loyall affection towardes her gracious Maiestie, your humanitie so full of honour towards all men, proceeding from the vnfained feare of God, (which continually encreasing, encreaseth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the rest,) doeth in such plentifull measure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abounde, that I dare appeale vnto him who is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Iudge of consciences, &amp; the tryer of all trueths, I doe herein affirme such a trueth without flatterie, as your enemies themselues cannot denie, but being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestered with enuie.</p>
   <p>Vouchsafe therefore mine Honourable good Lord, of your noble disposition, fauourably to accept this
<pb facs="7"/>
small Treatise, (such as it is) which of duetie and good will is offered vnto you; protecting it so farre foorth, and no further, then the trueth of demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and commodiousnesse of the conclusions shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue. And thus beseeching the Almightie to blesse your Lordship, to encrease his good giftes in you, and to prosper all your Honourable affaires: I commend your Lordship, and al yours in my humble and heartie prayers, vnto the protection of him, from whom all good giftes doe descend, and with whom there is no variablenesse, nor any sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of change; but yesterday, to day, and is the same for euer.</p>
