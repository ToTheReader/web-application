      </gap>orkemanshippe and rare Architecture.</p>
   <p>The people are more swarty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion then the Spaniardes be, almost like the tawny Mores, and something lesse of stature commonly then those of our nation be. They are for the most part of pregnant siuely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ittes, of exceeding memory, of stoute <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ouragious mindes, and wonderfull patience in occasions of aduersity. Commonly they be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>aughty and high minded, very desirous of
<pb n="22" facs="12"/>honour and estimation. They do contemne all other Nations in the world in comparison of themselues, from whence proceedeth the small account they make of any strangers that come into theyr country. Pouerty doth not with them diminish Nobility, nor Gentility nor wealth gaine or increase it. The better sort do vse great cerimonies of honour and courtesy one towardes another: yea the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people as tradesmen and artificers must be vsed with respect, or else you shall obteyne nothing at theyr handes: neyther will they put vp intury at any man without complete reuenge. They are very carefull not to shew feare or cowardize in any case: they stand much vpon theyr grauity, and therefore they carry thēselues alwaies very soberly &amp; after a stayed manner: in so much that it is held a wondrous inciuility for any to make any great noyse, as shouting, hollowing, or the like, whether it be in publike or priuate, at home or abroad. To bring vp theyr children to hardnes, as soone as they be new borne they wash them in some riuer, and when they be weaned from the nurse, they take
<pb n="23" facs="12"/>them from theyr mothers, &amp; bring them vp most commonly in exercise of hunting &amp; the like: when they come to a certaine age they change the forme &amp; fashion of their apparrel, vsing therein very many cerimonies.</p>
   <p>They haue diuers fashions very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from ours: with vs men weare hattes &amp; women euer somethinge on theyr heades: they both men and women go bareheaded at all times, and in all occasions, both in the heate and could, in sunne and wind, in haile, in snow and raine: they mourne in white as we do in blacke, &amp; blacke with them is worne in signe of ioy: we hould it good to haue white teeth, they thinke it otherwise, and therefore dye them black: we get on horse blacke on the right side, they on the left: we when in meeting we salute put of our hattes, they put of theyr shoes. When they visit one another, he that is visited must not go out to meete the other that commeth to visit him, nor rise vp if he be set in any place, but rather contrary, if he be standing he sittes downe to receiue him. Our manner of musi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ke is not gratefull vnto them, our meates dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastfull,
<pb n="24" facs="13"/>our sweet odoriferous smels odious and abominable. They cure their sicke quite contrary to vs, giuing them raw meates, and salt and sower thinges to eate. In steed of kniues and spoones they vse two woodden stickes exceeding curiously, and after a farre neater fashion then we they vse to eate their meate. Whereas we write from one side of the paper to the other, they write from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oppe to the bottome of the leafe, making their liues downeward.</p>
   <p>In all <hi>Iapone</hi> there is but one only language, the which yet is so exceeding copious, and of that variety, that it may seeme to be many, by reason that for almost euery thinge they haue very many wordes, whereof some do signify it when mention is made thereof in contemptible manner, others when in honorable sashion; some are to be vsed onely by the common people, others only by those of Nobility or Gentry: some are only for men, others only for women: theyr manner of writing is very different also from their speach; and theyr writing letters from theyr writing bookes: theyr cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
<pb n="25" facs="13"/>or letters are of a fashion farre different from ours, and of that nature that with one only letter they signify sometimes a whole word, sometimes many words.</p>
   <p>In times past there was but one only King in all <hi>Iapone</hi> who was Monarch ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and obeyed and reuerenced exceedingly of all, and liued with wondrous state and maiesty, and him they called the <hi>Dayri</hi> or <hi>Vo:</hi> but these <hi>Dayries</hi> giuing themselues at length by occasion of the great peace and quietnesse they enioyed to sloth and idlenes, and to all kind of voluptuous pleasures and delightes, about <hi>500.</hi> yeares ago were by two principall captaines that rebelled against them, dispossessed of a great part of the Kingdome, they making themselues kinges of all they could get and maintaine by force of armes, and afterwardes others moued by theyr example did the like: so that within short time the <hi>Dayri,</hi> although he still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned with the title of vniuersall Lord of all <hi>Iapone,</hi> yet had he small or no iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction at all, only a power to giue titles of honour and dignity according vnto mens
<pb n="26" facs="14"/>desires or desertes, the which he enioyeth to thi day without any gouernement at all, scarce hauing meanes to maintaine himselfe in honorable fashion.</p>
   <p>Since those times to these, he hath euer beene accounted King our Empe or of <hi>Iapone</hi> that could by any meanes make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe Lord of the <hi>Tenca,</hi> that is, of some few Kingdomes or Prouinces neere adioyning to <hi>Meaco,</hi> which is the principall Citty of all those countreys, as London is in ours; and so in our dayes there haue beene three who haue had the name and authority of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour one after the other, not by any right or title of election or inheritance, but obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by maine force, or other wrongfull meanes. The first of them was called <hi>Nobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanga</hi> who conquered six and thirty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. The second <hi>Taycosama,</hi> or <hi>Quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacù,</hi> who being a man very meanely borne, brought vnder his dominion fifty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes or Prouinces. The third is the <hi>Xogun</hi> who re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>gneth at the present, and hath raysed the persecution (whereof this booke intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) against the Christians, and he as it
<pb n="27" facs="14"/>seemeth is acknowledged as Lord of all the threescore and six Kingdomes of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponia.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>These Emperours as absolute Lords and owners of all the country, do dispose of al thinges as their pleasure, and therefore for their owne greater security as soone as they haue gotten the gouerment by force or other meanes into their handes, they deuide the kingdomes or prouinces vnto diuers of their freinds, with obligation that they shall serue them in time of war with a certaine number of men, at their owne charges and expences: and these againe do deuide their prouinces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst their freindes with the like obligation to be ready to serue them in all occasions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing to themselues sufficient for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their house and family: so that all the whole country doth in such maner depend of the Emperour, that he giues and takes, rayseth and pulleth downe, enricheth and impouerisheth whome, and when, and how he pleaseth. And it is the custom amongst them when they take from any one their Prouince or Estate, or change them to another, that
<pb n="28" facs="15"/>al the gentlemen and souldiers that did depēd vpon that person, do leaue that prouince to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him, and either go with him, or else seeke meanes to liue in some other place, the trade semen, artificers, husbandmen, and laborers onely remaining therein.</p>
   <p>Those that be the Lords or petty kinges of particular prouinces or kingdomes, as also all other principall personages, as gouernors of townes and Citties, besides the obligation aboue mentioned, are bound at the begining of euery yere, betwixt the ninth &amp; twentith day of the first moone (for their acount is by Moones, and after a different manner farre from ours) to go vnto the Emperors Court to do him homage, and acknowledge their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards him, and togeather therwith they must alwaies offer him some thinge of good value by way of present, whereby he draweth to himselfe the greatest part of all the wealth of the contry, &amp; by meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, togeather with his owne reuenews (which amount to two milliōs or more euery yeare) be groweth in short time to be exceeding rich potent, strong, and so powerfull that none
<pb n="29" facs="15"/>almost dare withstand or contradict him in any thing, no though he make himself a God, as diuers of them haue procured to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and esteemed.</p>
   <p>And indeed most of these that be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored amongst them as Gods, were eyther kinges famous for their valour in warre, and feates of armes, or else <hi>Bonzos</hi> singularly noted for their learning and eloquence, or strict rigorous course of life. These last they call <hi>Totoques,</hi> the other <hi>Camis,</hi> of whom they aske only earthly goods, tēporall blessings and benefittes, as of the <hi>Totoques</hi> they do onely the selicity of the future life. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall or cheife of all these be two, the one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Xaca,</hi> the other <hi>Amida,</hi> whome they worship and inuoke with great reuerence and deuotion. Their <hi>Bonzos</hi> which be those that teach and preach vnto them, as our preistes to vs, be deuided into ten or eleuen diuers Sectes, very contrary amongst themselues, though the most of them do agree in denying the prouidence of God, and immortality of the soule, the which they do to the end they may liue with more liberty, and more freely
<pb n="30" facs="16"/>giue thēselues to al kind of lewd licentiousnes. Besides these Gods som do adore the Heauens the Sunne and Stares, others Oxen, Stags and other baser creatures. Not farre from <hi>Meaco</hi> they haue a sumptuous Temple dedicated to the <hi>Lisard,</hi> which they reuerence as the God of learning, wisdome and eloquence. Many there be that do adore the Diuel who doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto them in sundry formes and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and makes them considently beleeue that all thinges do depend of him, and that they prosper or haue ill successe according to the deuotion they beare and shew to him.</p>
   <p>And in this miserable blindnes was al that whole contry vntil the yeare of our Lord <hi>1549.</hi> in which the Blessed Father <hi>Francis Xauier,</hi> a Preist of the Society of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and one of the ten Companions of the holy Father <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> of happy memory who was the first Founder of that worthy Religious Order, did enter thereinto to preach vnto them the Gospel of our Sauiour Iesus Christ; the which he did vpon this occasion.</p>
   <p>There was in a certeine port towne of <hi>Iapone</hi> called <hi>Cangoxima</hi> in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="31" facs="16"/>of <hi>Saxuma</hi> a wealthy substantial man named <hi>Angier,</hi> who in his youth had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted some enormous crime, and finding afterwardes his conscience much burdened and tormented therewith, vsed all meanes possible he could inuent, or that the <hi>Bonzos</hi> could imagine to aduise him, to obteyne some remedy therefore, and procure the peace and quiet of his mind: but hauing after experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence made of all the remedies that any of the Sectes of his country could affoard, foūd that his affliction did still endure, he was euen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most out of hope of euer obteyning ease or remedy; vntill it happening afterwardes that the <hi>Portugalls</hi> comming with some ships vnto <hi>Cangoxima</hi> to traffique about mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise, were an occasion of raysing a new hope in him; for he falling into familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with some of them, and after much other talk hauing had by theyr meanes some notice of Christian religion, as also of the great Sanctity and holinesse of life of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Francis Xauier,</hi> who at that time was famous in all the East Indies, thought with himselfe, that perhaps by his meanes
<pb n="32" facs="17"/>he might find some salue for the soare of is wounded and afflicted conscience. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon resoluing to go and seeke him out, he left his house, wife and family, freinds kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes and country, and taking with him onely a seruant or two he wēt with the <hi>Portugals,</hi> &amp; after many dangers past at sea of stormes, tem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>estes, soule weather, and the like, he arriued at length at <hi>Malaca,</hi> a towne of great trade and traffique in the East Indies, and there by good fortune to his great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he found the Father whom he sought, and from thence went with him to <hi>Goa,</hi> the chiefe Citty that the <hi>Portugalls</hi> possessed in all those countryes; where hauing found by following his direction as much ease and comfort of his mind as he did wish for and desire, and being sufficiently instructed in all the mysteries of Christian Religion, he was baptized by him, and named <hi>Pablo de la santa Fe</hi> that is, <hi>Paul of the holy Faith.</hi>

   <p>Hauing thus obteyned his desire, and being after some time to retourn againe into his country, the Blessed Father <hi>Xauier,</hi> whose whole desire was to propagate the
<pb n="33" facs="17"/>fayth of Christ to the honor and glory of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migty God, and for the saluation of mens soules, would needes accompany him, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him other two of the Society, the one a Priest called Father <hi>Cosmo de Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> the other a lay brother whose name was <hi>Iohn Fernandez</hi> both of them Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes borne: and so they all departed from <hi>Goa</hi> in the moneth of April <hi>1549.</hi> and at the end of May they came to <hi>Malaca,</hi> from whence they arriued at <hi>Cangoxima</hi> in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone</hi> about the middest of August: where being welcommed and well receiued of the freindes, kinred, and acquaintance of <hi>Paul</hi> the new conuerted Christian, and hauing with much labour and iudustry learned a little of the <hi>Iaponian</hi> language, they began to preach the Christian fayth publikely to all with the good leaue and liking of the Lord or Prince of the countrey, who hoping to haue some benefit by the comming of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugalls</hi> into his countrey was content to giue way to the Fathers, and let them preach: but afterwardes perceiuing that some of the <hi>Portugells</hi> leauing his Porte went vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="34" facs="18"/>not farre off called <hi>Tirando</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Tigen,</hi> he withdrew his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour from them, and by instigation of the <hi>Bonzos</hi> made a Proclamation, that vnder payne of death none of his subiects should leaue their former Sectes to imbrace the Christian religion. Whereupon Father <hi>Xauier</hi> after he had in vaine vsed all possible diligence to mollify the King, and suffered diuers incommodities and iniuries with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding patience, taking his leaue of those Christians that were already made, which amounted to the number of an hundred or there aboutes, he went vnto <hi>Tirando</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his two companions, where being now somewhat more expert in the <hi>Iaponian</hi> tongue then they were before, setting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to preach, partly thereby and partly by the rare example of their liues, they moued more in a few dayes to imbrace the sayth of Christ, and to receiue the holy Sacrament of baptisme, then they had done in a yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at <hi>Cangoxima.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Father <hi>Xauier</hi> did perswade himselfe that if he could get vnto <hi>Meaco,</hi> which was
<pb n="35" facs="18"/>the cheife Citty of <hi>Iapon,</hi> &amp; the place where the <hi>Cubosama,</hi> who was then the chiefe King of all the country, did keepe his Court, that there he might do more good, and sooner come to giue notice of Christ and his religion to the principall persons of the Kingdome, then in any other place: and therefore hauing commended the care of the new conuerted Christians in <hi>Cangoxima</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponian,</hi> and those of <hi>Tirando</hi> to Father <hi>Cosmo de Torres,</hi> he and brother <hi>Iohn Fernandez</hi> tooke their iourney towardes <hi>Meaco,</hi> and about the beginning of October they got vnto <hi>Amanguchi</hi> a goodly Citty at that time, for since it hath beene burned, sacked, and destroyed, euen in the hart of all <hi>Iapone,</hi> almost three hundred miles distant from <hi>Tirando,</hi> whither being come, they were carried vnto the king or Prince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, vnto whom they declared in the best manner they could the principall mysteries of Christian religion, he neither shewing liking nor dislike of any thing they sayd: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes they did the like in the publike streets and market places of the Citty, wherein by
<pb n="36" facs="19"/>reason they were but meanely apparreled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the custome of religious men, and spake the <hi>Iaponian</hi> language but very bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenly, they were not only derided and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of all, but also iniured and handled very hardly by some of the ruder sort. From thence they went vnto <hi>Meaco,</hi> and in their iourney which endured well nigh two monethes, they suffered exceeding many miseries. First they went barefoote all the way, and then because the wayes were very dangerous and full of theeues who murthered all they robbed, they were enforced to keep company with horsemen, to runne though the hard stony wayes, as fast as the others did ride, towade also ouer many great riuers and other deepe waters in the way, hauing afterwardes no meanes almost to dry, rest, or ease themselues, no where finding any that would help or succour them, take pitty, or compassion on them, but many almost euery where that egregiously abused and iniured them: so that had they not carried some little rice in sachels on theyr backes for theyr su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance, it is very likely they had perished
<pb n="37" facs="19"/>by the way for very want, and necessity.</p>
   <p>Being now arriued at <hi>Meaco,</hi> they found all the Citty in vprore and armes, no disposition at all for them to manifest the Christian fayth: whereupon they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced almost immediatly to retourne againe to <hi>Amanguchi</hi> the same way, and after the same fashion that they came from thence before. And there Father <hi>Xauier</hi> did reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, notwithstanding all difficulties, to set and settle himselfe to the preaching and planting of religion: and because he had learned by experience that the <hi>Iaponians</hi> did neyther esteeme of men nor of theyr wordes, vnlesse they were in exterior good fashion, and well apparreled, therefore to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himselfe vnto them for their greater good, he went vnto <hi>Tirando,</hi> and there at they charge of the king of <hi>Portugall</hi> he put himselfe in good apparell, and taking with him letters of fauour frō the viceroy of the Indies, and of the Bishop of <hi>Goa,</hi> which he had procured vnto the Princes of <hi>Iapon,</hi> and certaine small thinges brought out of <hi>Europe,</hi> as clockes, and such like curiosities,
<pb n="38" facs="20"/>the which were giuen him by the Gouernor of <hi>Malaca</hi> to bestow in such occasions, he returned backe againe to <hi>Amanguchi</hi> with Brother <hi>Iohn Fernandez,</hi> and two or three <hi>Iaponians</hi> in his company, where he made meanes to haue accesse vnto the King to whom by way of present he gaue those thinges which he had brought with him thither to that purpose. The king accepted of them willingly, and though he wondred at them as being rare and neuer seene before in those countryes, yet much more did he admire at the greatnes of the giuers minde, who did refuse a great quantity of gold and siluer, and other thinges which he offered him in requitall thereof, and only required that he would giue him licence to preach the fayth of Christ to whome, and where he would: the which he graunted easily, and assigned him besides a certaine house of good capacity, where he and his companions might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne.</p>
   <p>This licence being thus obteyned, the which was all the holy Father did desire, he and the Brother his Companion did set
<pb n="39" facs="20"/>themselues immediatly to worke, preaching all the day time in the streetes and middest of the market place, an innumerable number of people flocking about them, some to see and heare what they sayd, others to laugh at their manner of speach, others to marke their actions, and mocke at their behauiour: and in the night they did the same in the house where they lodged to those that came thither to visit them, as many did, some of courtesy, but most of curiosity. And in this manner they spent diuers monethes without seing any fruit at all of all their labours, vntill at length one was conuerted vpon this occasion. Brother <hi>Iohn Fernandez</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching one day in the street according to his wonted manner, a <hi>Iaponian</hi> that passed by in a scornefull manner, did spit at him; and the filthy fleame falling iust vpon his face, he wiping it of, without making any shew of the least impatience in the world, with great serenity of mind went forward in his speach: the which being well marked and obserued by one of the standers by, caused him within himselfe to frame this conceipt:
<pb n="40" facs="21"/>doubtlesse this doctrine must needs be very good that causeth in the professors thereof so great humility patience and constancy of mind, in suffering iniuries and indignities: and thereupon the Sermon being ended, he followed the brother to their house, where hauing learned the Creed, the ten Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, our Lords prayer, the Salutation of our B Lady, and diuers other prayers, and being sufficiently instructed in all the mysteries of Christian religion, and sorry for the sinnes of his former life, he was the first in all that Citty that did receiue the holy Sacrament of baptisme, and thereby was made a member of Christs holy Church and Congregation. Soone after him diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also were baptized, and within a short tyme the number of Christians there amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fiue hundred or there abouts, and all of them (as they well shewed in many occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that happened afterwardes) exceeding constant, vertuous, and perseuerant.</p>
   <p>Matters being come to this good passe, letters were brought vnto Father <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> in which wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> signified that it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
<pb n="41" facs="21"/>necessary for him to returne in person to the <hi>Indies</hi> vpon vrgent busines: leauing therefore behind him Father <hi>Cosmo de Torres,</hi> and Brother <hi>Iohn Fernandez</hi> to conserue and increase the best they could that little flocke of Christ, which he had there begunne and gathered, he went backe to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laca,</hi> and afterwardes to <hi>Goa,</hi> from whence he sent some more of the Society vnto them to help towards the conuersion of <hi>Iapone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> the which they and others that succeded them did with such diligent care and industry (God Almighty blessing their labours &amp; concuring thereunto with many miracles wrought by them) that within the space of twenty yeares or thereaboutes, there were in that country by their meanes and good endeauors more then an hundred and forty thousand Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and amongst them many persons of great worth &amp; estimation, as the King of <hi>Bungo</hi> a very potent Prince, who for the deuotion and veneration he bare to Father <hi>Francis Xauier,</hi> when he was baptized, which was some yeares after the holy Fathers death, would neede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> be called <hi>Francis</hi> by his name.
<pb n="42" facs="22"/>The King of <hi>Arima</hi> also named <hi>Don Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasio,</hi> and his brother <hi>Don Bartholomew</hi> Prince of <hi>Omura,</hi> a most pious and valerous Gentleman, and diuers other Noble men; who all agreeing amongst themselues to the end the whole world might vnderstand how sincerely they did beleeue and imbrace the fayth of Christ, in the yeare <hi>1583.</hi> they sent from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> which is well neere ten thousand miles, foure young Gentlemen, some of them very neere of kinred vnto the kinges before named, to render obedience in their names vnto the most pious Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the thirteenth, who then liued, as vnto the vicar of our Blessed Sauiour here on earth and cheife head &amp; pastor of all the Christians in the world.</p>
   <p>After Father <hi>Xauier</hi> his death, which was in the yeare <hi>1552.</hi> the Superiors of the Society of IESVS still continued sending some of their subiectes to <hi>Iapone,</hi> to procure the increase of Christianity therein, and some yeares ago others of other holy Religious, Orders, as of <hi>S.

<pb n="43" facs="22"/>to the same in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

And in such prosperous manner did they go on assisted by the help of God, and all of them in concord of hart, and vnity of faith, that there was no smal hope that the whol country would within a short time haue beene eyther all or the most part thereof conuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
