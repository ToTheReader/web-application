   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orthy Ladie, when I began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider to whome I might best commend the care of this so great a cause; my hart could conceiue of none so fitt as you, &amp; that for two causes &amp; the third may not be wanting. The first is, because I knowe your faithful vnfained loue to God &amp; his truth, &amp; that in manie thinges according to knowledg: The second because I knowe there is none in that Land that hath better meanes to procure a cause of religion, to be handled according to the judgmēt of the best: The third is the faithful reverēd loueing respect I beare to you; &amp; that from your owne worthie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts in the best things, &amp; in all good vnto me. I pray &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you by that loue of God, that hath bene in you of long time: (the which I wish may abound in you more &amp; more) that you faile not my hopes herein which are: That you wil either plainely see an upright consionable sound answere from the word of truth to this groūd here propounded: or els giue glorie to God, &amp; receiue it for the blessed truth of God. The ground is easilie &amp; plainelie set downe, which is that God giueing <hi>Adam freewil / and power in himself not to eate of the forbidden fruit / and live: or to eate / and dye</hi> / could not in his eternal decree; ordeyne or appoint him to life, or death, for then had his <hi>Freewil</hi> bene overthrowne: &amp; if Adam had not eaten &amp; sinned (which
<pb facs="3"/>
was to his owne power) then had not death entred: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God did not decree that death should enter: &amp; then <hi>Gods decree</hi> is not the cause of anie mans condemnation. I now pray you Ladie, with all the loue off my soule 'enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this great cause off God, into your thoughts, &amp; lett it take vp your best meditations, that good thereby being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, you may stil be an instruement to advance the gospell off Iesus Christ: &amp; you shalbe sure off an high recompence off reward at the hands off the most high in heauen, &amp; your remembrance shalbe blessed amonge the Saints upon earth, Thus praieing the Lord to blesse you, and to giue you his holie Spirit with a gracious, wise, vnderstanding hart, to descorne a right the thinges that differ. I take leaue▪ withal the grace &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full honestie off my hart, (as I haue cause) desiering your best good.</p>
