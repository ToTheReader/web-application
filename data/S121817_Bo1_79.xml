      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue thought meete to write a briefe note or abstracte of such termes &amp; proper woordes as I haue obserued in Uenerie, either by reading or by experience: aswell bycause mine Aucthor hath done the like, as also bicause I finde it very pertinent to the purpose. But bicause I find that his termes in the Frenche are in many places much different frō ours (&amp; yet many holde opinion that we borowed all our termes of Hunting, Hawking, and such like out of the Frenche) therfore I haue thought my parte to set downe suche as I my selfe haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

And if the Reader do finde that in any parte of the discourses in this booke, I haue termed any of them otherwise, then let him also consider that in handling of an Arte, or in setting downe rules and precepts of any thing, a man must vse suche woordes as may be most easie, perspicuous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible. But here (as neare as I can) I will set them downe in suche termes as wee ought by lawe of Uenerie to name them: as followeth.</p>

      <head>The proper termes for the companies of all beasts, when they are more than one togither.</head>
      <p>TO beginne with the termes that are proper for the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies<note place="margin">Companies of Beasts.</note> of beasts: you shall vnderstand that Huntesmen vse to saye, <hi>An Heard of Harts</hi> and <hi>Hindes, Buckes</hi> and <hi>Does:</hi> and <hi>A Trippe of Gotes</hi> and <hi>Geates. A Beauie of Rowes. A Sounder of Swine.</hi> And a <hi>Rowte of VVolues.</hi> I haue not readde any thing of the Raynedeare in this respect, and I could not heare any thyng bycause in deede they are not in this Realme as farre as euer I coulde learne. But in my iudgement it shoulde also be called <hi>An Heard of Raynedeare.</hi> Trystrā addeth, <hi>A Richesse of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes,</hi> and a <hi>Slowth of Beares.</hi> As for <hi>Hares,</hi> if they be two togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we say, a brase of <hi>Hares,</hi> and a <hi>Lease</hi> when there are three: as also a brase of Harts or Hindes, Buckes or Does, is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly spoken: but more than two or three Hares, you shal seldom see togither at once. Twoo Conies are called a couple, and three are called a couple &amp; a halfe of Conies. If they be many feeding out togethers, we say it is a fayre game of Conies. As for Fox, Badgerd &amp; other suche vermine, you shall seldome see more than one of them at once, vnlesse it be when they engendre: and then their encrease is called <hi>A lytter.</hi> This is asmuche as I thinke requisite to say of the termes for the companies of Beastes: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that. xx. is the least number which maketh an Hearde of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Deare sauing the Rowe: but sixe Rowes make an hearde. And of Swyne twelue is the least nūber, which may be called a Sounder: as also the same nūber serueth for a route of Wolues.</p>

      <head>The termes of the Ages of all beasts of Venerie and Chace: and first of the Harte.</head>
      <p>AN Hart is called the firste yeare a Calfe, the seconde a Brocket, the thirde a Spayde, the fourth a Staggerd, the<note place="margin">Age.</note> fifth a Stagge, and (as <hi>Trystrams</hi> booke teacheth) the sixth yeare he shuld be called an Hart. But I am rather of opiniō y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he
<pb n="236" facs="125"/>
is not to be called a Harte vnlesse he be hunted or killed by a Prince. A Bucke is called the first yeare a Fawne, the second a Pricket, the third a Sorell, the fourth a Sore, the fifth a Bucke of the first head, and the sixth a Bucke. Of the Raynedeare I haue neyther heard nor redde any termes. The Gote hath no difference (that euer I heard) after he passe the firste yeare, and then is called a Kidde. The Hare and the Conie, are called in their first yeare, <hi>Leuerets,</hi> and <hi>Rabets,</hi> and afterwards they haue no difference, but to say, <hi>A great Hare,</hi> and an old <hi>Conie.</hi> Also you shal say by any <hi>Deare, A great Deare,</hi> &amp; not <hi>A fayre Deare,</hi> vnlesse it be a <hi>Rowe.</hi> The which is called the first yeare a <hi>Kidde,</hi> the second a <hi>Gyrle,</hi> the third an <hi>Hemuse,</hi> the fourth a <hi>Rowbucke</hi> of the first heade, and the fifth yeare a fayre <hi>Rowebucke.</hi> A <hi>Bore</hi> is the first yeare a <hi>Pigge,</hi> the second an <hi>Hogge,</hi> the third a <hi>Hogsteare,</hi> the fourth a <hi>Bore,</hi> and the fifth yeare a <hi>Singuler,</hi> or (as I would thinke more properly spoken) a <hi>Sanglier,</hi> according to the French worde. Foxes are called the first yeare Cubbes, and afterwards (Foxes) without any other difference than an <hi>olde Foxe,</hi> or suche like. Also the Badgerd is the first yeare <hi>a whelpe or a Pigge</hi> (for I haue herd Huntesmen vse both those termes) and euer after a Badgerd great or old, &amp;c. As for Wolfe, Beare, and suche like we haue them not here. The Otter is called the firste yeare <hi>a whelpe,</hi> and euer afterwardes an Otter, &amp;c.</p>

      <head>Termes generall of the huntesman, in hunting of any chase.</head>
      <p>VVHen huntesmen doe beate any Couerte with kennell houndes for any chase, it is called <hi>drawing of the Couert.</hi> When they cast about a groue or wood with their Liamhound, then they make a ryng. When they finde where a Deare hath passed, and breake or plashe any boughe downewardes for a marke, then we saye, <hi>they blemishe,</hi> or make <hi>blemishes.</hi> When they hang vppe any paper, clout, or other marke, then it is to be called <hi>Sewelling</hi> or setting of <hi>Sewels.</hi> When they set houndes in a readynesse whereas they thinke a chase will passe, and cast them off before the rest of the kennell come in, it is called <hi>a vaunt laye</hi>
         <pb n="243" facs="128"/>
When they tarrie till the rest of the kennell come in, and then cast off, it is called an <hi>Allay.</hi> But when they hold vntill the ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell be past them, then it is called a <hi>Relay.</hi> When a hounde mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a chase, and goeth away with it farre before the rest, then we say he <hi>forel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
