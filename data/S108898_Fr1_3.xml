   <head>TO THE HONEST AND JUDICIOUS READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or unto any prejudice I scorne either E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle or Apologie. yet such men will be medling, and though they disdaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to read, will notwithstanding be sure to judge, and let them: 'tis a faire way of proceeding, as they think, but brings with it the comfort of being common, nor may I expect to escape their good word, though I direct nothing to them, but unto you I stand boūd to give an account of what I have done, and of the reason that incited mee unto it. In briefe then, that principall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that caused me to publish this Translation, was, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme herein the pious duty of a surviving sonne unto the deare memory of a deceased father: who as hee was a true lover of Schollers, and Learning, (especially of this kind) will I doubt not finde favourable entertainment amongst those that are conversant in these studies, and beare affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Greeke tongue. Hee was indeed no profest schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler nor tooke any more than one degree in this famous Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie, having beene sometimes of <hi>Oriell</hi> Colledge: but yet although hee were taken off by a countrie retirement, hee never lost the true tast and relish that distinguishes men of this education, but rather made continuall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of that nutriment which hee had received in his yonger daies, from the breasts of this his honoured mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. His studie or rather his recreation, was chiefely in the Greeke tongue, and of his knowledge herein hee hath left unto the world sufficient testimonies, of which these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Dialogues are a part, and these with divers other things of his performance, being at this time in my custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,

I supposed I could not do him more right, nor his friends and mine better satisfaction (whose desires herein challenge a second motive) than to give them free libertie, and suffer him by this meanes to propagate his owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, which may chance to last longer in this small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of his owne raising (or in some larger hereafter) than in the hardest marble posteritie can erect him. What I have added here, is not worth speaking of, much lesse the censuring: Onely let mee say thus much, to defend my owne innocence from the blacke mouth'd obloquie of such as can speake no other colour, that in the Authors life I have not gone about (farre be your charities from such a thought) to acquit him from any of those villanies and blasphemous impieties wherewith hee hath beene truly charged; but so farre to vindicate these innoxious workes of his, as reason and your owne selves must needs (I know) allow of in the rest, I have onely endeavour'd to make the Translator understood, as hee the author, wherein I have not thought it much, though perhaps some may, to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the satisfaction even of the meanest capacities (for to this end was it translated that all might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it) otherwise, the English, would be to many, almost as much Greeke as the Originall: and herein if I have done ought amisse, when I know it, I shall both acknowledge it and desire your pardon hoping in the meane space that your ingenuous candor will lay the fault where it is due, that is on mee, not the Translator, nor cause the worke to suffer, if I have any where failed. This I hope will be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to satisfie you to whom I write, unto whom I submit both my selfe and this, and so rest, a true lover of yous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and honourer of your vertues.</p>
