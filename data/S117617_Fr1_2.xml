   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F among friendes, there needes great
and ample giftes, then will not my
pouertie furnishe your expectation.
Large giftes I haue none, the greatest
I am able to shewe, is good will, the
which is gift great ynough, among
right friendes. Therefore forasmuch
as I haue alwayes counted you, as one of my dearest
friendes, and you likewise haue accepted mee among
your friendly fraternitie (I thanke you therefore) I trust
this my remembraunce, shall be a sufficient token and
pledge of my good will. It is not long since I for want
of better furniture, offred you the like token, the which
was of you so gently receyued, as I am not able to tell
well, whether I were more sorie I had no better gift to
gratifie you withall, or wheather I more marueyled at
your curtesie (in so well esteeming) so small a thing, If
I had had better at that tyme, better would I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed,
as nowe I would also, but as you receyued that
simple and rude thing then in good part, at my handes,
of I againe, trust you will doe nowe no lesse, at thys
time, renuing that friendship, which vnequally of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
had almost seperated and losed, in so doing, I can
but wishe you well, the which prayer as I am bounde
I will alwayes bestow vpon you. Thus in few wordes
I ende, committing you to God, who graunt you long
health, and prosperitie in this life.</p>
