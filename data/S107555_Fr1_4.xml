                 <title>Iurisdiction regall, episcopall, papall : Wherein is declared how the Pope hath intruded vpon the iurisdiction of temporall princes, and of the Church.

   <head>An Admonition to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may bee thought strange, that so many are found to write in this contradicting age, one contrary to another: the trueth cannot bee on both sides, and therefore there is a great fault on the one side: the Reader that is desirous to trie where the fault is, may be intreated to marke with adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed obseruation some things, wherein our aduersaries wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting either knowledge or sinceritie, haue broken all the rules of right writing, to deceiue such as cannot iudge (of which sort the greatest part consisteth) I doe therefore intreat the Readers, especially such as reade my Booke with a purpose to answere it; to consider these things, wherein we challeng our aduersaries for euil dealing, in this particular Controuersie: First, In setting downe our opinion, they make it not that which we hold, but another thing; and then make large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses in vaine: they should vnderstand our cause as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer it: for we deuise not their opinion, but take it out of their owne bookes, especially from the Popes Canons: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they would refute vs, they bring their owne Canon law, which was deuised in preiudice of the freedome of Princes, and is our aduersarie, and therefore cannot bee our Iudge: Thirdly, When they produce the testimonies of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers, the abuse, for which we challenge them, is, that they will not vnderstand the question: for the fathers write for the spirituall Iurisdiction of the Church aboue Princes; which thing we neuer denied. But against the coactiue Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of Prinees in matters Ecclesiasticall: which thing we hold, the Fathers neuer w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>ote, but they are for it. If these things were faithfully obserued (as they are all peruerted in
<pb facs="9"/>
this cause by one that termeth himself the Catholick Diuine) and if the truth were sought with conscience, and not preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice maintained with resolution, men would neuer presume so much vpon the simplicitie of the Readers, nor in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their wit and learning, would they suffer themselues to be set to the maintenance of any cause whatsoeuer. Let me farther intreate him that would aunswere me, to enter into this short and serious meditation with himselfe, thus: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my purpose is to serue God for the truth, and then I may looke for a blessing vpon my labours; or else to serue man though against the truth, and then I may looke for a curse vpon my selfe and my labours: let this Meditation rule thy pen and heart: I aske no more. Last of all let me intreate thee of curtesie, to amend the faults escaped in printing, with thy pen, thus.</p>
