   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader: to deale plainely with thee, I was long afraid and asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to put pen to paper, about this theame of Mortification. Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the point is not exceeding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to be handled; but because I found my selfe verie vnworthie and vnfit to entreate of it. Being guiltie to my selfe, of being farre from hauing done any thing worth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, in the practice of the dutie, I thought it scarce likely, that I should doe any great good in writing of it, and I was euen ashamed to publish any thing of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, finding my selfe, alas, so little mortified. At last yet, I resolued to aduenture on this worke for two reasons: One, because I am priuie to my selfe, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing indeauoured (in some poore degree, and with some truth,) to performe my selfe, what here I have taught, and that also, not without some little successe, tho farre short of what I ought, and (but for mine owne careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) might haue attained. Another, because I con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiued, that as a man, which hauing but a small stocke, can himselfe make but small gaines of its returne, may yet giue husband like directions to him that hath a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger stocke, by which he may improue his ten talents to more aduantage, then else he could doe: so a man, that hauing but a small quantity of grace, can doe little him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb facs="56"/>may yet giue sound directions to those that haue receiued a greater measure of Grace, to further them much in their spirituall thrift. And as he that by some disease or wound, is halfe lame, and can goe but a slow pace in the knowne right way, may yet direct others to the right way, and quicken their pace, by calling vpon them; so may he, whose corruptions suffer him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed but slowly in the wayes of holinesse, shew that way to others, and hasten them therein. In a word, he may be a good Drummer or Trumpeter in the warre, that hath but a weake body, and feeble lims to fight. Hinder not thy selfe therefore, from profiting by this Work, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the weakenesses of him that wrote it; striue thou to run apace in this path, I will either follow after thee, or beare thee company, or, if I can, goe before thee, as fast as I can. Fight thou valiantly at the sound of this Trumpet, and I will also striue to vse the hand, aswell as the mouth; and the Sword, aswell as the Trumpet. So committing my selfe and thee, to the good fauour and grace of our common Father, and requiring a few of thy prayers for my selfe in speciall, I rest</p>
