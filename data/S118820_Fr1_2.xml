   <p>Whosoeuer will (as <hi>Isaac</hi>) continually meditate on Gods booke,<note place="margin">

         <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.</note> and a light to his paths: yea Gods word will be in his mouth sweeter then honie and the hony combe. When I perceiued how desirous your Worship was, to heare &amp; reade Gods word, it greatly moued me to write this booke, perswading my selfe that it will be to you and all the godly, a recreatiō, to apply some part of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly historie of Christ our Sauiour to the tune of one of the Psalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that being (as S. <hi>Paule</hi> aduiseth all men) filled with the spirit of God, you may stil be speaking vnto your self in Psalmes &amp; hymnes and spiritual songs,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.18.</note> singing and making melodie vnto the Lord in your heart, and giuing thanks alwayes for all
<pb facs="6"/>
things vnto God euen the Father, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
   <p>The second reason that moued me to take this worke in hand (besides the hope that I haue thereby to benefit many, and especially such as haue delight to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and singing of Ballades and other English meeters, by giuing them better matter to reade and sing, then such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do yeeld vnto them) is to signifie in some part, my gratefulnesse to God and your Worship, for the manifold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites and fauours that I and mine haue receiued at your hands: to God (I say) first, as the author, and your selfe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumēt that he hath vsed to do me much good. For if God had not opened your heart,<note place="margin">

            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>. 16.14.</note> as he did the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> to heare the preaching of S. <hi>Paule,</hi> you had not regarded my miserie. And therfore with <hi>Dauid</hi> I will as long as I liue receiue the cup of saluation,<note place="margin">

            </gap>sal.</hi> 116.12.</note> and call vpon the name of the Lord: for as nothing pleaseth God more then thankfulnesse, so nothing can displease God and man more then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefulnesse. But lest some Sicophant should (seeking to deface my good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) note or charge me with adulation, I will rather passe ouer the sundrie and
<pb facs="6"/>
daily benefites I haue and do receiue by your Worships meanes, with this slight remembrance of them, thē giue him anie such-aduantage, or the least occasion to carpe at the same. But if any of <hi>Momus</hi> mates mislike with my doings, either in this or the rest of my booke, (so that the godly &amp; well disposed, &amp; of them chiefly your Worship, to whom I offer my book and my selfe to be patronized and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, do like and allow of it) I esteeme not his detractions but as trifles, and his floutes as follies, and therefore let him content himself with this answer, I tooke not this trauel for his sake. And thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring your Worship to accept in good part this my humble dutie and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of you, as glad by this meanes to impart the effect of my affection towards you, as the widow was by two mites to manifest her good meaning to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, I beseech Almightie God to blesse you and all yours with continuall and daily increase of the riches of his graces &amp; gifts, that you may euer go forward from faith to faith, readie with all your endeuours to maintaine the quarell of Christ and his Church, vntill you bee
