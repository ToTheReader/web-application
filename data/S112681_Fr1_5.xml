   <head>The Praeface to the godly Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Christian Reader, though the carkasse of Poperie,<note place="margin">Cosmog.</note> the better to auoide the heat of truth, sit downe and shadowe it selfe, like the Sciopodes in <hi>Munster,</hi> with one great legge of traditions: yet will it not be amisse, if I slit or cleaue that one great legge into two, namely, Traditions in generall, and the Romish primacie in particular, that it may stand vp the better to thy view, and so make a more open shew of it owne vglinesse.</p>
   <p>Touching the first, I am not ignorant how eagerly the ancient Fathers bee vrged vpon vs, and how easily their authoritie may be auoided, as being no fast friends to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie in this argument: yet, me thinkes, the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> should heare the words of their owne Father, rather than any other father that euer put penne to paper, namely, they<note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 16.29, 31.</note> haue <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, let them heare them. And againe, if they heare not <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, neither will they bee perswaded though one rise from the dead.</p>
   <p>What will the Papists, nay, what can they, or any man else liuing say to this? will they tell vs that <hi>Moses</hi> and the prophets be hard to vnderstand, and that they containe not an absolute and full doctrine of life and death, vnlesse they be peeced out with traditions? I am sure the rich glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in hel durst not say so much, &amp; yet it is to be presumed that he would haue sayd so, if he had not vnderstood that it was not worth the propoūding in <hi>Abrahams</hi> presence; thus much hee was bold to reply to the first part of <hi>Abrahams</hi> speech, nay, father <hi>Abraham,</hi> but if one come to my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren frō the dead, they wil amēd their liues, but the second
<pb facs="5"/>
part which exclusiuely refers them to <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, doth so stop his mouth, that hee had no whit further to plead for his owne brethren. It may be maruailed that he spake nothing, neither of the imperfection of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor of Iewish traditions, nor any such thing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of such apparitions from the dead; verily, if any such plea had been of any moment, hee would not haue fayled to doe his best endeauour for his brethren, and to put <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in mind of the imperfection of his answere.</p>
   <p>Howbeit, that which he then durst not doe, is thinking it to be little worth, is now propounded and vrged by the Papists the Sonnes and heires of the rich Glutton, who euen in despight of <hi>Abraham,</hi> presume to reply, that it is not inough to heare <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, and that they will heare such as rise from the dead. Oh, take heede of such desperate fellowes as these be, that regard not the doctrine of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and make themselues wiser now in shifting off the force of his speech, than Hell it selfe was in the dayes of our Sauiour, belike hell was not so wise then, as it is now, for now our Popish Gluttons can tell vs new tales of the darkenes, of the imperfectnes, of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitie, of the corruptions of the Scripture, they can prate of traditions, and vnwritten verities which are not to bee found in <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets: howbeit, let him that hath any regard of his saluation consider with himselfe, whether is the surer and the safer way to beleeue them, or to beleeue <hi>Abraham,</hi> for it is impossible to beleeue both.</p>
   <p>Captaine <hi>Stapleton</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">Lib. 12. Cap. 8.</note> tels vs, after this wise manner, that it is one thinge [to heare <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets,] which <hi>Abraham</hi> requireth, and another thing, [to heare them onely:] but what doth hee else in so doing, but shew
<pb facs="5"/>
himselfe more impudent than the Deuil, who, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour saith in <hi>Mathew</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">Math. 4.10. &amp; Luk. 4.8.</note>, It is written, thou shalt worship thy lord thy God, &amp; him only shalt thou serue, durst not be so sawcie as to tell him, that it is one thing to serue God, as it is commaunded in<note n="d" place="margin">Deut. 6.13. &amp; 10.20.</note>
      <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> and another thing to serue him onely, I am sure <hi>Cyprian</hi>
      <note n="e" place="margin">Lib. 2. epist. 3.</note>, where God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from heauen<note n="f" place="margin">Math. 17 5.</note> saith, <hi>Ipsum audite,</hi> is bold to adde the word, <hi>solum,</hi> twise together in one place, yet neuer durst any quarrelling hereticke tell <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as <hi>Stapleton</hi> tels vs, <hi>Aliud est Mosen &amp; Prophetas audire, aliud solos audire,</hi> It is one thing to heare them, and another thing to heare them onely; but to bee short, doe but looke the words of <hi>Abraham</hi>
      <note n="g" place="margin">Cap. 16.29.31.</note> in Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospell, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the circumstances with an vpright religious heart, and then blame me if thou finde not that the word <hi>onely,</hi> may as rightly be added here in <hi>Luke,</hi> as either Christ or <hi>Cyprian</hi> haue added it in <hi>Mathew.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Stapleton</hi> goeth on still, and beareth vs in hand against <hi>Abraham,</hi> that if <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, were onely to bee heard, then the new Testament should be excluded as superfluous; but by Stapletons good leaue, thats neither so, nor so, for<note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 18 15.</note>
      <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe willeth vs to heare Christ in all things whatsoeuer he should say vnto vs, so doth<note n="i" place="margin">Act. 3.22</note>
      <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> teach vs out of <hi>Moses,</hi> and<note n="k" place="margin">Act. 7.37.</note> Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> likewise witnesseth, that <hi>Moses</hi> sayd vnto the children of Israel, that the lord their God shuld raise vp vnto them a Prophet whō they shuld heare, therfore <hi>Moses</hi> in the old Testament hath taught vs to heare Christ in the new; and if thou make question of the writings of the Apostles,<note n="l" place="margin">2. cor. 5.19.20.</note>
      <hi>Paul</hi> saith, they were the Ambassadors of Christ, and preached the word of reconciliation in Christs stead: if this yet stop
<pb facs="6"/>
not <hi>Stapletons</hi> mouth, then let him know that the new Testament is not an addition, but an exposition of the old, but such an exposition as all the world together could not haue made without the extraordinarie inspiration of the spirite of Christ: and heere, for the full determination of this point, hearken (I pray thee) what their owne <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus</hi> tels them in his Cōmentaries vpon <hi>Luke, Habent</hi> Mosen <hi>qui docuit moralia &amp; agenda, habent prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas qui docuerunt mystica &amp; credenda, &amp; ista suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt ad salutem, ideò sequitur, audiant illos,</hi> They haue <hi>Moses</hi> (saith hee) who hath taught morall things that ought to be done, they haue the Prophets, who haue taught mysticall things that ought to be beleeued, and these be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to saluation, therefore it followeth, heare them.</p>
   <p>Thus is the doctrine of insufficiencie of the scripture, and necessitie of Traditions condemned to death, and must goe to the place of execution, vnlesse a better pardon bee sued out for it, than any that euer I could yet see registred in their Popish Cronicles; howbeit, wee haue not yet done with this question of traditions, for there is no man so carelesse of his saluation, that will set vp an Altar to these vnknowne fictions, as<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 17.23.</note> the Athenians did to the vnknowne God, before he know how many they bee, how few they be, what they be, and so consider with himselfe deliberately, whether they be fish, or flesh, or good red her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; herein then we call vpon them for resolution, and it is good reason wee should so doe, till we know whether they dreame, or lye waking.</p>
   <p>This makes a sort of them to vncase slouens, &amp; absurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to confesse themselues to be no better than heretickes,<note n="b" place="margin">Lib. 3. ca. 3. fund. 4.</note>
      <hi>Canus</hi> a great Papist tels vs out of <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
that <hi>Moses</hi> did not write the secrecies of the law, but deliuered them to <hi>Ioshua</hi> by Tradition, and so infers, that the Apostles committed the secrecies of the Gospel by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to a few wise and perfect men. And <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as great a Papist as liues this day,<note n="c" place="margin">Bellar. de verbo non script. lib. 4 Cap. 8.</note> concludes out of <hi>Paul,</hi> that all thinges are not to be opened to all, but some things must be<note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 2.6.</note> reserued, <hi>perfectis &amp; sapientibus;</hi> yet I doubt whether any such perfect wise men are to bee found in the world. O you perfect wise men of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> or where else soeuer you nestle your selues in the world! can your perfect wisedomes doe so much for vs, as to set downe these Traditions in blacke and white in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Catalogue, that if any controuersie arise about this or that tradition, your blacke and white Booke may resolue vs? No, no, you cannot doe it: and therefore you tell vs you may not doe it in the hearing of such simple fellowes as we be, because <hi>Paul</hi> hath commaunded the contrarie; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientiam loquimur inter perfectos,</hi> is your warrant to hide these mysteries from such poore fooles as we be. But wote you what? this verie allegation shall be our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to pronounce, that you are perfect wise heretickes, such as <hi>Basilides, Carpocrates, Cerinthus, Valentinus,</hi> and <hi>Marcion:</hi> looke in<note n="e" place="margin">Iren. lib. 1. cap. 23. &amp; 24. &amp; lib. 3. cap. 2.</note>
      <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and<note n="f" place="margin">Tertul. de prescript. aduers. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.</note>
      <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and there you shall finde that I doe not be-lye you<note n="g" place="margin">Math. 10 27.</note>; our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our willeth his Disciples to speake in the open light, and to preach on the tops of the houses, and himselfe confirmed this plaine and open dealing by his own practise<note n="h" place="margin">Ioh. 18.20.</note>, [I spake openly to the world, saith he, I euer taught in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and in the temple, where the Iewes alwaies resort, and in secret haue I sayd nothing.]</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>These places be inanswerable, and therefore some that be lesse wayward in this point than their fellowes, as for example,<note n="i" place="margin">Aduers. Brent.</note>
      <hi>Petrus à Soto,</hi>
      <note n="k" place="margin">In Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tech. cap. 5.</note>
      <hi>Canisius,</hi>
      <note n="l" place="margin">In Pan. lib. 4. cap. 100. &amp; in fine fabulae. 6.</note>
      <hi>Lindanus,</hi>
      <note n="m" place="margin">Parte. 3.</note>
      <hi>Peresius,</hi> and others, reckon vp a iolly companie of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as namely, [the oblation of the sacrifice, their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealing, their praying to the dead, and for the dead, their primacie of <hi>Rome,</hi> their hallowing of Fonts, their fiue pretended Sacraments, the Merits of Works, their satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, their tallying vp of their sinnes to the Priest, their worshipping of Images, their set-fasting dayes, their holy time of Lent, their oblations for the dead, their <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> their real presence, their halfe Cōmunion, their reseruation and adoration, their priuate masse, their shrifts, their satisfactiōs, their indulgēces, their purgatory, their single life of Priests,] and such like, of which they say, like down-right Squiers, that they are not grounded vpon the holy scripture, and that by scripture they cannot bee defended; and so saith this our Papist of most of them euen in<note n="n" place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> this Dialogue, and therfore howsoeuer they trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vs with some few light-footed allegations of Scripture: yet their owne consciences tell them, that the Scriptures will faile them in all these seuerall questions. Wouldest thou know then what remayneth to bee done? Mary I will tell thee, let all their rich Gluttons in hell, or out of hell, dead or aliue; nay, let the Diuell himselfe say, and doe what they will or can, yet we will, and so doe thou, follow the counsell of <hi>Abraham;</hi> we will, and so doe thou, heare <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and the Prophets, as he teacheth vs, and not such as will vs to repose our trust in vnwritten and vnsealed Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
   <p>And here, to passe ouer to the other point I promised
<pb facs="7"/>
to speake of, let it please thee to remember, who was the first founder of Traditions, namely, <hi>Papias</hi> a Chiliast, whom<note n="o" place="margin">Hist. ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. lib. 2. 15. &amp; lib. 3. 36.</note>
      <hi>Eusebius</hi> calleth, a publisher of Paradoxes, and strange and fabulous doctrines, an inconsiderate mistaker of the disputations of the Apostles, and a man of small iudgement, yet this is the man that layd the first stone of <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> and so consequently of the Papall Primacie, and where <hi>Peter</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">1. Pet. 5.13.</note> saith, the Church that is at <hi>Babylon</hi> saluteth you: this is the first that euer told vs that he means <hi>Rome,</hi> a worthy foundation, no doubt, to build religion vpon, and yet when he saith that [<hi>Rome</hi> is Babylon,] he puts vs all in minde to<note n="b" place="margin">Apo. 18.2.4.</note> come out of <hi>Rome,</hi> the habitation of Diuels, and the hold of all foule spirits, and a cage of euerie vncleane and hatefull bird.</p>
   <p>And here it is a world to see how the Papists labour to auoyd the force of this, and such like Prophecies. This (say they) must bee meant of the heathenish, not of the Christian <hi>Babylon.</hi> And I say againe, it neither must nor can be so meant, for who will yeeld, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> should set downe that by way of Prophecie, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied alreadie by<note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 7.</note>
      <hi>Daniel</hi> long before either Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was banished, or Christ was incarnate? Againe, if happily <hi>Daniel</hi> be otherwise vnderstood, why should the holy ghost speake of the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> rather than <hi>Corinth, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippos, Colosse, Thessalonica,</hi> great Cities of <hi>Greece?</hi> or of <hi>Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, Laodicea,</hi> to which<note n="d" place="margin">Cap. 1.4.</note> the Reuelation is dedicated? or the Citie of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where it is thought Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was Bishop? were not all these Cities as heathenish as <hi>Rome,</hi> and better knowne to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> so to be, than <hi>Rome</hi> was? What? was Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> made a Prophet to
<pb facs="8"/>
speake against heathenish <hi>Rome</hi> which he neuer saw, nor came neere to, and no prophet at all to speake of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenishnes of so many Cities that hee had seen so often, and was so well acquainted withall? Moreouer, if this might be yeelded vnto, yet why should heathenish <hi>Rome</hi> be figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the person of a gawdie scarlet coloured whorish wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and be counted the mother of all the filthinesse, whoredomes, and abhominations of the earth: whereas indeed there was neuer a more manly, and more continent gouernement in the world?</p>
   <p>In the<note n="e" place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> prophecie of <hi>Daniel</hi> the chiefe Kingdomes and Empires of the earth, are described vnto vs by the names of Lions, &amp; Beares, and Leopards, and stronge, terrible, and fearfull beasts with yron teeth &amp; nayles of brasse; and shall we thinke that the most continent, most iust, most strong, most terrible, and couragious gouernment that euer was in the world, should be compared by the holy ghost to a fine daintie Dame, to a tender nice whore, to a proud shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse whore, that made open shew of the filthinesse of her Fornication? No, no, this verie Booke of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Reuelation<note n="f" place="margin">Apoc, 13, 2.</note> doth compare the Romane Emperor to a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard with Beares feet, and a Lions mouth, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists themselues doe so vnderstand it.</p>
   <p>And here obserue, that beside the first beast which was like a Leopard, there is another there spoken of, which hauing two hornes like a lambe, spake like a Dragon, and did all the first beast could doe, and more too, euen in his sight and presence. Now, what can this second beast be, but the [Lambe skinned] &amp; [Dragon tongued] Prelacy of <hi>Rome?</hi> and what other beast did the Romane Empire euer yeeld vnto, but this onely? whereof it followeth, that
<pb facs="8"/>
the first beast is not onely the heathenish Emperours, but the succession in generalitie, for the heathenish neuer yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any of their heads to be cured by the Romish Dragon; nay marke further where the<note n="g" place="margin">Apoc. cap. 18.</note> holy Ghost teacheth, that this first beast that hath seuen heads and ten hornes, is rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the scarlet coloured whore of <hi>Baylon,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vnderstood singly of the heathenish Emperours, but generally of the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> which at length yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his backe to bee sadled and ridden by that Babylonish Harlot, which<note n="h" place="margin">Cap. 19.20.</note> is afterward called a false prophet. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as I sayd before) so I say againe, come<note n="i" place="margin">Reu. 18.4</note> out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> that ye be not partakers of her sinnes, and that yee receiue not of her plagues. O mercifull Father, open our eyes that we may see the vglinesse of Poperie in the cleere glasse of thy holy word, and still teach vs by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall experience of thy gratious fauor and protection, to take heed of the sauage designements of the Romish Dragon. <hi>Hardwicke</hi> the 28. of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuarie, 1606.</p>
