                 <title>Christian offices crystall glasse : In three bookes. First written in Latine, by that famous and renowned Father, Saint Ambrose Bishop of Millane. Whereunto is added his conuiction of Symmachus the Gentile. A worke tending to the advancement of vertue, and of holinesse: and to shew how much the morality of the Gentiles, is exceeded by the doctrine of Christianity. Translated into English by Richard Humfrey</title>

And therefore eagerly moves, and with all his rhetorick perswades to procure the Altar of victorie taken downe to be reedified, and to be adored, as of old, for a Goddesse, the stipends of the Vestall Virgins, as heretofore, to be repaid them, all the rites of the Gods with their sacrifices, priests, and ministers to bee againe revived. Against which his detestable, and pernicious errors, our author for gravity, and authority a most eminent Divine, for wisdome, zeale, and goodnesse of style, joyned with all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of learning, a man incomparable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth himselfe, the cause of religion now lying at the stake, and necessarily requiring it in these his two Epistles: which may serve all posterity, as two strong bulwarkes, for Apologie of the Christians faith against
<pb facs="213"/> Gentilisme, and all superstition. Hee it was that stood in the forefront, abode the sorest brunt, and forced to silence that braving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutor. Howbeit, the matter being of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est importance, needfull it was for succeeding times, his Hydra's head still springing up, that some should come in as champions to cut it downe: Wherefore <hi>Aurel. Prudentius</hi> a worthy Poet inserting expresly this our <hi>Symmachus</hi> owne words, beateth him every where from his hold in two bookes of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke verse. St. <hi>Hierome</hi> in many passages of his workes, but specially in his Epitaph upon <hi>Neopotian</hi> unnestles him in his couch. For what is his stuffe stript of some little flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish? <hi>P. Diaconus,</hi> and <hi>P. Orosius</hi> (St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> schollar, and set on worke by St. <hi>Augustine</hi>) by their pithy historicall discourse pinched him on both sides to the hard bones. And at last St. <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe in that everlasting monument of his<note n="f" place="margin">De Civitate Dei.</note> 22. bookes hath sifted him to the branne, hunted him out of all his starting holes, and loosing the lists of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined lines hath quite, and cleane, like to a few Spiders webbes, swept them away with all their wiles. Thus you see, that all these (and many more not now extant) as so many malls, are hammering still upon this stithy, and though they batter it every one in his turne, yet they never leave striking till they have driven it to powder.</p>
   <p>But this was one of the least, not of the
<pb facs="213"/> last of our prudent Fathers labours. For hee applied himselfe to profit posterity as long as hee was able to handle a penne. Every of the foure, and he in the first place, had his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. He in his Allegorie, <hi>Gregorie</hi> in Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie, <hi>Hierome</hi> in History, <hi>Augustine</hi> in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogie. Each of these is doubtlesse for uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, if we had the like will, and wisdome to use it accordingly. The Apostle bids <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> bring with him his<note n="g" place="margin">2 Tim. 4.13.</note> bookes, specially his parchment. Hee being exraordinarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired, and his time of dissolution now at hand, what should hee doe with bookes? As the sacred, so other godly bookes in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, be for comfort, instruction, strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the judgement, establishing in the truth, the day of reckoning being come of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall use for preparation, and committed to parchment more durable. But that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God is wonderfull for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his Church, wee might justly admire that the Fathers in their continuall care of government, of preaching, disputing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring, reading, had any time left them at all to write, much more so many large vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes. <hi>Varro</hi> in his time was a mirrour to the <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> and our Author may bee a<note n="h" place="margin">Vs{que} ad ultimam ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritudinem non cessavit scribere: unde scribens in illum psalmum, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Dominus, &amp; lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabilis nimis, &amp;c. mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus est.
