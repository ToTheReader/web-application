If then (right Honorable) the Spaniards setting out such hyperbolicall trophees of their cōquests, seeke by such praises to incourage their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie: It behooveth us, not to be stained with ingratitude, but to publish the prowesse of such woorthy men as still with their bloud do paint out, the woorthines of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions. Amongst whom your Honor having the cheefest place, as high Admirall of so victorious a fleete, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in your owne person such honorable service therein: I humbly present this my simple translation to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors patronage, as the Romaines did their martial discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to the Dictator, hoping your Honor will beare with the harshnes of my stile, in that verbally it answers the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors minde, and to accept of my well intended meaning, with that honorable curtesie, that your noble minde hath alwaies extended towards others: In which hope resting, I wish to your lordship, such health and happines, with such most honorable successe to all your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, as your Honor can desire, and I imagine.</p>
