      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S if Armes, and Learning were not Sisters, some pratling Sophister seemeth (me thinkes) to tell me, That I should doe well to follow my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary profession, and let <hi>Elogiums</hi> alone, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them to Schollers; it seeming vnto him, that these two, are of too different a nature, to consort together. But I shall be able to point forth vnto him, not one, but many <hi>Caesars,</hi> as dextrous in Letters, as disciplin'd in Armes. And that I may take away all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion from such Cauillers, of alledging against me, That I am too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in vsurping the office of an <hi>Orator,</hi> taxing mee of too much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and inconsiderate rashnesse, I will march as farre off as I can, from their dangerous style of <hi>flattery</hi> and <hi>ostentation,</hi> safely retiring my selfe into mine owne Trenches, and there to defend and maintaine the truth, a thing as proper to a Souldier, as is his Sword and Target, or his Pike and Corslet.</p>
   <p>I will be but the Eccho, not the Chronicler, of what I haue seene, heard, treated, and knowne abroad in the world; for I haue beene in my time in many, and different Nations, and Countries. I will goe on, and cumply with my desire, not fearing the face of <hi>Calumniation,</hi> because I know my selfe to be dis-interessed, and a free-man. For loue, interest, and feare, are those three ropes, that halter Iustice.</p>
   <p>And for that it is so iust a thing, to reward mens labours, encouraging the vertuous with a shout, as they doe in warre, giuing it them as a thankfull pay, which being truly deserued, is a true treasure. I haue therefore beene willing, seeing so many so drouzy in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to take vp the pen for them, though least of all obliged thereunto in the common opinion of the world, by reason of my profession. But no man shall out-strip me herein. We are all beholding to <hi>Mateo Aleman,</hi> wee are all indebted vnto him, and of all he doth iustly deserue condigne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. For wee must acknowledge him to be the first, that till this very day, hath in such a kind of style as his, come to discouer and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Vice: (with such a sweetnesse and softnesse) which being to them a venemous Aspe, robs them of their liues, when they are in their sweetest sleepe.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="151"/>
Many Physitians minister to their sicke Patients, pils of Aloes for to purge the head, but few or none of them haue taken pleasure in chewing of them, nor so much as to touch them with their tongue, neyther haue they beene able so to sweeten them, that mouing a desire to eate them, they should procure a generall appetite. Only <hi>Mateo Aleman,</hi> hath taught vs the way to taste things with delight, instructing vs by other mens actions how to gouerne ours: with no small hurt to his health and estate, hauing much wasted both the one and the other by his painfull studies. And we may very well say of him, That neuer Souldier had a poorer purse, and a richer minde, nor a life more vnquiet, and full of trouble, then was his; and only, because hee accounted it a greater honor vnto him, to be held a poore Philosopher then a rich flatterer. He left (as it is well knowne to the world) voluntarily, and of his owne accord, the Kings palace, where hee serued almost twenty yeares, being the best, and as it were the very creame of his age, in the Office of <hi>Contador de resultas,</hi> to King <hi>Philip</hi> the 2. and in many other waighty businesses, besides visitations and suruayes, which were committed vnto him, in all which hee behaued himselfe so well, that hee euermore gaue wonderfull good satisfaction, proceeding so vprightly, that he grew to be so poore, that not being able any longer, by reason of his wants and necessities, to continue these his seruices, he rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himselfe from that course of life, to one of lesser both ostentation and attendance. And though he wanted the goods of fortune, yet was he rich in the endowments of the soule, which are of much more estimation and price, then worldly pelfe, whereof no man could more truly boast himselfe.</p>
   <p>Let the tongues of men be listned vnto, and yee shall heare nothing so common as the publishing of his praise: no lesse in <hi>Spaine</hi> (where it is no small wonder to haue a Prophet liked in his owne Countrey) then in <hi>Italy, France, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> which mine owne eares and eyes can truly testifie and avow. And I might (if need were) boldly sweare, That I neuer heard his name mentioned, but with the addition of some honourable Epithite, euen to the giuing of him this noble Attribute, <hi>El Espan̄ol divino, The diuine Spaniard.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Who, like him, in lesse then three yeares, and in his owne life time, saw his owne workes translated into so many sundry languages, that like your <hi>Cartillas</hi> in <hi>Castile,</hi> his bookes ran posting for <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France?</hi> What Author euer writ, who at the very time when he was willing to bring forth his Labours to the light, they haue scarce come forth of the wombe of the Presse, but that they were strangled in the mid-wifes hands, and left for dead. And those his workes, that came forth into the world aliue, and did breathe, and inioy their life, as these of this our Author, they flew abroad with such swift and nimble wings, holpen by those of Fame, that with extraordinary speed they past through all parts of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,</hi> in somuch that there was not any one Prouince, whereinto they haue not flowen, and receiued, where-euer they came, most honorable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment?</p>
   <p>What workes can ye instance in, that in so short a time, haue had so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Impressions? The whole number of those bookes that haue been printed amounting to more then fifty thousand volumes. There haue beene (of my knowledge) six and twenty seuerall Impressions, whereof he was rob'd,
<pb facs="151"/>
whereby others became rich and the Owner of them, poore. Against whom but him, did ye euer finde the gates of <hi>Murmuration</hi> shut? Who, but he, had so perfectly learnd the way to beat Malice out of the field, and to put her to flight? If this be so; or if (as by euidext Mathematicall demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) it shall require a necessary proofe of witnesses, let the best of the world be brought forth, I meane the famous Vniuersity of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> where being celebrated there, by the best wits of that Academy, I haue heard many speake of him, as the <hi>Grecians</hi> of their <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> and the <hi>Romanes</hi> of their <hi>Cicero;</hi> reputing <hi>Mateo Aleman</hi> as the Prince of eloquence in the Spanish tongue, as well for the modesty, &amp; dextrousnes of his style, as for his elegancies, and choice phrases. Of which opinion, was areligious <hi>Augustine,</hi> as discreet, as learned; who maintained in that Vniuersity, in a publike Act, that there was not from the beginning of the world, to this present day, that the first Part of this was printed, any booke of like nature to this, (being no diuine subiect) of greater eyther profit or pleasure.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Valençiano</hi> testifieth this truth; who (denying his name) falsly styles himselfe <hi>Mateo Lujan,</hi> that he might be taken for <hi>Mateo Aleman.</hi> And albeit he might parallel him in his name, and Country, yet that he should be the same man in his workes, it was not possible. Only therein his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice may be discouered, and that he did that he did, moued thereunto out of the benefit that he should reape therby: which if it had fallen out (as he expected) had been no small matter; But it fell out, (as fit it was) contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his expectation. For in that very self-same yeare that it came forth, I bought one in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which in the Frontispice, had its Impression in <hi>Castile,</hi> taking it to be authenticall and good, till I had read a little of it, and then it was not long, that his eares <note n="a" place="margin">
         <hi>Mostrar las orejas fuera del pellejo,</hi> is meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically an Asse.</note> shot out of his skin, and so came to be knowne what he was.</p>
   <p>But to let this passe, and to speake of those that admiring such a deale of depth and profoundnes both of wit and learning, being wonderfull wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to haue some learned and graue Fathers to adopt this childe of his begetting, they all laboured to seeke out some one, who for his quicknes of wit, greatnes of Schollership, and singularity of eloquence, might be able to vndertake so rare and admirable a peece of worke; all which doth argue the worth thereof, and redound to the greater glory of the true Author. And then shall they free themselues of this doubt, when they shall haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used his <hi>S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. Antonio de Padua,</hi> which out of a vow that he had made, to set forth his life &amp; miracles, made him so slow in publishing this his second Part. They shall see how miraculously he treateth of them, and it may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most be counted a miracle, if we will but consider how wonderfully he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed himselfe in the printing of them. For putting his papers from hand to hand to the Presse, and wanting matter for that dayes worke, I knew for certaine, that ouer-night he composed so much stuffe, as did serue to keepe the Presse going all the next day following: for he was troubled at that time with diuers other businesses, which did necessarily require his help and assistance. And in those short houres of the night, he was seene to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him-selfe with a great deale of diligence, as well in the affayres of his other businesses, as in the ordering and sorting of papers to send them to the Printers, as also, in the composing of more matter for the Presse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb facs="152"/>
his attendance vpon other things, importing his owne person and house. Euery one of which would haue well required a whole man, free from all other incumbrances. And that, which he wrote in this manner, was all the whole third Booke. And though euery-where through-out in all the rest of his writings, he hath show'd the Ocean of his wit, being that therein they shall find a most rich treasure of diuers Histories moralized, and expressed with all the elegancie that can be deuised, yet this is that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amelling, that beautifies that Iewell, and sets it best forth. As all those haue affirmed, who had the good hap to haue a sight thereof.</p>
   <p>What shall I say of this his Second Part of <hi>Guzman de Alfarache,</hi> and in how short a time he made it? Which seemeth almost a thing impossible, being so differing from his former, which he was forced to change and to alter, casting it in a new molde, for the reasons before deliuered. This will render sufficient testimony of his worth, &amp; bridle those rash tongues and head-strong spirits, which shall kick against him, and vainly and foolishly runne on to the wronging of their iudgements. If all that I haue said be truth, if the learned approue it, the vulgar deny it not, if the world confesseth it; (for here euery one may meet with that, which shall please his appetite, which <hi>Horace</hi> holds so difficult a thing,) if vnder a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane name he doth write so diuinely, that he may serue for a bridle to the bad, for a spurre to the good, for study to the learned, for entertainment to ordinary capacities, and in generall, for a fine Politicall, Ethicall, and Oeconomicall Schoole, and so full of sweetnesse and pleasure, that it may inuite any man to looke thereinto, and to dwell vpon that, which he shall finde there set downe, both for pleasure, and for profit. What doe I throw vpon him? or what doe I in this, more then to pay him that, which he so iustly deserueth? O happy <hi>Sevill,</hi> that maist amongst thy many Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, nay one of thy greatest, glory in this thy Sonne, whose laborious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuors, and indefatigable studies, (equalling the very best both <hi>Latines</hi> and <hi>Grecians,)</hi> haue thus truly merited and deserued, that all the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world, crowning his head with Bayes, and celebrating his name, should willingly, and with a great deale of triumph, sing forth his due prayse.</p>
