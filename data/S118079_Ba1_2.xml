                 <title>Pisgah euangelica : By the method of the Reuelation, presenting to publike view those Cananites ouer whom our Lord Iesus Christ and his holie Church shall triumph after seuerall battailes. That which is past is shewed in a briefe ecclesiasticall historie, containing most of the mutations which haue befallen the Church, from the yeere of our Lord 97, vnto the yeere 1603. as they haue been shewed vnto S. Iohn in Patmos, and recorded by such historiographers as are of least suspected faith. Gathered by William Symonds, sometimes fellow of Magdalen Colledge in Oxford</title>

   <p>THou seest (gentle Reader) that by the weight of <hi>Athanasius</hi> Arguments, the Papists are excluded from the number of true <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Catholikes,</hi> as well as the <hi>Arians,</hi> so farre forth as they obtrude any doctrine which was not from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but hath been deuised at seuerall times. Of this sort are the points in which we differ from them. It remaineth therefore that thou conclude, that either <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his fellowes, or the Pope with his followers are to be auoyded. The Lord blesse thy hunger and thirst after righteousnesse.</p>
