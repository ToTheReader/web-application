      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen <hi>Iupiters</hi> head was great with
childe, and the time of trauaile nere
at hand: he skorning to complaine,
yet put to his shiftes, was faine to
send for <hi>Vulcan</hi> the Smith, to crase
his crowne with a downedriuing
blow; not only to cause the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to cease, but also to prouide
passage for the birth of his babe. Which thing when
<hi>Vulcan</hi> had performed in giuing him a sound pat on the
pate, out start <hi>Pallas</hi> at the opening of his head, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
before him so maiden-like, that the present sight so
pleasant, expelled all former paines in the birth. Euen so
(most worthie sir) when the confused Chaos of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
following, was first inhabitant in my witlesse head:
then feared I no such swellings, as since I did feele, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
those throwes, which now are ouerpast. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
<pb facs="3"/>
when my braines fell to their busines, and began
to beate as tho my head had been ready to burst, disdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
withall the help of mother <hi>Crackfart</hi> the Midwife;
<hi>Iuno Lucina</hi> was as deafe as a dishclout, so that <hi>Volens
nolens</hi> I betooke my selfe to the hearbe <hi>Hellebore,</hi> whose
pleasant operation produced so present a purgation, that
forthwith there followed a most speedie deliuerance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
cares, renuing ioy. This young impe thus borne,
being brought to the font, was named <hi>Bacchus Bounty.</hi>
Which <hi>Bounty</hi> I willingly offer vnto your worthines;
doubting not at all, but that you will highly accept of
him; not only because he is a bonny boy, and the gift of
a welwiller: but also because hee was begot by <hi>Bacchus</hi>
your welbeloued friend; conceaued by me, &amp; nourished
euer since with the iuice of the grape. From <hi>Ale-foorde</hi>
this 9. of December. Anno Dom. 1592.</p>
