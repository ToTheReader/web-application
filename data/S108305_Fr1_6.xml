      <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is time (companions) that we quit our selues of the promise, which wee made one to another in the entrance of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses concerning man, to recreate our mindes sometimes (if God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gaue grace) in the faire and spatious fields of the <note n="*" place="margin">Or whole world.</note> Vniuers, by a diligent search and attentiue consideration of all nature: to the ende thereby the better to acknowledge the soueraigne author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to induce vs the more to honor him, who is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereupon we began at first to build, &amp; still desire to raise vp our Academie. For seeing the knowledge of God, tending to his seruice, is the principall outte of our being and of all our actions: and that his infinite essence cannot make it selfe to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended woorthily, and according to his greatnes by the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mans vnderstanding: it behooueth vs carefully to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vpon his workes, for so much as in them the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect
<pb facs="8"/>
of the world hath imprinted certaine marks of his glorie, sufficient to giue vs so much knowledge of his high Maiestie, and of that wherein he requireth vs to honour him; as our condition can beare, and according as is altogither necessarie for the health and repose of our soules. Now we consider of the worke of God principally in two things (yea, and to them we may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refer all the discourse concerning this matter:) to wit, in the creation conducting, and gouernment of his creatures; and in the mysterie of Redemption, which it hath pleased him to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe on mankinde. As then in the processe of our Academie, where wee haue amply entreated of the little world, which is Man, we haue begun to instruct our selues concerning the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest of his workes: so now I desire that wee may prosecute this goodly matter of the creation and being of the great world; if you (companions) will answere me with the same affection: And if we may obtaine so much fauour of our God, that being well instructed in his schoole of wisedome, and guided by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirit, we may dare to speake (and what may we not dare in seeking his glorie) of the incomprehensible secret of his worke for the health of man; we will assay to accomplish our worke, and rest our selues on this point.</p>

      <speaker>AMANA.</speaker>
      <p>For as much as the world is a shadow of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, and like a great booke of Nature and naturall Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie; and that all creatures contayned in the Vniuers, are like so many preachers and generall witnesses of the glorie of the creatour, as all the learned teach: we must diligently settle our vnderstanding to the contemplation of this shadow of the diuine brightnes, and our eies to the reading of this booke of Nature; and our eares to heare these naturall preachers, which teach vs to acknowledge God &amp; his prouidence aboue all things else, to the end to glorifie him as his bounty doth bind vs. We know also the great reasons which inuite vs to this natural search of all things, &amp; namely the impietie of our age, as we haue declared in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speech of the second Tome of our works, shewing that the world is of it selfe sufficient to vanquish all Atheisme, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Vniuers either so great or small, but from step to step doth direct man to acknowledgment of a diuinitie. Which will appeere more manifest vnto vs, if we entreat of the so great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of creatures. Boldly then (companions) let vs prosecute our
<pb facs="8"/>
purpose. If the enterprise be difficult, and too high for vs to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the summe thereof, yet to approch to things excellent, is alwaies very laudable.</p>
   </sp>

      <speaker>ARAM.</speaker>
      <p>Many blame discourses which are made, of heauen, for that they be feeble and very slender beeing compared to the beautie, and importance of the thing it selfe. And indeede I must confesse, that all that can bee spoken of the world accordeth therewith as it is in it selfe no more then the portraiture of the Romane common wealth vpon the shield of Aeneas, could meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly represent the greatnes and maiestie of the acts and power of this Empire. But howsoeuer it be, wee haue in the doctrine of the spheres most excellent principles and grounds, which prepare men to the knowledge of nature, and the author thereof; yea which aduance them (if they can apply this studie to his proper ende) in the vnderstanding of the secrets, wisdome, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, so far as the mind of man can pierce thereinto. Let vs then (companions) direct our sight straight towards the place, which wee must apprehend, to be blessed; to wit, towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and let vs especially regard God in his workes, as the onely limit whereto we shall and must once attaine.</p>

      <speaker>ACHITOB.</speaker>
      <p>The orderly motions of the heauens, the goodly workemanship of so many starry pauilions disposed one aboue the other, without any inter-annoiāce in their course; the accord, agreement, power, vertue and beautie of the elements; the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, stabilitie, and largenes of the earth in midst of the waters, which continually threaten it, and yet drowne it not; and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diuers natures, and creatures, which are, which liue, which haue sense and vnderstanding, in this whole great Vniuers, and serue each one in his place: all these things (I say) are like so many interpreters, to teach vs God, as their onely efficient cause, and to manifest him vnto vs in them and by them, as their finall cause. Therefore pursuing our first intent sufficiently declared in the beginning of our Academick discourse, and according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of the talke by vs obserued in our description of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall history of the Microcosme (or little world:) let vs here make (companions) as it were another history of the Macrocosme (or great world) first entreating of the creation of the world: then of the diuision of the same, afterwards of the orders of the spheres; of their substance, natures, and motions, of the influences and
<pb facs="9"/>
effects of their planets; consequently of the elements; and lastly of euery essence and creature therein contained; not by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular description of their kindes, which would amount to a work almost infinite, but onely of the principall of each sort, and so much as wee shall hold sufficient to induce euery one of vs, and of those which will deigne to heare vs, to consider, and highly to praise the wisedome of the father and moderator of all these things, in the creation, conduction, gouernance, and end of them: and by the vnion of their parts, with the whole, and among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, we haue enough to refer the euent of our purpose to their beginning and principall scope, which is, to know God and his prouidence, to the end to glorifie him. Declare then vnto vs (ASER) that which you haue learned of the creation of heauen and earth.</p>
