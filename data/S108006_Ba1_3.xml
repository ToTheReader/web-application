   <p>BEloued; I haue maruailed, what may be the cause of your walking
thus those. If because of my daily repaire vnto the Lords visited people, som
moneths since you fear to com near me, you must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that I haue bene

years in a mouse hole, and then come out. That <hi>Aphorisme</hi> (it is like)

      </gap> I am in bonds. An
vngodly feare, to bee ashamed of well doing. Such irregular walking, may cause
me to call in question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever you were a true friend, seeing one of

      <hi>A friend loueth
at all times, and a brother is borne for adversite.</hi> Besides, that such
keeping aloof (worse then that of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> for he came by night) it

<hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular:</hi> but if you would have first vnderstood me, and secondly
your selues; all that I did, was but a bringing of that doctrine, into distinct
methode, which (for the most part) was taught over-confusedly. In so much as

then doubtles you should not be so long destitute of comfort in any your

mercy.</hi> Make vpright steppes to your feet, and feare not an happy issue out
of all tentations. And so with my hearty prayers to God for your good, I leaue
you to his guidance, that neuer for sakes the faithfull.</p>
