      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>VNGARIE after many afflictions endured by her sworne enemies (the Turkes) for her vtter ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay: and after as many intreaties, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, and earnest petitions made to the Princes of Christendome, and to diuers persons of great reputation and authoritie amongst them, for the asswaging (or rather quite suppressing, if possible it could be) of these her wofull and intollerable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series: doth now at last wander abroade, and is come into our little Iland (it being as it were in the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most confines of Europe) in ragged and mournfull habits as a distressed Pilgrime, and with like zeale doth importune your Honour to assist her with your fauour; which though her attire be plaine and sad: yet such is her magnificent and illustrious minde, that
<pb facs="3"/>
vnder these meane and withered weedes, she onely in plaine and syncere manner, discouereth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of her lamentable estate: which happely if your Honour will vouchsafe to peruse this her pitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full discourse, she maketh no doubt, but that (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your accustomed goodnes, whereof most doe taste) she shall with like fauour be graced as other distressed strangers are. If any defects appeare in her presence, I humbly beseech you they may be fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably imputed to the ignorance (not wilfulnes) of her guyde, whose desire was rather safely to conduct her into England, then curiously to furnish her, had his abilitie been fully aunswerable to his good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Yet herein to manifest his willing minde, he hath aduentured to present her to your Honour, whose fauour and countenance may greatly grace her. In doing whereof, Hungarie (who now waileth for want of reliefe) shall thinke her selfe highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; and I, for her so good successe, shall not onely pray for the prosperous continuance of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable estate; but shall also rest most bound in all humble dutie and seruice at your Honours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund.</p>
