   <p>By these and sundry other like examples it is apparant that as Cities and cōmon vvelths vvere first foūded vpon good gouernment and common societie, for as long as they yeelded to the one, and maintained th'other, they prospered, and men became then not onely valiant and strong, beeing able to vvithstand the enemie: but also vvise, politike and vvelthy, able to maintain the common societie, and the priuat family. Such are the frutes of good gouernmēt, in the magistrate, and of dutiful obedience in the Subiect, and of the maintainance of the common societie in all men. For as the soule giueth life to the body: so dooth lavv dirict the Magistrate and Subiect and keep all things in due order, and therby giue life to a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or cōmon vvelth, all vvhich doo perish vvithout it, as the body dyeth beeing depriued of the soule.
