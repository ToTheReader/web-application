   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Readers, whom by my will I woulde haue onely Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and therefore to you I direct my woords. May it please you to vnderstand, that the great desire I haue to procure your delight, hath caused me somwhat to transgresse the boundes of faithfull freindship: for hauinge with great earnestnesse obtained of my very freinde Master <hi>George Pettie</hi> the copie of certaine Histories by himself vpon his owne and certaine of his freinds priuate occasions drawn into discourses, I saw sutch wittie &amp; pithie pleasantnes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in thē, that I thought I could not any way do greater pleasure or better seruice to your noble sexe, then to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish them in print, to your common profit &amp; pleasure. And though I am sure hereby to incur his displeasure, for that he willed me in any wise to keepe thē secret: yet if it please you thankfully to accept my goodwill, I force the lesse of his ill wil. For to speake my fancy without feigninge, I care not to displease twentie men, to please one woman: for the freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship amongst men, is to be counted but colde kindnesse, in respect of the feruent affection beetweene men and women: and our nature, is rather to doate of women, then to loue men. And yet it lyeth in your powers so to thinke of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to yeeld him sutch courteous consideration for the same, that hee shal haue more cause to thank me, then think ill of my faithles dealing towards him. Which if your cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies shall perfourme, you shall increase my dutie towardes you, and his good will towards mee: you shall make me shew my will and him his skill another time to pleasure you: you shall binde both of vs to remaine ready at your commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.
<pb facs="3"/>
For mine owne part, I can chaleng no part of praise or thankes for this woorke, for that I haue taken no paines therein, neither by addinge Argument, Note, or any thinge, but euen haue set them forth as they were sent mee: only I haue christened them with the name of a <hi>Pallace of Pleasure.</hi> I dare not compare this woorke with the former Pallaces of Pleasure, because comparisons are odious, and because they cōtaine Histories, translated out of graue authors &amp; learned writers: and this containeth discourses, deuised by a greene youthfull capacitie, and reported in a manner <hi>ex tempore,</hi> as I my selfe for diuers of them am able to testifie. I dare not commende them beecause I am partiall, I dare dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them to you Gentlewomen, beecause you are curteous. And that you may the better vnderstande the drift of these deuises, I haue caused the letter also which my freinde sent mee with this worke, to be set downe to your sight. Thus commending mine owne faithles enterprise, and my freinds fruitfull labour and learning, to your courteous protection, I wish you all, beuty with bounty, and cumlinesse with curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, from my lodging in Fleetstreete.</p>
