I assure you neither; but partly from contempt, and partly from feare. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> contempt proceeded from the manner of your writing, wherein you regarde not <gap reason="foreign">

         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: not how eyther truly or pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but how largelye you do wright: endeauouring nothing else, but eyther to abuse weake iudgements, or to feede the humors of such discontented persons, as wante o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> disgrace hath kept lower then they had set their swelling thoughts. The feare was occasioned by the nimble eare which lately was borne to the touche of this string: for which cause our English fugitiues did stand in some aduantage, in that they had free scope to publish whatsoeuer was agreeable to their pleasure; knowing right well, that their bookes could not be suppressed, and might not be answered.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>It may be you will question, wherefore I haue not answered your second part: it is ready for you, but I haue not now thought fit to divulge the same; partly because it hath beene dealt in by some others; but principallie because I know not how conuenient it may seeme, to discusse such particulars, as with generall both liking and applause are now determined. I forbeare to expresse your true name; I haue reserued that to my answere to some cast Pamphlet which I expect you will cast forth against mee: and I make little doubt but to driue you in the end to such desperate extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as (with <hi>Achitophell</hi>) to sacrifice your selfe to your owne shame, because your mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuous counsaile hath not bin embraced.</p>
