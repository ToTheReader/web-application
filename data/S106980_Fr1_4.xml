It is true that many who have spente the moste parte of theyre time in the profession of armes; Not with standinge they are ingnorante, and unable in accomplishinge withe theyre obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones with prudence and auctority, and that is resultinge of theyre idle life, and litle desire in well employenge there time, and for to hide theyr rude ingnorance, and litle skill in warr they are wonte to floute, and mocke at those of approved partes and sufficiency.</p>
   <p>Suche fellowes moste comonly in occasiones and incounteres with the enemy, (are puseled and amased) and all moste oute of theyre wittes, and that resultinge of theyre rude ingnorance, and litle perfection in warr. Not soe with the prudente and experimented Souldier, who in time of moste neede withe a setled mynde maketh notoriouse his resolute determinationes and perfection. Suche bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve conductores of vertues and prudente cariadge are to by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, for that to all posterity they leave a memory of theyre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noumed

actes; Soe this fruite of my laboure and longe practice in warr, togither with the desire and affection i allwayes had to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten my belooved contrimen, and others who are inclined to this arte.</p>
   <p>I doe protecte under the defence of those of renoumed actes, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente cariadge and perfection in warr. And not to those inclined to murmur, and full of burninge flames of Diabolicall malice; sheo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winge a milde and amiable countenance, and in theyre deedes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with pestrificall, ambition, and emulation. The heavens are grived, and hell rejoyseth for theyre wicked poysoned rancor. They leave to all posterity a memorie of theyre bad and odiouse iuclinationes, they are hated by those of verteouse life, goode ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicationes, and prudente cariadge, and moste comonly they finish theyre lives with a tormented and miserable ende.</p>
