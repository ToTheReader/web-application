your Ladie with this little remembrance, though simple and small in shew, yet of inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable valew in substance. Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is the most abiect sinne in the worlde, and caniustly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge no excuse for it selfe, bee it in how great or meane persons soeuer: And therefore least my selfe should therewith bee tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hauing found such extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie gentlenesse both in you and my good Ladie your wife, I haue made a learned and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine French man my interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour, to tell you in rude English, that I forget not such fauours.</p>
