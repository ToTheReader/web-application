   <head>A Fore-Speach To the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a seasonable saying of <hi>Nichodemus,</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.51.</note> (standing in our Lords defence)
<hi>Doth our Law judge any man, before it heare him, and know what hee
doth?</hi> I make no question (<hi>Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affectioned Reader</hi>) but thou
hast before this time, perused <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Pagets</hi> Booke, and hast there
seene many words tending to his owne justification, and our condemnation.
Now the thing that I shall desireous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly request of thee, is, that thou
wilt haue the patience, to read over this my Answer to it: And when thou
hast seriously studied, pondered and examined, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring rule of
Gods Word, all that both parties haue said in the whole caraige of this
busines; judge then, as God shall give thee understanding. Wishing thee
by the way to remember, what folly and shame it is for any, (as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon<note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.13.</note> sayth) <hi>to answer</hi>)
(or give sentence of) <hi>a matter before hee heare it.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>There are some things, which I thinke necessary first of
all, to informe thee off; and that is touching the <hi>reasons,</hi> why I
haue set forth this Treatise: Also, why in the manner it is.</p>
   <p>For the first, to let passe the many <hi>insultations</hi>
and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,</hi> which I haue suffred at some particular mens
handes, since his writing came forth, as if every thing were true that he
hath set downe against me. I am oftē by name particularly called upon, and
singled out to defend our <hi>Iust Complaint</hi> made against him.
Besides accused of committing many <hi>untruths, slaunders, lies,</hi>
with other crimes, little lesse then blasphemy: and this not against
himself alone, but Magistrates, Ministers, yea all Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches. If
I should therefore under these heavie charges, say nothing; would not
most men hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that I am guiltie. And so through my silence, I
should (which I dare not doe) dishonour God, betray the truth, and let goe
my owne innocency.</p>
   <p>Moreover I conceive that it lay upon me (though the meanest of
my Brethren) to reply; considering that the <hi>Booke of Complaints</hi> was
set forth chiefly by my meanes. Now my conscience for my part beares me
witnes, that I did the thing, out of love towards God, his truth and people;
and not (as is falsely suggested) of contention and a peeuish mind. And
I was thereto moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the sooner; 1. because the same was in many mens
hands already, and so rather publicke then private. 2. We had waited almost
a quarter of a yeare for answer, but could not obtaine it, although <hi>M<seg rend="sub">r</seg>.
Paget</hi> was spoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, many times about it. 3. It was given out, that
hee had writen 12 or 15 sheets of paper against us, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded shortly
to acquaint the world therewith: when this report was brought unto me, I
thought it requisite (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <pb facs="3"/>the copies by me) immediately to
publish them: that so (seeing hee would publikely write in confutation
thereof) men might truely understand, what our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular grieveances were.
And these causes of great and good regard, led me to doe, what I did. Of
which more is spoken in another place. Lastly whereas I haue had
occasion, to sit many times in our <hi>Consistory.</hi> Hence I haue
taken a more full and certaine knowledge of our common <hi>Ecclesiasticall
affaires.</hi> I mean, observed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freenes of our Congregation, and her
subjection to the power of the <hi>Classis,</hi> and in this regard, as I
know my self, the better able to give testimony of the truth in the
mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters betwixt us: so I thinke my self the more called to speake what I
truely may, in the just defence of my self and others.</p>
   <p>For the manner of this writing: Whosoever shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
either the subject here treated off; or the persons whom it chiefly
respecteth, will (I thinke) confesse, that there lay a necessity upon
mee, to use the best meanes I could, to haue it done unto some effectuall
purpose.</p>
   <p>But for my part, I must confesse, (and so I would haue all
men, in all places to know) that I am not in my self of the abilitie, to
compose a worke of this nature. And therefore thorow my entreatie and
desire, others (more able) haue taken some paines for me herein: both in
see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out learned Authours, as also setting them downe in the places
as they stand: On whose fidelity, skill and care I haue presumed the
publishing of them to the world: having this confidence in the
<hi>person,</hi> or <hi>persons,</hi> that they will stand to justify
all the allegations, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the end and use here produced. And if
just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion be offered, it may be they will adde some thing more
thereunto.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>As for the truth of the matter, this <hi>I owne</hi> under my owne
hand. And to use here <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Pagets</hi> words, <hi>for the testimony of
this truth, I am not ashamed to suffer that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, which some lay
upon me. Though I have allready bene smiten on the right checke,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Preface.</note>
      <hi>yet I am ready to turne the other also,
rather then to forsake this truth, which I iudge to be of great importance.
Yea if I were cast upon my death-bed, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to deliver up my soule in the
hands of the Lord, I should among my last words, professe before men
and Angels, that the things here pleaded for by me, are the holy precepts of
the eternall God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The reason why I haue not followed him, steppe by steppe
throughout his Booke, but haue principally insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted upon two points, viz.
<hi>promiscuous Baptisme,</hi> and the <hi>due power of the Church,</hi>
is, because on these depend all our differences: For if it be true (as it
is here prooved, to be most true) that it is unlawfull to baptise any
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, whose Parents (one at least) are not members of any visible
Church. And that every particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, is independent, and may, yea
ought to practise Ecclesiasticall Government, and all other Gods
spiritual ordinances, in, and of it self immediately from Christ: Then it
will follow, that our former <hi>protest</hi> is certainly true against him:
And so much (the premises granted) is by himself acknowledged; for thus
hee sayth: <hi>If this Church be deprived of that liberty and power, which
Christ hath given it, &amp;c.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Preface.</note>
      <hi>If
the Elders be deprived of their power in Government; for the good of the
Church: If I have subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the Church under the undue power of the
Classis, &amp;c. If these, and the like assertions in their Booke he
true, then is there cause to complaine of the miserable slavery and
bondage of this Church, and of Tyrannicall government. Then is there cause,
to commend and preferre the liberty and freedome, if <pb facs="4"/>the
Brownists, which are not subject unto the power of any Classis or Synod,
&amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Not to trouble then the Reader, with unnecessary
discourses; I am well contēted, in this to joyne issue with him, that
so all wise and judicious Readers, studious of the truth, by this meanes,
may the sooner perceive where the fault is, and censure it accordingly.</p>
   <p>Touching <hi>Mr. Pagets</hi> person, I hope all men shall
see, by the care which I haue had, to avoyd all bitternes, and unreverend
speaches, (howbeit often provoked to it) that I beare no ill will against
him; truely I doe not: For the Lord is a witnnes to my conscience, I ly not,
that I wish his good, many wayes, and shall be glad to heare that the Lord,
before his changing, doe give him repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the evills, which hee hath
committed against the Congregation; and other good Servants of God.
Howsoever, my hope is, that his sinne herein hath bene of ignorance, and
so God for his Sonnes sake will pardon it to him.</p>
   <p>So for the Classis, they are men whom I much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and
worship God with my soule, for the gifts and graces, which appeare in them:
Notwithstanding for their assuming unto themselves authority over our
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: This my mind gives me, is their fayling, and it cannot by Gods
Word be justified. Besides wee are a people of another Nation, whose
language they know not, at least most of them; and therefore to me it
seemes strange, that they should undertake the care and charge of us;
being in this regard most unfit for it. I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, put aside this
last age, there will not be found an example of the like practise anywhere,
since the Apostles dayes.</p>
   <p>To draw unto a conclusion, the thing that I chiefly <pb facs="5"/>ayme at, is, that the Churches of God hereafter, may keepe &amp;
practise the ordinances of Iesus Christ, and not under a pretence to haue
things better, then the <hi>Lords owne institutions,</hi> to give place unto
the sinfull devises of men. Let us consider Moyses words: <hi>Ye
shall observe to doe as the Lord your God hath commaunded you:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Deut. 5.32.</note>
      <hi>You shall not turne aside, to the right
hand, or to the left.</hi> When worldly Princes make any statutes; their
subjects are carefull strictly to doe them, without putting thereto, ought
of their owne. How much more, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>And as for any answer that shall be made unto this Treatise;
this I shall desire in it, 1. that all by-matters be layd aside, and the
truth followed in love, without gibes, reproaches, bitternes, &amp;c. things
unbeseeming the Saints of God.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Esa.</hi> 8.20.</note>
2. That <hi>Scripture-proofes</hi> be brought, for the matters in cōtroversy
betwixt us. <hi>To the Law, and to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony. All Scripture</hi>
(saith Paul) <hi>is given by inspiration of God,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2.
Ti. 3.16.</note>
      <hi>and is profitable for doctrine, for reproofe, for
correction, for instruction in righteousnes.</hi> 3. I doe wish that
whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall be writen, may be done to the glory of God, as of
sincerity, and for the truths sake.</p>
   <p>In short, I suppose, few will take it amisse, that I
haue now answered for my self, considering how often he hath called upon
me for it; <hi>Where is his warrant? where is his proofe? &amp;c.</hi> And
seldome am I named, but am charged with <hi>lying, slaundering,</hi> and
the like. Besides it is given out, that hee professeth a marvelous
desire, to see his Booke answered before hee dies. Now as hee shall
haue his content herein, so God grant, that hee make that good use of it,
as hee ought; and I wish hee may.</p>
