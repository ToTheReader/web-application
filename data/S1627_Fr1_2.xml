   <head>To the Reader or Buyer
of this Booke.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a true
saying, <hi>Tempus
omnia terminat.</hi>
So I, <hi>Gentle
Reader,</hi> hauing
gained experience all my life
to these present dayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I am ready to creepe into
the earth, willing now at the
important request of my best
Friends, haue yeelded my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb facs="3"/>
to lay the Glorie of my
Skill in <hi>Horsemanship</hi> open to
the World: And hauing kept
secret in the Cabinet of my
Brest, these Secrets, by which
I haue gained from many a
Noble person many a fayre
pound, I now bestow it vpon
thee for the value of <hi>Foure
Pence.</hi> It may bee some will
account mee a Foole in print
for disclosing my Secrets, but
I euer regarded the life of a
worthy Horse, before the
Word of a Foole. For bee
thou Noble, or what else, this
here I doe is for thy Good.
If you take pleasure either in
an Horse to <hi>Hunt,</hi> or for the
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Warre,</hi> or for the <hi>Race,</hi> or for
to <hi>Draw,</hi> or a <hi>Hackney,</hi> come
hither, buy, see, and welcome.
Take my opinion, and thou
shalt finde in this my honest
<hi>Faithfull Farryer,</hi> a <hi>Shoppe</hi> of
Skill for thee to view: Let
this bee thy Doctor, and thy
Druggist: Let this be thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structer
and Director. I hope
that no good minded <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryer</hi>
will be greeued with me
because I giue insight to the
Master of the Horse: For if
thy House were on fire, why
shouldest thou run to fetch
thy Neighbours Water to
quench it, when thine owne
is neerer at hand? So if the
<pb facs="4"/>
Horses Owner know by this
Booke how to saue the life
of his Horse, why should he
either ride or run to the <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryer?</hi>
But it may bee euerie
Owner of an Horse will not
buy a Booke. It matters not
if but euery <hi>Farryer</hi> haue one,
and but that one in a Towne,
I doubt not, but with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vse of that one, many
a Man shall saue the life of
his Beast. Come therefore
and reade these Secrets, which
cost me <hi>Paines, Studie, Practise,</hi>
and <hi>Labour;</hi> All which hath
cost mee <hi>Trouble</hi> for thy <hi>Ease.</hi>
This shall bee thy <hi>Pleasure</hi>
which hath beene my <hi>Toyle.</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
It shall bee thy <hi>Profit</hi> which
hath beene my <hi>Trouble:</hi> And
this shall bee thy <hi>Faithfull
Farryer</hi> and <hi>Inctructer.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For what Creature canst
thou name more necessarie
than the Horse, and what
more helpefull at a time of
need?</p>
   <p>For were wee without
Horse, in what a strait should
wee bee in, hee being our best
Seruant both in <hi>Warre</hi> and
<hi>Peace,</hi> and of that inestimable
value, that hee makes a Man
proud of his seruice.</p>
   <p>Now if an Horse be such
a profitable Seruant for Man,
let vs then respect the meanes
<pb facs="5"/>
that God hath giuen vs for
his Cure: For here is a <hi>Schoole</hi>
of Skill for thy knowledge.
First, How to make choyse of
a good Horse: Secondly,
what Countrey Horse is the
most fit for thy vse: Either
for seruice in <hi>Martiall</hi> or <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>
imployment, or for <hi>Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
or for <hi>Long trauell,</hi> or for
<hi>Draught,</hi> or for <hi>Coach,</hi> or for
<hi>Cart,</hi> or for <hi>Packe,</hi> or any other
<hi>Burthen.</hi> This shalt thou find
here, in as ample manner, as
if thou wert an old Master
in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> And this shall
bee my Glorie euen as long
as I liue, that I haue liued to
leaue this my last and best
<pb facs="5"/>
Worke to the World, and to
them which will not liue to
see it buried in <hi>Obliuion.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But mee thinkes I here
some <hi>Momus</hi> say, That the old
Captaine was vnaduised to
put this in print, which hee
euer kept as a rare Secret, and
it is true, <hi>Veritas odium parit.</hi>
But I reply, <hi>Tempus omnia ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat.</hi>
And though I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to my selfe, neuer to
haue published this worke,
yet being so continually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned
to print it, I was
forced to yeeld, though I had
promised the contrarie. And
let this excuse mee to those
<hi>Noble</hi> persons whose bountie
<pb facs="6"/>
I haue felt, that for them I was
the willinger to publish it in
print while I liued, fearing
that after my death, my then
Fatherlesse Child might get a
new name. But now I leaue
this, being begot in my old
age, to all Noble, &amp; Worthy
Gentlemen, and when they
looke not after him to the
<hi>Faithfull Farryer</hi> to be cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and to be knowne by the
name of <hi>Captaine</hi> GERVAS MARKHAMS
last and best Labours.</p>
