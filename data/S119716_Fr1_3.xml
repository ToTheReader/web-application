   <head>TO THE READER.</head>

      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD Reader the two Treatises ensuing were written by M. WENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WORTH, whose zealous affection to the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Religion, his Prince &amp; countrie, hath bene made better known to al her Maiesties good subjects, by his patient and constant indurance for so good a cause as he maintained, then it can be by any mans reporte or commendation. In the former (which by the advise of some friends he preferred to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie in forme of a supplication) is prooved, that for the safetie of the kingdomes of England and Scotland, and of the Religion professed in them, it is absolutelie necessarie that al the claimes and titles to the crowne of this Realme be tried by Parliament, and that the rightfull successour to her highnesse be declared and confirmed nowe in her Maiesties life-time. I doubt not but every re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligious and true hearted subiect is of his minde. The latter declaring his opinion concerning the person of the true &amp; lawfull successor, he sent to some privie friends at their instant request: it may seeme strange that hee woulde venture to write it, in respect of these ticklish times, and of his present troubles for a lesser matter: but yet there was strong reasons leading him to doe the same. I haue published them both not so much to procure commendation &amp; praise to the dead, though he iustlie deserue it for his most worthie
<pb facs="3"/> parts, as to worke a due regarde of right and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, to the good and behoofe of all my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triemen: and that he whose mouth was stopped from speaking the good which he would when he did liue, might now without danger openlie proclaime the same, (though some would not) after his death. And as he was accustomed to say to his friends, if it bee a duetie required of vs to communicate our knowledge in the meanest matters for mutuall instruction: who in any good conscience can suppresse his knowledge in matters so greatly importing every private and publick estate of these Realmes? yea both earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie kingdomes and the kingdome of Christ. For these respects I haue thought it expedient, that hee who hath spoken in the Parliament with so great regarde and good liking of all the hearers, shoulde nowe as it were with his owne mouth speak to all the subjects of England, seing it is a matter that so greatly concerneth vs all. I haue altered or suppressed no thing in either of them, vnles it be titles and names of persons, &amp; places, &amp; words of courtesie, which were not at al requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>site to be knowne. Some things I haue quoted in the margent for thy better vnderstanding, being acquainted with his meaning, and haue also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glished some things for the help of the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Now for my self (good Reader) I speak my opinion in the trueth of my conscience, that the Scottish King (for anything I knowe) hath the best right to succeede to our gracious and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Ladie. Wherein I am the more confirmed for that I know it to be the opinion of some mē, who make as much conscience of their doings,
<pb facs="3"/> and haue as much wisdome &amp; law in their bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, as any man whatsoever that is in this land. And to mee it seemeth a thing altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, yea voide of common sense and reason, to fetch with so great adoe the branches and pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from William the Conqueror, Edward the first, or Edward the third, and to contend and to dispute a fresh for the houses of Lancaster and Yorke, seeing all good men confesse, that the right must haue beene in the children of Henrie the seaventh, and Elizabeth eldest daughter to Edward the fourth. And if by all our judgemēts the two titles were in them most happily joined he must be vnhappie, that would seek to dissolue them. We haue paide too deare for pleading bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken titles: and other service will please God bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to purge this land with our bloode for our vnthankfulnesse of all the benefites which wee doe at this present enjoy. But to goe a little further, if her Maiestie had a daughter or sister, I dare be bolde to avouche that none in all Engl. durst presume to speak against her: yet she could not possibly haue any better rightor title, I speak of the ground of it, then the heires of the Lady Margaret Teuther may claime by her. For if the right of the brother King Henrie the 8. and his children be good, the right of his eldest sister La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Margaret and her heires cannot be badde, &amp; for want of his issue, hers must needes come in. The acts and statutes wrested against the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish king, are, in my conceit▪ by diverse sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie answered. The inconveniences pretended for barring him, are but suspitions and surmises al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged without any colourable ground, and
<pb facs="4"/> though they were true, yet they were rather to be admitted, then the manifest ruine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alms. Finally, I wish thee so to read these treatises of M. Wentworths, as hee was accustomed to read other mens, to wit, to yeeld tot he reason, and not to the man, for if he or I be deceived, it is enough that wee beare the blame of our owne error, though wee bee not also burdened with thine, and therefore do as thou will answere for it, for I seek thy good, and not to hurt thee. Thus protesting that with my hart I desire hereby no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then the preservation and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Religion, the standing of my natiue Prince and countrie, and that if I did knowe a better right then the Scottish kings, I would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedlie favour it, I leaue thee for this matter to the gracious direction of the Almighty.</p>
