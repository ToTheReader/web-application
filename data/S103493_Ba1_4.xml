      <hi>Henry Welby,</hi> Esquire, who dyed at his House in <hi>Grub-streete,</hi> and lyeth buried in the Church of Saint <hi>Giles,</hi> neare <hi>Cripple-gate.</hi>
   </head>
   <l>WHo on the setting Sun shal cast their eyes,</l>
   <l>May easily guess next morning how he'l rise.</l>
   <l>Those that our parting from this old world view,</l>
   <l>May presuppose what welcome in the new</l>
   <l>Is to be had; but best, when <hi>Qualis vita</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Is sweetly Echo'd to by <hi>Finis ita.</hi>
   </l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="25"/>If this be true, as no man needs to doubt,</l>
   <l>Search this mans life, nay, all the world through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</l>
   <l>To paralell in both, 'tmay be deny'd</l>
   <l>Many more strictly liv'd, more Saint-like dy'd:</l>
   <l>And therefore we may fairely hope, that he</l>
   <l>Is now where we may wish our selves to be.</l>
   <l>This man through many stormes &amp; tempests hurld,</l>
   <l>Though he was in, yet was not of the world;</l>
   <l>When forty foure yeeres since he did divide</l>
   <l>Himselfe from men, even then to men he dy'd:</l>
   <l>And at that time, his precious soule to save,</l>
   <l>His Chamber made his Chappell, Bed his Grave.</l>
   <l>What did he now then? since none twice can dye,</l>
   <l>He chang'd his Bed, remote from noise to lye,</l>
   <l>Where undisturb'd, he better rest might take,</l>
   <l>Untill the Angels Trumpet him awake.</l>
   <l>This, of such note, so late, shall we let passe</l>
   <l>Sleightly? No; rather make his Dust our Glasse,</l>
   <l>Him our <hi>Memento,</hi> and his Life (no lesse)</l>
   <l>A Mirrour, by the which our lives to dresse.</l>
   <l>And though we strive not to be like austere,</l>
   <l>(For that indeed scarce humane strength can beare)</l>
   <l>Let's in some sort our love to vertue shew,</l>
   <l>And crawle like Children, ere they well can goe.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="26"/>If he hath beene so abstinent? at least</l>
   <l>Let us forbeare to surfeit when we feast.</l>
   <l>He dranke no Wine at all, let us not use</l>
   <l>Immoderate Cups, our senses to abuse.</l>
   <l>His cloaths were onely to defend from cold,</l>
   <l>Shall our pyde garments then be dawb'd with gold?</l>
   <l>Many his Manours were, and great his rent,</l>
   <l>Yet he with one small chamber was content.</l>
   <l>Then let not such, already well possest</l>
   <l>By powers hye hand, their lands from others wrest.</l>
   <l>His Temperance all vaine obiects did despise,</l>
   <l>Let us then make some covenant with our eyes:</l>
   <l>If he from his best strength to his last houres</l>
   <l>Pull'd downe his body, let's not pamper ours.</l>
   <l>Rare Presidents ought to be followed most:</l>
   <l>Than this, a rarer there's no Age can boast.</l>
