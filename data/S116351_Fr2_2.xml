   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>REligion</hi> (saith S. Thomas in 22. quest: 81. Art. 1.) <hi>is a vertue by which men giue to God due worshipp and reuerence:</hi> wherin hee agreeth with <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> (in his book of the nature of God) saying: <hi>It is the office of religion to giue due honor vnto God.</hi> And the honor and worshipp which is cheef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and most properly due vnto God is the inuisible Sacrifice of the heart, and the outward visible Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of some creature to expresse the inuisible Sacrifice of the soule, as wordes doe things, which is properly <hi>Latria</hi> or seruice due vnto God, as God and Creator of all things, as I haue shewed more at large in the 5. and 6. Chapters of the first part. Whereupon it cometh to passe, that without the offering of visible Sacrifice, there cannot be any perfect <hi>Religion;</hi> for though some of the more pious sort of men, by a longer custome, and much practise, may attaine vnto a continuall, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inuisible Sacrifice of their hearts, by inward ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogicall actes without the helpe of exterior visible Sacrifice; yet because the myndes of men in this life, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the organs of the bodie for their knowledge
<pb n="4" facs="80"/> and operations, therefore they haue need, to be lead by the hand of sensible and visible things vnto God, and inuisible: because as <hi>S. Paule</hi> saith in the first to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the inuisible things of God are knowne by the visible, and the increated by the creature, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in this life be well knowne, or learned of man by other meanes. Therefore <hi>Religion</hi> cannot stand without visible Sacrifice, which may as by a signe, or motiue, conduct the mindes of men vnto the inuisible of the heart; so to be vnyted vnto God.</p>
   <p>Againe, the strength of a kingdome is the vnitie, or concord of the subiects amongst themselues, and with their Soueraigne vnder God; and by visible Sacrifice, not onely a league of freindshippe, and ciuill vnitie is made amongst men, by the participation and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the thing, that is sacrificed, as is proued in the 2. chapter of the first part; but also there passeth, as it were a couenant betwixt God and them, whereby they become his particular people, and he their God, and Protector, without whose particular prouidence and protection, no common wealth can either prosper or stand. VVhereupon it cometh to passe, that there cannot be anie perfect common wealth or well framed monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, without the offering of visible Sacrifice to God; for
<pb n="5" facs="80"/> which cause <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in the 7. of his politickes, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the things which are precisely necessarie to the preseruation of a common-wealth (guided by the light of abondant reason) giueth order that <hi>Speciall care be had of the Sacrifice to the Gods:</hi> because this is the end and office of visible Sacrifice, to vnite men with God, and amongst themselues; as further witnesseth <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in the 5. Chapter of his 10. booke of the Cittie of God; saying: <hi>VVhatsoeuer things we reade, to haue been commanded by God diuers waies, concerning sacrifices in misterie of the tabernacle, or of the temple, they are referred vnto the loue of God, and of our neighbour;</hi> by which loue peace, vnitie, and concord, the commonwealth is established. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, seeing that some kinde of exterior visible Sacrifice, is so absolutely necessarie, both to the state of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the perfection of a common wealth, as that they cannot well stand, or be without them, it cannot be that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> our Lord, the wisdome of his eternall Father, should either establish a <hi>Religion,</hi> or plant a common wealth amongst men without the institution of a daily Sacrifice, as I shall shew more at large, in the ensuing chapters.</p>
