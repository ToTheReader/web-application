   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Haritable Reader, it is one of the golden Sentences, which Christ our Sauiour vttered to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, that there <hi>is nothing so couered,
<note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> that shal not be reuealed, neither so hidde, that shall not be knowen: and whatsoeuer they haue spoken in darkenesse, should be heard in the light: and that which they had spoken in the eare in secret place, should be publikely preached on the tops of the houses:</hi> And since he hath said it, most trew must it be, fince the authour thereof is the fountaine and very being of trewth: which should mooue all godly and honest men, to be very warie in all their secretest actions, and whatsoeuer middesses they vse for attaining to their most wished ends; lest other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise how auowable soeuer the marke be, whereat they aime, the middesses being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to be shamefull whereby they climbe, it may turne to the disgrace both of the good worke it selfe, and of the authour thereof; since the deepest of our secrets, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hidde from that all-seeing eye and penetrant light, piercing through the bowels of very darkenesse it selfe.</p>
   <p>But as this is generally trew in the actions of all men, so is it more specially trew in the affaires of Kings: for Kings being publike persons, by reason of their office and authority, are as it were set (as it was said of old) vpon a publike stage, in the sight of all the people; where all the beholders eyes are attentiuely bent to looke and pry in the least circumstance of their secretest drifts: Which should make Kings the more carefull not to harbour the secretest thought in their minde, but such as in the owne time they shall not be ashamed openly to auouch; assuring themselues that Time the mother of Veritie, will in the due season bring her owne daughter to perfection.</p>
   <p>The trew practise hereof, I haue as a King oft found in my owne person, though I thanke God, neuer to my shame, hauing laide my count, euer to walke as in the eyes of the Almightie, examining euer so the secretest of my drifts, before I gaue them course, as how they might some day bide the touchstone of a publike triall. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst therest of my secret actions, which haue (vnlooked for of me) come to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like knowledge, it hath so fared with my <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, directed to my eldest son; which I wrote for exercise of mine owne ingyne, and instruction of him, who is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God (I hope) to sit on my Throne after me: For the purpose and matter thereof being onely fit for a King, as teaching him his office; and the person whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for it was ordained, a Kings heire, whose secret counsellor and faithfull admonisher it must be, I thought it no wayes conuenient nor comely, that either it should to all be
<pb n="142" facs="93"/>proclaimed, which to one onely appertained (and specially being a messenger betwixt two so coniunct persons) or yet that the mould whereupon he should frame his future behauiour, when hee comes both vnto the perfection of his yeeres, and possession of his inheritance, should before the hand be made common to the people, the subiect of his future happy gouernment. And therefore for the more secret and close keeping of them, I onely permitted seuen of them to be printed, the Printer being first sworne for secrecie: and these seuen I dispersed amongst some of my trustiest seruants, to be keeped closely by them, lest in case by the iniquitie or wearing of time, any of them might haue beene lost, yet some of them might haue remained after me, as witnesses to my Sonne, both of the honest integritie of my heart, and of my fatherly affection and naturall care towards him. But since contrary to my intention and expectation, as I haue alreadie said, this Booke is now vented, and set foorth to the publike view of the world, and consequently subiect to euery mans censure, as the current of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection leades him, I am now forced, as well for resisting to the malice of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of enuie, who like waspes sucke venome out of euery wholsome herbe; as for the satisfaction of the godly honest sort, in any thing that they may mistake therein, both to publish and spread the true copies thereof, for defacing of the false copies that are alreadie spread, as I am enformed; as likewise by this Preface, to cleare such parts thereof, as in respect of the concised shortnesse of my Style, may be mis-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein.</p>
   <p>To come then particularly to the matter of my Booke, there are two speciall great points, which (as I am informed) the malicious sort of men haue detracted therein; and some of the honest sort haue seemed a little to mistake: whereof the first and greatest is, that some sentences therein should seeme to furnish grounds to men, to doubt of my sinceritie in that Religion, which I haue euer constantly professed: the other is, that in some parts thereof I should seeme to nourish in my minde, a vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue resolution against <hi>England,</hi> or at the least, some principals there, for the Queene my mothers quarrell.</p>
   <p>The first calumnie (most grieuous indeed) is grounded vpon the sharpe and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wordes, that therein are vsed in the description of the humors of Puritanes, and rash-headie Preachers, that thinke it their honour to contend with Kings, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe whole kingdomes. The other point is onely grounded vpon the strait charge. I giue my Sonne, not to heare nor suffer any vnreuerent speeches or bookes against any of his parents or progenitors: wherein I doe alledge my owne experience anent the Queene my mother; affirming, that I neuer found any that were of perfit aage the time of her reigne here, so stedfastly trew to me in all my troubles, as these that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly kept their allegiance to her in her time. But if the charitable Reader will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly consider, both the methode and matter of my Treatise, he will easily iudge, what wrong I haue sustained by the carping at both: For my Booke, suppose very small, being diuided in three seuerall parts; the first part thereof onely treats of a Kings duety towards God in Religion, wherein I haue so clearely made profession of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, calling it the Religion wherein I was brought vp, and euer made profession of, and wishing him euer to continue in the same, as the onely trew forme of Gods worship; that I would haue thought my sincere plainnesse in that first part vpon that subiect, should haue ditted the mouth of the most enuious <hi>Momus,</hi> that euer
<pb n="143" facs="93"/>hell did hatch, from barking at any other part of my booke vpon that ground, except they would alledge me to be contrarie to my selfe, which in so small a volume would smell of too great weakenesse, and sliprinesse of memory. And the second part of my booke, teaches my Sonne how to vse his Office, in the administration of Iustice and Politicke Gouernment: The third onely containing a Kings outward behauiour in indifferent things; what agreeance and conformitie hee ought to keepe betwixt his outward behauiour in these things, and the vertuous qualities of his minde; and how they should serue for trunsh-men, to interprete the inward disposition of the minde, to the eyes of them that cannot see farther within him, and therefore must onely iudge of him by the outward appearance: So as if there were no more to be looked into, but the very methode and order of the booke, it will sufficiently cleare me of that first and grieuousest imputation, in the point of Religion: since in the first part, where Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is onely treated of, I speake so plainely. And what in other parts I speake of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes, it is onely of their morall faults, in that part where I speake of Policie: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring when they contemne the Law and souereigne authoritie, what exemplare pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment they deserue for the same. And now as to the matter it selfe whereupon this scandall is taken, that I may sufficiently satisfie all honest men, and by a iust Apologie raise vp a brasen wall or bulwarke against all the darts of the enuious, I will the more narrowly rip vp the words, whereat they seeme to be somewhat stomacked.</p>
   <p>First then, as to the name of Puritanes, I am not ignorant that the style thereof doeth properly belong onely to that vile sect amongst the Anabaptists, called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of loue; because they thinke themselues onely pure, and in a maner without sinne, the onely trwe Church, and onely worthy to be participant of the Sacraments, and all the rest of the world to be but abomination in the sight of God. Of this speciall sect I principally meane, when I speake of Puritans; diuers of them, as <hi>Browne, Penry</hi> and others, hauing at sundrie times come into Scotland, to sow their popple amongst vs (and from my heart I wish, that they had left no schollers behinde them, who by their fruits will in the owne time be manifested) and partly indeede, I giue this style to such brain-sicke and headie Preachers their disciples and followers, as refusing to be called of that sect, yet participate too much with their humours, in maintaining the aboue mentioned errours; not onely agreeing with the generall rule of all Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, in the contempt of the ciuill Magistrate, and in leaning to their owne dreams and reuelations; but particularly with this sect, in accounting all men profane that sweare not to all their fantasies, in making for euery particular question of the policie of the Church, as great commotion, as if the article of the Trinitie were called in controuersie, in making the scriptures to be ruled by their conscience, and not their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science by the Scripture; and he that denies the least iote of their grounds, <hi>sit tibi tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ethnicus &amp; publicanus;</hi> not worthy to enioy the benefite of breathing, much lesse to participate with them of the Sacraments: and before that any of their grounds be impugned, let King, people, Law and all be trode vnder foote: Such holy warres are to be preferred to an vngodly peace: no, in such cases Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not onely to be resisted vnto, but not to be prayed for, for prayer must come of Faith; and it is reuealed to their consciences, that GOD will heare no prayer for such a Prince. Iudge then, Christian Reader, if I wrong this sort of people, in giuing them the stile of that sect, whose errours they imitate: and since they are contented
<pb n="144" facs="94"/>to weare their liuerie let them not be ashamed to borrow also their name. It is onely of this kinde of men, that in this booke I write so sharply; and whom I wish my Sonne to punish, in-case they refuse to obey the Law, and will not cease to sturre vp a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: Whom against I haue written the more bitterly, in respect of diuers famous libels, and iniurious speaches spred by some of them, not onely dishonourably inuectiue against all Christian Princes, but euen reprochfull to our profession and Religion, in respect they are come out vnder coulour thereof: and yet were neuer answered but by Papists, who generally medle aswell against them, as the religion it selfe; whereby the skandale was rather doubled, then taken away. But on the other part, I protest vpon mine honour, I meane it not generally of all Preachers, or others, that like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the single forme of policie in our Church, then of the many Ceremonies in the Church of England: that are perswaded, that their Bishops smell of a Papall supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, that the Surplise, the cornerd cap, and such like, are the outward badges of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish errours. No, I am so farre from being contentious in these things (which for my owne part I euer esteemed as indifferent) as I doe equally loue and honour the learned and graue men of either of these opinions. It can no wayes become me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce so lightly a sentence, in so old a controuersie. Wee all (God be praised) doe agree in the grounds; and the bitternesse of men vpon such questions, doeth but trouble the peace of the Church; and giues aduantage and entry to the Papists by our diuision: But towards them, I onely vse this prouision, that where the Law is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, they may content themselues soberly and quietly with their owne opinions, not resisting to the authoritie, nor breaking the Law of the Countrey; neither aboue all, sturring any rebellion or schisme: but possessing their soules in peace, let them preasse by patience, and well grounded reasons, either to perswade all the rest to like of their iudgements; or where they see better grounds on the other part, not to bee ashamed peaceably to incline thereunto, laying aside all praeoccupied opinions.</p>
   <p>And that this is the onely meaning of my Booke, and not any coldnesse or cracke in Religion, that place doeth plainely witnesse, where, after I haue spoken of the faults in our Ecclesiasticall estate I exhort my sonne to be beneficiall vnto the good-men of the Ministrie; praising God there, that there is presently a sufficient number of good men of them in this kingdome: and yet are they all knowne to be against the forme of the English Church. Yea, so farre I am in that place from admitting corruption in Religion, as I wish him in promoouing them, to vse such caution, as may preserue their estate from creeping to corruption; euer vsing that forme through the whole Booke, where euer I speake of bad Preachers, terming them some of the Ministers, and not Ministers or Ministrie in generall. And to conclude this point of Religion, what indifferencie of Religion can <hi>Momus</hi> call that in mee, where, speaking of my sonnes marriage (in case it pleased God before that time to cut the threed of my life) I plainly forewarne him of the inconuenients that were like to ensew, incase he should marry any that be of a different profession in Religion from him: notwithstanding that the number of Princes professing our Religion be so small, as it is hard to foresee, how he can be that way, meetly matched according to his ranke.</p>
   <p>And as for the other point, that by some parts in this booke, it should appeare, that I doe nourish in my minde, a vindictiue resolution against England, or some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals there; it is surely more then wonderfull vnto me, vpon what grounds they can
<pb n="145" facs="94"/>haue gathered such conclusions. For as vpon the one part, Ineither by name nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription poynt out England in that part of my discourse; so vpon the other, I plainly bewray my meaning to be of Scottish-men, where I conclude that purpose in these termes: <q>That the loue I beare to my Sonne, hath mooued me to be so plaine in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: for so that I discharge my conscience to him in vttering the verity, I care not what any traitour or treason-allower doe thinke of it.</q> And English-men could not thereby be meant, since they could be no traitours, where they ought no alleageance. I am not ignorant of a wise and princely apophthegme, which the same Queene of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland vttered about the time of her owne Coronation. But the drift of that discourse doth fully cleare my intention, being onely grounded vpon that precept to my Sonne, that he should not permit any vnreuerent detracting of his praedecessours; bringing in that purpose of my mother onely for an example of my experience anent Scottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, without vsing any perswasion to him of reuenge. For a Kings giuing of any fault the dew stile, inferres no reduction of the faulters pardon. No, I am by a degree nearer of kinne vnto my mother then he is, neither thinke I my selfe, either that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie, or that neere my end, that I neede to make such a <hi>Dauidicall</hi> testament; since I haue euer thought it the dewtie of a worthie Prince, rather with a pike, then a penne, to write his iust reuenge: But in this matter I haue no delite to be large, wishing all men to iudge of my future proiects, according to my by-past actions.</p>
   <p>Thus hauing as much insisted in the clearing of these two points, as will (I hope) giue sufficient satisfaction to all honest men, and leauing the enuious to the foode of their owne venome; I will heartily pray thee, louing Reader, charitably to conceiue of my honest intention in this Booke. I know the greatest part of the people of this whole Isle, haue beene very curious for a sight thereof: some for the loue they beare me, either being particularly acquainted with me, or by a good report that perhappes they haue heard of me; and therefore longed to see any thing, that proceeded from that authour whom they so loued and honoured; since bookes are viue Idees of the authours minde. Some onely for meere curiositie, that thinke it their honour to know all new things, were curious to glut their eyes therewith, onely that they might vaunt them to haue seene it: and some fraughted with causlesse enuie at the Authour, did gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily search out the booke, thinking their stomacke jit ynough, for turning neuer so wholesome foode into noysome and infectiue bumours: So as this their great concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in curiofitie (though proceeding from farre different complexions) hath enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the vn-timous divulgating of this Booke, farre contrarie to my intention, as I haue alreadie said. To which <hi>Hydra</hi> of diuersly-enclined spectatours, I haue no targe to oppone but plainenesse, patience, and sinceritie: plainenesse, for resoluing and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the first sort; patience, for to beare with the shallownesse of the next; and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie, to defie the malice of the third with-all. Though I cannot please all men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I am contented, so that Ionely please the vertuous sort: and though they also finde not euery thing therein, so fully to answere their expectation, as the argument would seeme to require; although I would wish them modestly to remember, that God hes not bestowed all his gifts vpon one, but parted them by a iustice distributiue; and that many eyes see more then one; and that the varietie of mens mindes is such, that <hi>tot capita totsensus;</hi> yea, and that euen the very faces, that God hath by nature brought foorth in the world, doe euery one in some of their particular lineaments, differ from
<pb n="146" facs="95"/>any other: yet in trewth it was not my intention in handling of this purpose (as it is easie to perceiue) fully to set downe heere all such grounds, as might out of the best wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue beene alledged, and out of my owne inuention and experience added, for the perfite institution of a King: but onely to giue some such precepts to my owne Sonne, for the gouernement of this kingdome, as was meetest for him to be instructed in, and best became me to be the informer of.</p>
   <p>If I in this Booke haue beene too particularly plaine, impute it to the necessitie of the subiect, not so much being ordained for the institution of a Prince in generall, as I haue said, as containing particular precepts to my Sonne in speciall: whereof he could haue made but a generall vse, if they had not contained the particular diseases of this kingdome, with the best remedies for the same, which it became me best as a King, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing learned both the theoricke and practicke thereof, more plainely to expresse, then any simple schoole man, that onely knowes matters of kingdomes by contemplation.</p>
   <p>But if in some places it seeme too obscure, impute it to the shortnesse thereof, being both for the respect of my selfe, and of my Sonne, constrained there-unto: my owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, for fault of leasure, being so continually occupied in the affaires of my office, as my great burthen, and restlesse fashery is more then knowen, to all that knowes or beares of me: for my Sonnes respect, because I know by my self, that a Prince so long as he is young, wil be so caried away with some sort of delight or other, that he cannot pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently abide the reading of any large volume: and when he comes to a ful maturity of aage, he must be so busied in the actiue part of his charge, as he will not be permitted to bestow many houres vpon the cōtemplatiue part therof: So as it was neither fit for him, nor possible for me, to haue made this Treatise any more ample then it is. Indeed I am li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beholden to the curiositie of some, who thinking it too large alreadie (as appears) for lacke of leisure to copy it, drew some notes out of it, for speeds sake; putting in the one halfe of the purpose, and leauing out the other: not vnlike the man that alledged that part of the Psalme, <hi>non est Deus,</hi> but left out the praeceeding words, <hi>Dixit insipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens in corde suo.</hi> And of these notes, making a little pamphlet (lacking both my methode and halfe of my matter) entituled it, forsooth, <hi>the Kings Testament,</hi> as if I had eiked a third Testament of my owne to the two that are in the holy Scriptures. It is trew that in a place thereof, for affirmation of the purpose I am speaking of to my Sonne, I bring my selfe in there, as speaking vpon my Testament: for in that sense, euery record in write of a mans opinion in anything (in respect that papers out-liue their authours) is as it were a Testament of that mans will in that case: and in that sense it is, that in that place I call this Treatise a Testament. But from any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sentence in a booke, to giue the booke it selfe a title, is as ridiculous, as to style the booke of the Psalmes, the booke of <hi>Dixit insipiens,</hi> because with these wordes one of them doeth begin.</p>
   <p>Well, leauing these new baptizers and blockers of other mens books, to their owne follies, Ireturne to my purpose, anent the shortnesse of this booke, suspecting that all my excuses for the shortnesse thereof, shall not satisfie some, especially in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour countrey: who thought, that as I haue so narrowly in this Treatise touched all the principall sicknesses in our kingdome, with ouertures for the remedies thereof, as I said before: so looked they to haue found something therein, that should haue touched the sicknesses of their state, in the like sort. But they will easily excuse me thereof, if they
<pb n="147" facs="95"/>will consider the forme I haue vsed in this Treatise; wherein I onely teach my Son, out of my owne experience, what forme of gouernment is fittest for this kingdome: and in one part thereof speaking of the borders, I plainely there doe excuse my selfe, that I will speake nothing of the state of <hi>England,</hi> as a matter wherein I neuer had experience. I know indeed, no kingdome lackes her owne diseases, and likewise what interest I haue in the prosperitie of that state: for although I would be silent, my blood and discent doeth sufficiently proclaime it. But notwithstanding, since there is a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Queene there presently reigning, who hath so long with so great wisedome and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie gouerned her kingdomes, as (I must in trew sinceritie confesse) the like hath not beene read nor heard of, either in our time, or since the dayes of the Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Augustus;</hi> it could no wayes become me, farre inferiour to her in knowledge and experience, to be a busie-body in other princes matters, and to fish in other folkes waters, as the prouerbe is: No, I hope by the contrary (with Gods grace) euer to keepe that Christian rule, To doe as I would be done to: and I doubt nothing, yea euen in her name I dare promise, by the bypast experience of her happy gouernment, as I haue already said, that no good subiect shall be more carefull to enforme her of any corruptions stollen in in her state, then shee shall be zealous for the discharge of her conscience and honour, to see the same purged, and restored to the ancient integritie; and further during her time, becomes me least of any to meddle in.</p>
   <p>And thus hauing resolued all the doubts, so farre as I can imagine, may be moued against this Treatise; it onely rests to pray thee (charitable Reader) to interprete fauourably this birth of mine, according to the integritie of the author, and not looking for perfection in the worke it selfe. As for my part, I onely glory thereof in this point, that I trust no sort of vertue is condemned, nor any degree of vice allowed in it: and that (though it be not perhaps so gorgeously decked, and richly attired as it ought to be) it is at the least rightly proportioned in all the members, without any menstrous deformitie in any of them: and specially that since it was first written in secret, and is now published, not of ambition, but of a kinde of necessitie; it must be taken of all men, for the trew image of my very minde, and forme of the rule, which I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to my selfe and mine; Which as in all my actions I haue bitherto preassed to expresse, so farre as the nature of my charge, and the condition of time would permit me: so beareth it a discouery of that which may be looked for at my hand, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euen in my secret thoughts, I haue engaged my selfe for the time to come. And thus in a firme trust, that it shall please God, who with my being and Crowne, gaue me this minde, to maintaine and augment the same in me and my posteritie, to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our conscience, the maintenance of our Honour, and weale of our people, I bid thee heartily farewell.</p>
