      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ay it please your HH. to vnderstand, that hauing by my fathers appointmēt for exercise sake, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my poore skill, translated out of Latin into English, this worthy worke following: and God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing besides prepared a way (when I did neither thinke nor know of it) to bring it to light &amp; sight of men, by putting it into Print, I bethought my selfe, as well as my want of yeares &amp; discretion would suffer me, of some worthy persons &amp; patrōs to whom I might dedicate these my simple labours. Amōgst many none came more
<pb facs="3"/>oftē &amp; more iustly into my remēbrance, thā your HH. whose affectiō in the Lord to my father, and some measure of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian care for me in the world, haue made me bold, &amp; euen as it were to presume, to dedicate these simple fruits of my first tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes vnto you. What reasons I haue besides those alledged to lead me thereto, I shall not need largely to lay out. Your HH. zeale to Religion: your fauours to me, as also some declaration of all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull thankefulnesse from my selfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you for the same haue greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked me. In whō though there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as in regard of my selfe and paines taken herein, that may commend it, yet as in respect of the worke it selfe, sure I am, not by mine owne iudgement I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test (for how weake and childish that is, I very well know) but by the sentence of sundry very learned men, both for the soundnesse and sufficiencie of the things therein contained, as also for the metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall maner of handling the same, there will be found much that may well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeme your HH. profession and place. And so earnestly praying the good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
<pb facs="3"/>of that which is done, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your HH. patronage it may be the better receiued amongst men: and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseeching the continuance of your HH. fauours, that so I may the better proceede in godlinesse and learning, whereunto my parents, though not able indeede of themselues to maintaine me therein, haue vnfainedly dedicated me, &amp; I my self haue willingly vowed my selfe; and hartily crauing pardon for my bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse &amp; scapes this or any other way cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, I humbly end.</p>
