      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that I had by the good aduise and earnest persuation of certaine of my brethren Ministers of this citty of London trāslate out of latine into our vulgar tongue <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>s litle booke intituled The preacher or Methode of preaching &amp;c. necessary for all those y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> by the true &amp; sincere preaching of the worde, labour to pull downe the sinagogue of Satan and to build vp the temple of God, I thought
<pb facs="77"/>
it my bounden duty (right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and my singuler good Lady) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same vnto your honour, and that for diuers and sondrye causes. VVherof the first and chiefest is that zeale and godlines in the true religiō &amp; fayth of our sauiour Christ, which I by experience haue noted and foūd to be such in you, that you do not onely your selfe dailye serue God by prayer, but do also straightly commaunde all your family and see them do the same. Imitating herein the example of the faythfull father of all the Sonnes of God Abrahā, who did not onely him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe but also appointed his whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily which was greate to serue God daily. The second cause is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> correctiō of sinne, by displacinge and puttinge cleane out of your house al such which
<pb facs="77"/>
by their vngodlines might either brīg vppon themselues the iuste plague of Almighty God, or els be an euill exā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnto others to cōmit the like. The third is your honours gret meekenes, patience and modestye towardes all mē and in all your affayres. The last cause is for y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it pleased your honour of your goodnes &amp; mere liberality to accepte and take me to be your house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chaplaine, &amp; as it were a guide and helper of that godly zeale of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon the name of God, &amp; recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his Sacraments. These causes therefore diligentlye considered, I thought it my duty to dedicate y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> first fruits of this my labour vnto your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, partly to declare vnto you mine obedient thanckfulnes of minde, and partlye that both honourable and all
<pb facs="3"/>
others in this lande, beholdinge your honours vertuous and Godlye lyfe, might not onelye imitate and followe the same, but also glorifie God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Iesus Christe. To whom I commende your honour, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely beseechinge him to encrease in you daily more and more al maner of vertue and godlines, to blesse and enriche you with all maner of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to graunt that for our good ensample and to the settinge forth of Gods honour and glorie, you maye liue longe many quiet and happy yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res amongest vs, and after this lyfe, to liue with Christ for euer. Amen,</p>
