                 <title>An excellent treatise touching the restoring againe of him that is fallen : written by the worthy, Saint Chrysostome to Theodorus a friend of his, who by leud liuing, was fallen from the Gospell; fit to read for reclaiming their hearts which are in like case. Englished (out of an auncient Latin translation, written in velume) by R.W. With an annexed epistle of comfort from one friend to another, wherin the Anabaptists error of desperation is briefly confuted, and the sinne against the holy Ghost plainly declared</title>

      <hi>To the Worshipfull and his special good friend, Master IOHN KEMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THORNE Esquier, R.W.</hi> wisheth in this life prosperous suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in all affaires, and in the life to come a crowne of glorie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing alwayes it hath bin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coūted a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous worke, either to commend in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> wisedome, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll in <hi>Hercules</hi> puissance, or to prayse in <hi>Minerua</hi> knowledge: it may bee
<pb facs="3"/> thought no lesse needlesse for mee, to prayse in fined wordes and garnished stile (if so I were able to doe) your ardent zeale in Gods truth, and maruellous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towardes the true professors thereof. And because among those that know you, it shineth so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riently, as in words to set it foorth, were rather to imbeazle than illustrate it; and among those that know you not, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it abundantly, may feare the censure of smoothing, I thinke it better, at this time (as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lust</hi> saith of Carthage) to speake nothing at all of it than a little. Yet surely (though the enuious hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
<pb facs="3"/> mislike it) this I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, when I bethought to finde a meete protector for this pamphlet, that might loue it, as Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us the Emperor was wont to loue books, as <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> was accustomed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme the workes of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> that might reade it diligently as <hi>Erasmus</hi> did <hi>Terence,</hi> as Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> did <hi>Horace,</hi> as Ladie <hi>Iane Graie</hi> did <hi>Platoes Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> none came to my minde before your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, vnder the wings of whose tuition, these my slender labors might safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be shadowed, from all the malice of spitefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouers and taunting
<pb facs="4"/> carpers. Now concerning the worke, some I knowe will finde fault with my presumption, that being a tender suckling and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in good letters, I would dare to put foorth ought in print, especially in such a plentifull time of bookes. Let these take this aunswere; that I did it not voluntarily but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, and that by the request, not of one or two, but of many, whose good will I haue often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, whose friendship in the Lorde I will not (for a small cause) violate, whose authoritie I may not despise. For lighting by chaunce on this treatise
<pb facs="4"/> of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it at the first sight more for antiquitie than ought else, assoone as I had read it ouer, I did it faithfully for my priuate vtilitie into English, neuer thinking it should come to this passe. But hauing lent it vnto some of my friends, desirous of such a peece of matter, they fell suddenly into that liking and louing of it, that they neuer ceased exhorting, begging, compelling (I may say) vntill (maugre my head) I graunted, it should goe foorth for the benefit of many. Which now beeing newly borne and come into the world,
<pb facs="5"/> I beseech your courtesie to receiue into your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage: and as it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from a willing minde, so to take it with a glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some countenance. And notwithstanding this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of a gratefull minde, doe not any way counterpoise the weight of your demerits, yet I beseech you to accept of the poore widowes mites. and of the cheerefull gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers minde. Thus surcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing any longer to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt your Worships seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affaires, I suppliantly craue of the Almightie, dayly to augment his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in you and the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gentlewoman your
<pb facs="5"/> wife, that after your race run in this dale of miserie, you may for euer enioy the sight of Christ Iesus in heauen.</p>
