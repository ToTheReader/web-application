<pb facs="5"/> sinne the mother of all calamityes hath by the fall of our first parēts so venemously infected vs all their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable posteritye and progenye, and so blinded vs: that what God is, and what his will is concerning true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, righteousnes, and eternall lyfe, wee of our selues are vtterly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. Therefore hath he merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully geuen vs his heauenly worde, a rule whereby wee may learne to acknowledge, celebrate, inuocate, and worship him according to the saying of the kingly Prophet: Thy <note place="margin">Psal. 118.</note> worde is a lanterne vnto my feete. Of the vertue of this heauēly word, according to the abilitye which God hath gratiously geuen me, I hauing not long sithēce publiquely spoken, &amp; being earnestly requested of certayne vertuously disposed, to cōmunicate my labours to them &amp; others: haue thought it meete to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their reasonable request: which
<pb facs="5"/> labour I consecrate to your good Lordship, and offer the same to your learned iudgement, as a scholler to his Maister as a souldiar to his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne. Wherein my endeuour is to seeke the glory of God: to encourage the faythfull: and to bring into the kinges high way of their saluation, such as goe astray, and daungerously wander in the marishes of idolatrye and superstition. Yet I protest to your Lordship, that considering the infelicitye and malignity of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent tyme, and the vanitye of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I was almost discouraged to speake or to write. And if I could doe it without offence to God, I would enioyne mee selfe, (not with Pythagoras schollars, to fiue yeares silence, but) to seuen yeares silence. <note place="margin">1.

      <hi>nobis placentia:</hi> Speake to vs such thinges as may lyke vs. And truely there are now a dayes I feare me too many such scholars: too many it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching eares: too many newfangled persons, and to many wranglers. But I am cōforted whan I consider that the veritye ouercommeth fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shod, and that the thinges which are of God, doe daunt whatsoeuer is obiected of men, and of Sathan himselfe▪ what hurteth the enemye, yf God protect? what preuaileth enuy, yf the highest preserue? They may mutter and murmure, brawle, and cauill: but they cannot hurt. Truth will get the vpper hād: Christ will haue the field. I would to God euery man would seeke the truth in the worde of God. S. August. sayth: <note place="margin">

      <hi>Vbi inueni veritatem: ibi inueni Deum meum ipsam veritatem:</hi> Where I foūd
<pb facs="6"/> the truth: there I found my God, who is the truth it selfe. I would to God men would embrace the truth and now at length stick no longer in their mire, but cease to defend the denne of Antichrist, the house of their spirituall whoredome, &amp; shops of falshode, fraughted with sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, dreames, pride, vaineglory, and all other abhominable abuses. It is great pitie that learning should be so ill bestowed. For how much might they be able to doe to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncemēt of the truth, which shew so great cunning and skill in defence of falshod? Erasmus a man of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and exquisite learning, writte much of the prayse of follie: what could he haue written in the prayse of wit? Cornelius Agrippa writte much of the vanitye of sciēces: what could he haue written in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of sciences? how could he haue praysed helth, that praysed
<pb facs="7"/> the feuer quartane? how could he haue praysed bewtifull heare, that praysed deformed baldnes? how many aduenture witte in desperate causes? It is a desperate cause that can not be smoothed with words of eloquēce. No follie so vaine, but by some shift it may be maintayned. By meanes wherof, the blinde drinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth many a flye, and the simple eye is sone beguiled. Yet notwithstāding their Transubstantiation, their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorye, their Merites, their Inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saintes, their Supremacy, and such other Romish platyre can not be iustly defended by scripture or Doctours. Therfore it were good for those kinde of teachers to cease to abuse the simplicitye of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to professe the trueth. S. Ambrose sayth: <hi>Nullus pudor est ad</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ambros. in Epist. ad Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosium. Tom. 1.</note>
      <hi>melior a transire:</hi> It is no shame to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue to the better. Augustine was an infant in Christes religion the
<pb facs="7"/> three and thirtye yeare of his age. S. <note place="margin">in Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donio.</note> Paule began ill: and yet he ended well. Of a cruell persecutour, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a mighty defender of Christes religion: Of a scatterer he became a gatherer: Of a wolfe, a lambe: Of an Antichristian enemy, a Christian souldiar: Of a learnd lawier at Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, a learner of the Gospell at Damascus: and of a Saul, a Paul.</p>
   <p>God of his mercy graunt that all they which haue traced the path of Antichrist, may renoūce their foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe dreames, and fonde assertions, and (after the example of S. Paule) professe Christ: detest Antichrist: &amp; goe forward in all godlynes, euen vnto their liues end. Dauid may fall, and Saule may rise. Wee ought to hope the best of all men, to iudge the best, and to thinke the best: For charity thinketh no euill. S. August. sayth wel: <hi>Bononorum desyderū est vt</hi>

      <hi>est vt qui boni sunt consumantur:</hi> Good men would faine haue ill men amended: and ill men would faine haue good men consumed. There are too many such in this doting age of the world, which hate all mē extremely that please not their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: yet they make great shew of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes. But if their visardes were pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of, (Good Lord,) what a masse of malice should a man see? what enuy, what falshode, what spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, &amp; rancour should a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold? Turkes and Iewes are better to be lyked, than such hipocriticall Christians. Charitye ouer commeth all thinges: without charity nothing preuaileth: and wheresoeuer chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye is, shee draweth all thinges vnto her: and shee is the bewtye of the soule. I surcease humbly and harte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beseeching Christ the Prince of Pastours to perserue your honour by the vertue of his holy Spirite many
<pb facs="8"/> yeares, to the aduauncement of his glory: to the repayring of the ruines of Sion: To the vtter ruin of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylō: and finally after your pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrination vpon earth, to geue you the laborers peny of euerlasting blessednes.</p>
