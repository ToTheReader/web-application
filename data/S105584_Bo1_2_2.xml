      <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Romise is debt, (gentle Reader) I haue therefore performed what in my first Part I promised; which was, to shew thee the vnfortunate death of the <hi>Red rose Knight,</hi> his beloued Lady <hi>Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litoras</hi> disloyal affections towards him, his Childrens Honours, Renownes, and Dignities: and in the period of this small Historie, his death both iustly, truely, and strangely reuenged: The reading of which (if with good consideration) I doubt not but shall bring vnto thee much pleasure and delight, being (for the quantitie thereof) nothing inferiour to the best that hath beene written of the like Subiect (I meane) of Knights aduentures, and Ladyes beloued. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dedicate this to thy reason, knowing that this old Prouerbe may confirme my expectation, which is; That good Wine needs no Bush: nor a pleasing Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie craues no shelter.
