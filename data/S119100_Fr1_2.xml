   <p>Right Worshipfull▪</p>

      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT my <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was devoted to your <hi>Worships,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
<pb facs="4"/>
by this Presentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath rightly dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted my Presentation, will easily bee seene; for where could these faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Witnesses</hi> that are dead, have had fairer hopes of <hi>Tuition,</hi> than by you who are living <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> of the same <hi>Truth</hi> most of them have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly suffered for: some of them were <hi>Exoticke,</hi> some <hi>Natives,</hi> all of the
<pb facs="4"/>
same <hi>Faith:</hi> GODS Word commends the protection of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; Grace</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> both pleade for the other: Some of them that were <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> had faire protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and good provision in this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and were publickly grac'd &amp; allowed in the famous <hi>Schooles</hi> of our <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities;</hi> and some of ours, upon the change of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
found presently a <hi>Reciprocall</hi> requitall in their chiefest <hi>Hans towns:</hi> Both one and the other were worthy <hi>Agents</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of GOD; and their <hi>Workes</hi> (the never dying Monuments of their Fame) will praise them in the <hi>Gates;</hi> they were so eminent <hi>Lights,</hi> that my <hi>Encomium</hi> will rather séeme to <hi>lessen</hi> than <hi>augment</hi> their lustre; however, I have striven
<pb facs="5"/>
(as much as I could) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive their <hi>Memories</hi> from the grave of <hi>Oblivion.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And (Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful) if you but receive as much comfort by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> of their <hi>Workes,</hi> as I have done by the <hi>Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> I am fully perswaded, your Worships will rest satisfied, and I shall not be taxt for presumption: Disdaine not therefore, I pray you, to <hi>Patronize</hi> those, whom I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb facs="6"/>
ere this, GOD, <hi>the Father of the Faithfull,</hi> hath <hi>registred</hi> for his own <hi>Sonnes in the Booke of Life.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I neede not blazon your <hi>Worthy</hi> and <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions</hi> to the World, when as both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> adorned, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beautisied by them, doth, and will, for ever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternize your <hi>Pietie</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> to succeeding po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity. I onely wish the
<pb facs="6"/>
rich men of this age, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to imitate your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or be ashamed that they follow not such E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent examples: Goe on still I exhort you, and in due time you shall reape the recompence of reward.</p>
   <p>Your Worships that so much love GODS Temple, I hope, will vouchsafe to receive and entertaine these famous men, who have been the
<pb facs="7"/>
Lords Embassadors in his <hi>Church</hi> here, and are in the Celestial <hi>Temple</hi> with him in <hi>Glory:</hi> So wishing all your Worships the like happinesse with his <hi>Saints,</hi> when you shal be dissolved: and praying for your prosperity on earth, with length of dayes; I referre my selfe, and all my endeavours to Him and your worthy selves, being,</p>
   <p>Your Worships in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Offices,</p>
