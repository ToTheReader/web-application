   <head>The Author to his Booke.</head>
   <l>GO painefull Booke, go plead thy owne Defence,</l>
   <l>Walke with undanted Courage stop the breath</l>
   <l>Of carping tongues; who count it small offence</l>
   <l>To bulge <hi>Thee</hi> up within the jawes of Death:</l>
   <l>Go lively charg'd, with stout historian Faith,</l>
   <l>And trample downe, base <hi>Critticks</hi> in the Dust:</l>
   <l>Make <hi>Truth</hi> thy sword to batter downe their wrath</l>
   <l>So shall thy Grave discourse, triumph as just:</l>
   <l>Who yeeld thee credite, and deserving trust,</l>
   <l>There prostrate fall, give them their hearts content:</l>
   <l>Point forth the Wise, and Court them as thou must,</l>
   <l>Give them in sight as I give argument:</l>
   <l>Instruct the curious, inlarge the Servile mind,</l>
   <l>Illuminate, mis-understandings blinde:</l>
   <l>Sound knowledg in their eares; deigne to approove me,</l>
   <l>Since Friends and Foes, the World and I, must love thee.</l>
