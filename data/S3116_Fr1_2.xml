      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen it pleased the Lord in a mercifull and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle correction, to lay his fatherly rod of sicknesse and mortalitie, in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne last, vpon this Citie of London, the schooles there both publike and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, soone after (as it vvas requisite) began to breake-vp. VVhereupon the Teachers vvere generally at more ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to follovv that course of practise, after the diuerse studies of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall professions, vvhich euery one affected. Among vvhom my selfe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed likevvise to publish somevvhat of my priuate readings (as leysure gaue

VVherein this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course I entred the rather for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe and benefite of my Scholers, to vvhom (as their young yeares vvere able, and capacities apt to conceiue) I haue vsed to interpret a portion of the nevve Testament by the space of an houre euery Saboth in the morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Common prayer: vvherby I might the better both traine them to * remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">Eccles. 12, 1.</note> novv their Creator in the dayes of their youth, and instill into their tender minds the vvonderfull consonancie &amp; concord of many notable sentēces vvith the vvord of God, vvhich novve and then met thē in their vveekly lectures of <note n="*" place="margin">The study of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie is a dead, darke, and erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labor without the knowledge of Diuinitie, wherby it is quickned, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, &amp; recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth easie, pleasant, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</note> humanitie: and vvithall bring thē in disliking of other discord and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable speeches, vvhich commonly in some Poets are vvithout all modesty. But besides these, the learned vvell knovv vvhat excellent sayings, most consonant and conspiring vvith the
<pb facs="4"/> vvord of God, are scattered in heathen authors Greeke and Latine, vvhich it vvere a great fault in the maister ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lightly to ouerpasse vvith silence, as vnprofitable, or to leaue his scholers ignorant of those maruellous lights of Nature, vvhich the Lord had left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen (to the intent that they should be vvithout <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1, 4.</note> excuse) euen testimonies of his vvill, according to his vvritten vvord, vttered by their ovvne mouthes, hovvsoeuer yet the same vvere quickly quenched, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly turned to mere <note n="*" place="margin">Ro. 1, 21.

For, by the very sight of the visible heauens ouer their heads (declaring the glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the maker, Psal. 19, 1.) they might euidently see, and certainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1, 20.</note> deitie and Godhead: &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise his <note n="*" place="margin">1.

Albeit (I say) they might clearely see that this God, that created heauen and earth, the sea, and all things, that in them are, <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 14, 15. &amp;c.</note> left not him selfe vvithout vvitnesse amōg
<pb facs="5"/> them, in that he did them good, <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 5, 45▪</note> made his sunne to arise vpon them, and gaue them raine from heauen, and frutefull seasons, filling their hearts vvith food and gladnesse, <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 17, 25. &amp;c.</note> giuing to all life and breath, and all things: for in him vve liue, and moue, and haue our being, as also certaine of their ovvne Poets haue sayd: yet vvere they so far from Dauids thoughts, vpon the vievv of these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens (vvho in holy meditation confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thus vnto God: <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 8, 3. &amp;c.</note> VVhen I behold thy heauens, euen the vvorks of thy fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the Moone and the stars, vvhich thou hast ordeined, vvhat is man (think I) that thou art mindfull of him? &amp; the son of man that thou visitest him? &amp;c.) that contraryvvise they <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 32, 9.</note> (like the horse and mule, vvhich vnderstand not) <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1, 25.</note> turned the truth of God vnto a lye, and vvorshipped the creature, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking the Creator, vvhich is blessed for euer.

<pb facs="6"/> them selues to be vvise, they became starke fooles, as the Apostle also vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth. These heathen, vve haue, in this our Discourse, declared vvho they vvere, vvhat time they vvere seuered, hovv long they continued separate from Gods people, and by vvhom, and hovve they vvere called, and recōciled to their brethren againe. Of them therfore here vvill I vvrite no more but this: vvhen in the yeare of the vvorld 3577, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander the great had subdued the Medes and Persians, &amp; many other nations, as vve haue briefly touched in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, the Greeke tongue, vvhich though 600 years before that time, it vvas ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry famous and florishing, as may speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally appeare by Homers vvorks (for all) the honor both of learning and Nature: yet then chiefly began to be generally studied in all the vvorld, insomuch that euery nation, as they vvere subiect to the Grecians, so they coueted chiefly to
<pb facs="6"/> come in fauour by speaking their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. But after that the Romanes had brought vnder the Grecians, &amp; vvere also conquerors of the vvorld, the Latin tongue likevvise grevv to be cōmon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all nations, vvhich held on til the coming of Christ. VVherfore Pilat (the Lord guiding his vvauering mind and pen, both for the matter &amp; maner) was not content to vvrite Christs Title in<note place="margin">Luke 23. 38.</note> Hebrue the Ievves tongue only, but in Greeke and Latine the tongues of the heathen also, that so it might appeare (though Pilate thought of no such my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie) that asvvel the Gentiles &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, as the nation of the Ievves, vvere to take notice, &amp; reap benefit of Christs death and passion. Novv the Theme or purport of my vvriting, I desired such, as might be both most necessarie for all sortes, and least handled of any in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. VVhich thing in this kinde of studie, &amp; in these our days (vvherin
<pb facs="7"/> mouing and vvorking in vs) conceiue comfortable hope to our vnspeakeable ioy in the Lord, and thervvithall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to glorifie God, the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, vvho hath called vs out of ignorance, sinne and error, into his maruellous light: and translated vs into the kingdome of his deare Sonne. To vvhich kingdome the Lord Iesus, vvho alone hath redeemed vs, conduct and bring vs, by a true and liuely faith in the merites of his death and passion, to vvhom, vvith God the Father, and the holy Spirit, be giuen all honour, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, povver and glorie for euer. From my house in Turnmill streete the 4 of Nouēber, in the yeare of the ioyfull incarnatiō of Christ our redeemer 1592 and the yeare of the vvorld 5502.</p>
