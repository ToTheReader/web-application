And as it can neither stand with my Profession &amp; your Ladiships sinceritie, nor yet the superlatiue dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of such a glorious subject to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the same with the intising wordes of humane wisedome: knowing your Ladiship to be as farre from all delight in assentation and flattering, as yee are from the affectation of salfe and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued praise; I haue contented my selfe in the simplicitie of the Lordes trueth, to commende vnto your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship, and all the rest of Gods Sainctes, the constant and carefull practise of the Fayth and knowledge which may bee reaped by the reading and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Doctrine, with Prayer and thankesgiuing to the Lord, for the happie successe of the same: not that I would wish your Ladiship by this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the matter to seuerall dayes, to bee so superstitiouslie tied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same, as if the whole particulars of the Creation should not bee at all times before your Eyes, as a faire Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb facs="4"/>whereof yee should beholde the beautie, and smell the fragrant Odours together: But heerewithall (if it may please the Lordes gracious Majestie) yee may resent the goodnesse, power and wisedome of God in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euerie creature vpon its owne day when it was made.</p>
   <p>So wishing the successe of these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises to bee according to mine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and intention, for the Christian profit and progresse in the faith of the trueth, which is according to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, I beseech God to blesse your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diship, with my Lord your Husband, and your hopefull Sonne Lorde CHARLS, with all Prosperitie in this Life, and euerlasting happinesse in the Life to come, I rest.</p>
