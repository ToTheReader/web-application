      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> WOƲLD NOT HAƲE TA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon me (most gratious and my redoubted soueraigne Lady) to haue brought into englishe this briefe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of your graces greatest aduersarie, though often I haue thervnto beene earnestly required, but only of purpose to dedicate it to your maiestie: Neither yet woulde I so haue presumed to haue done, but that I haue here before seene your graces most gratious accepting of smaller matters. The Author so eloquentlye in Latin hath exprest his minde, and so plainely and truely hath described the fayned sanctitie of the Romishe religion that nowe so much is boasted of, as J cannot but iudge him a present meete for a Queene. The translatiō (though rude) so dealeth with truth, as being ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly hated of the enimies of truth, it requireth of necessitie the patronage of so noble a princesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before in Latin safely defended by the no lesse

Most humbly I therfore besech your maiestie to vouchsafe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof against the wrongefull slaunders of malitious tongues, and to pardon, according to your accustomed clemencie, my bolde attempt in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to your highnesse so rude a translation: wherein I haue the lesse beene curious, bycause it was chiefely made for the benifite of the common, and simpler sorte. J haue also herevnto ioyned some parte of another booke written by the same Author, and entituled, The spirituall husbandrie (which I long before translated) bicause the other being printed, seemed something to small in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume.
