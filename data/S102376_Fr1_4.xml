                 <title>Doctor Fludds answer vnto M· Foster or, The squeesing of Parson Fosters sponge, ordained by him for the wiping away of the weapon-salue : VVherein the sponge-bearers immodest carriage and behauiour towards his bretheren is detected; the bitter flames of his slanderous reports, are by the sharpe vineger of truth corrected and quite extinguished: and lastly, the vertuous validity of his sponge, in wiping away of the weapon-salue, is crushed out and cleane abolished</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Did not thinke (Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and learned Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to haue stirred vp the puddle of this mine Aduersaries tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent Spirit, for a 3. fold reason, whereof the first is his insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie to vndergoe a taske of so high a nature and so farre beyond his reach or capacity, namely; to diue into this profound My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of curing by the weapon-salue: and then because my learned friends, obseruing his inclination vnto immorality and malice (as appearing indeed more skilfull to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and calumniat, then to decide with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity so weighty a controuersy) gaue mee counsell to haue patience and to answer such a manner of man with Silence: and lastly, by reason of that reverence which I beare vnto his vocation, namely; as he is a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb facs="4"/>
of Gods word, professing vnto the world that I would endure much rather then to haue the least opposition with any of that profession. But since I haue perceiued his indiscreete importunity to extend it selfe so farre as to vrge me beyond the bounds of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience by setting vp in the night time two of the frontispices or Titles of his booke, as a Challenge, one each post of my doore, and vnderstanding of his many other vndecent actions, as well by heare say, as in his publick writing, wherein hee hath in a Scornefull and opprobrious manner laied disgracefull matters vnto my charge: I haue beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, against my will, to take the person (set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ing with my best respect aside the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and his habit) into my better conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to examine in this my small Pamphlet the misdemeanours of his Booke entituled; <hi>The Sponge to wipe away the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon-Salue</hi> expressed both in his errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine touching the maine subiect of that manner of curing, as also his rude and vnseemely carriage towards his bretheren, that thereby I may as well cleare my selfe from such immodest and vniust imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which with an euill Conscience he hath
<pb facs="4"/>
laied vpon me, as also expresfe the Shallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the person in this busines, which hee so vaine gloriously hath vndertaken.</p>
   <p>I doubt not but as there are many who in euery degree can discerne an euident differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between this satyrical gentleman &amp; my selfe, so because I know that there are diuers of the common sort of people, who in their zeale without vnderstanding are apter to conceiue and iudge amisse, then in their charity to ponder the truth of the businesse; I am the willinger to cope with this vnsauory Philosopher, whom I finde (and I make no doubt, shall proue) fuller of windy verbosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then of solide Philosophy, or any thing else that is grounded vpon firme reason.</p>
   <p>What shall I say vnto the man, whom, vnto my best remembrance, I neuer saw nor knew, saue onely by a bragging smoake of rumour, which pronounced me a farre off an Anathema? The thunder which long smoothered in the gloomy Cloud of report, is now broke forth the flame of his light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning affaileth mee: What then is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient and requisite then sharpe vineger to quench it? yea, he shall find it so acute &amp; peir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing (though not with rayling and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niating
<pb facs="5"/>
edge, according vnto his bitter cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, but reseruing it selfe within the bounds of Christian modesty) that his Sponge shall not bee able to drinke it vp or wipe it away. It shall quell the vnsatiable appetite of his Salue-deuouring Sponge, and squeeze or crush it so, that it shall be constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to vomit vp againe that wholesome Child of nature and gentle friend vnto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (I meane the weapon-salue) which it hath drunk or sucked vp, and leaue it in it's wonted Splendor and reputation amongst men. And lastly, it shall examine the quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essence of the Sponge-bearers selfe-conceited wit, and tell him, that what somtimes appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth great, is not alwaies the same it seemeth, but rather a shaddow or blast of empty ayre. This is all (iudicious Reader) that I wil say at this time, as for the rest, I refer it to the proofe in the pondering wherof I most heartily pray you that all partiality or peculiar affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laied aside, you will be pleased faithfully to iudge of this our cont ouersie, and weigh euery passage thereof in the iust and equall ballance of your best discretion.</p>
