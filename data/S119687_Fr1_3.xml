   <p>My desire to see, tooke away my sight, as it
fares with those who are suddenly taken with a
killing beautie, or gaze vpon the Sun. Yet some
glimmerings I haue obserued, like an ill-sighted
man, who sees with Spectacles or Perspectiues,
the rather, that your Lordships protection may
haue the same operation on me, the Sunne hath

care not what roome I fill vp, nor what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
I stand in, so my Company be good and
the action Noble.</p>
   <p>This casts me still vpon your Honours good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
as the Patrone of Vertue, and my safeguard
both from the Ignorance of those who can
find fault at home, and the malice of such as
carpe at any rate, and condemne before the
Book be printed, it may be before 'tis ended: who
antidate their exceptions, and like Merchants
with their goods, enter them, before they ship
them: Such imprest money I doe not like, but

should I feare hast or Detraction, when your

To beleeue my selfe safe, is to be so: since O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
strikes a great stroake in the iudgements

any subiect to find more safety or calmnesse for
this poore Barque, which (I assure your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship)
