And as it is the duety of euery man to seeke by all meanes possibe to bring so waightie a matter to passe, so for mine owne parte, although as vnable as the least, yet as willing as the best, haue done what I might, though not as I would, that vertue might be aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and vice ouerthrowne, and do wishe it
<pb facs="9"/>to be read for the end it was written, which was to set foorth the glory of God, that our wickednes may be done away, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life embraced: but if there be any that would seeke for painted speech or rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Rhethorike, which is not here to bee found: when they haue opened the booke I woulde wishe them to goe no further, for if they seeke till they haue reade the whole, they shall find in the ende, that they haue but lost their labour: but if they wold know the truth, here they shall finde no lyes, but many thinges that are too true and I wish it to be a booke in euery mans hand, that al estates might learne somewhat, and that the sounde of it might ring in the cares of all Popishe Priestes, couetous Ministers, and vnlearned Pastors, that when they sée as in a glasse their sinnes laid before them, their duetie shewed them, and in the ende, and example of repentance: they may learne of the best, and forsake the worst, that God in them may be glorified, and them selues in Christ sanctified.</p>
