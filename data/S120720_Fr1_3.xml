   <head>TO THE PVRITAN.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is your practise, to run from the Church. Iam sorry, that so learned, and so holy men, as you would seeme to be, doe want true Christian patience, to heare orthodox holy doctrine. But let me intreat you, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand me this one time. I hope it will be for your edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying. This is my prayer vnto Almighty God through Iesus Christ. My businesse with you is the <hi>Puritan:</hi> whose name distinguish'd, whose essence rē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'red in the very property, and whose severall kinds essentially differing, I giue into your owne hands, that you may see, and learne true Reformation.</p>
   <p>Concerning the name <hi>(Puritan)</hi> it is ambiguous, and so it is fallacious. For some good men are called <hi>Puritans:</hi> and they are <hi>Puritans</hi> indeed. They are pure in heart, and so blessed, that they shall see God. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. And some evill men are called <hi>Puritans,</hi> who desire to seeme to be iust, and holy; but in their doctrine, and discipline, they are the vnderminers of our True, Protestant, Reformed Church. Are you
<pb facs="4"/> angry, because I tell you the truth. <hi>Be angry but sin not,</hi> and I will tell you, the essentiall definition of this fallacious <hi>Puritan.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>A <hi>Puritan</hi> is a Protestant Non-Conformist. A Protestant, this is his Genus, his kinde of being. A Non-Conformist: this is his differentia, his essentiall difference, his essentiall Qualitie. A <hi>Puritan</hi> is a kind of Protestant. For he wilbe tryed by the Scriptures concerning his faith, and his Christian morall life, so farre as his Spirit will endure the text. But the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures deduceable sence in Essentials, Essentiates, Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, Finals, Subiects, Effects, and their Modalities, being opposite to their tenets, confounds this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, and overthrowes his Chaire: but he asham'd to forsake his seducing profession a long time vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently clamarous, taketh fast hold only on the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and chapter of the text. So then this <hi>Puritan</hi> is a sullen fallacie of the Reformed Church: being confuted, he will not learne to turne: still he is pure, not really, but in his owne suppose. The Lord graunt him grace to reforme.</p>
   <p>This <hi>Puritan</hi> is a Non-Conformist. For he is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positely set, a Contradictist to the Scriptures deduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sence in three things. The first is the 39 Articles of our Churches Reformed faith. The second is our Common Praier-booke. The third is the Canons of our Church. And yet the doctrine of the Articles, the faith of the common prayers, and the lawfulnesse of the Canons, are contained in the deduce-able sence of holy Scriptures. The Articles of our Reformed
<pb facs="4"/> Churches saith, which he opposeth, are these: the 3. 6. 9. 16. 17. 20. 21. 23. 26. 27. 33. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39. This is proved in the severall kindes of this irregular scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turist. The praiers in the common prayer-booke, which he contradicts (being collected, and translated out of the Masse-booke, yet corrected, and purged from grosse errors) those selected prayers he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth every one, because they were thence collected. The Absolution he disliketh, because he makes a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, whether the congregation did faithfully, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently confesse their sinnes. The Lords prayer hee will not say, because hee will make a praier like to the Lords praier. <hi>Nunc dimittis, &amp;c:</hi> hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, because he will not any praier, or hymne, but such as hee thinkes fit according to his owne will. The Letanie he saith is composed of coniuring, and swearing, and of vnnecessarie and vnlawfull In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations. The collect on Trinitie Sunday, he saith is composed of an Impossibilitie. And that the last collect but one read at holy Communion is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of vntruths. He is ill-disposed., oppositely affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted against prayers at Christnings, Confirmations, and Burialls.</p>
   <p>I make answere thus. To pronounce, He pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and absolveth all them, which truely repent, and vnfainedly belieue; is the actuall duetie of Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Priests, and so good a duetie is no sinne. Ministers (must) say the Lords prayer. The Lord hath said it. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 2. And they must make their praiers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the forme of the Lords prayer. It is the text,
<pb facs="5"/> they must vse no vaine babling: their forme of praier must be effectuall, not vaine; briefe, not stuffed with tautologies, and iterations. Read <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. 8. 9. God did regard vs with a Saviour, in that he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Blessed Virgin with a Sonne, and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, therefore we say the Magnificat. Wee shalbe saved by the same faith, as old Simeon was, therefore we say <hi>Nunc dimittis.</hi> In the Letanie we pray to bee delivered from sinne, and punishment. And how must Christians pray for to bee delivered, but by Christs agonie, and bloody sweat, &amp;c? And is this swearing, or coniuring? Is praying in the Winter, to be delivered from thunder, and lightning, vnneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie? Lightning, and thunder are Gods secret iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: he may afflict sinners with them in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: though naturally summer bee the time for those terrifying Meteors: but because they are Gods secret iudgements, therefore we pray alwaies for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Is praying for theeues, and whores vnlawfull, the one being included in all men, travayling by land, or by water; the other being included in all women labouring with child? Our Saviour saith, that his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father <hi>is mercifull to the iust, and vniust,</hi> and that all Gods people must be so mercifull <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 48. &amp;c: And S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>doe good vnto all. Gal.</hi> 6. 10: and therefore we must pray for all. On Trinity Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day we pray to be delivered from all adversity; and it is thus in the Lords praier: <hi>Deliuer vs from all evill:</hi> And shall we not pray, as the Lord hath taught vs? In the last Collect but one at the holy Communion,
<pb facs="5"/> wee Confesse our vnworthines, and blindnes: And wheresoever sinne is inherent, and a fighter, there must be <hi>necessitate causae,</hi> (sin being an actuall cause,) an vnworthynesse of Gods favour, and blind igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; not in the necessary precepts of saith, but in Contingents, with what particular blessing, when, where, and how God will blesse sinners. Prayers at Baptisme doe regenerate: though you denie this. Tis the text: <hi>Aske, and you shall haue.</hi> To pray is to <hi>Aske.</hi> To be Regenerate is to <hi>haue.</hi> The blessed Apostles did confirme the Churches, which they before had converted. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 22. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 32. <hi>For confirmation is a Principle of the doctrine of Christ</hi> next to baptisme. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. 2. Therefore S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did pray &amp; impose hands to confirme the Church with the holy Ghost. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 17. And little Children being more weake in the state of Grace, then such Converts, must necessarily be confirmed by the Bishop, the Apostle of the Diocesse; though not by miraculous, <hi>yet by seaven, of the holy Ghosts gifts.</hi> We must pray for the dead. <hi>Thy kingdome come.</hi> Oh Lord raise the dead prisoners in the graue. And herein we pray for their soules, and bodies. God be with them, to comfort their soules deprived of their bodies; I say to comfort them with hast'ning the Re-vnion, and the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ioy of soule and body. Thus the Primitiue Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: <hi>Iunius, B. Bilson, Mornay, Chameirus.</hi> This is not to defend Purgatory, but the receaued answere against Purgatory.</p>
   <p>These things being thus answered; obserue that
<pb facs="6"/> this <hi>Puritan</hi> would obstinately cast out of the Church, <hi>Gods sauing mercy, saving hope, saving cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the seauen guifts of the holy Ghost.</hi> And what then is his religion, but faction? <hi>But marke those, that cause diuision in the Church, contrary to the doctrine, which you haue receiued. For they, that are such, serue not the Lord Iesus, but their owne bellies; and with faire speech, and flattering, deceiue the hearts of the simple. Rom.</hi> 16. 17. 18.</p>
   <p>The third thing, in which this <hi>Puritan</hi> is Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformist, is the Canons of our reformed Church. These, 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 24. 29. 30. 31. 48. 49. 54. 55. 56. 57. 58. 60. 61. 73. 127. &amp;c. But who is this <hi>Puritan?</hi> What is his name? M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Rogers</hi> in his Preface to the 39 Articles, saith, that since the suppression of <hi>Puritans</hi> by Arch-Bishops, <hi>Parker Grindall;</hi> and <hi>Whitegift,</hi> none will seeme to be such irregular Professors. But the eie that beholds their da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring oppositions in the Church, may very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that such Rebellions are taught in their <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</hi> What Rebellions? Their teaching against the Kings Supremacie, a reiecting of our Reformed saith, a refusing of Gods holy worship written, which is the Common Praier-booke; a despising of Canonicall obedience; a repugning against our Reformed Church. Yet this seditious Schysmatique would be the most true Reformist of Church, and Religion: but read the Suruey of the Pretended holy discipline and hence it is euidently proued, that he knowes not what he is, nor what he would be. Therefore for his
<pb facs="6"/> better edifying, let him learne to beleeue, to pray, and obey according to the vnderstanding Rules of this Reformed Church. For the 39 Articles are true pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of faith; all Collected out of holy writ. The Common praiers are godly praiers. The Canons are true, &amp; wholesome lawes. Therefore he, that will not beleeue, pray and obey according to this established estate of Church gouernment, <hi>is noe pure man in heart.</hi> He studies Consusion of Church, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. The specificall kinds of <hi>this Puritan</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise neither truth, nor goodnes: and therefore let noe man fauour their vnrighteous dealing; and let our Church stand fast in her faith, instruct, correct, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke: that this Non-conformist may be a true Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist.</p>
   <p>The species; specificall kinds of this <hi>Puritan</hi> are these. 1. <hi>the Perfectist.</hi> 2. <hi>the factious Sermonist.</hi> 3 <hi>the Separatist.</hi> 4. <hi>the Anabaptist.</hi> 5. <hi>the Brownist.</hi> 6. <hi>Loues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>familist.</hi> 7. <hi>the Precisian.</hi> 8. <hi>the Sabbatarian.</hi> 9: <hi>the Ante-disciplinarian.</hi> 10. <hi>the Presuming Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist.</hi> These ten kinds <hi>in their opinions</hi> are the best Christians: and every one differs <hi>in the Reciprocall Quatenus</hi> (i. e.) in his proper essentiall Quality from other, as much as white, and blacke: yet the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of inhesion (man) may be all these ten, as the same eie is white, and blacke: though whitenes, and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes differ essentially.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The <hi>Perfectist</hi> is he whose purenes is <hi>continuata perseverandi actio sanctificans;</hi> neuer to sinne after baptisme. This is the Nouatian Catharist. But
<pb facs="7"/> S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      <hi>Paul did sinne after baptisme. Rom.</hi> 7. This is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect keeper of Gods law. Thus he is a Papist. But S. <hi>Paul could not doe the good, which he would, but the evill which he would not.</hi> His opinion is, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian sinning after baptisme is damned. Our Reformed faith is; That by the grace of God, he may Repent, and amend: and thus S. <hi>Iohn; if we confesse our sinnes, he will forgiue.</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. This <hi>Puritan</hi> sinnes against the 16. Article.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The <hi>factious Sermonist,</hi> is he, whose purenes is, to serue God with sermons, and extemporary praiers made according to his supposititious inspiration. His opinion is vaine glory: Preachers Compos'de not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his hasty rule, he sayth are vn-worthy, and therefore they must not be heard to preach, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted to, at holy Communion. Then <hi>S. Peter,</hi> (if vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines might depose Preachers) should neuer haue preach'd <hi>after his forswearing his master.</hi> Our reformed faith is, that we may vse the ministery of <hi>vnworthy Ministers.</hi> And tis strange that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends himselfe to be worthy: whereas <hi>S. Paul</hi> is not a teacher of his opinion. 2. Cor. 2. 16. in these words. <hi>Who is sufficient for these things?</hi> This sinneth against the 26. Article. Another opiniō of his, is that <hi>preaching is better than Praier.</hi> But both being most necessarie: Preaching for to instruct the people; and praier to worship God, instrumentally to cause regeneration by baptisme &amp;c. It followes, that this <hi>Sermonist</hi> is a peeuish disturber of Religion. A third opinion of his, is, that <hi>priuate Praier</hi> made by a tardy commer to
<pb facs="7"/> Church is <hi>the sacrifice of fools.</hi> As if too late cōming to Church were not a sinne to be repented of: and that one soe ill prepar'd to ioyne with the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, should not pray for remission, and Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and then praise the Lord with the whole Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The <hi>Separatist</hi> is he, whose Purenes is Pharisaicall. He commends himselfe in the Temple to be farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all others for holines: Our Sauiour sayth that the <hi>Publican repenting was more iust than he. Luke</hi> 18. 14. His opinion is, <hi>that only he is the Elect, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and faithfull child of God.</hi> And that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are reprobates, the wicked, the vnregenerat, and the damned: <hi>But Gods iudgments are vnsearchable. Rom.</hi> 11. 33. <hi>And who art thou that iudgest? why dost thou Iudge &amp;c? Rom.</hi> 14. 4. 10. 11. 12. 13. The iudgment of our Church is, that al that are baptized are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat: Thus, <hi>Seeing that this child is regenerat &amp; graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the body of Christs congregation &amp;c.</hi> And the Church regulated by scriptures <hi>is the pillar and groūd of truth.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. therefore belieue our Church. Regeneration is by infusion of grace, by sowing the good seed: (it differs frō increase of grace, &amp; perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Regeneratiō is <hi>ortus boniseminis,</hi> the springing of good seed: <hi>This good seed did grow in stony and thorny ground.</hi> Regeneratiō is the individual act, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Christians. Increase of grace &amp; perseverāce pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue Christians. And morall perswasion cannot rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate stony and thorny hearts dead in sinne. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore regeneration being the individuall act of God
<pb facs="8"/> bound to his Church by his owne covenant, iudge as our Church doth, concerning the baptized; that all baptized are regenerate. The grace of Gods covenā<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> doth admit of noe <hi>Separatists:</hi> for it did not separate, but bind <hi>Isaac</hi> &amp; <hi>Ismael</hi> vnto God in obedience: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it separate, but vnite the baptized vnto Christ. As for the separating iudgement according to the mercifull decree of election who are the saved: this belongs only to God to pronounce. But let all Christians religiously pray and liue according to the grace of restitution, and humbly submit their iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, concerning the secrecy of personall election. The <hi>Separatist</hi> sinnes against the 17. Article, which sayth that <hi>Gods election is secret to vs, for we know not the elect by their particular names.</hi> He sinnes against the 35 article at the 2. 4. 5. 6. 7. 10. 11. 15. 19. 20. 21. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie. For these doe charitably exhort the whole cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to obey and honour God; whereas the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratist is noe freind of Publicans and sinners: but the vncharitable accuser of our Saviours pittied cōpany.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The <hi>Anabaptist</hi> is he, whose purenes is a supposed birth without originall sinne. And yet our bodies are parts of <hi>Adams</hi> nature, that did sinne. And no man was borne without sinne, <hi>Christ only excepted.</hi> His te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net is, that infants must not be baptized. <hi>Yet Isaac was circumcised the eighth day.</hi> And to be <hi>circumei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> and <hi>baptized</hi> are one, and the same in effect. And <hi>Abrahams</hi> Religion, and ours are the same. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 9. 14. 15. 16. 17. And therefore by a necessarie seale of the Covenant, we must doe, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did; <hi>binde little</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <hi>children in covenant to God.</hi> This <hi>Puritan</hi> sinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the 9 &amp; 27 Articles. The one affirmeth <hi>that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are borne in originall sin;</hi> the other, <hi>that infants must be baptized.</hi> If infants be borne without origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne: then tis noe controversy; That originall sin foreseene is not the meritorious cause of reprobation. The sinner deserues, &amp; the iudg intends punishment. So 'tis certaine, that sinne is not the foreseene inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding efficient of that preordain'd punishing decree. And it is without question, that Gods Supremacy may pardon or punish <hi>pro absoluto beneplacito,</hi> only as he will, seeing 'tis the prerogatiue of supremacy, he being supreame Iudg. But he <hi>cannot be iust in decree,</hi> if he so reprobates, but for sinne foreseene. For the law was not, that any should die in <hi>Adam,</hi> if <hi>he</hi> had not eaten of the forbidden fruit: <hi>and therfore this law in prevision transgressed is the meritorious efficient of reprobation.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The <hi>Brownist</hi> is he, whose purenes is to serue God in woods and feilds. He is a wildernes of purenesse. His opinion is, that Idolatry cannot be reformed without pulling downe of Churches. But King <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> commaunded <hi>the Levites to sanctifie the house of the Lord, and to carry forth the filthines out of the sanctuary &amp;c.</hi> 2. Chron. 29. 5. And our Saviour <hi>whipt the buyers and sellers out of the Temple:</hi> though it was prophan'd, yet without any pulling downe, he calls it <hi>the house of prayer.</hi> Mat. 21. 12. 13. This <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> sinnes against the 35 Article, at the 1 homily, which teacheth a decent keeping of the Church.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
      <hi>Loves familist</hi> is he, whose purenes is to serue

Tis true in an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing iudicious sence: Thus. Thou must praise God for the Creation, Redemption, Restitution, and preseruation of the world: To praise God for these
