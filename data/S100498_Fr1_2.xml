The chief things here handled, are. 1. Of Gods word and Scriptures, whither they be a sufficient rule of our faith. 2. Of the Scriptures expounded by the Church; and of unwritten traditions. 3. Of the Church of Rome, whither it be the true Catholike Church, and her sentence to be received, as the certayn truth</title>

   <head>E. P. to the Christian reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>CHristian reader, I having had some interest in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the passages here following, and with the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of both the writers, taken knowledge of the matter in controversie; was moved, and did resolve to publish it to the view of others. Considering, that the subiect and question han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, is very profitable, and the truth therein, necessary to be knowen. And whereas the controverters are so different in iudgment, and yet both of them for conscience sake suffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictiō, being separated frō the Ch: of Engl: the one, to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of a Romane Catholik; the other to a way, thereunto most opposite; and both of them being leaders &amp; men of note, in their so much different religions: it may move a desire to see the thing further prosecuted between them, and provoke a going forward where the stay is. I have without prejudice, but not (as I hope) without the good liking of both parties, (who ech of them seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto me very willing, that any should read their writings,) put forth these things: hoping that some benefit may come to the readers hereby: whom I wish all of them to follow the Apostles counsel, to try the spirits whether they be of God. His grace be</hi>

      <hi>with us all, to guide us in the truth, Amen.</hi>
