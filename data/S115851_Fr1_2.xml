   <head>TO CHRISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Parents, House<hi>-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Schoole-masters, and such as</hi> haue charge of youth: <hi>E. B.</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth the fruition and encrease of all-sauing Grace, and <hi>true blessednesse.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is one speciall dutie (my good brethren) which is required of Christians, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them: that they admonish and stirre vp one another, to matters which concerne Piety and godlinesse. Exhort one another (saith the Apostle, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 11.) and edifie one
<pb facs="3"/> another, euen as yee doe: and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. Let vs consider one another, to prouoke vnto loue, and to good workes. Let vs exhort one another, and that so much the more, because the day draweth neere.</p>
   <p>Through this am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> bold to impart an admonition to you, and this concerning a duety of most great and high impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance-to wit, of Catechizing.</p>
   <p>And I suppose there cannot bee a more needfull thing spoken of; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which admonition should be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giuen, then this: partly by reason of the great benefit and profit which commeth by it; and partly through the great contempt and neglect which is had of it; and partly for that a great number of these, by whom this duty is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, put it off from them as a busines impertinent, and with which they stand not chargeable. I meane this last of House and Schoole-gouernours.</p>
   <p>I shall therefore labour breefly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme you of three things: the first is, teaching the profit of it: secondly I shall endeuour to remoue the contempt of it: thirdly, I shall prooue that you (my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren aboue mentioned) doe in some
<pb facs="3"/> sort (though not so fully as certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) stand chargeable therein.</p>
   <p>Touching the first, my reasoning shall be onely by allegation of the seuerall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which flow from it: now Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing is of exceeding aduantage, as in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the preaching: it is not vnknown how great the number is of these who enioy the preaching of the worde, and are nothing, or very slenderly bettered by it; this is most certainely one mayne cause thereof, the want of Catechizing; in that persons come vnskilled thereto in the principles of religion: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is a special course to be taken of him that would be a good proficient by preaching, that he be seen in the grounds before mentioned.</p>
   <p>Secondly, concerning the Sacrament of Baptisme, wherein wee enter into so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Couenant with Gods maiestie, how commeth it to passe that so many thousands who haue thus solemnely bound themselues, yet are so farre from keeping it, that they scarcelie thinke of such a matter? Proceedeth not this of neglect of Catechizing? And therefore as any one tendreth to receiue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb facs="4"/> of his baptisme, it standeth him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to submit himselfe to this kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, concerning the Sacrament of the holy Supper, is not this generally to be held of all Christians, that the same appertaineth not to all commers, but onely to prepared guests? therefore the holy Ghost plainely affirmeth of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort, that they eate and drinke their owne iudgement: now can it bee denied that this is one special good helpe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, to bee well lessoned in all the ground points of the christian doctrine?</p>
   <p>Fourthly, what a speciall matter is it to bee frequent in the reading of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, concerning which, the commandement of our heauenly master, is expresse for all, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. <hi>Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for in them ye thinke to haue eternall life; and they are they which witnesse of me:</hi> hereby we are made wise vnto saluation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. now certaine it is, that without Catechizing, the Scriptures will be as a sealed booke: and therefore as we haue in regard the reading of Gods booke, to receiue edification and comfort by it, it is needfull we be skilled in the principles before.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p> Fiftly, can there bee a more notable preseruatiue, to keepe vs safe from the multitude of seducers and impostors in the world, as Iesuites and Seminaries? How many are peruerted by them? for they compasse sea and land, to make of their profession, that they may make them the children of hell like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, I will not say two-fold worse; for that I suppose cannot be: witnesse their many treacheries and conspiracies, and especially that gunne-powder businesse, which argue their attainment to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this kind. If false Prophets may be knowne by their fruits, which is the rule of our master, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. then it is no hard matter for these who will apply themselues to discerning of spirits (the which we are counselled, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 1.) to finde out of what spirit they are: but concerning these that haue beene sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by them, hath there beene a more chiefe cause then neglect of instruction in the grounds of the true religion?</p>
   <p>Sixtly, what a rich treasure is the feare of God? the want whereof <hi>Abraham</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing in a country where hee was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourning, doubted of villanies to bee
<pb facs="5"/> done him and his wife: <hi>Surely</hi> (said hee) <hi>the feare of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wiues sake, Gen.</hi> 20. This is it which keepeth the subiect from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie against his Prince and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 9. 10. 11. which is the ground of dutifulnesse in children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their parents, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Children obey your parents in the Lord.</hi> This is the chaine that tieth seruants to due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their masters, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 5. 6. 7. 8. This is it that holdeth persons from breaking forth into lewdnesse of behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: <hi>How can I</hi> (said <hi>Ioseph</hi> being temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his ill mistresse) <hi>doe this great wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, and so sin against God? Gen.</hi> 39. 9.</p>
   <p>Now is it possible that this treasure of Gods feare can be, except there be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge going before? and is there againe a more direct way for this, then instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the principles of Christianitie?</p>
   <p>Seuenthly, what is catechizing in the very nature of it, but as it were a taking of any one by the hand, to lift him vp out of the dungeon of darknesse, and to bring him into the light and sight of Christ crucified, the which alone doth yeeld iustification, <hi>Esa.</hi> 53. 11. and life
<pb facs="5"/> eternall, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. So that catechizing is a most speciall pole to lift vp the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent, the onely beholding of which perfectly cureth that deadly wound which that fiery Serpent of hell gaue vs, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. If therefore the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ crucified be in price and account with vs, (the which <hi>Paul</hi> estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of such excellencie, that all things of this world herewith compared, hee reckoned them to bee dung and filth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.) then ought this exercise to be in request with vs, as being without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie greatly requisite to the getting and procuring of that worthy science.</p>
   <p>There may be added an eighth bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: The doctrine of the Gospell is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 9. yea a great mysterie, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. and euery one by his birth is a person naturall, and <hi>the naturall man perceiueth not the things that are of God,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. This being so, it may easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare how necessary catechizing is, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a familiar and plaine instruction in the grounds of doctrine.</p>
   <p>A ninth consideration of the benefit of this is hereby euident: Christians are all of two sorts; either they are babes,
<pb facs="6"/> through being lately new borne, or they haue attained to some good growth, and they haue their wits exercised to discerne both good and euill. This distinction the holy Ghost setteth downe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 13. 14. Now how many are there of the former ranke? (yea and it were well if they were come to this) and as for these, they haue need of milke, and not strong meat, as the Apostle there speaketh, <hi>v.</hi> 12. And will you know what hee meaneth there by milke? he expresseth himselfe a little before, calling it the first principles of the word of God: and could hee haue spoken more plainly?</p>
   <p>The last benefit, which is the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole: Catechizing is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the establishing of persons for a fixed and setled standing in grace. <hi>If yee continue in my word</hi> (saith our heauenly Master) <hi>then are yee my Disciples, Ioh.</hi> 8. 31. Now hereunto this kinde of exercise (by the confession of all) is singularly expedient. It is a common title giuen to the principles of religion, that they are called grounds, which is a very fit appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as being to notifie, that all such who are not skilled in these principles,
<pb facs="6"/> are as a building which stands vpon no firme ground. Therefore euery one that mindeth in good earnest the profession of Christianitie, had need to looke to his ground, that it be sure enough. <hi>All that will liue godly</hi> (saith the Apostle, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.) must suffer persecution: and therefore without firme setling not any one may looke to hold out against such stormes and tempests.</p>
   <p>Let this suffice to haue beene said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the benefits by catechizing, the which as diuers coards twisted together, may make as a great cable to draw and pull any vnto it.</p>
   <p>Now in the second place, I am to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour about remoueall of the contempt, wherein this noble exercise is: and here, albeit the former consideration, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the profits arising by it, may bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this, yet whereas profit is one thing, and dignitie or excellencie is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will here alleage what concerneth this.</p>
   <p>First, should catechizing seeme a base and vile matter in our eyes, which God in the depth of his wisdome hath inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as an ordinance of his, to helpe his
<pb facs="7"/> elect to the faith of Christ, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them therein? This is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which <hi>Paul</hi> vsed in his plea for preaching, which otherwise was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted foolishnesse, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. Here then may I say this of catechizing: Bee it in the account of the greater number a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and weake thing, yet certainly it is Gods foolishnesse, which is wiser then men, and Gods weaknesse, which is stronger then men, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 25.</p>
   <p>Secondly, should that be contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with vs, the carefull and diligent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of which, hath made certaine, though otherwise much accepted, yet to be the more honourable with God? <hi>Abraham</hi> for example: It is true that his faith properly made his person plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vnto God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. and 39. yet his diligentnesse about the instructing of his familie in the way of the Lord, did make him the more acceptable; and therfore for this very act God maketh him of his priuie counsell: <hi>Shall I hide</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>from Abraham the thing that I will doe? For I know him, that he will command his sons &amp; his houshold after him, that they keepe the way of the Lord, Ge.</hi> 18. 17. 19.</p>
   <pb facs="7"/>
   <p> Thirdly, if antiquitie and ancientie may procure reuerence, (as it ought to doe when it is not seuered from truth) certainly catechizing is not destitute of this.</p>
   <p>In the Ecclesiasticall storie there is mention made of diuers Catechists, <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus, Clemens, Origen,</hi> and other which were in the Primitiue Church, or very shortly vpon the same, that tooke great paines in this kinde. More then this, it is euident that in the Apostles times it was in practise, as is plaine both by the fift to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> vers. 12. 13. and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the sixt, vers. 1. 2. young <hi>Timothie,</hi> as he was brought vp by his mother <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and grandmother <hi>Loys,</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from his childhood, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. so doubtlesse he was in this kinde also. Further then this, in the times of the old Testament there is mention made of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> how he was taught and instructed by his mother, <hi>Prou.</hi> the last: <hi>The words of King Lemuel, the prophecie that his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught him.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Beyond all this, it is plaine that in the times of the Patriarkes catechizing was practised. That <hi>Iacob</hi> vsed it, it is plaine
<pb facs="8"/> by <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. <hi>Then said Iacob to his houshold, and to all that were with him, put away the strange gods that are among you, and cleanse your selues.</hi> Now it may not otherwise be thought, but that this holy Patriarke, as he tooke straight order for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the false gods, so his care was as great in the informing them in the knowledge of the true God, and in the right worship of him. And as for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that hee vsed it, it is euident by <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. the place formerly alleaged.</p>
   <p>Yea it ascendeth to the supremest height of antiquitie, which is to <hi>Adam</hi> himselfe: for in that his two sonnes did so applie themselues to the worship and religious seruice of God, it is certaine (howsoeuer it be not literally expressed) that this came to passe by being catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and instructed therein, by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Fourthly, this maketh not a little for the high reputation of catechizing, in that all the reformed Churches through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christendome doe vrge and require the practise of it: wherein what doe they otherwise then giue an honourable testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie vnto it?</p>
   <pb facs="8"/>
   <p> Lastly (which onely might suffice, if there were no more spoken for it) Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing is of ordinance Apostolicall; and so it is not of humane inuention, but it hath Iehoua himselfe to be the founder of it. This is plaine by <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle hauing before spoken of the needful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, whereas he saith, <hi>Ye haue need againe that wee teach you the first principles of the word of God,</hi> then doth hee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward relate the Catechisme it selfe in the maine 2. principall points of it, which he tearmeth repentance from dead workes, and faith towards God: he mentioneth also the two sorts of persons of whom it was required, to wit, the Conuerts before they were baptized, which he meaneth by the doctrine of Baptismes, and the children of Beleeuers so soone as they came to discretion, which hee meaneth by the laying on of hands, because these little ones after such exercises performed by them, had the hands, to wit, of the Pastors, laid on them.</p>
   <p>Thus wee haue seene of these two points, to wit, the great profits which come by catechizing, and also that there is no vilenesse in it, so as any one may
<pb facs="9"/> despise it; but contrariwise to bee had in great regard by any persons whatsoeuer.</p>
   <p>There remaineth now this third to be showne, which is that you (my brethren) who are Parents, Masters, and Schoole-gouernours, haue an interest in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, I meane that in some sort you stand chargeable for the practise of this dutie of catechizing.</p>
   <p>Farre be it from mee to lay any yoke on your neckes, or burden on your backes, other then that which is Christs, to which euery one must submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. especially sithence his yoke is easie, and burden is light, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 30. He is that great, yea and only Law-giuer to the conscience, and therefore these that desire to bee in the number of his good subiects, must not denie him obedience, as in other, so in this dutie.</p>
   <p>Now how shall this appeare? Euen easily if wee acknowledge that all the whole Scripture is only his word, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as is said, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>Let the word of Christ dwell plenteously in you,</hi> meaning thereby the whole doctrine of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But let vs goe to the matter. And
<pb facs="9"/> first I reason thus: Euery Christian is by his calling a Prophet, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 12. and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that if we partake with Christ in his two greater offices, to wit, Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Kingdome, <hi>Ren</hi> 1. 6. we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the lesser also, which is of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie. Now then if euery common Christian ought to bee a Teacher, how much more you, whose callings, though not publike, yet are more speciall then ordinary?</p>
   <p>Secondly, thus I argue: The husband oweth this dutie to teach the wife, as is plaine by 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 35. <hi>If they will learne any thing, let them aske their husbands at home:</hi> now she is a person of superioritie in a familie; then much more is this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be performed to those that are sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the inferiours.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, the expresse commands of God are many and diuers for this dutie: <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <hi>These words which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart, and thou shalt rehearse them continually vnto thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and shalt talke of them when thou tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest in thine house.</hi> Likewise vers. 20. <hi>If thy sonne shall aske thee in time to come, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, What meane these testimonies and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi>
      <pb facs="10"/>
      <hi>&amp;c. then thou shalt say vnto thy sonne, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. <hi>God established a testimonie in Iacob, and ordained a Law in Israel, which he commanded our Fathers, that they should teach their children, that the posteritie might know it, and the children which should be borne, should stand vp and declare it to their children.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And in the new Testament, very pregnant is that which is <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. <hi>Ye Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers prouoke not your children to wrath, but bring them vp in instruction and information of the Lord.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Fourthly, I thus argue: You that are Parents and Schoole-gouernours, owe loue vnto your children and Pupils, for this is a common debt which we owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8. much more vnto them. Now this loue must be in deed, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 18. and can there bee a more speciall worke of loue, then to helpe them to that science, which yeeldeth for its bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit life eternall, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 3.</p>
   <p>Fiftly, those that professe the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, are by their calling <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7. Now they that will be <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, must necessarily (as Truth it selfe hath affirmed) doe the
<pb facs="10"/> workes of <hi>Abraham, Ioh.</hi> 8. 39. Now this was one of his workes, as may bee seene <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. of which also God did take especiall notice.</p>
   <p>Sixtly, it is your desire, that at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed times, especially at Easter, they should come to the Sacrament, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thereof: now in comming vnpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, what other doe they then eat and drinke vnto themselues iudgement? 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and should not you take pitty on them in this respect, and apply your best endeuours, that they may not turne vnto their bane, which by Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is appointed the food to life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall?</p>
   <p>Seuenthly, you that are Parents and Masters, desire greatly to haue your children dutifull and obedient, also your seruants faithfull and diligent; and can there be a more notable means then catechizing, for the effecting of this, whereby their hearts may bee seasoned with grace, and consequently fit fruits will be following?</p>
   <p>Lastly, what is a Christian familie but a little Church? so is it tearmed in diuers places, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 5. and <hi>Philem.</hi>
      <pb facs="11"/> verse 2. <hi>To the Church which is in thy house:</hi> therefore such a speciall holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise as is Catechizing, should not be as a stranger therein.</p>
   <p>I omit further allegations (beloued brethren) concerning this catechizing dutie to be performed by you: it is God only that hath the perswasiue power, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 27.</p>
   <p>I will onely satisfie a demand or two, and so I will end. One is, wherefore I am silent concerning the Ministers, for the executing of this catechizing busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: I answer, for that generally it is held for a dutie whereto they are boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, whereas concerning other it is not. And hence it is strange to mee, that all those who make conscience of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doe not also of catechizing, which is equally commanded, and rather more then lesse profitable. Secondly, That if the Ministers doe their duties, there may be no more required then their care to present them to the Minister: I answer, that except they doe something in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, the profit by the publike may bee endangered: but if this be neglected in the publike, then it standeth you the
<pb facs="11"/> more vpon, that your selues be labourers in the worke.</p>
   <p>If here it be said, the matter is too dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be done by you, I answer, if you only command your companies to learne these principles, and to vtter the same to you, this is a small matter; and then there are so many helpes by those who haue written vpon the grounds of Religion, that at the least some of those being procured, there may bee some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with great facilitie performed.</p>
   <p>I shall briefly specifie something con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Treatise which here is put forth, and so I will end. I haue for the method altogether followed the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Catechisme: for the matter, I haue vsed libertie therein, as other haue done before me in the selfe-same booke.</p>
   <p>The points here set downe, I hope haue euery one of them good warrant.</p>
   <p>There are some persons, for whom I haue done it, who I know will make vse of it; and indeed for them I tooke this businesse, such as it is, in hand.</p>
   <p>Yet I haue beene bold to hang out a garland, because this kinde of mine, howsoeuer good, is in small request, I
<pb facs="12"/> meane of catechizing in generall.</p>
   <p>Now I desire you (good brethren) to take my former admonitions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations in good part, and to accept these my poore endeuours in the forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this so needfull an exercise.</p>
   <p>And so I commend you to Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious inclining and directing you for all his good ordinances: and I heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech him to vouchsafe to all vs his elect and called ones of his purpose, through a grace that was giuen vs through Christ before the world was, that wee may bee made perfect in all good workes, to doe his will, working in vs that which is pleasant in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
