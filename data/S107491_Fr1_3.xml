      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was in my thoughts when this Coppy of my meditations upon <hi>the consecratiō of the Son of God to his everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Priest-hood,</hi> was first licenced for the Presse, to have annexed unto it one or two Sermons, or short Treatises of the like argument. But being called from my studies by urgent occasions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the impression of this 9<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Book of Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon the Creed was neare finished, I am constrained to publish it in a lesser volume, then I first intended it, though (I take it) in as many lines, or more words then either of the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Bookes upon the same argument, to wit, the knowledge of Christ, and of him crucified, doe
<pb facs="6"/>
containe. The matter is not great, and so much the lesse, because I have ready <hi>(in adversariis)</hi> divers Sermons, or short Treatises as appendices or appertinences to all these three Books, <hi>respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,</hi> &amp; to another intitled <hi>Christs answer to Iohns disciples,</hi> or an Introduction to the knowledge of Christ &amp;c. to be published as soone as God shall be pleased to grant me ability, and opportunity. Other three Bookes I have in like readinesse for the Presse, to wit, the 10<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Book of Comments upon the Creede, or a treatise of the naturall mans servitude to sinne, and of that poore remnant of Free-will which is left in the Sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> before▪ they be regenerated in Christ by the spirit, together with directions for the right use or imployment of Free-will, after our Baptisme, for the accomplishment, or rather for performance of the conditions on our parts required, that mortification may be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in us by the spirit of God. The next of the three Bookes promised is the 11<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Booke of these Commentaries containing a treatise upon the Articles of Christs comming to judgement, of the Resurrection of the dead, &amp; of the Life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, which is the finall setence which at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="6"/>
to Iudgement shall passe upon all men, as well upon them which have bin long dead, as those that shall be found alive at his comming. The last Booke of these Comments containes the second part of a treatise heretofore begun, and in part published, concerning the Articles of the holy Catholique Church; of the Communion of Saints, and the Forgivenesse of sinnes. What I here promise or may occasion the Readers, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially young students in divinity, to expect, shall by Gods assistance be shortly or in good time performed, either by myselfe or by my Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: unto whose disposalls, I am not likely to leave much; scarce any thing else besides Books and Papers.</p>
