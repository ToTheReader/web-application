   <head>The principall vses of this Treatise.</head>
   <p>FIrst here the Reader may behold the pointes of faith, with the errours repugnant therevnto, referred to the Articles of our Christian faith, and to the residue of the maine grounds and principles of our Catholike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
   <p>Secondly in this collation he may perceiue both the particular pointes of faith to be a light for the better vnderstanding of these grounds of faith, &amp; also the groundes of faith, to giue greater strength for the confirmation of the particular pointes of faith, and for the confutation of the erroures that are contrary thereto.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, whereas the people for the most part cannot read the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor so well vnderstand and keepe in memorie the sentences takē out of the Apostles &amp; Prophets, as they can these groūds of our Christiā profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siō, by reason of the more familiar vse of the same, therefore the particular pointes of faith being made open and knowen vnto them the more easily by this collatiō, they may the sooner hereby be brought to the knowledge of the truth, and also confirmed and established in the same.</p>
   <p>Fourthly wheras the most venemous Doctrine of Antichrist is the more <note place="margin">A preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatiue for the simple against the polloned doctrine of the Romish Antichrist being offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them in a cup of gold, that is, vnder the name the of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, faith.</note> read<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ly received, for that it is delivered in a cuppe of gold, that is vnder the name of the Catholike faith, even the simple &amp; vnlearned may receiue by this collation a most soveraigne preseruatiue against the same. For it is an vndoubted trueth agreed vpon of both sides, that these groūdes of faith are Catholike and Apostolike, &amp; therefore that all such doctrines as are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable thereto, but are contrary to the same, are neither Catholike, nor yet Apostolike. How then, (may even a simple man say to such as would se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to the Popish religion, vnder the pretēce of recōciliatiō to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith) cā that doctrine be Catholike, which teacheth it to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to beleeue in grosse, &amp; as the Church beleeueth, wheras the scope &amp; end of my Catholike Creede is, that I not only know &amp; vnderstād, but also be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make a distinct cōfession of the very hardest pointes of the Christian faith? Secōdly he may say, how can that doctrine be Catholike, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me to doubt of particular faith, whereas the Catholike Creede teacheth every faithfull Christian constantly to professe without wavering, I BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEEVE. Thirdly be may aa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e, how can your Romish doctrine be Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, which teacheth me to beleeue in the Church &amp; in the Saintes, wheras my catholike Creede teacheth me to beleeue the Church, and not in the Church, but only in God: Lastly to omitte the rest, whereas my Catholike
<pb facs="13"/> Creede teacheth me, that Christ only suffred &amp; died for my sinnes, &amp; that he is my only Redeemer &amp; Saviour, how can your Romish doctrine be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, which teacheth that the Saintes also suffered and died for me, and that their sufferings being applied vnto me by the Popes Pardons, are both SATISFACTORY for my sins, and also MERITORIOVS of eternall glory? wherefore pretende no longer your Romish doctrine to bee the Catholike faith, seeing that it is directly contrary to the maine grounds and Articles of the Catholike faith.</p>
   <p>Lastly by this treatise it may be perceived, how the Bishop of Rome and his aaherentes haue brought in that great Apostasie from the faith fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Apostle, and haue also fulfilled all the other prophecies which d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> concerne the great Antichrist, and therefore that hee is most truly and iustly charged by the professors of the Gospell, to be that very grer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
