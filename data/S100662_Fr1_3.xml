      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which heretofore I haue propounded to you (right Worshipfull &amp; beloued) in teaching, I doe now publish to all men by printing, to wit, mine opinion of the vnlawfulnes of Games consisting in chance. My desire is either information, if I erre in judgment, or reformation, of so leud a practise. But whether I erre or no (which yet I would gladly vnderstand,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 7.</note> for I ought not to teach an vntruth, though to Gods glorie) yet there is none, zealous indeede against sin, desirous from the heart
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
to reclaime sinners, and who deeply conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the greiuous abuses, which accompanie dicing and carding, (as horrible swearing, dangerous quarelling, losse (I say not of good houres, but) of nights and daies, &amp; the pitifull vndoeing of too too manny) but will remember that all things are not<note place="margin">1.

Which respect▪ the <hi>7.</hi> Iniunction forbidding Ministers to vse these vnlawfull games, may besupposed to haue. Now that which authoritie exacteth of Ministers, doth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion require of all true Professors. For as the one are to be ensamples to the flocke,<note place="margin">1.

And therefore as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, If meate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my brother, I will eate no flesh while the world standeth: so euery true Christian should say, and that with more resolution (for Play is not so necessarie as meate) If
