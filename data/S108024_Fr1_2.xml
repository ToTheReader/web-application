   <head>TO THE MOST EXCELLENT AND ILLVSTRIOVS PRINCE, CHARLES, PRINCE of Wales.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Highnesse may please to remember how great an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest your Princely Mother, our late Gracious Queene, vouchsafed to challenge in my deceased Father: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting Him as one of Hers, as most truly (next the professed band of dutie to his dread Soueraigne, whose first-sworne Chaplaine he was, after his Maiesties happie arriuall in
<pb facs="3"/>
these parts) by all the tyes a Royall Mistris might engage a Seruant, he was. Since that Starre was taken from our sight, I know not whether else ought Shee could call Hers might so immediately refer as to your selfe. I am sure it was His study, while he liued, to consecrate his best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to the Branches of that Royall stocke, and by that line of duty, drawn from Her merits, to measure out His bounden seruices to Her Line, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to your Highnesse; Who, I haue cause to thinke, doe yet beleeue you had a faithfull Orator and Seruant of Him. Since then by double right he was deuoted to your Highnesse, by his owne acknowledgement, and by the purchase of your especiall fauours towards Him; I durst not entitle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="3"/>
other Patrone to the remainder of what he was, his <hi>Memory,</hi> without leaue from your Highnesse. But as it was my filiall duety to vindicate a wronged Father, so I held it the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of my ciuill duty to tender it first to your Hands, that it might take sanctuary vnder your Princely wing. Thus borne vp, the <hi>Truth</hi> I write shall boldly flie into the bosome of those climes where it was first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured; and, if their foreheads be not meretriciously steeled with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or growne flint, fetcht backe it's owne proper hiew, or their shame.</p>
   <p>It is not a forward presumption in me, but the cause which makes your Highnesse patronage my chiefe scope; vpon which tearmes it will not be inglorious for you to vndertake it.
<pb facs="4"/>
For whilest you shall protect abused Innocence, your Goodnesse will stand pitched at the iust height your Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse now doth, one degree from a <hi>Defender of the Faith.</hi> Long may you flourish, to make all Good men happy in your protection; and may that heart want the prayers of good men to relieue it, which doth not as faithfully sue to Almighty God for all addition to your Happinesse, as he who is</p>

      <signed>Your Highnesse most humbly deuoted Seruant, HENRY KING.</signed>
