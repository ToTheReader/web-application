   <head>TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE HENRY, <hi>Eldest Sonne to our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne,</hi> the Kings most Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Maiestie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight High, Right Excellent, and gracious sweete Prince, (in all humilitie) I beseech your Highnesse to pardon me, in that (being one of the meanest among the King your Fathers ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants) I haue presumed to Dedicate this simple small Treatise to your Excellencie: the Subiect whereof is notwithstanding such and so great, as may seeme vnmeete to bee tearmed a Subiect. For, it treateth onely of Kings and Princes; all excellent Worthies: a matter (I confesse) much vnbefitting my slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der capacity, and lesse learning, to deale with. In which regard, I cannot but acknowledge, the true Prouerbe most fitte to bee applied
<pb facs="3"/>
against me, <hi>Blinde Bayard is the boldest horse in the Cart.</hi> Notwithstanding, that, which hath spurred me forward to commit the fault, may (I hope) in some measure, qualifie and excuse it; to weet, my seruent loue and zealous heart: which cānot endure, your Grace should passe by me, without some little testimony of my great ioy, zeale, and bounden duety: howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, in the maner of expressing it, my discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may perhaps be worthily taxed, and my insufficiencie layed open to the world. But to proceede on: The Worthies, here recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, are nine in number; all <hi>Henries,</hi> al mighty Potentates: eight of which haue already been Souereigne Kings of this renowmed Nation; seuen of them excelling in Martiall valour and conquest, one of them (namely, King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt) in vertue and pietie, (the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of sinne and himselfe) and none of them much inferiour to some of the ancient nine Worthies. Now, your Highnesse being of the same name with them, and Heire appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the same Dominions, which those eight Worthies (your glorious Ancestors) sometime held, and the blessed sonne of a mighty Monarch; the eye of the World is
<pb facs="3"/>
vpon you, and lookes for a transparent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of their vertues into you, and a reflexion from you: the ioy and comfort of this famous Realme of <hi>Great Britaine</hi> (aswell in Church as Common wealth) is set and settled in and vpon you, next to our King and present sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Gouernour. And their hopefull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation hath already installed you the ninth Worthy; as being likely (in time) I say not, to equall the eight, but euen to surmount and exceed them. For, as the ages, since theirs, haue been illustrated with more learning, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and diuine wisedom: so, besides your gifts of Nature (who, in perfections, hath not been niggardly towards you) your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse taking also your princely and happie education in a time of peace, and that vnder the wings and eyes of the most learned King your father, vertuous Queene mother, and such a Councel of settled and deep wisedom, as not the like in <hi>Europe;</hi> your Highnesse, I say, hath (herein) meanes, examples, and leasure to heare, learne, behold, and obserue the singular goodnesse of God, in that, which hereafter shall be your owne greatnesse and happinesse. And here I may not forget your
<pb facs="4"/>
chiefest honour, nobilitie, and worthinesse; that you are descended of the eldest and highest house, of the blood royall of Heauen, the child and sonne of God, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coheire with Christ (our great Lord) to the immortall Crowne. Now, the same God, your heauenly Father, who hitherto (in rich mercie) hath showred downe abundantly his graces vpon you, vouchsafe to continue and increase them in you; guiding al your prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections and actions, to the glorie of his name, the benefit of the Church, the good of this whole Monarchie, the vnspeakeable ioy of your royall Parents; and blesse both them and you, as with much health, long life, and glory here, so with eternall happinesse here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>July</hi> the 4.</p>
