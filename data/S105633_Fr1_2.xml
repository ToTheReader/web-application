   <head>To the Rightly right Honorable Lady,
the Lady Penelope, Countesse
of Deuonshire.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST NOBLE LADY,</hi>
had the blessings whilō
bestowed, and too soon
depriued, beene as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent,
as they were
glorious: the world had
not then had such a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
cause of iust sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to bewaile, nor I of perticular griefe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe,
the present losse of so worthy a lord: but
a most sad trueth it is, <hi>Fate may be lamented, neuer
recalled:</hi> vpon which infallible axiome, despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
of all possibility, either of regaining the
same, or hoping his peere▪ as much as in the
reache of my weake talent lay (vnusuall to this
stile) I haue endeuored to register his memory,
whose memory will grace my labors. To you,
<pb facs="3"/>
(<hi>excellent Lady</hi>) it was intended, to you it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed:
not doubting, but whatsoeuer hath
beene of him sayd, and trewly saide, your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
fauour, will allow the fauourable
protection of your expressest patronage, who
whiles he liued endowed you and iustly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
you, with all the principalles of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerest
hart, and best fortunes. Let not therfore
(worthy Countesse) my rasher presumption,
seeme presumpuous folly, in the eyes of your
discreeter iudgement, in that without your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie
(being a meere straunger alltogether
vnknowne vnto you) I haue thus aduentured,
to shelter my lines, vnder the well-guided con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of your Honorable name: grounding my
boldnes vpon this assurance, that true gētility
is euer accōpanyd (especially in your sex, more
specially in your selfe) with her inseparable
adiunct, singular Humanity, principally towards
those, whom neither Mercenary hopes or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
flattery, haue induced to speake but with
the Priuiledge of troth. And as for such, who
misdeeme virtue without cause, innocency
shall pitty them, though not eagerly with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<pb facs="3"/>
hate: yet simply with naked truth to which
enuy is euer opposite. Thus (<hi>Madame</hi>) presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
on your acceptance, I will in the meane
while, thinke my willing paynes (hitherto
confined to the Innes of Courte studyes
much differente) highlie guerdoned,
and mine vnfeathered Muse (as
soone dead as borne) ritchly
graced, vnder the plumes
of so worthy a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectresse.</p>
   <signed>The honourer and louer of your
noble perfections,
Io: FORDE.</signed>
