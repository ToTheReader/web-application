   <head>¶<hi>TO THE GENTLE</hi> harted Rear, all he wisheth.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F Galen, chéefe iudge of the most excellent Philosophers, and worthily Prince of all Phisicions (louing Reader) doubted not only the enuie of Momus, with the route of tatling Sophisters, as may appeare in hys fowerth booke, <hi>De sanitate tuenda,</hi> writinge the arte or trade of maintaining health: which knowledge was (as Tullie affirmeth) so highly estéemed, that it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to procéede from the immortall Gods, and not from man, but also to loose his labours: Shall I then suppose, iudge you in this yron age (wherin al men, except the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and godly affected, for the most parte gréeuouslie disquieted eyther with pleasure, couetousnes, enuy, pryd, ambicion, and such lyke passions, mocions of the mynde not obaying reason, gréedily gape after worldly gayne, whyles in the meane tyme the members and the mynde fall into such lappes, as they neuer may recouer agayne, so that then good night at Algate) to be voyde of doubte, disdayne, or feare to loose my laboures? When as Galen was so afrayde both to lose his labours, &amp; also to incurre the enuie of maliciouse cauillers, albeit hee well knewe that day would appéere at a litle hole, and that the Sunne with his bright beames, wold at length perse thruogh the foggie and dark mistes, and consume them away. For al counterfeyte vertue in the presence of true vertue, is no more able to abyde, then the snow is able to withstande the heate: howbeit for a time it may.</p>
   <p>Therfore Galen séeing most aswell of the Romaines as Greekes, spending all their tymes in vanities, few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the substances, altogither gyuen to the accident, as if a flocke of shéepe, a droue of fat ware, a number of fermes, lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters">

chiefest good, most studiously to be desired and earnestlyest to be sought for, hauing no care, whyle tyme serued, of the health of their bodyes, which is the very thing that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth the tyme of their lyfe: but all settinge greatest store by their painted sheath, as if a gaie or guilded robe were better or more to be desired, thē an healthy body in playn cloth, or a lame iade betrapped with pendentes of golde, more laudable and seruiceable then a sounde and lustie courser in a stéele sadle: or a weake witles heade couered with a cappe of aglettes, better then an heade furnished with liberall disciplines, of lyuely mynd, and noble lyfe, bent altogither vppon Vertue, couered with a playne bonnet. What seruice I praye you (if I may be so bold) doth a man affected with the sléeping sicknesse, vncured, or a man numme depriued of al his limmes, the same truly that a paynted man doth, except perhaps more gréeuouse to him selfe, his friendes, and the worlde, as was hée that was conuayed vnto mée on horsebacke frō Maister Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, whome I healed at Louth, An. 1562. What should I stand here expressing infinite millions, that throwe the noble arte of Phisique haue ben preserued, I can testifie of a thousande, and not so fewe that I haue cured in all partes, for these fouretéene yeares: some frantique, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectique, Epileptique, Melanchollique, Paralitique, Goutie, Pleuritique, Hydropique, some with {per}tisique, Stone, Strangurie, Consumpcions, Suffocations, Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mulsions, Obstructions, Ouerflowinges, Barrenes, Des<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cendings, Ascendings, the partes wasted, one part eaten, another vlcerated, the body distempered, as well the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, humours, as members, with moste vehemente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues: all the which fieuers you may finde in my Diall of Agues, and others in Methodo nostro ad. &amp;c. be it no more vayne gloriously published then Hippo. the popular infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, or with Galen the effectes which hée wrought by Purgation: or that Montan. doth shew in his Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, or Amatus Lusitanus, in his Centuriis, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand other of the learned and expert Phisicions.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="8"/>Notwithstanding, if any man shall take in hande, as many good mē do, to shew the way of restoring thē again to their naturall health (being a most excellent acte) their shall not be wanting sume, that if they can not disprayse it for blushing, yet they wil at the circumstances, or some other thing bée carping, or else the sicke them selues for want of learning wil gyue credite rather to the ignorant then to the skilfull, aproued and expert. To bée briefe, they shal haue good leaue for my part, séeing it is, and hath among so many ben a commune euil, and the wysest sort thinke it a booteles matter to perswade the forlorn hope, suche as haue decréed to caste awaye them selues, and contemne all vertuouse diligence, eyther taken for the preseruation of soule or body, albeit for the weale of the godly, I will not staye but procéede forwardes (in so reasonable maner as I may in so doubtfull matters) too showe how the Bathes of the Citie of Bathe, will ayde such as néede them: and therefore I suppose it is worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly termed Bathes ayde, if onely to your ayde for wante of other remedy you will vse them, and not as brutishe &amp; senceles persons frequent them. For as the learned Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantius sheweth in steede of things defensible, against out ward chaunces, gyuen vnto the vnreasonable beastes: vnto man as a farre more excellent gyfte, the vnspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wisedome of our creatour hath bestowed reason: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accordinge to reason in tyme if thou haue néede, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent them.</p>
   <p>This treatice therefore onely is atchieued, wherin if you hestowe some labour, most things doubtful you may finde discussed at the least so into your remembrance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled, that no question néedfull is, least vnremembred. In which if any thing I haue bin ouer bréefe, consider our trauayle, gyuing vs time, and wée wil amplifie it, if not, doe it your selues if you can, if you can not, it were no good manners, to finde faulte with an other, for that you can not or will not amende your selues. If it be to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouse or ouer curiouse, I doo not knowe why therefore
<pb facs="9"/>
you shold greatly mislyke it, for if you be bidden to a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and ther be more varietie of dishes then you be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed, or can away withal, it wer no reason that ther with you should be offended, seeing the cost is others, and the delicates ordeyned for you. But it may be that you thinke it neyther to briefe nor to long, and yet not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether after your mynde. No meruayle, for I vse myne owne veine and not yours. Neuerthelesse I would not that you should take my words as the sacred scriptures, or to thinke that whatsoeuer I shall speake sure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, but as the sayings of some simple man following that which is probable by coniecture, for further then likelyhode I can not go. It is enough for them to tell cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and sure thinges which saye those thinges may bee knowen, and do also professe them selues wise, but for my parte to be a louer of wysedome if is very requisite.</p>
   <p>Thus (gentle Reader) while I labour to proffet thée, I am fayne to submit my workes to euery curiouse car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, howbeit I craue this at theyr handes with Apelles, who when he had made a most excellēt picture, insomuch that it rather séemed a liuing thinge then the counterfayt of any, offering it to the world to be vewed, (to thend that if any found fault therwith, he might amend it) ther was amongst many other, a shoomaker which founde faulte with the show latchet, which Apelles hearinge (in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret place for the purpose attending) with his pencil forth with amended, as I shall gladly if reasonably therto I bée admonished. But hée not contented therewith (as one by lykelyhoode somewhat proude, that he could fynde fault with Apelles workmanshippe) dispraysed further the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing of the tippe of the nose. To whom Apelles auns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, no farther then thy show souter. And true it is that of arte no man can iudge but the artificer. No tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate man will take in euell parte, the trauayle of good natured persons for the vniuersal profet, seeing Tullie in his fyrst booke of his Tusculane questions, and also in his Offices, as all other carefull of the wele publique, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb facs="9"/>
that they be of best nature which think themselues borne to helpe, saue, and comfort men. But when such lacke estimacion, ther is small cause of diligence to attain perfection, honour bréedeth artes, all men are stirred to studie by fame, and alwayes those things are litle set by, which few or none do aduaunce. In fine, as in pleasing the godly, vertuouse and indifferent Reader, I account my paines abundantly recompenced: So for the reprochfull woords of the backbiting Zoilus, (a number of which this our age is notwithout, as neyther the corne without chaffe.) I passe not a strawe, so that I may well conclude with Erasmus saying.</p>

   <p>Thus cōmitting thée good Reader to the giuer of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, who endue thée with whatsoeuer thy gentle harte desyreth remaine thine to the vttermost of my power as thou findest.</p>
