      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the manner of some quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relsome persons, that being beaten by one aduersarie, too strong for them, they are not quiet in their mindes till they haue got another, with whom they hope to deale well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and to beate the former upon his back, wrecking upon him all that anger which they haue harboured in their heart against the other, but could not utter as they desired. So it seemes to be with this man: who having had of late (as it is reported) much comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the <hi>Morris-dauncing-Papists</hi> and <hi>Athiests</hi> in his parish, whereof lately hee was Minister: And finding them too hard for him; and that insteed of being sheep to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, they came with open mouth like wolues both against the sheep and Shepheard: he hath thought it best, seeing these wolues thus comming to saue himselfe by flying to an other place; leaving the pore sheepe in the same fould with the wolues, to shift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues as they could. But not resting so, hee hath bethought him of an other sort of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, with whom he hopes more easily to deale: and these are the poore <hi>Separatists;</hi> against whom he hath also those <hi>Morris-daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi>
      <pb n="4" facs="3"/>and many greater then they to take his part. Them he encountreth stoutly with <hi>Ten Counter-Demands</hi> (as he cals them) with which as with so many yron hornes, he hopes so to shake the silly Separatists, as not to leaue them a whole bone in their skin. But why doth he call them <hi>Counter-Demands?</hi> Not because he hath answered, but onely seen, as I heare, 7 <hi>Demands</hi> of theirs, some good space since pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by thē. These he should rather haue answered, in my judgment, if he could, for the defence of his Church Communion, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Ministerie, and Worshippe. But it seemes he had rather aske, then answer que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions (as what bungler cannot better strike then fence?) and so his meaning is, to set these his <hi>Ten Counter-demands</hi> against their <hi>Seaven Demands,</hi> that so they might knock heads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to see whose is hardest. Since then it must be so, I will first set downe those <hi>Seaven,</hi> and after answer his <hi>Ten,</hi> simply, without all doubt, yet as well as I can: but plainly, and distinctly as he desireth: Intreating thee, good Reader, to beare with my vnschollership, for I haue not been brought up among the Muses, but Mariners: and am unwillingly, though par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, drawn hereunto by his importunity.</p>
   <p>Quest. 1 <hi>Whether the Lord Iesus Christ haue in his last will &amp; Testament given unto, and set in his Church, sufficient ordinary Offices, with their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, workes, and maintenance, for the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his holy things; and for the ordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, guidance, and service of his Church to the end of the world, or no?</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether the Offices of</hi> Pastors, Teachers,
<pb facs="3"/>Elders, Deacons, <hi>and</hi> Helpers <hi>be those offices ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Testament of Christ? or whether the present ecclesiasticall offices of</hi> Arch-Bishops. Lord-Bishops, Suffragans, Deanes, Priests, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars,, Arch-Deacons, Prebendaries, Canons, Gospellers, Petty-Canons, Epistlers, Virge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Queristers, Organ-Players, Parsons, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, Chancelors, Commissaries, Proctors, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters, Appariters <hi>or</hi> Sumners, Churchwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Doctors of Divinity, Questmen <hi>or</hi> Side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Deacons <hi>or</hi> halfe Priests, Chaplins <hi>or</hi> house-Priests, Clarkes, Sextons, <hi>and the rest now had and retained in the Cathedrall and Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shionall Assemblies of the Land, be those Offices appointed in Christs last will and testament, or no?</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="3">3 <hi>Whether the calling, and entrance into the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall offices last before named, with their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations, and maintenance now had and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in England, be the manner of calling, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, and maintenance, which Christ hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for the offices of his Church, or no?</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="4">4 <hi>Whether every true Church of Christ, be not a company of people called and separated out from the world and false worship and waies thereof, by the word of God, and ioyned together in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of the Gospell, by voluntary profession of the faith, and obedience of Christ.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="5">5 <hi>Whether the sacraments, being seales of the righteousnes which is by faith, may be administred vnto any other, but to the faithfull and their seed, or in any other ministery or manner then is prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and appointed by Iesus Christ the Apostle and high preist of our profession? And whether they be not otherwise administred in the parish as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of England at this day, or no?</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="6">
      <pb facs="4"/> 6 <hi>Whether the booke of Common prayer, with the feasts, fasts, stinted prayers, holly dayes, and leiturgy prescribed therein &amp; vsed in the assemblies, bee the true worship of God commanded in his word, or the devise and invention of man for Gods worship and service.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="7">7 <hi>Whether all people and Churches without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, be not bound in religion, onely to receiue and submit vnto that Ministry, worship and order, which Christ as Lord and King hath given vnto, and appoynted in his Church: or whether any may receiue and ioyne vnto another devised by man for the worship and service of God: and consequently whether they that ioyne to the present Ecclesiasticall ministry, worship, and order of the Cathedrall and Parishionall Assemblies, can be assured by the word of God, that they ioyne to the former, or dayned by Christ, and not to the latter, devised by man for the worship and service of God.</hi>
