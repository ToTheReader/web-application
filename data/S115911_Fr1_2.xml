For readers are not (for the most part) so beneuolous as hearers: and I haue obserued of the eye, it is farre more censorious than that sanctified sense of salvation.

Thus much the paines that I haue taken doe assure mee, that I haue not done the worke of God negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently: and yet I confesse not exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the itching eares and eyes of this age.
