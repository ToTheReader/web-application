And on the other side, there is none so well learned about vs, (I dare auouch) that is able to iustifie and defend it by the word. And yet haue they so raged and stormed at me since the preaching of these sermons: that I had almost waxed proude with conceit that I had spoken much against them. For▪ as it is the nature of the greater and stronger beasts, to despise the barking whelpe and then only to turne againe when they feele them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues bitten and touched indeede: so I began to conceiue of these <hi>Vsurers,</hi> that because now they stormed therefore they were stung: and because they fretted earnestly, therfore they were touched throughly. If that be true which is reported, (for I haue not vouchsafed to fift and examine the cause) some haue vowed the answere of my booke before it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth: some are sayd to haue many a reason alreadie deuised against it in their braine▪ some haue threatned that I shall neuer borrowe: some haue slandered mee behinde my backe: some haue spoken foule things to my face: yea, I haue been bitten and backbitten, as one sayd of me publikelie of late,<note place="margin">

      </gap> in a further declaration. All that I will say for the present is this.

      <hi>Vti peccato alterius ad bonum,
<pb facs="8"/>
licitum est:</hi> It is a lawfull thing to vse another mans sinne, to good end and purpose. But the summe of that poynt is this: If I haue done both, or either of both, that helpeth not their cause: If I haue not done both, nor neither of both, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is their sinne.</p>
   <p>Two things I require of the good Christian reader. The one: that thou stumble not at the title of this treatise. So many hauing written of this argument, it was not the easiest thing to finde a name whereby to distinguish it from other mens labours. All that I haue aimed at therein is, that <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> might be <hi>rei notamen,</hi> (as <note n="t" place="margin">
         <hi>August. de Genesi ad lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram cap. 6. tom. 3.</hi>
      </note> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh) that is, that the title of the booke might deliuer the substāce and matter therein contained. Other quilitie or new deuise I haue affected none.</p>
   <p>The other is this: that thou hold it not strange to see, that after <hi>The Death of Vsurie,</hi> published the last yeare by one man, thou hast now the yeare following his <hi>Arraignment</hi> and <hi>Conuiction</hi> by another. For first, many times it falleth out, that malefactors are executed before their examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Arraignment</hi> and <hi>Conuiction</hi> bee published to the world. Secondly, <hi>The death of Vsurie</hi> came foorth from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where I hope no lesse but it is dead indeede. <hi>Schollers</hi> haue not so great store of money that they can, nor so little store of learning that they will be practisers of <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie.</hi>
   </p>
   <q>
      <l>—Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes</l>
      <l>Emollit mores.</l>
   </q>
   <p>But this <hi>Arraignment</hi> and <hi>Conuiction of Vsurie,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth from <hi>London:</hi> where though it hath in former time been pleaded against by <hi>D. Wilson,</hi> concluded against by <hi>M. Caesar,</hi> and now of later times reproued by <hi>M. Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bull,</hi> and examined by <hi>M. Smith:</hi> yet is it not hetherto tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly conuicted in the consciences of the people, much lesse put to death and executed as it should. Thirdly, wee see that <hi>Iudges</hi> of life and death, doe not all hold their <hi>Sessions</hi> or <hi>Assises</hi> at one and the same time. But when some haue exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb facs="9"/>
fellons in one shire: some begin their arraignment in another. And therefore what shall let me to follow their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and after the <hi>Assises</hi> ended, and <hi>vsurie</hi> executed at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to proceede on to <hi>The Arraignment</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiction</hi> thereof, in the citie of <hi>London.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This I speake not, as if I could speake nothing els in this case, but as sparing and pitying the Author of that treatise, who hath ploughed with my heifer, and whose bookes haue been published vnder my name, to my great preiudice and discredit. But I remember what <hi>Salomon</hi> sayth: <note n="u" place="margin">
         <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

      </note>
      <hi>A foole powreth out all his minde: but a wiseman keepeth it till afterward.</hi> All therefore that I will adde is this, If this booke benefite thee, thanke God that gaue the meanes. If it offend thee, yet know that I ment well, and aimed at thy good, and haue written without gall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any mans person. And so I bid thee farewell in Christ.
