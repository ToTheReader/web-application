   <head>TO THE RIGHT WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and honorable gentleman sir Walter Raleigh knight, seneschall of the <hi>duchies of Cornewall and Excester, and lord warden of the</hi> stannaries in Deuon and Cornewall: Iohn Hooker <hi>wisheth a long, a happie, and a prosperous life, with the</hi> increase of honour.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong all the infinit good blessings, right honorable, which the Lord God hath bestowed vpon vs, I thinke none more expedient and necessarie, than the vse and knowledge of histories and chronicles: which are the most assured registers of the innumerable benefits and commodities, which haue and dailie doo grow to the church of God, and to the ciuill gouernment through out all nations. The vse of them began and was receiued euen from the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <note place="margin">The first vse of histories.</note> and immediatlie vpon the dispersing of the sonnes of Adam through out the world: for they were no sooner diuided into seuerall nations, but they did (as Cicero saith) make choise of some one man among themselues, who surpassed the rest in wisedome, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderstanding, <hi>Ad quem confugiebant.</hi> These kind of men <note place="margin">The first chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nographers.</note> for the most part in those daies were preests and philosophers, and for their great knowledge, wisedome and credit, had the charge to commend to their posteritie such notable and good acts as were woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the memorie. And as all other nations had such men, so the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Ilands in the great Ocean had the like. For Britaine, now conteining England, Scotland and Wales, had <note place="margin">The first chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nographers in England and Ireland.</note> their Druides and Bardos, and Ireland had their Odalies or Rimers, who being verie wise men &amp; of great credit, did deliuer all their saiengs in meeter, and were therefore called Poets. And these for the better alluring of the people to attention, and to frame them to the knowledge of vertue, did vse to sing with an instrument such les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and instructions as they were woont to giue, whether it were concerning manners and common conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, <note place="margin">Poets were the first chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nographers in Britaine.</note> or matters of policie and gouernment, or of prowesse and martiall affaires, or of the gests of their ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, or of anie other thing thought meet to be learned and woorthie the knowledge, by which meanes they made men the more apt, readie, and willing to applie themselues to vertue and to a commendable course of life, both concerning God how he was to be honored, the magistrate how he was to be obeied, &amp; the common soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie how it was to be conserued; and finallie how the whole course of mans life was to be ordered and directed. <note place="margin">The definition of an historie. <hi>Cicero de oratore.</hi>
      </note> These and manie other like commodities when Cicero had considered, did grow by these means, which is the verie substance of an historie: he described the same to be the witnesse of time, the light of truth, the life of memorie, and the mistresse of life: willing and aduising euerie man at all times and in all matters to haue their recourse to the same, and to be well exercised in the knowledge thereof, bicause the things past are set downe therin, and by them a man may learne what to doo in the life to come. For as the wise man saith, There is nothing <note place="margin">Ecclesiast. 1. 3.</note> new vnder the sunne: for the thing which is now hath beene, and by the things past we are taught the things to come. And so saith Augustine: <hi>Historia magis vel certè non minùs praenunciandis futuris, quàm enunciandis</hi>
      <note place="margin">August. de ciuit. Dei. Chronica Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionis. Thucidides.</note>
      <hi>praeteritis inuenitur intenta:</hi> Histories doo teach and aduertise vs as well of the things to come, as of the things past: and the knowledge thereof is so no necessarie that Melancthon would haue no man to be vnlearned in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, bicause <hi>Sine qua nulla in re quispiam lucem habet.</hi> And Thucidides the old ancient historiographer of Grecia would that euerie man should haue about him a booke of histories, as a thing most necessarie for him in all matters whatsoeuer: and this did he draw and learne (as it should seeme) from Moses, who when he had faithfullie and diligentlie written and set downe the whole course of the world, the woonderfull works of God, and all the most necessarie precepts and rules for mans life, either concerning matters of religion or causes of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill policies, or of common societie: then he and Iosua assembling all the people togither, did deliuer vnto them the whole Pentatychon of Moses to be dailie read &amp; taught, with a commandement that they should neuer haue <note place="margin">Deutero. 5. Iosue. 1.</note> that booke out of their hands, but to haue alwaies their continuall recourse to them, as well for their life, as also for their direction in all their causes. Which thing they did most diligentlie obserue and keepe, and not onelie in matters of religion, but in all doubtfull matters, as to the most true oracles, they would make their recourse for their full resolutions. As the enimies of Iehuda, when they saw the prosperous successe of the building of the temple in the times of Ezras and Nehemias, and they much maligning the same, made sute to king Artaxerxes <note place="margin">1. Esdras. 4. Nehemias.</note> that he would reuoke the decree which king Cyrus had made vnto the Iewes, licencing them to build the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, alledging manie great and sundrie matters against them. Wherevpon the king commanded the chronicles to be searched, whether it were true that had beene informed against them. Likewise when Hamon had gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouslie <note place="margin">Esther. 6.</note> complained vnto king Ahasuerus against Mardocheus and the Iewes, charging them with sundrie hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offenses worthie death, the king commanded the chronicles to be searched. Also when Paule and Sylas <note place="margin">Acts. 17.</note> first preached the gospell at Thessalonica and Baerea, a doctrine then accompted strange and new, they searched and examined the books <hi>Num haec ita se haberent.</hi> For as they found things there recorded, so gaue they credit, and by the same they did proceed in the like. For it was a common thing among the Romans, that not onelie
<pb facs="61"/>
they would make recourse in all doubtfull matters to their owne annales: but what so euer they sound in the like in anie other nation or commonwealth, which might further them in anie thing touching their owne affaires, they would draw the same into an example for themselues to follow, which was no small benefit to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
   <p>Likewise Alexander the great, notwithstanding he were brought vp in all good letters vnder Aristotle, yet <note place="margin">Alexander.</note> when he was to inlarge his empire, he gaue himselfe to the diligent reading of Homer, the most exact chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher of the Troian wars: and so he esteemed that booke, that in the daie time he caried it about him, and in the night time he laid it vnder his beds head; and at all times conuenient he would be reading of it, and in the end was so perfect therein, that he could verbatim repeat the whole without booke; the stratagems, the policies, and the manie deuises vsed in those warres he practised in his owne warres, which stood him in great steed. Iulius Caesar also in his wars searched the ancient bookes and histories of the citie of Rome: and did not onelie thereby <note place="margin">Iulius Caesar.</note> draw a paterne for his owne direction, both for his ciuill and his martiall affaires: but also, he being then the greatest monarch of all the world, thought it not preiudiciall to his imperiall estate and maiestie, to commend vnder his owne hand writing vnto his posteritie, the historie of his owne age and dooings. Manie like princes hath England bred, who haue bin verie carefull, that the memoriall of the good things doone in their times should <note place="margin">Mat. Parisiens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>.</note> be commended to their posteritie, to follow in the like. And therefore euerie king for the course of sundrie hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of yeares, was woont to reteine and keepe some wise, learned, and faithfull scribes, who should collect and record the things doone in euerie their seuerall times, and all which as time and course of yeares did serue, were published; and what great good benefits haue growne thereby to this present age, and like to serue to the future time, all the world maie easilie see and iudge. For this I dare boldlie saie and affirme: No realme, no nation, no state, nor commonwealth throughout all Europa, can yeeld more nor so manie profitable lawes, directions, rules, examples &amp; discourses, either in matters of religion, or of ciuill gouernment, or of martiall affairs, than doo the histories of this little Isle of Britaine or England. I would to God I might or were able to saie the like, or the halfe like of Ireland, a countrie, the more barren of good things, the more replenished with actions of bloud, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and lothsome outrages; which to anie good reader are greeuous &amp; irkesome to be read &amp; considered, much <note place="margin">Ireland yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech small matter for an historie.</note> more for anie man to pen and set downe in writing, and to reduce into an historie. Which hath beene some cause whie I was alienated and vtterlie discouraged to intermedle therein: for being earnestlie requested, by reason of my some acquaintance with the maners and conditions of that nation during my short abode therein, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the historie of that land, from the death of king Henrie the eight vnto these presents, which hitherto hath not beene touched; I found no matter of an historie woorthie to be recorded: but rather a tragedie of cruelties to be abhorred, and no historie of good things to be followed: and therefore I gaue the matter ouer, and was fullie resolued not at all to haue intermedled therewith. Neuerthelesse, being againe verie earnestlie requested, and no excuse neither of my age, nor of my often sicknesse, nor of my calling in the seruice of the commonwelth, nor of my small learning and skill, sufficient to compas such a matter, could be accepted: then (but with an euill will) I entred into it, and the more I bethought my selfe of the matter, the more I began to consider, and at length to behold the great and woonderous workes of God, both of his seuere iudgement against traitors, rebels, and disobedient; and of his mercie and louing kindnesse vpon the obedient and dutifull. Whereof, though there be <note place="margin">The iustice of God against rebels.</note> infinite examples both in the sacred histories and humane chronicles: yet I find none more apparant and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, nor more fit for vs, and for this our time and age, than the histories of our owne nation, which yeeld vnto vs most infinite examples, how yoong princes rebelling against the kings their fathers, noble men against their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereignes, and the commons against the kings and rulers, some by the mightie hand of God swallowed vp in the <note place="margin">Grafton, Holinshed, Polydore, in Hen. 2. Edw. 2.</note> seas, some deuoured with the swoord, some by martiall and some by ciuill lawes executed to death: and few or none haue escaped vnpunished. But of all others, none to be compared to this tragicall discourse of Ireland, and to the most vnnaturall wars of the Desmonds against hir sacred maiestie. Whose disobedience the Lord hath in iustice so seuerelie punished and reuenged, as the like hath not in our age beene seene nor knowne; which albeit somewhat at large it be set downe in the historie, yet breefelie and in effect is as followeth.</p>
   <p>The earle of Desmond, named Girald Fitzgirald, was descended of a yoonger house of the Giraldines of Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare, and both of them descended from one and the same ancestor Girald of Windsor, a noble gentleman of Normandie; who after his arriuall into England, trauelled into Wales, and there maried the ladie Nesta daughter to the great Roesius prince of south Wales, and by hir among others had issue Moris Fitzgirald, ancestor to these the foresaid Giraldines; and he being assistant to Dermon mac Morogh king of Leinster in Ireland, was one of the cheefest and most principall seruitors in the conquest, or rather one of the conquerors of that land vnder king Henrie the second. The issue and ofspring of this Moris as they were honourable in blood, so they were no lesse honorable in all their actions: they being verie famous for their good gifts of the mind, in wisedome and policie in their ciuill gouernment, and renowmed for their valiantnesse and prowesse in martiall affaires, in both which they had well tried themselues, and therefore manie times they had the cheefe gouernment of the whole realme, being sometime lord iustices, somtime lord lieutenants, and sometime lord deputies of the whole land: and for their truth and fidelitie were aduanced to honor. For Thomas Fitzgirald being the elder house, was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated earle of Kildare in the ninth yeare of king Edward the second, in the yeare one thousand three hundred and fifteene. And in the beginning of king Edward the third his reigne, in the yeare one thousand three hundred twentie and seuen, Moris Fitzthomas a yoonger brother of that house was created earle of Desmond. And from thense as before, they continued verie honourable, dutifull &amp; faithfull subiects, for the course of sundrie hundreds of yeares: vntill that this brainesicke and breakedanse Girald of Desmond, and his brethren, alies, and complic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>s, forgetting the honour of his house, and forsaking their faith, dutie and alegiance, did breake into treasons, and shewed themselues open enimies, traitors and rebels, vsing all maner of hostilities and outrages, to the impeach of hir most sacred maiestie, and the destruction of the commonwelth: the price whereof in the end he paied with his and their own bloods, to the vtter destruction of themselues and that whole familie, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Sir Iames of Desmond ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken &amp; hanged.

For first the earle himselfe, the cheefe of his familie, after his long repast in his traitorous follies, was driuen in the end to all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and penuries, and at the last taken in an old cotage, and his head was cut off and sent to London, and there set vpon London bridge, and his lands and inheritance confiscated and discontinued from his house and name for euer. Sir Iames one of his yoonger brethren, in taking of a preie, was taken and made a preie; he was han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as a theefe, quartered as a traitor, and his head and quarters dispersed and set vpon the gates and wals of the citie of Corke. Sir Iohn of Desmond, an other of his yoonger brethren, and next to himselfe the cheefe ringlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this rebellion, was taken, his head cut off and set vpon the castell of Dublin, and his bodie hanged by the heeles at Corke. His onelie sonne and heire being wholie disinherited, is prisoner in the Tower of London. His ladie and wife destituted of all honour and liuings, leadeth a dolefull &amp; a miserable life. His capteins, soldiers, and men of warre, put all for the most part to the swoord. The popes two prelats and nuncios, the one slaine in the field, and the other died most miserablie in the woods. The Italians and strangers few or none left aliue to returne to aduertise of their successe vnto their holie father. The common people such as escaped the swoord, all for the most part are perished with famine, or fled the countrie. The land it selfe being verie fertile, is waxed baren, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nor corne nor fruits; the pastures without cattell, and the aire without fowles, and the whole prouince for the most part desolate and vnhabited, sauing townes and cities: and finallie, nothing there to be seene but mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and desolation.</p>

A notable and a rare example of Gods iust iudgement and seuere punishment, vpon all such as doo resist and rebell against the higher powers and his annointed: which is so greeuous an offense in his sight, that next to the capitall offenses against the first table, this is accounted the greatest and in the highest degree. For as it is written, Who resisteth against the higher power, resisteth against Gods ordinances, and he shall receiue iudgement. And the Lord shall root him from out of the face of the earth that shall blaspheme his gods, and curseth the prince of <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> the people. Euen as of the contrarie, when the people liue in all subiection, humblenesse, and obedience, the Lord defendeth and keepeth them, and with his manifold blessings prospereth them; as hir maiesties good subiects <note place="margin">The prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the English pale.</note> dwelling within the English pale, and inhabiting within hir cities and townes can witnesse. They sow and till the land, and doo reape the fruits. Their fields are full of sheepe, and they are clothed with the wooll. Their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures are full of cattell, and they inioie them. Their cities and townes are well inhabited, and they liue in safetie. All things go well with them, and peace and plentie resteth in their houses. Two notable examples (I saie) and woorthie to be throughlie obserued; the one of Gods iust iudgement against the rebels and traitors, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercie and loue towards the obedient and dutifull subiect. Which examples the later they are, the more should they imprint in vs an inward affection and an vndoubted resolution, to yeeld to the superiours all dutie and obedience: and by the examples of the rebels, to shun as a pestilence all disobedience and rebellion; least in dooing the like, we doo receiue the like iust iudgements with them. Let therefore the examples of the elders be sufficient persuasions and instructions to the posteritie, to follow that which is good, and to eschew that which is euill. For albeit good counsell of our friends, and conferences with the good men, maie much preuaile with vs, yet none can so much preuaile nor be of such vertue and effect, as the examples of our ancestors, and the actions of our forefathers when they be laid before vs: <hi>Magis enim exemplis potest persuaderi, quàm argumentis extorqueri.</hi>

And for as much as such is the value and vertue of the footsteps of our forefathers, I trust it shall not be offensiue vnto you, that I doo a little digresse and speake somewhat of your selfe and of your ancestors; who the more honourable they were in their times, the greater cause haue you to looke into the same: that what in some of your later forefathers was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopited, maie not in you be consepulted, but rouzed and raised vnto his former and pristinat state. And for as much as I am somewhat acquainted in their descents, let me make bold with you to laie the same downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you.</p>
   <p>There were sundrie of your ancestors by the name of Raleigh, who were of great account &amp; nobilitie, and alied as well to the Courtneis earls of Deuon, as to other houses of great honour &amp; nobilitie, &amp; in sundrie succeeding <note place="margin">The descent of the lord warden.</note> descents were honoured with the degree of knighthood. One of them being your ancestor in the directest line, was named sir Iohn de Raleigh, who then dwelled in the house of Furdell in Deuon, an ancient house of your ancestors, and of their ancient inheritance: and which at these presents is in the possession of your eldest brother. This knight maried the daughter and heire to sir Roger D'amerei, or de Amerei, whome our English chronicles doo name lord de Amereie, who was a noble man and of great linage, and descended of the earls de Amereie in Britaine, and alied to the earls of Montfort in the same duchie and prouince. This man being come ouer into England, did serue in the court, and by the good pleasure of God and the good liking of the king he maried the ladie Elisabeth, the third sister and coheire to the noble Gilbert earle of Clare and of Glocester, who was slaine in the battell of Banokesborough in Scotland, in the time of king Edward the second. This earle died sans issue, he being the sonne and the said ladie Elisabeth the daughter to Gilbert de Clare earle of Glocester, by his wife the ladie Iane de Acres or Acon, daughter to king Edward the first. This Gilbert descended of Robert earle of Glocester, sonne to king Henrie the first, and of his wife the ladie Mawd, daughter and heire to Robert Fitzha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, lord of Astrouill in Normandie, coosen to the Conqueror, knight of the priuie chamber to king William Rufus, and lord of the lordship of Glamorgan in Wales. So that your ancestor sir Iohn de Raleigh married the daughter of de Amerie, Damereie of Clare, Clare of Edward the first, and which Clare by his father descended of king Henrie the first. And in like maner by your mother you maie be deriued out of the same house. These all were men of great honour and nobilitie, and whose vertues are highlie recorded sparsim in the chronicles of England; some greatlie commended for their wisedomes and deepe iudgements in matters of counsell, some likewise much praised for their prowesse &amp; valiantnesse in martiall affaires, and manie of them honored for both.</p>
   <p>But yet as nothing is permanent in this life, and all things variable vnder the sunne, and time hath deuoured and consumed the greatest men and the mightiest monarchs, and most noble commonwealths in the world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old countrie saieng; Be the daie neuer so long, yet at length it will ring to euensong: so this hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <note place="margin">All things haue an end.</note> race, though for so manie descents, and for the course of so manie yeares it continued in great honor, nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and reputation, yet in processe of time the honour became to be of worship (neuerthelesse alied alwaies and matched in houses of great honour and nobilitie) and so euer since possessed by knights of your owne name, vntill by little and little the honour and estimation of your noble and worthie ancestors seemed at length to be buried in obliuion, and as it were extinguished and to be vtterlie forgotten as though it had neuer beene. And now when all was past anie hope and vnremembred to the world, it hath pleased God to raise the same euen as it were from the dead, and to looke vpon you the yoongest sonne of manie, as he did vpon Ioseph, one of the yoongest sonnes of Iacob; and in you hath left a hope to restore the decaied house of your sept and familie. He hath brought you into the good fauour of your prince, who hath pleased to reward and honour in you the approoued faithfull seruice of your late ancestors and kindered deceassed, and inclined hir princelie hart, conceiuing a great hope of your owne sufficiencie and abilitie to restore you againe, being the last branch remaining of so manie noble and famous houses descended. And whereof commeth this, that the Lord hath thus blessed you, and so bountifullie hath dealt with you? but onelie (as the wise man saith) <hi>Vt noscas in omni virtute omnibus prodesse,</hi> and that you should be beneficiall and profitable to all men. And therefore in all our actions, <hi>Semper aliquid ad communem v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitatem</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cicero de offic.</note>
      <hi>est afferendum:</hi> for we are not borne to our selues alone, but the prince, the countrie, the parents, freends, wiues, children and familie, euerie of them doo claime an interest in vs, and to euerie of them we must be benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall: otherwise we doo degenerate from that communitie and societie, which by such offices by vs is to be conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; doo become most vnprofitable: <hi>Nam inutilis prorsus est, qui nullam vtilitatem reipublicae ac communi socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati possit afferre,</hi> and euerie such man, as a member vnprofitable is to be cut off. And as the bee is no longer suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> to haue a place in the hiue, than whiles he worketh; no more is that man to haue place in the publike weale than whiles he dooth some good therein, bicause through idlenesse they doo not onelie no good, but as Cato saith, <note place="margin">
         <hi>Cato.</hi> Idlers ought not to haue place in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> they doo euill: <hi>Nihil agendo homines male agere discunt.</hi> Idlenesse therefore the mother of all wickednesse, and idlers the sonnes of so bad a mother, are vtterlie to be exiled and expelled out of all well gouerned common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales; and they onelie to be fostered, nourished and cherished, who as they are borne to the countrie, so if they doo good and be beneficiall to the same.</p>
   <p>And how great your care hath beene heerein, the course of your life hitherto dooth manifest it. For after that you had seasoned your primer yeares at Oxford in knowledge and learning, a good ground and a sure foundation to build therevpon all your good actions, you trauelled into France, and spent there a good part of your youth in the warres and martiall seruices. And hauing some sufficient knowledge and experience therein, then after your returne from thense, to the end you might euerie waie be able to serue your prince and commonweale, you were desirous to be acquainted in maritimall affaires. Then you, togither with your brother sir Humfreie Gilbert, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled the seas, for the search of such countries, as which if they had beene then discouered, infinit commodities in
<pb facs="63"/>
sundrie respects would haue insued, and whereof there was no doubt, if the fleet then accompanieng you, had according to appointment followed you, or your selfe had escaped the dangerous sea fight, when manie of your companie were slaine, and your ships therewith also sore battered and disabled. And albeit this hard begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (after which followed the death of the said woorthie knight your brother) was a matter sufficient to haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged a man of a right good stomach and value from anie like seas attempts; yet you, more respecting the good ends, wherevnto you leuelled your line for the good of your countrie, did not giue ouer, vntill you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered a land, and had made a plantation of the people of your owne English nation in <hi>Virginia,</hi> the first Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish colonie that euer was there planted, to the no little derogation of the glorie of the Spaniards, &amp; an impeach to their vaunts; who bicause with all cruell immanitie, contrarie to all naturall humanitie, they subdued a naked and a yeelding people, whom they sought for gaine and not for anie religion or plantation of a commonwelth, ouer whome to satisfie their most greedie and insatiable couetousnesse, did most cruellie tyrannize, and most tyrannicallie and against the course of all humane nature did scorch and rost them to death, as by their owne hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories dooth appeare. These (I saie) doo brag and vaunt, that they onelie haue drawne strange nations and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne people to the obedience of their kings, to the knowledge of christianitie, and to the inriching of their countrie, and thereby doo claime the honor to be due to themselues onelie and alone. But if these your actions were well looked into, with such due consideration as apperteineth, it shall be found much more honorable in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie respects, for the aduancement of the name of God, the honour of the prince, and the benefit of the common wealth. For what can be more pleasant to God, than to gaine and reduce in all christianlike manner, a lost people to the knowledge of the gospell, and a true christian religion, than which cannot be a more pleasant and a sweet sacrifice, and a more acceptable seruice before God? And what can be more honorable to princes, than to inlarge the bounds of their kingdoms without iniurie, wrong, &amp; bloudshed; and to frame them from a sauage life to a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill gouernment, neither of which the Spaniards in their conquests haue performed? And what can be more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to a common weale, than to haue a nation and a kingdome to transferre vnto the superfluous multitude of frutelesse and idle people (heere at home dailie increasing) to trauell, conquer, and manure another land, which by the due intercourses to be deuised, may and will yeeld infinit commodities? And how well you doo deserue euerie waie in following so honourable a course, not we our selues onelie can witnesse, but strange nations also doo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you for the same: as dooth appeare by the epistle of <hi>Bassimerus</hi> of France, to the historie of <hi>Florida:</hi> and by <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> a citizen of Rome in his epistle to his booke intituled <hi>Cullombeados.</hi> It is well knowne, that it had beene no lesse easie for you, than for such as haue beene aduanced by kings, to haue builded great houses, purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed large circuits, and to haue vsed the fruits of princes fauours, as most men in all former and present ages haue doone; had you not preferred the generall honour and commoditie of your prince and countrie before all priuat gaine and commoditie: wherby you haue beene rather a seruant than a commander to your owne fortune. And no doubt the cause being so good, and the attempt so honorable, but that God will increase your talent, and blesse your dooings, and euerie good man will commend and further the same. And albeit the more noble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises a man shall take in hand, the more aduersaries he shall haue to depraue and hinder the same: yet I am persuaded, as no good man shall haue iust cause, so there is none so much carried with a corrupt mind, nor so enuious of his countries honour, nor so bent against you, that he will derogate the praise and honour due to so worthie an enterprise; and that so much the sooner, bicause you haue indured so manie crosses, and haue through so much enuiengs and misfortunes perseuered in your attempts, which no doubt shall at last by you be performed when it shall please him, who hath made you an instrument of so worthie a worke. And by how much the more God hath pleased thus to blesse you, so much the more are you bound to be thankefull vnto him, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the same to proceed from his grace and mercie towards you. Giue me leaue therefore (I praie you) to be bold with you, not onelie to put you in mind hereof, but also to remember you, how it hath pleased God to bring you into the fauour of your prince and souereigne: who besides hir great fauour towards you manie waies, she hath also laid vpon you the charge of a gouernement in your owne countrie, where you are to command ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie people by your honourable office of the stannarie, and where you are both a iudge and chancellor, to rule in iustice and to iudge in equitie. Wherin you are so much the more to be circumspect and wise, bicause vpon your iudgement (and such as you shall appoint to be vnder you) the determinations of all their causes dooth rest and depend, knowing that a hard iudgement abideth for such as be in authoritie, if they iudge not vprightlie, and doo not yeeld iustice to euerie man indifferentlie. Be you therefore carefull in this respect, that you be well reported for your vpright dealings, both herein, &amp; in euerie of all your other actions to all men. Be you a patterne of vertue, &amp; an example of true nobilitie, which is grounded &amp; hath hir foundation vpon vertue, for as the poet saith, <hi>Ex vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute nobilitas nascitur, non ex nobilitate virtus: virtus sola nobilitat, nō caro nec sanguis.</hi> And therfore saith Demost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes; <note place="margin">Palingenius. Demosthenes.</note> If thou draw thy descent &amp; pedegree euen from Iupiter himselfe, yet if thou be not vertuous, iust &amp; good, <hi>Ignobilis mihi videris;</hi> In my opinion thou art no gentleman. It is a noble thing to be borne of noble ancestors (as Aristotle saith) but his nobilitie faileth, when his ancestors vertues in him faileth, <hi>Hic enim verè nobilis est cēsendus, cui non aliena sed sua virtus ad gloriam opitulatur.</hi> Your ancestors were verie ancient, and men of great nobilitie, beneficiall to their princes and countrie manie &amp; sundrie waies. And as in nature you are descended from them, so it hath pleased God to blesse you with knowledge in learning, with skill of warlike seruice, and in experience in maritimall causes, and besides hath placed you among the nobles, and in the good grace and fauour of your prince. Wherefore you are so much the more to be carefull to restore the house of your decaied forefathers to their ancient honor and nobilitie, which in this later age hath beene obscured, abiding the time by you to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to their first and primer state: which you are not onelie taught by their old and good examples, but also by the ensignes of their and your nobilitie. For the fusils, being an instrument of trauell and labour, doo aduertise <note place="margin">Fusils, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note> you, that yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap> are one of the sonnes of Adam, borne to walke in a vocation, and therein to be a profitable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the church of God, and in maintenance of the common societie: which when you behold and looke vpon, you must so endeuour your selfe, euen as Agathocles king of Syracusa, whose cupbords, though they were well furnished with great store and varietie of rich plate, yet he thought not the same sufficientlie fraughted, vnlesse <note place="margin">Agathocles.</note> he had also his earthen pitchers and stone cups, in which he vsed to drinke, to teach &amp; remember him in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of his roialtie, to be mindfull of his origin estate and dutie.</p>
   <p>The white colour or siluer mettall dooth teach vnto you vertue, sinceritie &amp; godlinesse. For as siluer is a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent mettall, and next vnto gold excelling all others, and with which for the excellencie thereof, the Lord God <note place="margin">White colour.</note> would haue his tabernacle and his temple to be adorned and beautified with vessels and ornaments thereof; and as the white colour, if it be spotted and foule, dooth lose his grace: euen so it teacheth you to be a man of an honest and of a godlie conuersation, to lead a life in all vprightnesse, without reproch and disgrace: and that you should be seruiceable to God and your countrie in all good actions; and therewith also (which by the gulie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is meant) you be bold and valiant for the defense of your countrie, and for the safetie thereof to spend both <note place="margin">Gules.</note> life and goods, that you should be beneficiall to all men, hurtfull and iniurious to no man. And such kind of men were your ancestors, who for the same were beloued and honoured, and their names for euer registred in immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall fame and memorie. And so shall it be with you, if you doo the like, and follow their steps and examples, God shall blesse you, &amp; you shall prosper &amp; florish as did Ioseph; you shall be honored, as was Daniell; and you shall be in fauor before God &amp; man, as were your ancestors; the whole people shall speake good of you, the honour of your house shall be restored, &amp; your talent shall be augmented &amp; increased, &amp; all things shall go well with you. But to returne where we left. When I had waded as far as I could in the discourse of this historie, according to
<pb facs="64"/>
such instructions as partlie by my selfe, but more by other mens helps, I had collected and gathered; and thought to haue continued the same from the death of King Henrie the eight, vnto these presents: it came vnto my mind, and I thought it verie expedient, to make a new review of that, which by others had beene doone in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruall betweene <hi>Cambrensis</hi> and my dooings, wherein I found great paines had beene taken, and that the authors had well deserued great praises and commendations. And yet in this they were much to be blamed, that all of them were beholding vnto <hi>Giraldus,</hi> and not one of them would yeeld that curtesie either to publish his historie, <note place="margin">The ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse vnto <hi>Cambraensis.</hi>
      </note> or vsing the same to acknowledge it. For some misliking both method and phrase, framed it into another forme, and penned it in a more loftie stile; and vnder that colour haue attributed vnto themselues the honour and fruits of another mans doings. In which, their discourtesie was the more, because they iniured so noble and woorthie a personage. For <hi>Giraldus</hi> was a noble man by birth, he being the sonne vnto Mauricius, the sonne vnto <note place="margin">The genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of <hi>Giraldus.</hi>
      </note> Giraldus de Windsor, and to his wife the ladie Nesta, daughter to the great Roesius prince of south Wales. He was from his youth brought vp in learning, and prooued verie well learned in all good letters both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and likewise humane: and by profession he was a man of the clergie, and liued by the patrimonie of the church. He was chapleine to king Henrie the second, and to king Iohn his sonne, and both of them he atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their iorneis into Ireland, and at the request and commandement of the king the father, he wrot the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of this land according as what he saw and knew to be true. The more noble then that this man was by birth, the more reuerend in calling, the more painfull in trauels, and the better learned he was: euen so much the more is their fault, that will borrow of him and not acknowledge it, nor thinke themselues beholding vnto him. For as Plinie saith, <hi>Ingenui pudoris est, fateri per quos profecerimus;</hi> It is the part of a good nature not to be ashamed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and confesse by whom he is the better, and benefited. I know it hath beene an old vsage in all ages, and among all the ancient writers, both Graecians &amp; Latinists, that they would borrow of other mens writings, and inlarge their owne therewith: as Plato did of Socrates and Pythagoras, Aristotle out of Plato, Cicero of them both; and so likewise others: and these men would not onelie confesse the same, which was accounted to be some part of recompense, but also they accounted their owne dooings to be so much the better, as that they were confirmed by the authoritie of such wise, graue, and well learned men. The like reason might suffice to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade such in this later age, as which be so curious that they will not haue anie father, doctor, or anie other writer to be named nor alleaged in sermons, readings, prechings, or writings; and yet they will not sticke to vse &amp; recite verbatim, whole sentences, yea &amp; whole pages out of other mens writings, and attribute the same to themselues, as of their owne inuention. A great fault and a point of ingratitude, not allowed among the gentiles: much lesse should it be so among christians, especiallie among them of the highest profession, <hi>Non profiteri per quos profece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But leauing euerie man to himselfe, for as much as all histories are to be doone with all sinceritie &amp; truth, which in this cannot be so well doone, vnlesse the first writer and author of this historie of Ireland haue his place: I haue thought good to publish and set foorth <hi>Giraldus</hi> his owne workes as they are, which, leauing all other translations, I haue as faithfullie translated as the historie requireth, and in as fit an English phrase as is most meete and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for the reader. And because the same so long hense written, hath sundrie obscure things, which doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire some further opening, for the better vnderstanding of the reader; I haue subnected and added to euerie chapter (so requiring) such notes and obseruations, as he shall be therewith the better instructed and satisfied. This thing thus by me doone, together with so much as I my selfe haue penned from the death of king Henrie the eight vnto these presents: which although it maie seeme to be verie imperfect, and to want that fulnesse as the course of so manie yeares might affoord; or that some things maie be misreported and set downe, otherwise than the truth is, or that some things maie be mistaken, &amp;c: let this be imputed vnto them, through whose default the same is so befallen; for manie things were promised and little performed; and some, who had and haue an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in the matter, haue refused and would doo nothing. But for my selfe, according to such instructions and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections as are come to my hands, I haue after the method and nature of an historie, most sincerelie and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie set downe what is materiall and woorthie the writing. And for as much as your selfe was a partie and a dooer in some part of the Desmonds wars, in which you were a painfull and a faithfull seruitor, and therefore can giue some report and testimonie to this discourse, and also for the loue and honour which I doo owe and beare vnto you, I thought it my part and dutie to offer and present, and presentlie in most humble maner I doo offer and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the same vnto your good fauour and protection. And albeit the thing it selfe be verie slender, and too farre an inferior present to be offred to one of your estate and calling; yet let your courtesie couer that, and accept my good will, which as time and occasion hereafter shall serue, I shall &amp; will be most willing (as your lordships most deuout and assured) to supplie in all the good seruices I maie or shall be able to doo at your commandement. The Lord blesse you and multiplie your daies, to the honor of God, the good seruice of hir maiestie, the benefit of the commonwelth, the comfort of your friends, and to your owne increase in all honour.</p>
