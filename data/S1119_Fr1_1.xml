   <head>TO THE WORLDS BLINDE IVDGEMENT, that wants a paire of Spectacles with a true sight.</head>
   <l>TRuth doth auouch it, and experience sayes,</l>
   <l>Time serues vs with his worst of wicked dayes,</l>
   <l>The world, euen like a garment waxeth old▪</l>
   <l>Selfe-loue is hot, charitie deadly cold.</l>
   <l>The notes we haue to know our good men by</l>
   <l>(As corrupt Iudgement deemes with errours eye)</l>
   <l>Are wealth, and words, no matter how they liue,</l>
   <l>Hee's a good man, that can good speeches giue,</l>
   <l>And talke of Vertue, and Religious zeale,</l>
   <l>Although in deeds he like a Diuell deale.</l>
   <l>Another sort there are, the world cals best,</l>
   <l>Onely because they are of wealth possest:</l>
   <l>Their gold and siluer gildeth them so well,</l>
   <l>They are the best in Parish where they dwell:</l>
   <l>And so was <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>iues,</hi> out of question too,</l>
   <l>Most richly magnified with much adoe,</l>
   <l>Vntill the end tryes truth, at dying day,</l>
   <l>When all the worlds esteemed things decay,</l>
   <pb facs="2"/>
   <pb facs="2"/>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>Diuels with Gluttons soule did merry make,</l>
   <l>Angels, poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> to glory take.</l>
   <l>Blinde iudging world, sencelesse in censure th'art,</l>
   <l>With greatnesse, not with goodnes taking part:</l>
   <l>Tell me, where's he that for true Vertues sake,</l>
   <l>The poore Iust man, will his companion make?</l>
   <l>Where's he that is the greatest finde-fault knowne,</l>
   <l>Reproues his brothers misse, and mends his owne?</l>
   <l>Where's he that is to such a patience growne,</l>
   <l>That he will put vp wrong, and offer none?</l>
   <l>What's he that now-a-daies doth good for ill,</l>
   <l>And would doe hurt to no man by his will?</l>
   <l>Point out the man, breathing beneath the Sunne,</l>
   <l>That doth, as to himselfe he would haue done.</l>
   <l>What's he as willing will repay a Debt,</l>
   <l>As he was ready trusted goods to get?</l>
   <l>Who will not flatter Greatnesse now-a-daies,</l>
   <l>In all the errours of their gracelesse wayes?</l>
   <l>Who will in losses on his God depend,</l>
   <l>And take that patiently the Lord doth send?</l>
   <l>Who will be weary to be monies slaue,</l>
   <l>And hauing wealth, confesse, inough I haue?</l>
   <l>Who will not catch (if by his craft he can,)</l>
   <l>The meanes, and liuing from another man?</l>
   <l>What's he that will his Couenant fulfill,</l>
   <l>As firme by promise, as by Bond or Bill?</l>
   <l>Where's he will lend of superfluitie,</l>
   <l>Without the Vsurers gratuitie?</l>
   <l>Who is it that of faithfull true intent,</l>
   <l>Maintaines the poore, defends the Innocent?</l>
   <l>Sure if <hi>Diogenes</hi> did liue againe,</l>
   <l>He might burne day, as once he did, in vaine,</l>
