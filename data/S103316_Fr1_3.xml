   </p>
   <p>GOD giueth pleasaunt peace, fyrme leages, and carefull Princes at certayne times and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. For what cause that men may tumble, and wallow in fylthye pleasure? nothinge lesse. But rather that mariges, procration, and educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Children, may bee as it were a frye or nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerye for his Churche: and that the doctrine of GODS essence and will, reuealed by his sonne may bee publyshed farre and nigh, that true discipline and Christian conuersation may bee effectuallye practised and executed.</p>
   <p>If wee abuse then, this diuine benefyt of peace, contemninge the knowledge of God and neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttnge good lyfe commaunded in his woorde: this blessynge can not bee durable with vs: and those plagues which GOD hath now a longe tyme withdrawne from vs wyll bee acquited at the last, with heauy and intollerable sharpnesse when hee beginneth to punish.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>But as our blessynges at home ought not to breede in vs senssesse securitie: so the forraigue plagues and almost oppression, of the Churche, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade <note place="margin" type="runSum">Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amōgst these world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly calamy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> should not abashe or make vs shrinke.

   <p>Men vse deepe inquysitions and carefull cogyta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where the Churche shall remayne amonge these ruines of kingdomes, confusion of opinions and infynit domesticall calamyties which we bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde with great, dolor and griefe. The Prophet caseth this carefulnes saying that the Church shal remayne, in the bosome and wombe of God: that is to say, that he wil alwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es defend those places y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> harbour &amp; intertaine his church. But amongst the rest, it is chiefly to be obserued that the Church of <note place="margin">Esa. 11.</note> God is compared to a sucking infant puttyng his hand in a serpents nest and Cokatrices denne, and playing with them. For as the litle babe sythinge amonge Serpences &amp; Cokatrices: neither vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth his daunger, neither is well defensed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those vencmous vipers: so the Church doth not throughly seethe crafty conuenticles, and lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng dennes of hir emiuties, and is assaulted with greater forces then she hath defenses visible: and yet she is myraculously and inuysibly preserued by the sonne of God the protector and defender therof. Whensoeuer therefore wee see our enimyes readye to deuour vs, and our selues destitute of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine helpe: then wee may most assurc our selues of Gods presence. If wee be exiled let vs not think that we are therefore abiectes or forsaken of God, or that wee wander alone. For the sonne of God marcheth before with an infinite company of chaste <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ngels: Christ Iesus is the Herbinger, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Warre shal not ouercōe Christes Church.</note> and will lotte out a conuement restinge place for his obedyent people.</p>
   <p>Blooddy war rageth presently throughout the whole worlde, and the crueltye of Tyrantes
<pb facs="6"/> increaseth euery where, wastinge and destroyinge many seruaunts of Christ. But they shall not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abollsh and vanquish the Church albeit they haue made many breaches in the wals, and seeme now ready to enter: for euen then wyll God shew his presence, to the confusion of <hi>Rabsaces</hi> and his <note place="margin">2. <hi>Reg. 19. Esa. 37. Esa.</hi> 31.</note> mighty army: which is lyuelye paynted out by the Prophet in this wise. <hi>Thus hath the Lorde spoken vnto mee. Like as the Lyon and Lyones vvhelp roreth vpon the pray that he hath gotten, and is not afraide though the multitude of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardes, crye out vpon him neither is abashed for all the heape of them: so shall the Lorde of hostes come dovvne from mount Syon and defende his Hill. Like as the birdes flutter about their nestes so shall the lorde of hostes, saue and deliuer Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem. Therefore O yee children of Israell tourne vnto him vvhom you haue ostentimes forsaken.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Let vs fyxe our eyes and hartes vpon these euy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent testymonies of Gods mighty presence &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of his Church in such sort that the gates of hell: that is to say the fearce assaultes, and subtyll vndermininges of diuels, and men shall not be able to prenayle against it.</p>
   <p>The Churche indeede is a lyttle tower or Oyle, yf you compare it with the warrelyke Castell of Sathan: but by meanes of hyr Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, shee sustayneth and beateth off the beseege and assauites of all hyr aduersaries.</p>
   <p>Neyther ought wee to thinke that the Churche <note place="margin" type="runSum">The godlye dye with ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes with dishonour.</note> shall at y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> last be destrcyed bicause many of hir mē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be dyuersely afflicted, and cruelly murdered.
