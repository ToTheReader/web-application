   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Very well remember, my welbeloued country mē, ye that are gouernours of families, that he was a wise Preacher, that sayde:
<note n="a" place="margin">Eccles. <hi>12.12.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>There is no ende in making many bookes.</hi> And that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny very good and excellent Catechismes are published in our English tongue: being not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very profitable for Christians, to exercise themselues in: but also most notable tokens of the Christian care and loue, of diuers learned and godly minded men, toward their neighbors and countrie. Yet haue I some good reasons (as I thinke) to put foorth this little booke of mine as a mite, in comparison of the greatest gifts of other men, who by their excellent workes, haue greatly replenished the Lords treasurie. First, because that I finde that the Lord in the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Church vseth the diuers gifts of
<pb facs="12"/>his seruants, to expresse his manifold wisedom. And as vnto men of diuers complexiōs and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, he hath giuen choise of meate and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of apparell: so, many bookes to one end are set foorth in diuers fashions and with a diuers gift, order and facilitie: that hee whome one booke sauoureth not, might yet like the taste of another. So it may bee, that I striuing to enter into the lowest place of the Church, which is the familie; and applying my selfe to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner sort, may happily finde a place to doe good vnto some, where books of greater excellencie, peraduenture are not entertained: and ioyning hands with my good brethren, who haue sorted themselues to the same standing place, may by ioynt working with them, peraduenture further their ioy, as they doe mine. Secondly, because I haue some experience in this order, that it may prepare them, which are hereby instructed, to haue their eyes open to other mens labours. And I am in great hope, that a discreet teacher shall finde by triall, that a childe of very tender yeres may be made able, through Gods blessing, with vnderstanding to giue a good reckoning of his faith, by the Scriptures. Moreouer, my purpose was not, curiously to set downe all points of doctrine, but especially those, which doe most neerely teach these two:
<note n="a" place="margin">Act. <hi>20.21.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and faith in Iesus Christ.</hi> And my desire was that these might be made to appeare
<pb facs="12"/>easie and familiar by the Scriptures.</p>
   <p>But aboue all other this moued mee most, that I might haue occasion to speake some things to the gouernours of the families, which doe very greatly affect my minde. Which is not to proue it their duties, to catechise their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or to describe the houshold gouernment, &amp; diuers such things which I know to be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently penned downe by others: but onely to lay before them, the great necessitie of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the great and honorable seruice, which a priuate man may doe, to God and his people, by this meanes. In doing whereof, I thought no better meane, then the setting foorth of an easie way, to doe the thing, to which I desire earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to perswade them.</p>
   <p>The necessitie will be seene,
<note place="margin">Necessitie to teach hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdes.</note> if they obserue with me two things, the time present, and the time likely to ensue. In the first they shall finde, that although wee haue had the Gospell, by the mercie and long suffering of God seuen and thirtie yeares, vnder the happie raigne of our most deare and gracious Soueraigne Ladie Queene Elizabeth, (who, I heartily pray our good God, may yet raigne many yeares ouer vs) there are to bee found so many that know not how they shall bee saued, or how they are iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, why they are called Christians, what is Christ in his person, and such like (which
<note n="b" place="margin">Hebr. <hi>6.1.2.</hi> Psalm. <hi>49.20.</hi>
      </note> eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginner and yongling in Christ ought to be
<pb facs="13"/>skilfull in;
<note place="margin">Lamentable ignorance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs.</note> and without the knowledge whereof a man is like a bruit beast) that I doe tremble to thinke, and am ashamed to vtter, and dare not commit to writing my knowledge herein. I haue had conference in some parishes with <hi>400.</hi> some, <hi>1000.</hi> some lesse, and haue made triall, and do make triall euery day, that I speake to any man, whom I knowe not, that I am asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished to thinke, that so many Christians in name, and baptized, should bee so ignorant and brutish, and so farre from being indeede, that which they delight to bee called. For I take it, that
<note n="c" place="margin">Galat. <hi>3.26.</hi>
      </note> faith maketh the being of a Christian, and these
<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. <hi>10.14.</hi>
      </note> who haue no knowledge cannot haue faith, which will then appeare,
<note n="e" place="margin">
         <hi>2.</hi> Thess <hi>1.8.</hi>
      </note> when Christ shall come in flaming fire, to render vengeance to them that do not know God. Therfore there is a great fault, whether it be in vs Ministers, or in you the masters of families, or in both, the Lord bee mercifull vnto vs, our danger is very great: for it is written,
<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. <hi>1.23.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>As they regarded not to know God, so God deliuered them vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a reprobate minde, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore it is a thing of necessitie, that such as keepe houses, should traine vp their people cōmitted to their charge,
<note place="margin">Many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters teach not.</note> in the knowledge of the Gospel. Againe, we that are Ministers, for the most part, are very vntidie for these workes, which might preuent this mischiefe.
<note n="b" place="margin">
         <hi>7.</hi> Tim. <hi>4.10.</hi>
      </note> Some imbracing this present world, and some being
<note n="c" place="margin">Math. <hi>15.14.</hi>
      </note> blind leaders of
<pb facs="13"/>the blinde. Therefore the masters of families looking not vnto this matter, the case is become lamentable. The time likely to ensue may bee very much iudged by the present.
<note place="margin">Coldnes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that God hath warned vs, to make more reuerent regard of his Gospell, by windes and vnseasonable weather, by diuers sicknesses, by the plague and dearth &amp; feare of the sword, not once nor twise within these fewe yeares: yet the great carelesnes and coldnes (that I say not contempt) of religion, may hereby appeare, that Atheisme, dronkennes, and other very great sinnes, are waxen bold and shameles, and he that feareth an oth, and taketh great paines to bee instructed in Christ Iesus, suffereth no small molestation. What may we then looke for? but as these former corrections, haue brought vs no one iot neerer to repentance, or loue of Gods word, so the Lord will yet stretch out his hand against vs. And what can we tell, that if other temporall plagues moue vs not, but that he will take away his word from an vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nation,
<note place="margin">We may seare the losse of the gospell.</note> and giue it to another that will bring foorth better fruites? If we that be Ministers ouerstip these things, how can they be repaired, but by the instruction of families. And many times when we take great paines, the backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the masters doth pull downe all that wee build. Therefore it is of great necessitie, that the gouernours of housholds should stirre vp
<pb facs="14"/>themselues to this duetie.</p>
   <p>Now the honorable seruice, which a priuate man may do to God and his Church,
<note place="margin">Teaching the familie hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable seruice to God.</note> appeareth in this; that such as traine their families in these good grounds, bring foorth an holy gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Church, and a ciuill nation to the Common-wealth; which doth not a little shewe it selfe to Gods glorie, and the praise of the Gospell, in our owne experience. Whereof the example of <hi>Ioshua</hi> and his familie, <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his souldiers, <hi>Abraham</hi> and his three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighteene, brought vp in his house, are as sufficiēt testimonies. How are the names of many priuate men and women for their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the Church, commended by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and registred to immortall fame and example of all professors,
<note place="margin">Priuate men and women may greatly further the Church.</note>
      <hi>Rom. 16.</hi> So that among many he acknowledgeth, that all the Churches of the Gentiles were to bee thankefull to one <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> his wife. And God doth so farre honour the house of
<note n="a" place="margin">Ierem. <hi>35.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Rechab,</hi> that he poynteth it out, and setteth it foorth, to be an euerlasting paterne, of the notable fruite of good gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of families. And as
<note n="b" place="margin">Exod. <hi>35.25.</hi>
      </note> women did worke diuers things for the tabernacle, in the daies of Moses: and as the
<note n="c" place="margin">
         <hi>1.</hi> King. <hi>5.</hi>
      </note> temple was not built, but by men of all sorts in the time of <hi>Salomon:</hi> and the
<note n="d" place="margin">Nehem. <hi>3.</hi>
      </note> walles of Ierusalem vnder the guiding of <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> So may priuate men very much further the building of the spirituall temple,
<pb facs="14"/>which is the congregation of Christ.
<note place="margin">The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches spring out of instructed families.</note> And as out of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacobs house, sprang forth the Churches of the Iewes: so the glorious congregations of the Gentiles, began in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: For if seruants well nurtured
<note n="e" place="margin">Tit. <hi>2.10.</hi>
      </note> may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne the doctrine of God our Sauiour in all thinges: and
<note n="f" place="margin">
         <hi>1.</hi> Pet. <hi>3.1.</hi>
      </note> husbands obeying not the worde, may without the word be wonne, by the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the wiues: how much more may the master of the familie doe vnto God and his Church honorable seruice? not only by sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his house by the word of faith; but also by hauing alwaies in a readines, very notable matter to further the building of Gods dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place. Which thing is auouched to thee by
<note n="g" place="margin">
         <hi>2.</hi> Tim. <hi>1.5.</hi> and <hi>3.15.</hi> with Act. <hi>16.1.</hi>
      </note> young <hi>Timotheus,</hi> who being brought vp in the holy Scriptures from a childe, vnder his faithfull grandmother <hi>Lois,</hi> and his mother <hi>Eunice,</hi> when he was yet a very young man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a companion of the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in that great and waightie worke of planting Churches. And
<note n="h" place="margin">Act. <hi>18.24.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Apollos</hi> cōfirmeth the same, who being an eloquent man and mightie in the Scriptures, was yet more perfectly instructed in the way of God, by the house of a craftsman: by whom not onely they which beleeued thorow grace, were very much holpen; but also the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries of Christ were mightily confuted by the Scriptures.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, I pray you to marke diligently,
<pb facs="15"/>how that the disorder of one priuate familie,
<note place="margin">One familie well or ill or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, may saue or destroy both Church &amp; Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> namely, of one

      </note>
      <hi>Micah</hi> of Ephraim, was an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that Idolatrie did spread thorowe the whole tribe of <hi>Dan:</hi> and so continued many yeares. And so contrarily,

      </note>
      <hi>Gideon</hi> being stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp by the goodnes of God, to the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one meane familie in <hi>Manasseh,</hi> was the cause of a very great deliuerance to the whole nation, from most mightie and cruell enemies, and most abominable Idolatrie, for the space of <hi>40.</hi> yeares. Where were those
<note n="c" place="margin">
         <hi>1</hi> King <hi>14.14.18.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>7000.</hi> in the daies of <hi>Eliah,</hi> that had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal:</hi> when he thought there were none left in Israel that feared God? were they not in the well instructed families? Whence came it that
<note n="d" place="margin">Gen. <hi>37.</hi> &amp; <hi>38.</hi> &amp; <hi>39.</hi> &amp;c.</note>
      <hi>Ioseph</hi> in his youth being sold vnto strangers, passed thorow so great temptations, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortles prison, the stocks &amp; iron, to be so worthie a father of the Common-wealth of Egypt, &amp; so good a nurse to the people of God? Ica name no other outward meanes, but his good education in the familie of the faithfull. Hence is it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
<note n="e" place="margin">Eccles. <hi>4.13.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Better is a poore and wise child, then an old and foolish king, which will no more bee admonished: for out of the prison hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth for to raigne, when hee that is borne in his kingdome is made poore.</hi> Therefore God commādeth his people,
<note n="f" place="margin">Deut. <hi>11.18.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>to lay vp his words in their harts, and in their soules, &amp;c. and to teach them their children, speaking of them when
<pb facs="15"/>they sit in their house, and when they walke by the way, and when they lye downe, and when they rise vp, &amp;c. that their dayes may be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied and the dayes of their children, &amp;c.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then what good may come out of a well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed familie, namely, that it may bee the preseruing of the countrie and Church, in the time of extreame daunger and darknes, the seedplot against the time of reformation, and a meanes by which God doth multiplie his people and peace in a countrie: and that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, an whole countrie may fall into Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and destruction. Whereby euery man may see what honorable seruice I wish him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, when I exhort him to the instructing of his familie.</p>
   <p>Therefore I heartily pray and earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate all gouernours of families,
<note place="margin">A request to the masters of families.</note> that they would set such wise order, in the disposing of all their worldly affayres, that they may haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient leisure and quiet time for the vse of this duetie: taking heede of all vaine excuses,
<note place="margin">Vaine excuses.</note> which the diuell and our corrupt nature will set before vs, as blockes and hinderances, that we should not once meddle with such
<note n="a" place="margin">Luk. <hi>10.42.</hi>
      </note> necessary matters. First,
<note place="margin">The Lords day</note> the Lords day being an ordinary rest &amp; time of libertie, doth call vnto you from the king of heauen, to doe this seruice. After morning and euening prayer, when you haue tried your people what they haue learned at the
<pb facs="16"/>Church by their pastour, and called to mind the chiefe heads of his teaching: then is it good to make it a drinke offering, vpon the pastours les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; to teach them a point or two of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion.
<note place="margin">Two howers once in the weeke.</note> And if it be possible, I would begge for these poore soules, in the name of Iesus Christ, (who shed his precious bloud for you and them) that you would bestowe some two howers euery weeke, in some one of the working daies, (as euery man shalbe able to find best and fittest lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) to instruct your children and seruants, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of this booke, or some such like: and that you would continue therein with al care and constancie. And I doe not doubt but you shall see great gaine by this little labour, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a blessing from the Lord our God,
<note n="b" place="margin">Hebr. <hi>6.10.</hi>
      </note> who will not forget any mans faithfull labour and loue, which is in Christ Iesus. There are foure sortes of people,
<note place="margin">Foure sortes of people haue most fit oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to teach the yonger. 1. Noble men, &amp; Gentlemen.</note> whome I would especially moue vnto this most vertuous and laudable worke, for that they haue most fitte opportunitie, to doe greatest seruice herein to God and their countrie. First al noble men and Gentlemen, and all Masters of great housholds. Whose families as they are the most in number, so most commonly they stand vnder the most reuerend and humble submission of their superiours. Therefore in regard of the one they may profit most; and in regard of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with most easines and conueniencie;
<note place="margin">Vaine pretēce.</note> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the greatest part pretend it, a very hard
<pb facs="16"/>thing in these daies, to bring their familie to Christian knowledge and sobernesse: yet the not hauing them so, consisteth not in the hardnes of the worke, or vnrulines of the people; but in the common neglect of many gouernours. Who pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing ouer this dutie,
<note place="margin">Libertie the spoyle of the familie.</note> as a matter either not much to be regarded, or not pertaining vnto thē: haue so hardeened the necks of children and seruants, with the loose raines of libertie and licentiousnes: that very few can abide this wholesome yoake of Christian nurture, the gracious &amp; godly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte of the knowledge of saluation.
<note place="margin">Great masters, rulers, princes, captaines, and kings may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate families.</note> For if one man could command to feare God, &amp; to instruct <hi>318.</hi> able men, beside all other seruants women and children: as is spoken of Abraham, Gene. <hi>14.14.</hi> and cap. <hi>18.19.</hi> and that a chiefe ruler o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>120000</hi> people, could so gouerne his priuat familie, that he could say, I and mine house will serue the Lorde, as wee reade of Ioshuah, cap. <hi>24.15.</hi> And an other great Prince had his seruants so guided in the feare of God, that hee and they were examples, in lending money and corne to the poore of the land: as did Nehemiah, cap. <hi>5.10.</hi> And if a Centurion could make both seruaunts and souldiers readie and obedient to euery good worke, as appeareth, Matth. <hi>8.9.</hi> yea if a King could protest vnto God, <hi>to banish deceitful and lying persons out of his house, and to entertain the faithful, &amp; him that walketh in a perfit way:</hi> as you may see, Psalm. <hi>101.5.6.</hi> I verily thinke
<pb facs="17"/>that no man endowed with a good conscience, fearing God and louing the Lord of life Iesus Christ, can haue any iust excuse or reasonable pretence, to keep about him a familie vntaught in the sweete words of the Gospell, and the hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some paths of our blessed Sauiour. Except they will say, that it is more behoofull for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and seruants to serue them, and to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence them; then to serue and reuerence the Lord of glorie.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Instructing of groat families, furthereth both Church and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> But why should I vse many words vnto men of such excellent wits &amp; great gifts, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so necessarily depending vpon them, that the least mention should suffice euery wise and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noble Gentleman to so glorious a worke. For by the good order &amp; Christian instructiō of one such great familie, many soules are brought to God, there is great encouragemēt by ensample vnto others out of the familie, and a maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous power for the bringing foorth and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of al good things, both for the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and also for the Church of God. For hence doe all other sortes of people take their light, and the liues of noble &amp; worshipfull men, are many times more of force, then either the law of God or man. For they are like the great pillars in a building, that if they stand steadie in faith and good life, with their families, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are vpholden by them in the wayes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: but if they swarue and become carelesse
<pb facs="17"/>and dissolute; they draw many with them, as by a mightie sway, into the wofull downfall of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie and destruction. Therfore aboue al men, it behooueth them to take heed to themselues, and the good instruction and gouernment of their housholds.</p>
   <p>The second sort are tutors in the Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to whom I ioyne also the third sort,
<note place="margin">Second and third sort, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors &amp; School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters.</note> School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters in towne &amp; countrie. Which two haue a great resemblance in their opportunitie to do good, when many mens children of all callings, are committed to their conscience: to the one,
<note place="margin">They may doe vnspeakable good.</note> in the first and more tender yeares: to the other, in the yeares of most danger. If these two sorts of men would be painfull to wring out the iuyce of this heauenly erudition, as a necessary sawce, to giue a pure verdure, to their other litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or as a sauoury salt to season al other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: it is not to be spoken how much good they may doe. For as young plants, being straightned while they bee tender, and trimmed with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and other parts of husbandrie, will growe very goodly to behold in their greatnes, which being neglected, are many times very crooked and vnfit for diuers vses: So doe young men for the most part proue as they are nurtured in their youth. And the good instruction of Schoolemasters and Tutors (in my knowledge) hath very well straightned such young impes,
<pb facs="18"/>(who otherwise were very rough and vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) that many receiue comfort by their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie example. Therefore I do most instantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech all Tutors and Schoolemasters to practise this booke: or, because you are learned, some better forme of your owne.</p>
   <p>Lastly,
<note place="margin">Fourthly, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing their children.</note> I doe heartily and humbly entreate all sorts of women, to watch carefully to doe this duetie: and first all Ladies and Gentlewomen, that they may be honoured by the spirit of Iesus Christ, as was that
