   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing some yeares since suffered shipwracke in the gulfe of Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by Gods gracious hand ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene lifted out, and saued from drowning in these waues, I thinke it my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to discry to others the danger and escape of those passages to and from Amsterdam. I left these Arguments of mine with Master <hi>Henry Ainsworth,</hi> Preacher to the same English at Amsterdam, calling themselues the Separation, commonly called <hi>Brownists;</hi> that hee and his might see, how I not rashly, but for iust cause left them. Sithence that, I haue beene inwardly moued to publish them in print, that they also who still sticke in that pit, may at length perceiue on what a sandy foundation the Separation is built; and forsaking the same with mee and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, may labour to build themselues vpon the Rocke Christ, so as the gates of Hell may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile against them, to plucke them from the one
<pb facs="3"/> Body, whereof hee is the one onely Head. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they perswade themselues, that their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of separation is the same that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe warrant, I haue set downe their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons grounded on two chiefe places of the same, very firmely, as they imagine: but I haue shewed that they wrest them, as many other alleaged to that end, for the proofe of that which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue. My reasons shewing their Separation to be a Schisme, I haue set downe briefly. This I haue done, not of hatred to any of their persons, or any truth of Christ, which they hold with the true Churches of God; but of sincere loue toward them; that they might acknowledge and forsake this worke of the flesh, Schisme I meane, which among other excludeth men from the Kingdome of God; which I pray God to bestow vpon all his there and euery where. Amen.</p>
