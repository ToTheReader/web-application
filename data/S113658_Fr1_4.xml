   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the complaint of old; yet never could it more justly bee taken up then now: In this <hi>Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivorous</hi> Age, wherein that <hi>Scripturientum Pruritus,</hi> doth every where, so more then abundantly raigne; the swarming issues of whose petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant braines, have induced such a nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seousnes, and utter loathing of the Muses banquets, as it is a thing almost past hope, to find an unperverted pallat. The very Title of a Poem even startled at, and the worke itselfe, to some scarce lesse odious then a Libel. So great a mischiefe hath licentious scribling, brought on that more excellent kind of writing. But this I leave unto the satyrist. And that I may not bee thought censoriously arrogant to blame
<pb facs="4"/>that act in others, which I may seeme my selfe to have committed; the Iudicious Reader may be pleased to take notice, that no vain desire of praise, nor giddy humour to bee seen in print, hath thus brought me into publique view. But an humble, and modest hope, of rectifying the wrongs our Author hath sustained through the rude attempts of a too-too busie pen: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this was the chiefe and sole cause of this publication (the worke having a long time lain by me:) yet will I not say, that herein I have wrought an actuall performance of the same; But the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse thereof, I leave to the censure of the conferring Reader. I am not ignorant of a sort of curious ones, that looke for wonders from a translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: when indeed they ought rather to checke, and limit their expectation: far different is the case with one who in his course exspatiates at randome, and with another, who is forc't to tread the steps of a fore-runner. Yet if they wil vouchsafe to
<pb facs="5"/>come without prejudicate, and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie opinions; they may herein meet with a strictnesse (such as is requisite) in the words, and a respective care towards the meaning of our Author; a sweetnesse too, asmuch as could conueniently be attained; having throughout observed a verse for verse traduction. For although in the Latine Elegiacke, that same <hi>In pedibus vitium</hi> be <hi>Causa decoris;</hi> Yet through the often close of the <hi>Pentameter,</hi> the genuine, sweet, and fluent statelines of the English <hi>Decasyllable,</hi> is much enerved. To plead my paines in the translation, were a thing which I will not, nor cannot doe: since I never made it other then my recreation, my sport. Though indeed the worke is such as might well deserve both a knowing, and a labouring Quill; and which that seldome erring critique, <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> hath thought good thus to censure. <hi>Epistolae omnium (Ovidii) librorum politissimae, nam &amp; sententiae sunt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres facilitas, &amp; composita, &amp; numeri
<pb facs="5"/>Poetici.</hi> If through my unskilfull copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have any wayes impayred the worth and lustre of the principall; so as it may now seeme unworthy of those Elogies; yet through kind acceptance of this my first draught, &amp; a friendly advertisement I shall hereafter endeavour to render it somewhat agreeable. For as I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne, and neglect, whatsoever proceeds from ignorance and detraction: so again, shal I alwayes be most ready (as <hi>Polyclete</hi> of old with his more curious peeces) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend whatsoever the judicious censurer shall think worthy the correcting pensil.</p>
