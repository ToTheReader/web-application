      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot forc't by fortune; but since your free minde</l>
   <l>(Made by affliction) rests in choice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd</l>
   <l>To calme Retreate; laid quite beneath the winde</l>
   <l>Of Grace, and Glory: I well know, my Lord,</l>
   <l>You would not be entitl'd to a word</l>
   <l>That might a thought remoue from your Repose,</l>
   <l>To thunder and spit Flames, as Greatnesse does;</l>
   <l>For all the Trumps, that still tell where he goes.</l>
   <l>Of which Trumps, <hi>Dedication</hi> being One,</l>
   <l>Me thinks I see you start to heare it blowne.</l>
   <l>But this is no such Trump as summons Lords,</l>
   <l>

   <l>Or gainst Hare-lipt <hi>Detraction, Contempt,</hi>

   <l>All which, from all Resistance stand exempt,</l>
   <l>It being as hard to seuer <hi>Wrong</hi> from <hi>Merit,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>As meate-indude, from blood; or blood from spirit.</l>
   <l>Nor in the spirits Chariot rides the soule</l>
   <l>In bodies chaste, with more diuine controule;</l>
   <l>Nor virtue shines more in a louely Face;</l>
   <l>Then true desert, is stuck off with Disgrace.</l>
   <l>And therefore truth it selfe that had to blesse</l>
   <l>The merit of it all, Almightinesse;</l>
   <l>Would not protect it, from the Bane and Ban</l>
   <l>Of all Moodes most distraught, and <hi>Stygian</hi>;</l>
   <l>As counting it the Crowne of all Desert,</l>
   <l>Borne to Heauen, to take of Earth, no part</l>
   <l>Of false Ioy here, for Ioyes-there-endlesse troth,</l>
   <l>Nor sell his Birthright for a messe of Broth.</l>
   <l>But stay and still sustaine, and his Blisse bring,</l>
   <l>Like to the hatching of the Black-thornes spring,</l>
   <l>With bitter frosts, and smarting haile-stormes forth;</l>
   <l>Fates loue Bees labors; onely <hi>Paine</hi> crownes <hi>Worth.</hi>
   </l>
   <l>This <hi>Dedication</hi> calls no Greatnes then,</l>
   <l>To patrone this Greatnes-creating Penn;</l>
   <l>Nor you to add to your dead calme a breath;</l>
   <l>For those arm'd Angells, that in spight of death</l>
   <l>Inspir'd those flowrs that wrought this <hi>poets</hi> wreath</l>

   <l>To leaue your Noblest suff'rance, no least saile.</l>
   <l>Strength then, the Obiect is of all Retreates;</l>
   <l>Strength needes no friends trust; strength, your foes defeates.</l>
