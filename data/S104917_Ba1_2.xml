gathered together in the towne
of <hi>Valladolid</hi> the yeere of our Lord 1542 for
order and reformation to bee obserued in the Indies: the eight
in order was this insuing, which consisteth vpon twentie reasons

to be giuen to the Spaniardes in Commendam, fee farme, or

the Dragons throate: least they doe wholy consume and slay thē,
&amp; so all that world remaine desart &amp; voide of the naturall me
habitants, wherewith we haue seene it replenished.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>THe eight remedie, is among all other principall and most in

that they all haue relation therunto, as euery motion to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

your Maiestie, which no man can expresse: in as much as therup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

wordes in your royall will and testament, that this decree be
euer kept, mainteined, and vpholden: also that so farre as in your
self or in them shal lie, they shall cōfirme and continue the same:
And for porofe of the necessitie hereof, there bee twentie reasons
to be alleadged: out of which twentie we haue drawen and put
in writing so many as may seeme to serue to our purpose.</p>
   <div type="part">
      <head>Extract out of the second reason.</head>
      <p>THe Spaniardes through their great auarice and couetousnes
to get, doe not permit any religious persons to enter into
their townes and holdes which they possesse, alleadging that they
receiue double losse by them. One and the principall is, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
persons do keepe the Ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>es occupied when they gather
them togethar to their Sermons, so as in the meane time their
worke is omitted, while the Indians being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>, laboure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>: yea,
it hath so fallen out, that the Indians being in the Church at the
Sermon, the Spaniarde comming in in the face of all the people,
hath taken fiftie, or a hundred, or so many as he hath needed to
carry his baggage and stuffe, and such as would not goe, he hath
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>den with stripes spurning them foorth with his feete, thereby
to the great griefe both of the Indians and of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 span">
            <desc>〈…〉</desc>
         </gap> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>oubling &amp; molesting all that were present, &amp; so defeating
thē al of the benefit of their saluatiō. Their other hinderance that
<pb facs="62"/>
they say they doe susteine, is, that after the Indians are taught &amp;
become Christians, they take vppon them as masters, pretending
more knowledge then they haue, &amp; therefore will not be so ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable
as afore.</p>
      <p>The Spaniards require no more of the Indians but authority
to commaund them, and that they worship them as Gods.</p>
      <p>The Spaniards openly and of set purpose, do hinder the course
of the gospel, and keepe the Indians from Christendome.</p>
      <p>Sometime it falleth so out, that a towne or borow is giuen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
three or foure Spaniardes, to one more, to another
lesse, so as sometime one hath for his portion the husband, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the wise, and the third the childrē as they were swine. Thus
doe they possesse the Indians. One appointeth them to labour a
peece of lande: another sendeth them to the mines loaden like
beastes: another hyreth them by two and two as they were
moyles to carry burdens thirtie, fortie, fiftie, a hundred or two
hundred miles out right. And this haue we seen to be a daily vse:
heereof commeth, it that the Indians cannot heare Gods word,
or bee instructed in Christian faith: they make them of free mē
very strange bondslaues. They haue subuerted and dispersed
great townes, and a whole worlde of people, so as they haue not
left any houses standing together, no not so much as the children
with the fathers. The Spaniards make no more account, neither
haue any more regard of conuerting the Indians, then if al those
reasonable soules should perishe with the bodies, and were not
hereafter to receiue immortall life, glory, or paine, no more then
beastes.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="part">
      <head>Out of the thirde reason.</head>
      <p>THe Spaniards are charged to instruct the Indians in our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
catholike saith: whereupon on a time when we examined
<hi>Iohn Colmenere of S. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>he,</hi> a fantastical ignorant, and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
man, who had gotten a great towne in <hi>commendam,</hi> and had
a charge of soules, he could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> how to blesse himselfe: and
asking him what doctrine he taught the Indians cōmitted to his
charge, he said, he gaue thē to the diuell: also that it was enough
<pb facs="63"/>
for him to say <hi>Per signim sanctin Cruces.</hi> Howe can the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes
that trauaile to the Indies, howe noble or valiant so euer
they bee, haue any care of the soules, when the most of them
are ignorant of their Creede and ten commandements, &amp; know
not the matters perteining to their owne saluation, neither doe
trauaile to the Indies for any other purpose but to satisfie their
owne desires and couetous affections, being for the most Parte
vicious, corrupt, vnhonest, and disordinate persons: so as he that
would way them in an equal ballance, &amp; compare them with the
Indians, shoulde finde the Indians without comparison, more
vertuous and holy then them. For the Indians what infidels soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they bee, doe neuerthelesse keepe them to one and their own
wife, as nature and necessitie teacheth, and yet we see some Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niarde
haue foureteene or more, which Gods commandementes
do forbid. The Indians deuoure no mans goods, they doe no
man wrong: they doe not vexe, trouble, or slay any, where them
selues doe see the Spaniardes commit all sinnes, iniquities, and
treacheries, that man can commit against all equitie and iustice,
To bee briefe, the Indians doe not beleeue any thing, but doe
mocke at all that is shewed them of God, beeing in trueth fully
rooted in this opinion of our God, that he is the worst, the most
vniust and the most wicked of all Gods, because he hath such ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants:
also concerning your maiestie, they thinke you the most
vniust and cruell of all kinges, because you doe both sende thither
and keepe heere such euill subiectes, supposing that your maiestie
doth feed vpon humane flesh and blood. We know these things
to be very new and strange to your highnes, but yet there they
be very vsuall and auncient. Many like matters which with our
eyes we haue seene might we speake of, but they would be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
to your maiesties eares, and would besides feare men, forcing
thē to wonder that euer God staied so long from plaging Spaine
in the bottomlesse pit. This title, to giue the Indians to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
in <hi>cōmedā,</hi> was neuer inuented to any other end but only
to finde occasion to bring them into bondage. One Spaniard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lorde, or hauing the charge of some towne or village, will
do more harme by his example and wicked life, then a hundred
good religious persons can do good by edifiyng or conuerting.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="part">
      <pb facs="63"/>
      <head>Out of the fourth reason.</head>
      <p>THe Spaniardes hauing authoritie to commaunde, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
interest in the Indies, can not by reason of their great
couetousnes abstaine from afflicting, troubling, disquieting, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or oppressing the Indians, taking away their goodes, landes,
wiues, or children, and vsing among them many other kindes of
iniquitie, for the which they can haue no redresse, sanction, or
warrant at your Maiesties chiefe iustice, because the Spaniardes
doe make them afraide: yea sometimes doe kill them, least they
shoulde complaine, as wee haue had certaine notice: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
it is euident, that they can haue no rest or quiet, to tende to
matters pertaining God, but doe sustaine a thousande lets, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes,
tormentes, sorowes, afflictions, heauinesses, and cares,
hating your Maiestie, and abhorring Gods lawe, which they
finde so heauie, bitter, and intollerable: as also your Maiesties
yoke and dominion so insupportable, tyrannous, worthie to bee
reiected and cast off, that they curse God and fall into desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
attributing to him all the aforesaide euils, because that vnder
the colour and title of his lawe, they do receiue such mishappes,
which hee doth beare withall, and doth not correct or chastice
those which boasting to be his seruanntes, doe put them to all
this. They doe night and day mourne after their gods, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them to bee better then ours at whom they sustaine suche
harmes, while contrary wise of their owne they reape there so
many commodities: and there is nothing that troubleth them so
much as the Christians.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="part">
      <head>Out of the fifth reason.</head>
      <p>VVE can shewe to your Maiestie, that the Spaniardes
haue within 38. or 40. yeeres slaine of iust accompt,

would not haue left either trauailer or inhabitant?</p>
   </div>
   <div type="part">
      <head>Out of the sixt reason.</head>
      <p>THe Spaniardes only for their temporall commoditie, haue
blemished the Indies with the greatest infamie, that any
man euen among the most horrible and villanous persons in the
world, could be charged withal, &amp; whereby they haue sought to

We may say as much of the eating of mans flesh, which likewise
<pb facs="64"/>
those places that I haue named are free of: although that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places they do it in deed. They be also charged with their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie,
as if for being idolaters, men should take vpon them to
punish them, &amp; not referre them to God only, against whō they
sin, whiles they haue both lands &amp; dominions seuerall to them
selues, which they hold not of any other thē their natural Lords:
besides that our ancesters were also idolaters before the faith
was preached vnto them, &amp; that all the world was gathered to
Christ. The Spaniardes haue purposely, &amp; effectually hindered
the teaching of the law of God and Iesus Christ: with all other
vertues among the Indians, &amp; driuen away the religious persons
out of townes and fortresses, least they shoulde see and disclose
their tyrannies: yea, they haue by their euill example, infected &amp;
corrupted the Indians, teaching them many odious behauiours
and vices, which before they knew not, as blaspheming the name
of Iesus Christ, practising of vserie, lying, &amp; many other abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
wholy repugnant to their nature. Again, to commit the
Indians to the Spaniards, or to leaue them in their handes, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
as much as to giue or leaue them to these that will
destroy &amp; bring them to nought, as well in body as soule.</p>
      <p>The Spaniards hauing fraudulently perswaded K. Ferdinand, he
suffered the Indians to be trāsported out of the Iles of Lucayos

      <p>To put the Indians into the Spaniardes handes, is, to giue
the childes throate to a frantick and mad man when he hath the
rasor in his hande: or it is as much as to deliuer men into the

   <div type="part">
      <head>Out of the eight reason.</head>
      <p>BEsides all that the Indians doe indure in seruing and pleasing
the Spaniarde, there is yet a butcher or cruell hangman, to
keepe them in awe appointed in euery towne and place, and is
tearmed <hi>Estanciero</hi> or <hi>Calpisque:</hi> who hath authoritie to lay
his clawes vpon them, and to make them labour, and doe what
the Lorde Commaunder, or chiefe thiefe will. So as if in hell
there were no other torment, yet were this incomparable. This
hangman whippeth them, hee ladeth them with stripes, hee ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
them with scalding grease, he afflicteth them with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
tormentes and trauelles, he forceth &amp; defloureth their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

their hennes whiche are their greatest treasure, not bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
them selues doe eate them, but that of them they offer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
and seruice to their greatest Lorde and chiefe tyrant: hee
vexeth them with innumerable other tormentes and griefes: &amp;
least they shoulde complaine of so many iniuries and miseries,
this tyrant putteth them in feare, saying: that he will accuse
them, and say that he see them commit idolatrie. To be briefe,
they must please and content aboue twentie disordinate and
vnreasonable persons: so as they haue foure Lordes and
maisters. Your Maiestie, their Cacique, him that hath them in
commendam, and the <hi>Estanciero</hi> of whom I last spake, whiche
<hi>Estanciero</hi> is to them more grieuous to beare then a quintall of

do molest, oppresse, and robbe these poore people.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="part">
      <head>Out of the tenth reason.</head>
      <p>IT is greatly to be feared, least God will lay Spain desolate, euen
for those horrible sinnes that this nation hath cōmitted in the
Indies, whereof we do euidently beholde the scorge, and all the
world doth see &amp; confesse that already it hāgeth ouer our heads,

   </div>
   <div type="part">
      <head>Out of the eleuenth reason.</head>
      <p>SO long as Lares bare sway and ruled, that was ix. yeeres, there
was no more care of teaching or bringing the Indians to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
neither was there any more labour employed, or once
thought of, to that purpose, then if they had been trees, stones,
dogges, or cats. He wasted great townes and fortresses, hee gaue
to one Spaniard 100. Indians, to another fiftie, to another more
or lesse, as euery man was in liking or fauour, and as it pleased
him to graunt. He gaue children, &amp; old men, women with child,
and in childbed, men of countenance and commons, the naturall
Lords of the towns and countreys, he parted them among those
to whom he wished most wealth and commoditie, vsing in his
letters of commaund this speech following: <hi>To you such a man,
are giuen so many Indians with their Cacique, them to vse in
your mines and affayres.</hi> So as all, great and small, young and
olde, that could stand on their feete, men, women with childe, or
in childbed, one or other, trauailed and wrought so long as they
had any breath in their bodies. He gaue leue to take away maried
men, and to make them drawe golde, ten, twentie, thirtie, fourty,
or eightie leagues, or farther. The women remayned in farme
houses and graunges, in great labours about gathering of great
heapes for the making of the bread that they doe eate, which is,
to heape together the earth whiche they doe digge, and rayse
foure handfull hie, and twelue foote square, that is a giaunts la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
namely to digge the hard earth, not with mattockes or sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels,
but with In other places they spinne cotten, and
doe such other worke, as are most meete for gaine and raysing of
<pb facs="66"/>
coyne, so that the man and wife should not see one another in 8.
or 10. monethes or a whole yere. And at their meeting they were
so worne with labour and hunger, that they had no minde of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation,
whereby their generation ceased, &amp; their poore chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
perished, because the mothers through hunger and trauaile
had no milke wherewith to nourish them: This was a cause
that in the Ile of Cuba, one of vs being there, there perished in
the space of three moneths for hunger 7000, children, some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
women strangled and killed their owne children, others
finding them selues with childe, did eate certaine hearbes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to loose their fruit, so that the men died in the mines, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mē
perished in the farme houses, their whole generatiō in a short
space decayed, and all the countrey lay desolate. The saide go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour,
to the ende without release to keepe them in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
labour, stil gaue them away, and yet besides their great labours
he suffered them rigorously, &amp; very austerely to be misused. For
the Spaniardes that had them in commaund, appointed certaine
hangmen ouer them, some in the mines whom the termed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niero,
other in the farmes, that were called Estanciero: vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and pitilesse persons that beate them with slaues and cords,
boxing them, pricking them with needles, and still calling them
dogs: neither did they euer shewe any signe of humanitie or cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie,
but all their dealings did consist of extreame seueritie,
rigor, and bitternesse, so as in troth it might be thought great
crueltie so to entreat or gouerne the verie Moores, being the
cruellest of all others, for all the damage that they haue done to
the Christians: where the Indians are more treatable, curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
gentle, and obedient, then any other nation in the worlde.
Farther, when because of these Estancieros and Minieros, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with such labours as they put them vnto, some of them fled
into the mountaines, as making full acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>mpt to bee killed,
the Spaniardes chose certayne officers whō they termed <hi>Algu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azil
del Campo,</hi> that shoulde pursue and hunt them out of the
mountaines.</p>
      <p>The gouernour had also in the Spanish townes and fortes,
certayne of the moste honourable and principall persons
<pb facs="67"/>
about him whome hee called Visitors, vnto whome also besides
their other ordinarie portions that he had giuen them, he gaue in
respect of their offices 100. Indians to serue them. These in the
townes were the greatest executioners, as being more cruel then
the rest, before whom <hi>Athuaziles del campo</hi> brought all suche
as had bin taken in this chase. The accuser, hee that had them in
commaund, was present, and accused them, saying: <hi>This Indian
or those Indians are dogs, &amp; wil do no seruice, but do dayly run
to the mountaines, there to become loyterers &amp; vagaboundes:</hi>
And therfore required they might be punished. Then the visitor
with his own hands boūd thē to a pale, &amp; taking a pitched cord,
in the Gallies called an Eele, which is as it were an iron rod, gaue
them so many stripes, &amp; bet them so cruelly, that the blood run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
downe diuers parts of their bodies, they were left for dead.
God is witnesse of the cruelties committed among those lambs:
I am perswaded that of the thousād part I can not rehearse one,
neither can any other tell it as it ought. The labour that they
were put vnto, was to drawe golde, whereto they had need haue
men of iron. For they must turne the mountaines 1000. times
vpside downe, digging and hewing the rockes, and washing, and
clensing the gold it selfe in the riuers, where they shall continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
stand in the water vntill they brust, and rent their bodies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uē
in pieces. Also whē the Mines peraduēture doe flow with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then must they also besides all other laboures, drawe it out
with their armes. To be briefe, the better to comprehend the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
that is emploid about gathering golde and siluer, it may
please your Maiestie to consider, that the heathen Emperours (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
to death) neuer condemned the Martyres to greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
then to mining for mettall: sometimes they were kept
a whole yeere at the mines: but afterward perceiuing howe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
perished there, they decreed that they mine for golde but
fiue moneths, which was fourtie dayes in melting, during which
time they tooke some rest.</p>
      <p>And what was their rest? They during those fourtie dayes,
made heapes of that which they shoulde eate, that is, they dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the earth, and cast it on heapes as is aforesaide, whiche la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
doeth exceede, dressing of vines, or tilling of the earth.
<pb facs="67"/>
Throughout the yere they neuer knew holiday, neither might be
suffered from labour little or much. Besides that during all this
toyle, they neuer had sufficient food, no not of <hi>Cacabi</hi> whiche is
the common countrie bread, and being made of rootes doth but
smally nourish except there be some fish or flesh to eate withal.
Moreouer, they gaue them of that countrie pepper, and <hi>Aies,</hi>
which be rootes like vnto nauetes, rosted or sodden. But some
Spaniarde, peraduenture meaning to seeme liberall in their
diet woulde weekely kill a hogge for 50. <hi>Indians,</hi> whereof the
<hi>Aliniero</hi> would consume two quarters, and part the other two
among the <hi>Indians,</hi> giuing daily to euery man as great a peece as
the <hi>Iacekins</hi> doe giue of holy bread in their Churches. Some
there were that through nigardlinesse wanting meate to giue
them, woulde send them two or three dayes abroade into the
fieldes and mountaines, to feed where they might satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with such fruite as hang on the trees, and then vppon the
force of that which they brought in their guttes, woulde force
them to labour two or three dayes more without giuing thē any
one morsell to eate. For the loue of God therefore, let your
Maiestie thinke what substance or strength those bodies naturally
so delicate and feeble, and nowe almost consumed and oppressed
with these trauailes, could gather of this food: also how it were
possible for those that liued so sorowfull, heauie and woeful alife,
in such labour without food shoulde liue long. The gouernour
commanded they shoulde bee paide their day wages and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for any labour or seruice that they shoulde doe to the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde,
and their wages was three blanckes euery two dayes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
in the yeere amounted to halfe a <hi>Castelin,</hi> that is worth 225
<hi>Maruedies:</hi> wherewith they might buye a Combe, a looking
glasse, and a paire of blew or greene beades. Yea, many yeeres
they had nothing at all paide them, but hunger and stripes did so
abound, that the <hi>Indians</hi> regarded none of this, neither sought
any more but euen once to get a good meales meat, or to die for
all, as wishing to forsake so desperate a life. He depriued them of
their libertie, suffering the Spaniards to keepe them in such bitter
bondage and prison as no man that had seene it, would or coulde
once thinke for: not leauing them any thing in this worlde free
<pb facs="68"/>
to vse at their pleasures: yea, notwithstanding the beastes haue
some time rest, and bee suffered to feede abrode in the fieldes, yet
woulde not these Spaniards that we speake of, graunt the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
any time or leasure so to doe: but the gouernour himselfe
would force them to an obsolute, perpetuall, forced, &amp; vnwilling
bondage. For they neuer had their free wil to do any thing at al of
themselues, because the Spaniards couetousnes, crueltie and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie,
was stil forcing them to some labour, not as captiues, but as
beasts, that are led bound to do whatsoeuer man will appoint. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
if at any time they were suffered to depart to their houses
to rest them, then should they there find neither wife, children,
nor food: as also although they had there found any meat, yet
should they not haue had time to make it readie: so that there
was no remedie but death. Thus grew they into sicknes through
long and grieuous trauailes, and that was sone caught among thē
as being (as is aforesaid) of a very delicate and tender cōplection,
&amp; much against their nature it was to be thus sodenly, contrary
to their wont, &amp; vnmercifully put to such labours, &amp; to be beatē
with staues, &amp; spurned at, besides the calling of thē at euery word
<hi>Villacos,</hi> &amp; vpbraiding thē, that they counterfeated sicknesse like
loytering losels, because they would not labour. When the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
perceiued the sicknes increase, so as there was no profit or
seruice to be looked for at their hands, then would they send thē
home to their houses, giuing thē to spend in some 30 40. or 80.
leagues trauaile, some halfe dosen of Radish or <hi>Refortes,</hi> that is a
kinde of nauet roote, &amp; a little <hi>Cacabi,</hi> where with the poore
men trauailed not far before they shold desperately die, som went
2 or 3. leagues, some 10. or 20. so desirous to get to their owne
home there to finish their hellish life that they suffered, that they
euē fel down dead by the waies: so as, many times we haue foūd
som dead, others at deaths doore, others groning &amp; pitifully to
their powers pronouncing this word, <hi>hunger, hunger.</hi> Then the
gouernour seeing that the Spaniard had in this wise slaine, half or
two 3. parts of these Indians, whō he had giuen them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,
he came a fresh to drawe new lottes, and make a newe
distribution of Indians: still supplying the number of his firste

that in our dayes haue delt in histories. Hee robbed his maiestie
&amp; subiects with those whom he tooke with him, and the harme
that he did amounted to aboue four, yea sixe millions of gold: he
laid aboue 40. leagues of land desart, namely from <hi>Darien,</hi> where
he first arriued vnto the prouince of <hi>Nicaraga,</hi> one of the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest,
richest and best inhabited lands in the world. From this
cursed wretch sprang first the pestilence of giuing the Indians in

any Spaniards doe inhabite, and by whom all these nations are
consumed: so that from him and his commandes, haue proceeded
the certaine waste and desolation that your maiestie haue sustei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

you must conceaue that we haue seene thē wonderfully peopled,

all the naturall inhabitants by meanes aforesaid, and that of the

      <head>The Prologue of Bishop Bortholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewe
de las Casas or Casaus, to the most
mightie Lord and Prince of Spaine,
Don Philip our good Lorde.</head>
      <p>MOst high and mightie Lorde, of late I was moued and by
the kings most vigilant counsaile for the Indies, vpon their
zeale and honour that they beare to our Lord God; as also hartie
<pb facs="70"/>
loyalie, wherwith they be adorned for his maiesties seruice, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in writing to set downe suche matter as to your person by
mouth I haue heretofore reported: namely, what I thought tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the title and claime that the kings of <hi>Castile</hi> doe make to
the soueraigne and vniuersall principalitie ouer the Indians: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
some did arise, who misliking that I dealt and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
with his maiestie and your highnes, about the discomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and losses compassed and perfourmed against the people of
those countries, and reported that in as much as I did so far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
and with such bitternesse and sharpnes did abhorre them: as
also I will still doe, so long as I liue, I doe call in doubt, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
deminish the said royall title and right.</p>
      <p>In which deede, as a testimonie what I did think, and in truth
according to God and his holy lawe doe still hold, I exhibited 30.
propositions, deuoid of all other proofe then what eache of them
in it selfe did conteine, the one of necessitie following the other,
because I was driuen to send them to his maiestie vnder pretence
of the great counsaile that then was holden.</p>
      <p>Afterward proceeding and persisting in desire to serue god by
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">

         </gap> felling some mens slanders, who either for want of comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the truth, or els hauing some other purposes &amp; contrarie
meanings, do presume vnder a fained and counterfet kinde of
seruice to the kings (who of thēselues naturally are endued with
courteous &amp; simple mindes and hearts, iudging &amp; measuring all
other by themselues) to present vnto them, a poysoned, bitter, &amp;
peraduenture a mortall drinke which doth not only waste king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
&amp; common wealthes, in procuting their carefull calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
&amp; dolorous destruction. but also doe bring euen the kinges
owne persons to the pit of manifest danger &amp; irreparable detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and losses. With which frandulous counsails they doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
so much as in thē lieth, the good &amp; godly affections of kings,
and do subuert all the princes vertuous deuises &amp; studies. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
did sometime that most mightie king <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> otherwise
tearmed <hi>Assuerus</hi> complaine, as appeareth in the booke of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
I haue so indeuoured my selfe (most mightie Lord) that now
I haue set in hand the proofe of the said 30. propositions &amp; some
more, comprehending the whole in this brief summarie, which
<pb facs="70"/>
is taken out of a greater volume, wherein euery article is more
perticulerly expounded: herein setting in sight only the 17. and
18. proposition, because the whole substance of this matter may
be reduced to these two propositions as to the principles &amp; ends.</p>
      <p>The title here of should in my opinion haue been: <hi>A proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
tretise of the soueraigne Empire, and vniuersal principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
which the kings of Castile haue ouer the Indies:</hi> As presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that it is manifest &amp; proued, in that the Apostolike sea
hath graunted it, and that there needeth no other opening of the
reasons whereupon the graunt of this empire consisteth.</p>
      <p>I purpose in this treatise chiefly to discharge my conscience,
vsing that meane which it seemeth that Gods prouidence hath
appointed me. My great age (for I am aboue 50.) being the cause
of my large knowledge and eye experience of the Indian affaires,
also to giue notice of that which passed in these partes, as also
what was to be done, euer referring my self to the like desire that
the disorders that I haue there seen practised might be redressed.
And the rather because those that hinder this redresse &amp; are most
hurtful to those lāds, are such as being deuoid of truth &amp; iustice,
do indeuout by counteseating and mingling that which is false &amp;
vntrue, and withall seeming to doe it for your maiesties seruice,
especially colouring your right to this new worlde, are in trueth
altogether withstanders of your seruice &amp; weale, either spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
or temporall (as euery true christian &amp; wise man wil graunt)
The other benefite that I hope to obteine and reape by this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
is, that I shall detect and vnfold those mens errours, who
rashly dare affirme that the right and principalitie of the kinges
of <hi>Castile</hi> ouer the Indians is, or shoulde consist of armes and
great force, entring vpon them euen as <hi>Nemrod</hi> who was
the first hunter and oppressour of mankinde did euer, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishe
his principalitie, as the holy scripture testifieth: either as
great <hi>Alexander</hi> and the Romans, and all other cotable and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
tyrants, doe lay the foundation of their Empires: also as
the Turke doth nowe adaies inuade, trouble, and oppresse chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome:
and yet haue not any of them once approched the
spanish tyrannies.</p>
      <p>How far those men that do pronounce such a sentence do euill
<pb facs="71"/>
seruice, and offend the sincertie and loue of the king of <hi>Castiles</hi>
iustice, is here very easie to be iudged.</p>
      <p>Who for proofe of their matters doe commit error vpon er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and so doe heape together other things both absurd, wicked
and vnworthie to bee once hearde from these men which bee
taken either for Christians or for reasonable persons. For vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
such as stray from vertue and truth, in excusing one fault, or
mainteining one errour, doe runne headlong into many. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
there are that do colour them with fairer &amp; honester titles,
who also deserue to be reiected, reproued, &amp; laughed at: as those
that say, because we haue more wit, or that we border neerest vp
on them, either for that the Indians are infected with suche and
such vices, we may subdue them: with other like colours wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they bee so far from vpholding or confirming that which
they weene to strengthen and fortifie, that finally they lay all in
the dust. To the end therefore that his maiestie may bee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
of all aforesaid, and as a most Christiā and iust prince, may
discerne betweene the pure and corrupt: also betwene right &amp;
wronge, and withall that he may knowe who serueth him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and those that hange vppon him only to satisfie their owne
affections: and for their priuate profit doe inuent and deuise new
titles for his Indies, which be neither probable nor of any effect,
&amp; so do hope to come to do their duties before that I were able.
Further for that offering this treatise to your highnes, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
shall bee serued thereby, sith himselfe shall haue such lettes
there as he goeth, I doe most humbly beseech your highnesse in
his name to accept it: also to examine, discerne, and vnderstande
it with such wisedome and clemencie as you holde of his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
and as himselfe would doe, seeing it is so, that Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
hath appointed your highnesse to inherite, as we doe hope
the same right in the empire &amp; principalitie of thē: besides if it
seeme necessary to be published in other places out of this realm
I will, if your highnes so command me, put it in latin: &amp; although
it should not deserue to bed spersed either in latin or otherwise,
yet were not the losse great, in that I caused it to be printed onlie
to the end your highnesse might with more ease reade the same,
whose glorious life and royall estate, the Lorde increase and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper,

      <head>The summe of the disputation between
Fryer Bartlemewe de las Casas or Casaus, and
Doctor Sepulueda.</head>
      <p>DOctor Sepulueda the Emperors chronographer hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
&amp; being perswaded by certayne of those Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes,
who were most guiltie in the slaughters and wastes
committed among the Indian people, wrote a booke in Latine in
forme of a Diologue very eloquently, and furnished with all
floures, and precepts of Rhetoricke, as in deede the man is verie
learned and excellent in the saide tongue, which booke consisted
vpon two principall conclusions: The one, that the Spaniardes
warres against the Indians, were as concerning the cause and
equitie that moued thē thereto, very iust: also that generally the
like war may &amp; ought to be cōtinued. His other conclusion, that
the Indians are bound to submitte them selues to the Spaniards
gouernment, as the foolishe to the wise: if they will not yeelde,
then that the Spaniards may (as he affirmeth) warre vpon them.</p>
      <p>These are the two causes of the losse and destruction of so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
numbers of people: also that aboue 2000. leagues of the
maine lande, are by sundrie newe kindes of Spanish cruelties
and inhumaine dealinges bin lefte desolate in the Ilands: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by conquestes and commaundes as he nowe nameth those
which were wont to be called Partitions.</p>
      <p>The sayde Doctor Sepulueda coloureth his treatise, vnder the
pretence of publishing the title which the kinges of Castile and
Leon doe chalenge in the gouernment and vniuersall soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of this Indian world, so seeking to cloake that doctrine whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
he endeuoureth to disperse and scatter as well in these lands,
as also throughout the kingdomes of the Indians. This booke he
exhibited to the royall counsaile for the Indies, very earnestly
and importunately lying vpon them for licence to print it, which
they sundry times denied him in respect of the offence, dangers,
&amp; manifest detriment, that it seemed to bring to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
      <p>
         <pb facs="72"/>
The Doctour seeing that heere hee coulde not publishe his
booke, for that the counsaile of the Indies woulde not suffer
it, he delte so farre with his friendes whiche followed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
court, that they gotte him a patente, whereby his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
directed him to the royall counsayle of Castile, who knewe
nothing of the Indian affaires: vpon the comming of these let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the court and counsaile being at Aranda in Duero, the yeere
1547. Fryer Bartholomewe de las Casas or Casaus, Bishoppe
of the royall towne of Chiapa, by happe arriued there, comming
from the Indians, and hauing intelligence of Doctor Sepulueda
his driftes and deuises, had notice also of the contentes of his
whole booke: but vnderstanding, the authours pernitions blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
as also the irrecouerable losses that might ensue vpon the
printing of this booke, with might &amp; maine withstood it, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
&amp; reuealing the poyson wherewith it abounded, and
whereto it pretended.</p>
      <p>The Lordes of the royall counsell of Castile, as wise and
iust iudges, determined therefore to sende the sayde booke to
the Vniuersities of Salamanca &amp; Alcala, the matter being for he
most part therein Theologically handled, with commaundement
to examine it, and if it might be printed, to signe it: which Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities
after many exact and diligent disputations, concluded,
that it might not be printed, as contayning corrupt doctrine.
The Doctour not so satisfied, but complayning of the Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
aforesayde, determined, notwithstanding so many denia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>les
and repulses at both the royall counsailes, to sende his treatise
to his friends at Rome, to the ende there to print <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>, hauing first
transformed it into a certayne Apologie written <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>o the Bishop
of Segouia, because the same Bishoppe hauing perused the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and booke aforesaide, had brotherly and charitablie as his
friende by letters reprooued and counsayled him. The Emperor
vnderstanding of the impression of the sayde booke and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,
did immediatly dispatche his letters patents, for the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in and supression of the same, commaunding likewise to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in agayne all copies thereof throughout Castile, for the said
Doctour had published also in the Castilean language a certaine
abstract of the saide booke, thereby to make it more common
<pb facs="72"/>
to all the lande: and to the ende also that the commons, and such
as vnderstood no latine, might haue some vse thereof, as being
a matter agreeable and toothsome to suche vs coueted great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and sought wayes to clyme to other estates, then eyther
themselues, or their predecessors coulde euer attaine vnto with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great cost, labour, and cares, and often times with the loffe
and destruction of diuers.</p>
      <p>Which when the Bishoppe of Chiapa vnderstoode, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
also to write an apologie in the vulgar tongue, against
the saide doctors summarie, in defence of the Indies, there in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning
and vndermining his soundations, and answering all
reasons, or whatsoeuer the doctor coulde alleadge for him selfe,
therin displaying &amp; setting before the peoples face the dangers,
inconueniences and harmes in the sayde doctine contayned.</p>
      <p>Thus as many thinges passed on both sides, his Maiestie i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
the yeere 1550. called to Valadolid, an assemblie of learned men,
as well Diuines as Lawyers, who being ioyned with the Royall
counsaile of the Indies shoulde argue, and among them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
whether it were lawfull without breach of Lustice, to leuie
warres, commonly tearmed conquestes, against the inhabitantes
of those conneries, without any newe offence by them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their infidelitie excepted.</p>
      <p>Doctor Sepulued a was summoned to come and say what hee
coulde, and being entred the counsayle chamber, did at the first
session vtter his whole minde. Then was the sayde Bishoppe
likewise called, who for the space of fiue dayes, continually did
reade his Apologie: but being somewhat long, the Diuines and
Lawyers there assembled, besought the learned and reuerende
father Dominicke Soto his Maiesties confessour, and a domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
Fryer, who was there present, to reduce it into a summarie
and to make so many copies as there were Lordes, that is four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene,
to the ende they all hauing studied vpon the matter, might
afterwarde in the feare of God say their mindes.</p>
      <p>The sayde reuerend father and Master Soto, set downe in the
saide summarie, the doctors reasons, with the Bishops answeres
to the same. Then had the doctour at his request a copie
deliuered him to aunswere: out of whiche Summarie
<pb facs="73"/>
he gathered twelue against him selfe, whereto hee made twelue
answeres, against which answeres the Bishoppe framed twelue

haue read part vnto your excellencies and Lordeshippes.</p>
      <p>And seeing hee hath sought to disclose him selfe, and feared
not to bee taken for the authour of so execrable impietie,
whiche doe redownde to the slaunder of the faith, the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

      <p>Wherefore I beseech your noble Lordeshippes graces and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhoodes,

to giue accoumpt of the losse of soules alreadie perished, and
hereafter to perish, vnlesse the gate be shutte vp against this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie

iustifie. Also that this honourable assemblie admitte no Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie
by him vsed to couer and cloake his hurtfull opinion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hee sheweth a pretence to colour and defende the authoritie
by him called Apostolike, and the Empire, whiche the kinges of
Castile and Leon haue ouer these Iudians. For no Christian
can lawefully and honestly confirme and defende the authoritie
tearmed Apostolike, eyther the soueraignetie of any Christian
king by vniust warres, by filling hilles and valyes with innocent
blood, either with the infamie and blaspheming of Christ and
his faith:</p>
      <p>But the Apostolike sea is rather by suche meanes defamed
and looseth her authoritie, the true God is dishonoured, and
the true title and right of a king is loste and perisheth, as euery
wise and Christian man may easily gather by that which Doctor
Sepulueda him selfe hath propounded.</p>
      <p>This title and right is not founded vpon the entrie into those
countries, and against those people to robbe, slay, and tyrannos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to rule ouer them, vnder pretence of preaching the faith, as
those tyrāts entred &amp; haue done, who by an vniuersallmassa cre
and slaughter, haue murdered such a multitude of Innocentes:
But it consisteth of a peaceable, louing, and gentle preaching of
the Gospell, and of an vnfaigned introduction and foundation
of faith, and of Christes principalitie. Yea who so euer goeth
about to giue our Kinges and Lordes any other tide, whereby to
obtayne the soueraigntie and principalitie ouer those Indians, is
starke blind, offendeth God, is a traitour to his king, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
