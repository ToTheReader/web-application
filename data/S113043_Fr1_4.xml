   <head>THE PREFACE OF THE FRENCH AVTHOR TO THE NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BILITIE OF FRANCE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Maisters: If we will exactly weigh and consider the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie of our natiuitie: we shall find (according to the obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Plinie:</hi>) that nature was verie sparie and niggardly in our creation: because that man (who was borne to haue the Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orie and Lordship ouer all other creatures) commeth into the world verie naked, fraile and poore, in comparison of them. She hath bestowed vpon all beastes euen in their originall and first beginning strength, wherewith to helpe them, vestures wherewith to couer them, weapons to defend them, pasture to nourish and feed them. But how hath she dealt with man? he commeth naked out of his mothers wombe, weake and feeble, and not able to sustaine and helpe himselfe: man alone of all other creatures is borne without knowledge and hath nothing but what is taught him: he is fit for nothing, he is not able so much as to go or to speake, and when he hath continued a long time learning and getting of experience, and when he is come (as the Philosopher saith) to his owne naturall: he applieth himselfe to nothing but to vice and sensualitie: and he remaineth still (notwithstanding all his paines and trauelles) inferior to the brute beastes: who on the contrarie euen by the instinct of nature do giue themselues to follow that which appertaineth to their function, and which is proper and peculiar vnto them.</p>
   <p>This conceipt of the comparison of the impuissance and infirmitie of mankind, putteth me in minde of an olde <hi>Italian</hi> prouerbe, which is: That it had bene expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and needfull for men either to be borne sage and wise, or to be borne twice. For if we were borne wise, we should eschew and auoide the inconueniences of this life, against the which by ignorance we do daily and howerly stumble: or at leastwise in the course of our second life, we should put that in practise which we had learned in our first life: and we should not walke blindfolded in the darknes of error as we now do, comming into this world depriued and destitute of the light of wisedome which <hi>Solomon</hi> demaunded of God before all earthly things whatsoeuer.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding on the contrarie, if we do marke and consider the excellencie of man: we shall see that in stead of these goodly corporall faculties wherein other creatures are his superiours, God hath gratiously endowed him with a singular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of that part of his nature which is intellectuall and capable of doctrine, and that is our spirit, which of it selfe is diuine and celestiall: and whereas by meanes of her prison and earthly tabernacle, it is made rude, sauage, and out of taste: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempered, reformed, and fashioned by the fauour and ciuilitie of good artes and sciences: it estrangeth vs as farre from the nature of creatures vnreasonable: as it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs to approach and draw nigh to the resemblance of the diuine Image.</p>
   <p>Seing therefore all men are by nature both capable of knowledge, and haue a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie imposed vpon them to seeke after learning; the gentle man of all others hath
<pb facs="5"/>
most reason to apply his mind thereunto: for that he exceeding all other persons in dignitie of bloud, and in the gifts, graces, and qualities of nature, and being in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thereof the sooner called to degrees of honour, and to the managing of great matters, he ought also to beautifie and enoble his minde and vnderstanding, and to make it more &amp; more glorious by the knowledge of good letters, especially of good and worthy histories: for in truth there is nothing so louely, beautiful or amiable, but the study of histories wil plentifully supply any man with the knowledge therof, that shal delite to be conuersant, and to exercise himself in them. This bringeth her follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be priuie counsellers to kings and princes: this preferreth them to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of kingdomes and common weales: to the most honorable estates &amp; offices of the warres, and to the gouernments of prouinces: this teacheth vs to be wise, at the cost of others. To be briefe (as <hi>Cicero</hi> well calleth them) Histories are the testimony of times, the light of truth, the life of memorie, the Ladie and mistreste of life, and the messenger of antiquitie, of the which who so is ignorant, may iustly be accompted as a stranger in his owne countrey. But I will not proceed any farther in her praises: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I will encourage you to be familiar with her: for I see (God be thanked for it) that she hath good entertainment generally, and is well receiued &amp; cherished amongst you: that you are content to bestow a good part of your honest leisure in her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Yet thus much let me tell you by the way, &amp; vpon occasion of this discourse: that forasmuch as the principall and most ordinary profession of Frenchmen is to followe armes, and yet they take litle or no care or pains at all to study &amp; know the lawes and rights depending vpon the profession of armes: I desire therefore, that the studie and reading of histories (which representeth vnto vs manifold exāples of so many migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie armies well gouerned, and of so many Captaines and souldiers which haue bene most curious and precise obseruers of the statutes and ordinances of the Art militarie) may prouoke and allure you also to follow more religiously &amp; carefully this ancient discipline, and that you would conforme your selues to the practise thereof: whereby those famous and worthy personages haue purchased to themselues endles &amp; eternall honor, to their Chieftaines and leaders innumerable triumphs and victories, and to their countrey mighty Empires, and Monarchies of infinite greatnesse. What was it that reserued and freed the name and memory of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> from the vngratefull silence and the iniurious obliuion of deuouring time? What hath made their glorie and renowme to be so famous euen till this day? What was it that spread abroad the glorious and immortall name of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> euen to the vtmost bounds and limits of this earthly frame? What made them so fearfull and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible euen to the proud and inuincible <hi>Romanes:</hi> that vpon euery rumor made to the Senate that the <hi>Gaules</hi> were on foote, they speedily had recourse to the Dictatorship, as vnto a sacred anker in the most tempestuous stormes and perils of their estate? As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly it was not the supernatural force of their bodies: it was not the infinit number of their squadrons, but the onely exact, strict, and rigorous obseruation of the lawes and discipline of warre.</p>
   <p>Thus did that famous Conqueror <hi>Godfrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Bouillon:</hi> thus did our generous and Christian <hi>Argonauts,</hi> and infinit others in times past make themselues way vnto the heauens, &amp; purchased immortal fame vpon the earth. What hath made the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins</hi> &amp; the <hi>Turks</hi> to grow to that reputation and honor by armes? What hath made them inheritors almost of all the Empire of the <hi>Greeks &amp; Romanes,</hi> but this only, that they did first imitate and succeed them in their good orders and discipline? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they only of all others at this day are the sole obseruers, and they alone may iustly vaūt, that they haue the true discipline in price &amp; regard: they (I say) only may arroga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      <pb facs="6"/>
this vnto themselues: for I know not any one nation besides them, who make anie account of the same. There is no care had now a dayes amongst souldiers and men at armes, of any rules, precepts or pollicie of warres: we loue rather to learne the duties of the field by experience, and by the euent &amp; hazard of our owne proper perill, then by reason and discipline: and therein do we fulfill the old prouerbe; In losse is lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But (in my opiniō) this is but a bad maxime: for the course of our life is briefe &amp; short, and vse and experience without reading requireth too long a time to furnish vs with all those things which are necessary for the perfection of our experience. But study &amp; reading of histories being ioyned to experience, is sufficient in a smal time to aduance, to quickē, to refine, &amp; to perfect our iudgement. For (as <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Comines</hi> hath<note place="margin">Saying of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip of Comines.</note> said very wisely) A man may know more touching the practise of deeds of armes by 3 moneths reading in one good booke, then 20 men shalbe able to know by the eye &amp; experience, if they liue in seuerall ages successiuely one after another. I returne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to my matter: and I say, that this science and practise being most needfull and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for our nation (whose profession is to follow the warres▪) the speediest and shortest course, and the best way and meanes to attaine to the true and perfect skill of armes, is to consort and to marrie themselues to the studie and reading of histories.</p>
   <p>The consideration hereof hath moued me to communicate vnto you a history, out of the which (I hope) you shall gather no lesse frute and profit, then pleasure and recreation. Howbeit I knowe there are fewe or no good Historiographers auncient or moderne, domesticall or straungers, but they are published in our language by the vertuous labors of many learned &amp; rare spirits amongst the <hi>French:</hi> neuertheles, in this our historie here imparted vnto you, first of all in reading the haughty aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and valiant exploites of an age so nearely conioyned to this of ours, falling in a manner within the time and knowledge euen of our grand-fathers: we haue good cause to reioice &amp; to glorie in the same, no lesse then the world hath euer accustomed to make a benefit, and to attribute vnto themselues the honor of great triumphes, and the glorie of their owne age and times. Besides, here shalbe represented vnto you, not the detestable and bloudie effects of our owne miseries, troubles, and seditions: nor the hatefull conspiracies of subiects against their Prince and countrie: nor the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble massacres of friends and fellow citizens: of children against their parents, of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fleshed against their naturall brethren: nor of husbands against their wiues: you shall not heare in this discourse the piteous cries and lamentations of wiues and maidens violated: you shall not see here the excesse of sacrileges, of burnings, nor the rapine and spoile of the goods of friends and allies: but you shall reade of a most holy, a iust, and an honorable warre: of armes lawfully vndertaken, for the defence both of the Christian, and of the ciuill libertie, against the Turkes and circumcised miscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, the sworne enemies of Iesus Christ: you shall see their townes maintained and defended, their countrie preserued and protected by the armes of their proper peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and naturall inhabitants: here shall you behold the image of a Prince most reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, of a warrior most magnanimous, armed with faith and zeale incredible: his souldiers faithfull, louing and obedient: here shall you trace out so perfect an obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of militarie discipline, that their notable victories and exploits will appeare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you worthie of wonder and admiration. All this shall you see in this historie, of the life of <hi>George Castriot,</hi> surnamed by the Turks, <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> which is, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Lord, or the Great, King of <hi>Albanie:</hi> whose immortall name is worthie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all contradiction, to be consecrated to the temple of Memorie, farre aboue all other Knightes, and champions of the Leuant, whose honourable actes haue made them to be recommended for the defence of the faith of Christ against the
<pb facs="6"/>
detestable and cursed sect of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> For it seemeth that God had a speciall will and purpose to marke him with all laudable qualities and prerogatiues: as faith, religion, strength of bodie, comelinesse of person, dexteritie of spirit, the practise and skill of armes: all which were accompanied with so wonderfull and vnspeakeable good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that it may be iustly auerred, that his deedes did surmount his destinies. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription whereof I haue according to the truth and sinceritie of an historie, drawen and deriued out of the writings of those that haue intreated of them: and specially out of the Latine historie of <hi>Marin Barletus</hi> Priest, borne in <hi>Scutarie</hi> or <hi>Scodra,</hi> a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in <hi>Epire,</hi> whom we haue chosen and followed as a principall example and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, and as an Authour who hath bene reputed most diligent and sincere, and most graue and sententious. In regard whereof he hath purchased to him selfe a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the most notable and famous historiographers of the Latines, that haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in these latter ages.</p>
   <p>This Historie do I nowe impart vnto you (my Maisters) humbly intreating you, that if ouer much temeritie haue caused me to forget my selfe in taking vppon me a taske which surpasseth and exceedeth the feeblenesse of my spirit, you would impute the blame thereof to the readinesse of my good will and affection, which I haue to do you seruice: and that you would please to receiue this my trauell as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously as I haue made offer thereof vnto your curtesies with my best deuotion and abilitie.</p>
