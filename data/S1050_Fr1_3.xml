   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese late frostie mornings (pleasing my humor) roused me sooner (then of custome) from my drowsie bedde, and with desire (pressing me) I went abroad to walke.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Where all alone, betrampling frosned ground,</l>
      <l>Me thought to heare, some fierce and warlike sound:</l>
      <l>For <hi>Phoebus</hi> then began his course in skies,</l>
      <l>On rolling wheeles, his fierie wagon flies,</l>
      <l>Most swift, to send blacke <hi>Pluto</hi> to his bed:</l>
      <l>Who giuing place, left skie like blood as red.</l>
   </q>
   <p>This made me conceiue some discourse within my selfe, and wondering much, there came vnto mind, how God had pleased to blesse, and keepe our Queene, and land from the thundering and tempestious stormes of all our mortall, and furious enimies: with this conceit my ioy was much augmented, and did amase me greatlie to consider, how far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expectation, the late rumors of wars, and the rage of those which wrought to destroy vs, were blowne ouer and gone from vs (with their owne confusion:) and we inrest still liuing (in all felicitie) ruled, and gouerned by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> our most blessed, and redoubled Princes. This seemed to my wonder most maruellous, and more moued me to muse, when stepping on a peece of broken Ice, I spurned forth a paper (rolled vp,) wherein when I had opened and read, appeared matter sitting my present deuise: which noting, by what chance and fortune, and in what season it came to my hands, sodenly resolued to haue it printed: yet not willing to be ouer rash in presenting vnto your viewes, what I knew not assuredly true, found after occasion of conference, with sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie of good iudgement, who I knew had long frequented the Low countries (from whence they lately came) By whom vnder standing all
<pb facs="3"/>was most true, and that they added much more honor vnto the Lorde Willughbie, (her Maiesties Lieutenant generall) whome this booke toucheth: I greatly longed (although I neuer did see his Lordships per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) to haue his so noble indeuours (with all speed) published: which as it may worthelie be placed for a looking glasse, to such as woulde game fame, and honor: So with your good fauor and patience, I will be bould to name this short discourse, <hi>A Mirrour to all that loue to follow the warres:</hi> Whereby if any shall take profite (in imitating his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships so honorable desire) to purchase Englands good, it will aduance him, and his to a neuer ending fame. And our sacred Prince (by whom we liue most happie) shall reape sweete comfort (in her so blessed daies) when her florishing realme shalbe garnished, and stored with many such Lord Willughbies; who leaueth not both day and night to liue in rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse toile and trauell, and ioyeth most when newes is brought, or meanes found, how hee may best spoile or incounter her Maiesties enemies. This onely do I craue, that with good construction you will (with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor) reade what followeth, and yeelde but due right, where nought besides is demanded: and when by chance I finde the like of any one of you, I promise to performe as much, (and more) if so your actions me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or deserue.</p>
