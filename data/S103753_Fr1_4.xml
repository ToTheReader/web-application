      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had meant to take leave of the Presse, as one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented to bee guilty of this common surfet. Yet once againe my zeale ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges me to breake silence. I finde so little feare of God in this world which I am shortly leaving, that
<pb facs="5"/>
I could not forbeare, after my tears, to bestow some inke upon it. Every man can bewaile it, I have stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to redresse it. Wee may indevour that which GOD onely can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. I humbly leave this to the worke of no lesse then an omnipotent grace. In the meane time it is both holy and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to project the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and it shall bee the no-small comfort of my death-bed, that I have
<pb facs="5"/>
left behind me this seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable advice of better thoughts; which, when I am gone, may survive to the benefit of many: Know withall that this Treatise entred the Presse under the honored name of my deare Lord, the Earle of <hi>Norwich,</hi> whose death preventing the publication, hath sent it forth Patron-lesse; Mee thought I should not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that what was once his, in my destination,
<pb facs="6"/>
should ever bee any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; Let this blanke be as my last memoriall of the honour that I justly beare to that incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friend, both alive and dead, serve to professe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, that these papers yeeld themselves not unwilling Orphans upon his losse: But why doe I so mis-name his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? That blessed soule not staying the leisure of my present directions, hasted up to the free view of the
<pb facs="6"/>
face of his God, which I could onely shew dimly, and aloofe. There will be more use of the imitation of his practice, then of the honour of his protection; Let us goe cheerefully on in the steps of true piety, and conscionable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, untill our faith like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise shall shut up in an happy fruition.</p>
