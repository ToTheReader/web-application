The poore that is reputed for a foole at his aste ende loketh to be partycypar of the goodes of dame palas. They y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> loue vertues without doynge outrage to ony body / god shall loue them without ony faute / so that he bere not a folysshe mytre / and yf he were of scyence vnpuruayed / So that he be replete with vertue / he shall be more wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser than a grete clerke. ¶ I fynde assembles of fooles by grete hepes and routes of dyuers nacyons and maners for the one is vnbraynles that wyll bere baners.

Mondayne fooles myrre you well in my glasse / and you shal se your fautes and synnes. And shall knowe euydently how fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dothe gouerne you.

If that some fooles mocke vs bycause of our lytell wrytynges / and that there is comprehended dyuers fooles in it / they haue small vnderstondynges / for the sens lytterall is not the substaunce of the mater. Suche folkes is lyke them that thynke for to ete the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondes kyrnelles withoute brekynge of the stones / for who that wyll fynde sauour therin muste breke it / also who wyll fynde prouffyte in this booke / oughte to reste hym on the moral sens that is couered with foly. My bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke satyryke I gyue vnto you for example. Lordes yf it please you for to rede it / &amp; yf it seme you y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it is mordaunt excuse me as the auncyentes are excused / the whiche ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue made dyuers fayre doctrynes mordauntes. The poe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes haue also compyled dyuers noble bookes correckyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge the vyces of the humaynes. ¶ All this consydered I wyll folowe them / notwithstondynge y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. But yet in maner of passe tyme I wyll speke here of fooles men and women / and assygne them guaryson of vertues / scyence / &amp; doctryne / for to make them condys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende vnto goodnes. For I had neuer other wyll but for to detraye yonge bachelers out of synnes and vyces / &amp; to conduyte them vnto the porte of reason and vertue / Pardon me you oratours yf ony thȳge be euyll couched and you lectours that occupyeth the tyme in this lecture yf you fynde ony faute / please it you to excuse the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyte of me / &amp; the yongthe that I am yet in / consyderȳge that there is none so well shodde but that they may slyde somtyme.</p>
