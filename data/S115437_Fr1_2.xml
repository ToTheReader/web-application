   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an excellent saying, which we finde in that diuine booke intituled <hi>THE FOLLOWING OF CHRIST: The felicitie, which is to be obtayned in this life, consists not, in the being able to preuent or auoid miseries, and crosses, which daily occurre; but in the patient and humble acceptation and sufferance thereof.</hi> For indeede, there is no such thing as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> not being encountred and crossed, some in one kinde, and some in another; some, by desolations of minde; some by infirmities of bodie; some by want of temporall mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, some by vnkindenesse of freinds; some by detraction against fame, some by suites in law; and some by persecution for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For these things lye as so manie snares, whereby to intrappe our patience, in this great Hospitall of the world; and some men are subject to more of them, and
<pb facs="3"/>some to fewer; but there is no man, who at one time or other, is not subiect to some. The businesse therefore must be, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte both such as Almighty God, shall either send for the punishmēt of our other sinnes, or for the greater purification and perfection of our owne soules; or for the aduancemēt of his owne glory otherwise; and such others also, as for the greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of wicked men, he shall permitt them to inflict vpon vs; and to supporte them so, through the fauour of God, as not onely thereby not to forfeite heauen in the next life, but to enable vs in the midst of all our miseries, to obtaine a kinde of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, euen in this. For I account it to be a kinde of heauen in the crowde of trouble, not to be ouerweighed with the burthen, but to accept, &amp; be content with the good will of God, and to aspire towards an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Passion of Christ our Lord, &amp; to know and feele in our very harts, the substantiall &amp; sauorie truth of that diuine saying of S. Iean Chrisostome: <hi>It is a more glorious thing for a man to suffer for Christ, then to raigne with him.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But now, as this doctrine is diuine, so the lesson, whereby we are to learne it, is
<pb facs="3"/>hard; and therefore we shall doe well to vse the best meanes, we can, to take it out. And for my parte I must confesse, that I haue neuer mett in anie Authour, with so manie, so weightie, so easie, and practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble considerations, and inducements to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards not onely the patient, but euen the ioyfull sufferance of all those crosses and afflictions, which can finde the way to vs in this world, as are deliuered by <hi>FATHER AVILA</hi> in his Epistles; whereof I haue selected the chiefe, and choice, and made them speake with our tongue; to the end, that we may be the better taught, to beare those burthens of affliction, which may otherwise proue too hard and heauie, for our soft shoulders of flesh and bloud. And I am confidently perswaded, that besides the entertainement, which the reader will finde therein otherwise, for his delight and gust; it will be impossible for him, to haue had, or haue a crosse of anie kinde, for which he shall not heere finde store of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and comforts brought to his hand. So that he will owe a diligent, and deuout reading to this Collection; if not for the Author's or Translator's sake, yet at least, for his owne.</p>
