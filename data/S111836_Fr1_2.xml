   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Princely bountie of your blessed hand (most gracious Soueraigne) comforting and supporting my poore old decaying life, of right challengeth the trauels in my studie, the labours of my bodie, and the prayers of my deuotions to be wholly imployed for your Highnesse, and altogether dedicated to your seruice. Wherein whilest I striue to bring in open shew some small per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of my most humble dutie to your sacred Maiestie, mine owne vnworthinesse amazeth me with trembling feare for my presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that your Highnesse matchlesse grace to so many your most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable vertues offer my pardon. Vnder which I present in all humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse into your Maiesties sacred hands this my second translation of the late addition of fifteene other liues, vnto those former in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> published for benefite of my country, vnder protection of the most royall name of your most gracious Maiestie. And albeit in respect of my selfe I offer but dutie, which I wish I could in other and better sort per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme: yet I am the rather emboldned herein, for that the famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of renowmed Emperours, mightie Kings, worthie Chieftaines and Generals of armies yea and of two famous Philosophers <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> being the whole subiect of this second translation, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily published vnder your Maiesties patronage. Whose rare vertues and wonderfull wisedome, neither former mightie kings, nor learned Philosophers might equall: from whose blessed fortunes many oppressed Kings, and distressed kingdomes haue sought and found their succors:
<pb facs="3"/>
and whose most honourable and most happy peaceable gouernement, is worlds wonder to all posteritie.</p>
   <p>Wherefore most gracious and most blessed Soueraigne, I beseech your Princely fauour to accept with grace the simple performance of your poore vnworthie seruant his most humble seruice, whose soule with heartiest prayer according to his most bounden dutie, continually calleth vnto God for preseruation of your most royall person, in all honour, health, and happinesse, and so still to raigne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs.</p>
