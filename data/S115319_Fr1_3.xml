                 <title>The perpetuitie of a regenerate mans estate : VVherein it is manifestly proued by sundry arguments, reasons and authorities. That such as are once truly regenerated and ingrafted into Christ by a liuely faith, can neither finally nor totally fall from grace. It is also proued, that this hath beene the receiued and resolued doctrine, of all the ancient fathers, of all the Protestant churches and writers beyond the seas, and of the Church of England. All the principall arguments that are, or may be obiected against it, either from Scripture, or from reason, are here likewise cleared and answered. By William Prynne Gent: Lincolniensis</title>

   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, when as I had well considered with my selfe the great danger and combustion that was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to befall our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> by reason of some dangerous points of <hi>Pelagianisme, Poperie,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianisme,</hi> which some factious and nouillizing spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, haue lately broched and set on foote among vs, as the receiued positiue and resolued doctrines, not only of the <hi>Scriptures, Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> in forraine parts, but likewise of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> I supposed, that I could not performe a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter peece of seruice to God, or to our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> then to cast in my <hi>Mite</hi> among the rest, and to indeauour according to my poore ability, to stoppe the streame and current of these late reuiued and new minted <hi>Errors;</hi> which by reason of the learning, fame and greatnesse of their <hi>Patrons,</hi> and the deprauation of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which is alwayes more propense and prone to Error, then to truth and holinesse) are like to threaten a generall and vniuersall deluge to our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> if authority preuent them not in time, Vpon this I resolued to put my penne to Paper, and thereupon I selected and culled out from among the rest, this hereticall and pernicious <hi>Error, Of the totall and finall Apostacie of the Saints from grace,</hi> to combate and to grapple with. The reasons which moued me to single out this one aboue all, or any of the rest, were these. First, because this <hi>Error</hi> is most of all insisted and stood vpon, and is more peremptorily maintained and d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>fended then any of the rest; and therefore requires the speediest and the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest opposition. Secondly, because this <hi>Error</hi> by reason of a misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported conferēce, hath drawne more disciples and parties after it, than any of the rest, it hath found more <hi>Patrons</hi> of late among vs,
<pb facs="6"/>
than any other <hi>Error</hi> that I know; and therefore I thought that I should doe the greatest good, in opposing and suppressing the most infectious and spreading <hi>Error.</hi> Thirdly, I made choyce of this aboue the rest, because it was a part of <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> heretofore, and it is but a point of pure <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Arminianisme</hi> now: and therefore I presumed that I might with greater boldnesse and audacitie, and with lesse offence to any, aduenture to refell it: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, since those who now defend it, produce no other reasons, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, answers, or authorities, than those which the <hi>Pelagians, Papists,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> haue framed and collected to their hands before, without any new addition of their owne. Fourthly, I made choyce of this, to vindicate the <hi>Church of England,</hi> the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> in forraine parts, from the false calumnies of those, who would make all these the <hi>Patrons</hi> of this <hi>Error,</hi> when as they haue all with one vnanimous consent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, censured and refuted it, yea, and resolued against it, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a dangerous and hereticall position. Fifely, I made choyce of this, because the sound confutation of it, will ouerthrow the whole frame and fabricke of <hi>Arminianisme:</hi> it will likewise out off a great part of <hi>Poperie,</hi> and it will in effect suppresse and quite sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, the most of all those <hi>Errors</hi> Which haue beene lately broched among vs. For if this <hi>totall and finall Apostacie of the Saints,</hi> bee once proued to be but an <hi>Error:</hi> then the doctrines of <hi>Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Grace; of Free-will; of Election from the fore-sight of saith; that such men as were neuer elected to saluation haue true saith: that the number of the elect is vncertaine: that the sinnes of the Saints doe cut them off from Christ, that all these who are baptized are regenerated: that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conuey grace alike to all</hi> ex opere operato: <hi>that there are some sinnes which are not mortall in their owne nature: that men ought to doubt, and that they cannot be certainely assured of their owne saluation without some speciall reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: that Grace is but a morall perswasion, and that men may receiue it or reiect it at their pleasure: that such as are not elected to saluation, are true members of the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church: that such as are not predestinated may bee saued.</hi> Yea, <hi>the Sacrifice of the Masse, Purgatory, Popish
<pb facs="6"/>
pennance and Indulgencies,</hi> will all to wrecke, and fall vnto the ground: So many other Errors are there which depend on this. Sixtly, I made choyce of this aboue the rest, because it is an <hi>Error</hi> of greatest consequence. For it derogates very much from all Gods great and holy attributes; from his glorie, mercy, honour, goodnesse, truth, wisdome, iustice, power, and the rest: it dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from Christs intercession, and the merits of his death and passion: it detracts very much from the Deity, might, power, essi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacte, truth, and working of the holy Ghost: it quite ouerthrowes and disanulls the Scriptures, and the very kingdome, nature, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> and power of true and sauing grace: it robs the Saints of God of all their happinesse, ioy and comfort: it stripps and spoyles them of all their spirituall priuiledges, of all the treasures of their soules, and leaues them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, poore and miserable, where else they were the onely, happy, and blessed of the Lord: In a word, it strikes at the very roote of all true religion; it pulls God out of heauen: and it either makes men <hi>Atheists,</hi> to haue no God at all, or at least to haue no God besides themselues. These and many other, are the ineuitable consequencies of this <hi>Error,</hi> which as they are many, so are they very great and dangerous. Laftly, I made choyce of this aboue the rest, because it is not (as some surmize) a <hi>notionall and speculatiue Error,</hi> fit onely for <hi>Schooles</hi> and <hi>Schollers</hi> to know, and to determine; but it is a <hi>practicall Error,</hi> and a point which trencheth farre into the practice of Christianitie: it is a point and <hi>Error</hi> that concernes not only the learnedest, but the very lowest and meanest Christians; it extends it selfe alike to all, and therefore the more needfull is it to refell it. Questions which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the nature and the truth of Grace, the Perpetuitie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Grace, extend indifferently to all those to whom grace it selfe extends, to one as much as to another, because they are alike vsefull and necessary vnto all, be they learned or vnlearned. Now this being a question concerning the very nature essence, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of true and sauing grace, extends alike to all men, and it is of great vse and moment, euen in their very practice of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>. Yea, I will affirme it, that there is no one thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> which will more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> men in the practice of religion, then this one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Error, <hi>that they may fall totally &amp; finally from grace.</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
For if Ministers should preach and publish this for orthodox and current truth; that true grace is of a corruptible and fading na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that it is such a thing as may be lost, when once it is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; who is there that would seeke it or respect it; who is there that either would or could preferre his profit and his pleasures, his riches and his honours farre before it? who is there that would part with these to purchase it, when as they were not sure to inioy it? when as they might be dispossessed of it at the last? If grace might vtterly be lost, if it were a transitorie and fading good, men would not, nay, men could not loue it or affect it; they would not part with any other thing to win and purchase it: euery man would then loue and serue his owne lusts and pleasures, you should haue none at all to loue or serue the Lord. Besides if this were true, <hi>that men might fall from grace,</hi> what comforts or incouragements could Christians giue vnto themselues or others? If a man should come to any one that was perplexed in his conscience, or to a dying Christian, if this were true, <hi>that true regenerate men might fall from grace,</hi> what comfort could he giue them? Should hee magnifie Gods grace and mercy to them in Christ? Should he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate those comfortable and pretious promises of grace and mercie which are euery where recorded in the Scriptures? should hee tell them that they haue liued a godly and religious life? That they are in a happy condition and state of grace? that they are the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the Lord? that Christ hath prepared an euerlasting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and a crowne of glory for them in heauen, and therefore they need not for to doubt or dispaire of Gods mercy? Alas, all these might be wiped off with this one answer; we are fallen quite away from the state of grace by these and these our sinnes; if not, we are sure to commit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> sinne or other ere we die, which will vtterly seuer and cut vs off from Christ for euer; and therefore all these promises and comforts which you bring, they belong to others not to vs, our soules can take no comfort in them. Doubtlesse there is not a Christian in the world, which could administer any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>oy or comfort at all, vnto his owne or other mens soules, if true regenerate men might fall from grace at last, and lose the fruite and benefit of all their workes and graces. Againe, what comfort or incouragement could any Christian haue, to doe or suffer any thing for the Lord
<pb facs="7"/>
if this were true? Who is there that would spend his life and dayes in doing of Gods seruice? Who is there that would suffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution and afflictions, that would vndergoe disgrace, contempt and scorne, or fire and fagot for the Lord, if he might after all this fall from grace, and lose the things which hee had wrought? Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans could haue no comfort or incouragement at all, to doe or suffer any thing for Christ, if this were true. Againe, in what a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and forlorne estate should poore Christians be in dubious, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, and dangerous times, if this position were grounded in their hearts, that <hi>they might fall from grace?</hi> then they were not sure of heauen, they were not sure of earth; they were vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of this present life, but more vncertaine of the life to come: they then should haue no certaintie at all of any thing; they should haue nothing left them on which to stay or rest their soules: they should haue horrors within, and feares without; troubles and doubts within, and crosses and afflictions without: that curse of God which is denounced against all disobedient and impenitent sinners should light vpon them. <hi>Among the nations they should finde no<note place="margin">Deu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
               <desc>•…</desc>
            </gap>. 28. 65, 66, 67.</note> ease, neither should the sole of their foote take any rest; but the Lord should giue them a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, aud sorrow of minde: and their liues should hang in doubt before them, and they should feare day and night, and haue none assurance of their liues; In the morning they should say, would it were euen, and at euen they should say, would God it were mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>ing; for the feare of their heart wherewith they should feare, and for the sight of their eyes which they should see;</hi> they should then finde no ease, no rest or comfort to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ir soules at all, and so they must needs sinke and perish in dispaire: Where as if they had this pillar to rest and stay their soules vpon, that they can neuer fall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>rom grace, nor be depriued of the loue of God: that let what will befall their bodies, their soules are sure to be safe: that <hi>though their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 16.</note> man perish, yet their inward man shall be renewed day by day: that though their earthly house of this tabernacle<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1.</note> were dissolued, yet they haue a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternall in the heauens;</hi> this would comfort and reioyce their soules beyond expression, this would beare
<pb facs="8"/>
them vp in all extremities, and keepe them from sinkeing in dispaire. So that you see, that the whole comfort and treasure of a Christian, that the whole seruice of God, and practice of religion are vtterly abolished and taken away by this pernicious <hi>Error;</hi> and therefore I made choyce of this aboue any of the rest, to combate and to grapple with, especially in these dubious and ambiguous times of ours, wherein we need an anchor on which to stay our soules. But now some men may thinke my labour vaine and needlesse, and perchance vnseasonable to, because so many Worthies of our <hi>Church,</hi> haue so lately handled and discussed this our present <hi>Controuersie.</hi> To wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ch I answer first, That the slacknesse of the Printer (in whose hands this worke hath beene pending euer since L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>nt last) hath turned these my <hi>First fruites</hi> into <hi>Gleanings,</hi> against my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and intent: and therefore if you returne a Tardè to them, let the Printer beare the blame, not I. Secondly, I answer, that though many haue lately handled and discussed this very controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in the by, conioyning it with other points; yet none of them haue handled it particularly, and indiuidually by it selse, as I haue done it. Yea, I may with modestie affirme it, without any pride, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, or selfe-conceite, that there was neuer any hitherto who hath written of this controu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>rsie, that hath handled and discussed it so fully and perspicuously, as I haue done it here. I haue produced many more arguments and reasons, and cited more quotations from <hi>Scriptures, Fathers, Councells, Synods, Confessions, and moderne Diuines</hi> to confute this <hi>Error,</hi> and I haue giuen more cleere, full, and satisfactorie answers to most of those arguments that are brought for to defend it, than any yet haue done, that I could reade or heare of. And therefore notwithstanding, that so many haue lately written of this subiect; I hope that these my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours (which I haue vndertaken in the synceritie of my heart, for the glory of God, for the peace and quiet of this our <hi>Church</hi> for the vindicating of the truth, and for the comfort and consolation of all such faithfull Christians as shall be made partakers of them) shall finde such approbation and acceptance in the world, that they shall neither be condemned as vntimely, nor loathed as superfluous. And here (Courteous Reader) to free my selfe from causelesse cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, I must intreate these few courtesies at thine hands. First, that
<pb facs="8"/>
where thou findest any mistakes or slips in words or letters in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this Treatise, that thou wouldest take the paines for to amend them; imputing the fault vnto the Corrector and not vnto my selfe. Secondly, that when thou findest the same reasons, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Arguments, or answers reiterated and repeated in seuerall places of this discourse, that thou would<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>st not forth-with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne me of <hi>Battologie</hi> and <hi>Surplusage,</hi> because they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies vrged and recited in a different forme and manner, and to other ends and purposes then they were before: so that though they are almost the same in words and matter, yet they alwayes differ in circumstances, forme, and end, and in the manner of propounding them; so that in truth they are not the same, though <hi>prima facie</hi> they may seeme to be the same. Thirdly, I would request thee so to censure and iudge of these my labours, as thou wouldest haue me and others to censure and to iudge of thine, if thou thy selfe hadst written. Lastly, since the generall end and scope of these my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, is nothing else but to vindicate and cleere, the honour and the truth of God: to establish peace and vnitie in this our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> that this our present controuersie, and those others which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon it, may no more molest and trouble them: and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and reioyce the hearts and soules of all the true and faithfull Saints of God, in these ambiguous, doubtfull, and perplexed times, (whose only ioy and comfort, whose onely stay and proppe, whose ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heauen vpon earth and chiefest happinesse, lie all at stake, and are suspended on this present Controuersie:). I would request thee so to reade and meditate on these my rude and indegested labours, as if thou didst vnfainedly desire for to learne and profite by them, and to diue into the truths contained in them. Reade them with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and impartiall eye, and with an vpright and an honest heart, voide of all criticall fore-stalled and preiudicated affections. Reade them with a meeke and humble spirit, not to carpe or quarrell with them, but willingly to yeeld and to submit vnto them as far as truth and conscience will permit: and if thou shalt receiue any benefit, comfort, or sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>isfaction from them, giue God the glory, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
