   <head>THE AVTHOR HIS PREFACE TO THE <hi>READER.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRISTIAN Reader, we cannot sufficiently bewaile the Iniquity of these last and worst dayes of the world, in which the crying and scarlet sinne of Murther makes so ample, and so bloody a progression: for we can now searce turne our eare or eye any where, but wee shall be enforced, either to heare with pitty the mournefull effects, or to see with griefe the lamentable Tragedies thereof: as if we now so much degenerated from our selves, or our hearts from our soules, to thinke that <note n="a" place="margin">Psal 23. 1.</note>
      <hi>Christ were no longer our Shepheard:</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 100. 3.</note>
      <hi>or we the sheepe of his Pasture:</hi> or as if we were become such wretched and execrable Atheists, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 25. 34. 41</note>
      <hi>There were no Heaven, to reward the Righteous: or Hell, to punish the ungodly.</hi> But if we will divert our hearts from Earth to Heaven, and raise and erect our soules from Satan to God, we shall then not onely see what engendereth this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall passion in us: but also find the meanes to detest and roote it out from amongst us.</p>
   <p>To which end it is requisite, wee first consider, that our enemies, who oppose our tranquillity in this life, and our felicity in that to come, are neither so few in number, nor so weake in power, that we should thinke our selves able to vanquish, ere we fight with them: for wee have to encounter with the bewitching World, the alluring Flesh, and the inticing Devill: not with three simple Souldiers or poore Pigmies, but with three valiant and puissant Chief-taines, subtill to incampe dangerous to assaile, and powerfull to fight.</p>
   <p>The World, that it may bewitch us to its will, assailes us with Wealth, Riches, Dignities, Honours, Preferments, Sumptuous houses, perfumed Beds, Vessels of gold and silver, Pompous Apparell, Delicious fare, variety of sweet Musick, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, Maskes and Stage-playes, delicate Horses, rich Coaches, and infinite Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, with a thousand other inticements and allurements.</p>
   <p>The Flesh presents us with Youth, Beauty. <hi>The</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 16.</note>
      <hi>lust of the eye, and the pride of life: with</hi>
      <note n="e" place="margin">Col. 3. 5.</note>
      <hi>inordinate affection and lascivious desires,</hi> with a piercing eye, a vermillion cheeke, golden haire, and a slender waste: and although it discover us not all these perfections of nature in one personage: yet, he shewes us most of them in divers, and then if any thing want to captivate our affections, wee shall heare them marry their <hi>Syren</hi> voices, to their owne Lutes and Vialls, or their dancing feete to those of others: or if this will not suffice, then Perfuming, Powdering, Crisping, Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Amorous kisses, Sweet smiles, Suggered speeches, Wanton embracings, and Lascivious dalliance, will uudertake to play a World in love. On the other side, Strength, Nimblenesse, Agility of body, Sloth, Luxurie, Gluttonie, Intemperancie,
<pb facs="6"/>
Drunkennesse, Voluptuousnesse and Sensuality will cast us out so faire (I meane so treacherous) a lure, as if we stoope thereto, we shall buy our pleasure with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and our delight therein, will prove our ruine and destruction.</p>
   <p>And now, if neither the World, nor the flesh can intangle, or insnare our hearts, <hi>Then comes the Devill</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet. 5 8.</note>
      <hi>that roaring Lyon, who wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap>tes about, seeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure, that mortall enemy, and</hi>
      <note n="g" place="margin">Revel. 12. 9.</note>
      <hi>Arch-traytor to our soules, that</hi>
      <note n="h" place="margin">Ioh 12. 31. Ephes. 6. 12.</note>
      <hi>Prince of darkenesse,</hi> whose subtilty is the more dangerous, and malice the more fatall, <hi>in that he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes himselfe into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi>
      <note n="i" place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 14.</note>
      <hi>Angell of light, thereby to make us heires and slaves of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure kingdome:</hi> yea, he will proffer us more, then either our tongues can demand, or our hearts desire: for all the pompe, treasure and pleasures of the World, yea, all that is in the World, and <note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 4. 6. 7.</note> the world it selfe, hee will prostrate and give us, if we will consent to obey him, and promise to fall downe and adore him; and for a pledge of his infernall bounty and liberality, hee will puffe us up with Pride, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie, Ambition, Vaine-glory, Ostentation, Disdaine, Covetousnesse, Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, Affectation, Confidence, Security; and if all these allurements will not prevaile to subdue us, hee hath yet reserved Troopes and Forces, and another string to his Bow: for then exchanging his smiles into frownes, and his calmes to stormes, hee will give us Pensivenesse, Griefe of mind and body, Affliction, Sorrow, Discontent, Choler, Envie, Indignation, Despaire, Revenge, and the like.</p>
   <p>Yea, he will watch us at every turne, and waite on us at every occasion: for are we bent to revenge, hee will blow the coales to our choler: are wee given to sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and discontent, hee will thrust and hale us on to Despaire: are wee incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Wantonnesse, and Lasciviousnesse, he will fit us with meanes and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to accomplish our carnall desires: or are wee addicted to covetousnesse and honours, hee will either cause us to breake our hearts, or our necks, to obtaine it: for it is indifferent to him, either how or in what manner we inlarge and fill up the empty roomes of his vast and infernall kingdome.</p>
   <p>Thus wee see how powerfull our three capitall enemies are, yea, what a cloud, nay, what a world of subordinate meanes and instruments they have, not onely to insnare, but to destroy us. yea, not onely to conquer our hearts, but which is worse, to make ship-wracke of our soules? And from hence comes our misery: yea, from these three fatall trees we gather the bitter fruit of our perdition.</p>
   <p>But against all these temptations and dangers, against all these our professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in generall, and each of them in particular: We may swimme in the Ocean of the world without drowning, and pilgrimage upon the face of the earth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out terrour or destruction, if we will consider, and in considering remember that <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 1. 27. Psal. 115. 6.</note>
      <hi>God is our Creator,</hi>
      <note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 21. 11. 25.</note>
      <hi>Christ our Saviour, and the Holy Ghost our Sanctifier and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter:</hi> that wee are honoured with the resemblance of God, whose stampe and character we beare, and inriched with immortall and <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 2. 7.</note> living soules: which sacred priviledges and divine prerogatives lift us up by many degrees of excellencie <note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 1. 28.</note> above the rest of all his creatures, whom hee hath made for our service, and <note n="q" place="margin">Isay. 43. 21.</note> we onely to serve and glorifie him: That he hath made the world for a thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and us as Passengers: That <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 13. 14.</note> we have no abiding Citie here, but must seeke one in the World to come: That the World is ours but for a season, and Heaven our patrimony and inheritance for ever: That the pompe and pleasures thereof are but transitory and temporary, and that the vanity thereof passeth away as dust or <note n="s" place="margin">Psal. 102 3.

      <note n="t" place="margin">Psal. 39. 5.</note>
      <hi>our flesh is but like flowers that fade, and grasse that withereth,</hi> but a masse of corruption, a tabernacle of clay, and a coffin of dust and ashes: that the best

of its beauty is but <note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </note> vanity and deformity, and the end of its bravery, but rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and putrifaction: If I say, wee spurne at the vanity of the world, contemne the pleasures of the flesh, and scoffe at the temptations of Sathan, using the first, as if we vsed it not, making the second <hi>the Temple of the Holy Ghost, and not the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a harlot,</hi> and that we are so farre from fearing, as we defie the third, <note n="x" place="margin">Coloss. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note>
      <hi>Setting our affections on things that are above, and not on things of the earth:</hi> for if we will be heires of the Church triumphant, wee must bee first souldiers of the Militant, and so following the advice and direction of the Apostle, stand against all these our enemies, <note n="y" place="margin">Ephes. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </note>
      <hi>Having the whole spirituall Armour girt about us, as the girdle of Truth, the Brest-plate of Righteousnesse, the Shield of Faith, the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the spirit,</hi> not to catch at these allurements, or to be caught by them; not to strike sayle, or stoope to these afflictions, or to hang downe our heads, as if wee gave way to them, or were contented that our weakenesse should yeeld to their strength; or our joyes to their afflictions: rather to stand up couragiously, and to expell and resist manfully, considering that wee are not onely heires, but coheires with Iesus Christ, in the participation and felicity of that heavenly <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> whose joyes are infinite, and glory eternall.</p>
   <p>I deny not but afflictions, and temptations may befall us, yea, I acknowledge they are subject and incident to the best and dearest of Gods children, whom hee will try in the fire, to see whether they will prove silver, or drosse: yea, hee will come with his Fan and winnow them, to see whether they are Wheat or Chaffe, Corne of Darnell: But the Children of God should <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 5. 3.</note>
      <hi>rejoyce in tribulations,</hi> and <note n="c" place="margin">Iames 1. 2.</note>
      <hi>account it exceeding joy, when they are tempted:</hi> yea, they must consider <note n="d" place="margin">Iam. 1. 13, 14.</note> that <hi>God tempteth no man with evill:</hi> but it is our owne concupiscence that drawes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeth us to it. In which respect, wee may justly say, it is a folly to hearken to temptation, but a misery and madnesse to follow and embrace it.</p>
   <p>For why should discontent cast us into despaire, except wee will resemble the foolish Saylor, who abandoneth the Helme in a storme, when he hath most neede to use it? or the simple fish, that leapes from the pan to the fire; Or those igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant fooles, who, to shelter themselves from the raine, run into the river? For are we tempted? <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 73. 23.</note>
      <hi>The Lord will hold us up by his right hand,</hi> yea, <note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 9. 10.</note>
      <hi>hee will not faile those that seeke him: For he is</hi>
      <note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 18. 2.</note>
      <hi>our Rocke and our fortresse, our shield and our refuge,</hi> yea, <note n="h" place="margin">Hos. 6. 1.</note>
      <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee hath wounded us, hee will bind up our wounds.</hi> And that wee may yet see a farther benefit, that accrueth to those that are tempted, let us read with joy, and retaine with comfort, that <note n="i" place="margin">Iames 1. 12.</note>
      <hi>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation, hee shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Crowne of life, which the Lord hath promised to those that love him:</hi> yea <note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 125. 1.</note>
      <hi>they that trust in the Lord, shall bee as Mount Sion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>When therefore (amongst other temptations) choller so farre prevaileth with us, (or rather the Devill with our choller) that wee imagine mischiefe in our hearts, or life up our hands against our Christian brother; let us then consider what the Apostle tels us from God: <note n="l" place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 11.</note>
      <hi>Hee that hateth his brother, walketh in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and knoweth not whither he goeth:</hi> yea, <note n="m" place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. 10.</note>
      <hi>He that loves not his brother, is not of God.</hi> Hath any one therefore offended thee? Why, consider hee is a man, and no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, and as subject to infirmities as thy selfe; as also, that he is thy brother by Creation and Adoption, by Nature and by Grace, and that hee beares the same Image and Resemblance of God, as thy selfe dost: in which regard thou art counselled, <note n="n" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 26.</note>
      <hi>Not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> the Sunne goe downe on thy wrath:</hi>

      <hi>That thou seeke after Peace and follow it:</hi>
      <note n="p" place="margin">Coloss. 3 13.</note>

But some there are (yea alas, too too many) who are so <note n="r" place="margin">Psal. 145. 8.</note> hardned in their hearts and sinnes, and so resolute in their wilfulnesse, as in stead of rellishing, they distaste, and in stead of embracing, reject and disdaine this Christian advice and counsell, opening their thoughts and hearts to all vanities, or rather drawing up the Sluces and Flood-hatches to let in all impiety to their soules, they give way to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous baites of the World, to the alluring pleasures of the Flesh, and to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and fatall temptations of the Devill, and so cruelly imbrue their hands in the innocent blood of their Christian brethren; and although the murthers of <note n="s" place="margin">Gen. 4. 8.</note>

      <hi>Iehu</hi> his Sonnes by <hi>Athaliah</hi> for Revenge (with their severall punishments which God inflicted on them for these their hainous and horrible crimes) are presidents enough fearefull and bloody, to make any Christian heart dissolve into pittie, and regenerate soule melt into teares: yet sith new examples ingender and produce fresh effects of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and compassion, and as it were, leave and imprint a sensible memory thereof in our hearts and understandings, therefore I thought it a worke as worthy of my labour (as that labour of a Christian) to collect thirty severall Tragicall Histories, which for thy more ease, and perfecter memory, I have digested into sixe severall Bookes; that observing, and seeing herein, as in a Christall mirrour, the variety of the Devils temptations, and the allurements of sinne, wherewith these weake Christians (the Authors and Actors hereof) suffered themselves to bee carried away and seduced: Considering, I say, the foulnesse of their facts in procuring the deaths of their Christian brethren, some through blood, others through poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as also Gods miraculous detection and severe punishment thereof, in reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging blood for blood, and death for death; yea, many times repaying it home with interest, and rewarding one death with many, that the consideration of these bloody and mournfull Tragedies, may by their examples, strike astonishment to our thoughts, and amazement to our senses, that the horrour and terrour thereof may hereafter retaine and keepe us within the lists of Charity towards men, and the bonds of filiall and religious obedience towards God, who tels us by his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Prophet <note n="z" place="margin">Psa. 7. 14, 15</note>that <hi>Whosoever makes a pit for others, shall fall into it himselfe: for his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief will returne upon his own head, and his cruelty fall upon his own pate.</hi> Which we shall see verified in these, who seduced partly by sinne, but chiefly by Sathan, who is the Author thereof, forgot the counsell of the Apostle, <note n="a" place="margin">Iam. 5. 13.</note>
      <hi>If any one be afflicted, let him pray:</hi> and grived, <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 61. 8.</note>
      <hi>to powreforth their hearts before God:</hi> not considering <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 15. 15</note> the efficacie thereof, <hi>nor how</hi> Moses <hi>made the bitter waters of</hi> Marah <hi>sweet thereby:</hi> yea they builded not their faiths on God, and his promises, on Christ and his Church, on his Gospell and his Sacrament, but spurned at all these Divine comforts, and spirituall blessings: yea, and trampled that sweet-smelling Sacrifice of prayer under their feete, which is the Antidote and preservative of the soule against sin, and the Bulwarke to expell all the fiery and bloody darts of Sathans temptations: yea, the very ladder whereby both the aspirations and ejaculations of our soules mount unto God, and his benefits and mercies descend unto us: and this, and only this, was both the Prologue to their destruction, and their destruction it selfe: the which I present unto the view, not only of thine eyes, but of thy heart and soule: because it is a Vertue in us to looke on other mens Vices with hatred and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, imitating herein the wise and skilfull Pilot, who mournes to see the Rockes, whereon his neighbours have suffered shipwracke: and yet againe rejoyceth, that by the sight thereof he may avoid his owne: which indeed is the true way, both to secure our safety, and to prevent our destruction, as well of the Temporall life
<pb facs="7"/>
of our bodies in this World, as the Spirituall of our soules in that to come.</p>
   <p>I must farther advertise thee, that I have purposely fetched these Tragicall Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from forraine parts: because it grieves mee to report and relate those that are too frequently committed in our owne Countrey, in respect the misfortune of the dead may perchance either afflict, or scandalize their living friends; who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther want matter of new consolation, then cause of reviving old sorrowes, or because the iniquity of the times is such, that it is as easie to procure many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as difficult to purchase one true friend: In which respect, I know that divers, both in matters of this, and of other natures, have beene so cautious to disguise and maske their Actors, under the vailes of other names and sometimes beene inforced to lay their Scenes in strange and unknowne Countries.</p>
   <p>For mine owne part, I have illustrated and polished these Histories, yet not fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them according to the modell of mine owne fancies, but of their passions, who have represented and personated them: and therefore if in some places they seeme too amorous, or in others too bloody, I must justly retort the imperfection thereof on them, and not thy selfe on mee: sith I only represent what they have acted, and give that to the publike, which they obscurely perp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>rated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> private.</p>
   <p>My intent, desire, and prayer is, that if thou art strong in Christ, the perusing and reading of these Histories may confirme thy faith, and thy defiance of all sinnes in generall, and of Murther in particular, or if thou art but weake in the rules of Christian fortitude and piety, that hereby it may incourage and arme thee against the allurements of the World and the Flesh; but especially against the snares and inticements of the Devill, which may stirre thee up either to Wrath, Despaire, Revenge, or Murther: that by the contemplation thereof, thou maist resemble the Bee, and not the Spider, and so draw honey from all flowers, but poison from none.</p>
   <p>It shall be the felicity of my thoughts, and the glory of my content and labour, if by the sight of these Histories, thou reape any Spirituall comfort or incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this <hi>Christian Warfare</hi> against the World, the Flesh and the Devill, our three professed and fatall enemies: or if thou wilt bee so wilfully negligent of thine owne good, as to ride poast by other mens sinnes and vices, yet with leisure take a curious and exact survey of thine owne, and in seeing them, not onely endeavour, but strive to reforme them.</p>
   <p>If this first Booke of my Tragicall Histories worke any good effect in thee, in causing thee to assume and take on a resolution to hate these sinnes in thy selfe, and to detest them in others; then the five other parts which I owe to my promise, and the frontispice to thee, shall not bee kept backe, or with-held thee, but in due time succeed this their elder sister: having purposely enlarged thee this my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, because this one shall serve for all sixe bookes, at least, if the rest be so happy to see the world, or I so fortunate, that the World may see them. In the meane time, hoping that thy courtesie and charity will wincke at some defects and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, which may herein have slipt either from my Pen, or the Presse, and whereof the malice of some, or peradventure the ignorance of others may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse themselves, by condemning me; I recommend these my labours, from their passion, to thy friendship; from their censure, to thy judgement: and us all to the protection of <note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 30. 20.</note> God, <hi>who is our life, and the strength of our dayes.</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 104. 31</note>
      <hi>To whom be glory for evermore.</hi>
