      <hi>TEmpus adest plausus aurea pompa venit,</hi> so endes the Sceane of Idiots, and enter <hi>Astrophel</hi> in pompe. Gentlemen that haue seene a thousand lines of folly, drawn forth <hi>ex vno puncto impudentiae,</hi> &amp; two famous Mountains to goe to the conception of one Mouse, that haue had your eares deafned with the eccho of Fames bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen towres, when only they haue been toucht with a leaden pen, that haue seene <hi>Pan</hi> sitting in his bower of delights, &amp; a number of <hi>Midasses</hi> to admire his miserable hornepipes, let not your surfeted sight, new come frō such puppetplay, think scorne to turn aside into this Theater of pleasure, for here you shal find a paper stage streud with pearle, an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial heau'n to ouershadow the faire frame, &amp; christal wals to encounter your curious eyes, whiles the tragicommody of loue is performed by starlight. The chiefe Actor here is <hi>Melpomene,</hi> whose dusky robes dipt in the ynke of teares, as yet seeme to drop when I view them neere. The argument cruell chastitie, the Prologue hope, the Epilogue dispaire, <hi>videte queso et linguis animisque fauete.</hi> And here peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, my witles youth may be taxt with a margent note of presumption, for offering to put vp any motion of applause in the behalfe of so excellent a Poet, (the least sillable of whose name sounded in the eares of iudgement, is able to giue the meanest line he writes a dowry of immortality) yet those that obserue how iewels oftētimes com to their hands that know not their value, &amp; that the cockscombes of our daies, like <hi>Esops</hi> Cock, had rather haue a Barly kernell wrapt vp in a Ballet, then they wil dig for the welth of wit in any ground that they know not, I hope wil also hold me excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, though I open the gate to his glory, &amp; inuite idle eares to the admiration of his melancholy.</p>
   <l>Quid petitur sacris nisi tantum fama poetis.</l>
   <p>Which although it be oftentimes imprisoned in Ladyes casks, &amp; the president bookes of such as cannot see without another mans spectacles, yet at length it breakes foorth in spight of his keepers, and vseth some priuate penne (in steed of a picklock) to procure his violent enlargement.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>The Sunne for a time, may maske his golden head in a cloud: yet in the end, the thicke vaile doth vanish, and his embellished blandishment appeares. Long hath <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi> (Englands Sunne) withheld the beames of his spirite, from the common veiw of our darke sence, and night hath houered ouer the gardens of the nine Sisters, while <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> and grosse fatty flames (such as commonly arise out of Dunghilles) haue tooke occasion in the middest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse of his shining perfections, to wander a broade with a wispe of paper at their tailes like Hobgoblins, and leade men vp and downe in a circle of absurditie a whole weeke, and neuer know where they are. But nowe that cloude of sorrow is dissolued, which fierie Loue, exhaled from his dewie haire, and affection hath vnburthened the labouring streames of her wombe, in the lowe cesterne of his graue: the night hath resigned her iettie throne vnto <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and cleere daylight possesseth the skie that was dimmed; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore breake of your daunce you Fayries and Elues, and from the fieldes with the torne carcases of your Timbrils, for your kingdome is expired. Put out your rush candles, you Poets and Rimers, and bequeath your crazed quater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zayns to the Chaundlers, for loe, here he cōmeth that hath broēk your legs. <hi>Apollo</hi> hath resigned his Iuory Harp vnto <hi>Astrophel,</hi> &amp; he like <hi>Mercury,</hi> must lull you a sleep with his musicke. Sleepe <hi>Argus,</hi> sleep Ignorance, sleep Impudence, for <hi>Mercury</hi> hath <hi>Io,</hi> &amp; onely <hi>Io Paean</hi> belongeth to <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel.</hi> Deare <hi>Astrophel,</hi> that in the ashes of thy Loue, liuest againe like the <hi>Phoenix</hi>; ô might thy bodie (as thy name) liue againe likewise, here amongst vs: but the earth, the mother of mortalitie, hath snacht thee too soone into her chilled colde armes, and will not let thee by any meanes, be drawne from her deadly imbrace; and thy diuine Soule, carried on an Angels wings to heauen, is installed in <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> place, sole <hi>prolocutor</hi> to the Gods. Therefore mayest thou neuer returne from the <hi>Elisian</hi> fieldes like <hi>Orpheus,</hi> therefore must we euer mourne for our <hi>Orpheus.</hi>

prophane lamentation, drinkes in the riuers of those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paireful teares, which languorous ruth hath outwelled, &amp; bids me looke back to the house of honor, where frō one &amp; the selfe same roote of renowne, I shal find many goodly branches deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; such as with the spreading increase of their vertues, may somwhat ouershadow the griefe of his los. Amongst the which fayre sister of <hi>Phoebus,</hi> &amp; eloquent secretary to the Muses, most rare Countesse of <hi>Pembroke</hi> thou art not to be omitted: whom Artes doe adore as a second <hi>Minerua,</hi> and our Poets extoll as the Patronesse of their inuention; for in thee, the <hi>Lesbian Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho</hi> with her lirick Harpe is disgraced, &amp; the Laurel Garlande which thy Brother so brauely aduaunst on his Launce, is still kept greene in the Temple of <hi>Pallas.</hi> Thou only sacrificest thy soule to contemplation, thou only entertainest emptie handed <hi>Homer,</hi> &amp; keepest the springs of <hi>Castalia</hi> from being dryed vp. Learning, wisedom, beautie, and all other ornaments of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie whatsoeuer, seeke to approue themselues in thy sight, and get a further seale of felicity, from the smiles of thy fauour.</p>
   <l>O Ioue digna viro ni Ioue nata fores.</l>
   <p>I feare I shall be counted a mercenary flatterer, for mixing my thoughts with such figuratiue admiration, but generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that surpasseth my praise, condemneth my rethoricke of dulnesse for so colde a commendation. Indeede to say the truth, my stile is somewhat heauie gated, and cannot daunce trip and goe so liuely, with oh my loue, ah my loue, all my loues gone, as other Sheepheards that haue beene fooles in the Morris time out of minde: nor hath my prose any skill to imitate the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond leape verse, or sit tabring fiue yeres together nothing but to bee, to hee: on a paper drum. Onely I can keepe pace with Grauesend barge, and care not if I haue water enough, to lande my ship of fooles with the Tearme, (the tyde I shoulde say.) Now euery man is not of that minde, for some to goe the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter away, will take in their fraught of spangled feathers, golden Peebles, Straw, Reedes, Bulrushes, or any thing, and then they beare out their sayles as proudly, as if they were balisted with Bulbiefe. Others are so hardly bested for loading that they are faine to retaile the cinders of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the shiuers of broken
<pb facs="7"/>
trunchions, to fill vp their boate that else should goe empty: and if they haue but a pound weight of good Merchandise, it shall be placed at the poope, or pluckt in a thousande peeces to credit their carriage. For my part euery man as he likes, <hi>Mens cuinsque is est quisque.</hi> Tis as good to goe in cut fingerd Pumps as corke shooes, if one were Cornish diamonds on his toes. To explain it by a more familiar example, an Asse is no great state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the beastes common-wealth, though he weare his eares <hi>vpseuant musse,</hi> after the Muscouy fashion, &amp; hange the lip like a Capcase halfe open, or looke as demurely as a six penny browne loafe, for he hath some imperfections that do keepe him frō the cōmon Councel: yet of many, he is deemed a very vertuous mē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and one of the honestest sort of men that are; So that our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion (as <hi>Sextus Empedocus</hi> affirmeth) giues the name of good or ill to euery thing. Out of whose works (latelie translated into English, for the benefit of vnlearned writers) a man might col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a whole booke of this argument, which no doubt woulde proue a worthy commonwealth matter, and far better than wits waxe karnell: much good vvorship haue the Author.</p>
   <p>Such is this golden age vvherein vve hue, and so replenisht vvith golden Asses of all sortes, that if learning had lost it selfe in a groue of Genealogies, vvee neede doe no more but sette an olde goose ouerhalfe a dozen pottle pots, (vvhich are as it vvere the egges of inuention) and vvee shall haue such a breede of bookes within a little vvhile after, as vvill fill all the vvorld vvith the vvilde fovvle of good vvits; I can tell you this is a harder thing then making golde of quicksiluer, and vvill trouble you more then the Morrall of <hi>Aesops</hi> Glovv-vvorme, hath troubled our English Apes, vvho striuing to vvarme themselues, vvith the flame of the Philosophers stone, haue spent all their vvealth in buying bellovves to blovve this false fyre. Gentlemen, I feare I haue too much presumed on your idle leysure, and beene too bold, to stand talking all this vvhile in an other mans doore: but novv I will leaue you to suruey the pleasures of <hi>Paphos,</hi> and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your smiles on the Aulters of <hi>Venus.</hi>
