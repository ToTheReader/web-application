      <salute>Sir,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have read of gratitude, in Birds, and Beasts; of a <hi>Lions</hi> thankefulnesse to a <hi>Romane</hi> Captive; of a <hi>Storke</hi> which cast a precious Stone into the bosome of a Maide, which had healed her of a wound: Which deeds of Nature doe speake to me that Gospel <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.37. <hi>Vade &amp; tu fac similiter, Goe thou and doe likewise.</hi> Now if <hi>Solomon</hi> thought to shame the Sluggard into pains, by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to the busie <hi>Ant;</hi> Ile thinke
<pb facs="3"/>it, no disparagement, to learne in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Schoole, gratitude of a Bird. Those many favours of Love which your noble spirit hath heaped upon me, laid such a strickt siege to my thoughts, that I knew not how to res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue my selfe, but by this publike decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; wherein, whil'st I shew my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I proclaime my weaknesse; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve this censure (from the world) to bee a man guilty of gratitude: yet no matter, 'tis a lesse crime to commit an errour, then to forget a friend: and if <hi>Naaman</hi> did not remember his maide, which told him of the Prophet, I dare say, his ingratitude was a fouler disease then his leprosie. The last Summer, when <hi>Divine Justice</hi> had scattered us over all the Land, your house was my
<pb facs="3"/>noble <hi>Sanctuary;</hi> where I saw, as much Religion practised, as an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> can talke of; and such reverent conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in your private Chappell, that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience might there safely stand for a Lecture; and bending the knee (to the <hi>Jesus</hi> of men) would not loose a voyce, but get a blessing. And now, sir, for my royall entertainement, I present you with a paper paiment, <hi>this poore Sermon,</hi> which wear's no costly dresse; preach'd in a time of sadnes, when sorrow is the best eloquence. To your hands I ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and your religious Lady, who (to the glory of her Sex) sees her selfe oftner in a Booke then in a Glasse, and is so enamour'd with saving knowledg, that she resembles the Bee, which lives in honey, or the Birds of the fortunate
<pb facs="4"/>Ilands, which are nourished with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes. Now the good will of him that dwelt in the <hi>Bush,</hi> preserve you both, and your virgin sister (second to none in <hi>Vertue</hi>) who now increaseth the poore with <hi>Almes,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Mrs.</hi> Mary Puliney.</note> as she will hereafter <hi>Heaven</hi> with a <hi>Saint:</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> give you the blessing of <hi>Joseph,</hi> the precious things of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the precious things of the <hi>Earth;</hi> &amp; grant, that what you sowe beneath, you may reape above; God Almighty lead you by the hands, from <hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>Glory;</hi> 'tis the prayer of him who is, and ever will bee</p>
