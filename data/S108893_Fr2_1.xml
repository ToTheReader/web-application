   <head>THE PROLOGVE OF the first Booke.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>AY ye, surely it shall be well with the iust. Esay 3.</hi> This is the embassage which GOD in times past sent to all the iust by the Prophet Esay, short and briefe in words, but most copious, and exceeding rich in rewards and benefits. Men are wont to be liberall in promises, but niggards and couetous in performance of them: God, after a contrary manner, is so liberall &amp; bountifull in performance, that the words of his promise, are much lesse then his deede and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration. For what could be spoken more briefely, then <hi>Say yee, surely it shall be well with the iust?</hi> But ō, how many &amp; how great be the blessings, which are contained vnder this small word <hi>Well?</hi> Which I thinke so to be left without any extention or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifying, that men might vnderstand, that it is impossible, that it should be expressed according to the veritie &amp; nature of the thing: neither that this litle word should be vnderstood of these or those blessings, but of all kinde of blessings, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended vnder this word <hi>Well,</hi> without any limitation.</p>
   <p>For thys cause it was aunswered to Moses of the Lord, when he asked, what was his name; <hi>I am that I am</hi>: no other word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.</note> that God might signifie, that his being could not bee circumscribed or defined with words; but that it was a thing v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall, which comprehendeth in it all kind of Essences, &amp; all perfection, which without any imperfection pertaineth to that Essence and beeing. So in this place the Prophet doth put this short word <hi>Well,</hi> not adding any explication, that he might sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and intimate vnto vs, that the whole vniuersitie and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of all good things, that can be desired of mans hart, are to be found in thys word, and be conioyned to it, which the Lord doth promise heere to the righteous for reward of his vertue.</p>
   <p>This is the chiefe &amp; principall argument, which (Gods holy Spirit assisting mee) I haue purposed to handle in this Booke: to the which I will also adioyne counsailes, instructions, &amp; rules, which ought to be obserued of those, who are studious of vertue. According to this purpose this booke shall be deuided into two
<pb n="2" facs="7"/>
Tomes,<note place="margin">The deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Booke.</note> or two principall parts. In the first shall bee shewed those most straight and firme bonds, which binde vs to followe and embrace vertue: also the inestimable and inualuable fruites and profits which are brought forth by this studie.</p>
   <p>In the latter part or Tome, wee will speake of a godly life, which is lead according to the prescript rule of vertue,<note place="margin">Two things required to pietie.</note> &amp; of the admonitions &amp; doctrines, which are required vnto it. For there are two things necessary to a man that will become godly and honest. The first is, that hee desire to be really and indeede in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with vertue. The second is, that he may know how to be so indued and furnished. For the first of these two, the first Booke is profitable and auailable: for the second, the second. For they (as Plutarch sayth) that teach that vertue is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, but deliuer not the way and manner how to attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> they doe as those that light a Lampe to burne, but poure in no oyle. Certes although the second booke is very profitable, yet the first booke (if I may so say) is most necessarie. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because to the knowledge of good &amp; euill, the very light of nature and reason is much conducent, which is bred &amp; borne with vs: but that wee should loue one, and hate another; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace one, and flie from another, very great contradictions and lets doe meete with vs, and doe arise of sinne, as well within, as without man.</p>
   <p>For seeing that man is compounded of a spirite and flesh, &amp; both parts desire theyr like; the flesh alwayes seeketh for things carnall and fleshly, in which vices raigne and beare sway; but the spirit desireth spirituall things, in which vertues haue dominion and preheminence. Therefore the spirit dooth feele and suffer great contradiction and repugnancie of his owne flesh, which hath no feeling, but of those thinges, which delight and bring pleasure; which desires and appetites, next vnto originall sinne are most vehement, when as by that, the bridle of original righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes is lost, with which they were bridled and restrayned. Neyther doth the flesh only resist the spirite, but also the world, <hi>Which</hi> (as S. Iohn testifieth) <hi>wholie lyeth in wickednes.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Iohn, 5,</note> The deuill also, a capitall enemie of vertues, doth repugne the spirit, and so doe our corrupt dispositions, and vicious custome, which as an other nature, especially in those, who haue had growth, and are
<pb n="3" facs="7"/>
confirmed in wickednes, through the continuaunce and diutur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of tyme. Therefore, that a man may passe boldly through the midst of these difficulties, and that hee may approch neere vnto vertue in veritie, and with the whole desire of his hart, to the despight of the flesh and all her powers it cannot be denied, but that these difficulties doe happen to man, and that ayde and helpe is necessary for him.</p>
   <p>Therefore, that we may come vnto thys first part, this former Booke is made, and sette foorth, in the which I haue bestowed much paynes, and haue laboured with all my strength, that I might gather (as it were) into a bundle all the reasons, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any whit to belong to the qualitie of this matter, or to the manner of this writing for the aduauncement of vertue; by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before your eyes the profit and fruites of them, who follow vertue, as well in this life, as in the life to come: and by declaring the great bonds, by which wee are bounde to vertue, seeing that God doth cōmaund it vnto vs, whom not to obey is exceeding haynous; and to which we are obliged, as well for that which it is in it selfe, as for that which it is for vs, and towards vs. I vvas especially moued to handle this argument, for that I dyd dailie see the greater sort &amp; number of men to prayse vertue in words, but to follow vices in deedes. And truely in mine opinion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many other causes of this so great enormitie, one is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men, ignorant of the condition and nature of vertue, doe esteeme it to be vnpleasant, barraine, and painefull. For this cause, when as they are wholy drowned in vices (because they seeme more pleasant vnto them) they flie from all vertue, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that there is no sweetnes in it.</p>
   <p>I, pittying the error of these men, willingly vnderwent thys labour, that I might shew how many, and howe great be the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, delights and treasuries; how great is the dignitie, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this heauenly Bride: and also that I might demonstrate howe vnknowne it is vnto men; that these mine admonitions might free them from this errour, and inflame them with the loue of so precious a thing.</p>
   <p>For if it bee true, that thys is one of the most excellent things, that are in heauen or earth, and most worthy to be loued &amp; had in honour; without doubt it is to be lamented, that men
<pb n="4" facs="8"/>
are such strangers from the knowledge and desire of so great a good. A great benefite therefore hee shall doe to all mankinde, whosoeuer he be, that endeuoureth to restore thys Lady to her honour, and to seate her in her royall Throne: for shee is the Queene and Lady of all things.</p>
   <p>But before I come to my purpose, I will shewe by a certaine example, with what minde thys Tractate ought to bee vsed. Heathen men doe write of theyr famous Hercules,<note place="margin">Cicero in the first booke of his offices.</note> howe when he began to waxe a man (which time is gyuen of Nature to choose, what course of life euery man will follow and enter into) went into the wildernes, and there sitting long debating &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing with himselfe, when he saw two waies, the one of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the other of Vertue, which it were better to enter &amp; walke in: at the length, after mature deliberation, Pleasure being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, he entred into Vertues path. Truely, if there bee anie thing in the world woorthy of deliberation and aduise, this is it. For if wee so often muse vpon those thinges, which pertaine to the vse of life, and doe so aduisedly deliberate of thē; how much more carefully and thorowly ought wee to weigh and consider of life it selfe? especially seeing so many and so diuers kindes of lyuing are found in the world.</p>
   <p>Proceede therefore, my brother, thys is that, that I woulde haue thee now to do, and to the which I now inuite thee. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou must know, that before all things it is needfull, that in this short time thou sette behinde thee, the whole rabble of the thoughts and busines of this world, &amp; that thou enter into thys spirituall wildernes, and that thou beginne to deliberate with thy selfe of the manner and way of that life, which it behoueth thee to follow hereafter. Remember, that among all humane affaires there is none, which ought to bee weighed and examined vvith greater care and attention, and which requireth a longer time in deliberating, then the election of that kinde of life, which is to be followed, &amp; continued till death. For if the beginning be good, those things that follow will be lawdable. On the contrary part, if thy choyce be faultie, what soeuer is built thereon will goe frō ill to worse. All other consultations, with the errors that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in them, are particuler, thys onely is generall, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all other vnder it.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="5" facs="8"/>Tell mee I pray thee, what may be builded vpon an ill foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation? What doe all prosperous euents profit? What auaile al admonitions and counsailes, if thy life be ill ordered? And what doe all aduersities hurt, if thy life be well lead?<note place="margin">Math, 16.</note>
      <hi>For what shoulde it profit a man, though he should winne the whole world, and loose his owne soule?</hi> Therefore we can speake of no matter or businesse more weightie vnder heauen, of none more proper vnto man, or of greater moment: for we doe not intreat heere of riches, or of honors; but of the lyfe of the soule, and of euerlasting glory. Doe not therfore run ouer these things carelesly, slightly, &amp; slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingly, as without aduisement thou doost read ouer many other things, oftentimes passing ouer many leaues, desirous to see an end, before thou hast wel examined the beginning: but I would that thou sitte as a Iudge in the iudgement seate of thine hart, &amp; that thou heare all these words with silence &amp; quie
tnes of mind. These things are not to be posted ouer hastily, but to be looked to heedfully &amp; discreetly, because in thē are handled the whole regiment of thy life, and what soeuer thereupon dooth depend. Consider howe thou wouldest that all the businesses of thys worlde should bee ordered and appointed; for in determining these things, one mans opinion cannot suffice thee, but haue an eye that they be seene to, examined &amp; scanned of sundry Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, Aduocates, and Iudges, least happily thou offend in them.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, seeing that in this case we doe not speak of earth, but of heauen; not of thine, but of thy selfe; haue an earnest care that this thing bee not considered of slothfully and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, but with the greatest attention. If thou hast erred he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, now at the length cast with thy selfe, that thou art rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated and borne againe, and beginne to enter into iudgement with thy selfe, and cut off the thred of thine errors, and begin by another way to vntwist this webbe. O who will nowe so blesse my labours, that thou maist now credite mee, and harken vnto me with attentiue eares, and that like a good Iudge thou mayst pronounce thy sentence and iudgement, according to those things which are spoken and approued vnto thee; for this thy resolution should be truelie blessed, and thy labour exceeding profitable. I know assuredly that I request too much, and that a wryting cannot be found so effectuall and preuailing, that may
<pb n="6" facs="9"/>
effect and performe this request: therefore in the beginning of this my worke (of what esteeme or value soeuer it bee) I intreat this one thing, that he who is the power and wisedom of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (who hath the key of Dauid, that he may shutte and open heauen to whom he will) would be heere present, and so temper these my writings, that they may yeeld a perswasiue spirit &amp; lyfe to those who shall reade them.</p>
   <p>But if I shall gette no fruite of thys my labour, yet this shall be a recompence sufficient for mee, that I haue satisfied mine owne desire &amp; delight, and that once I haue filled &amp; glutted my selfe, in praysing &amp; commending a thing greater then all praise, as Vertue is, especially seeing that of a long time I haue longed and wished to apply my minde to this studie. This also I haue obserued throughout all this worke (which also I haue doone in all the rest of my labours) that I might fitte and apply my selfe to all sorts and estates of men, spirituall and not spirituall, Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and Laitie; that as the cause and necessitie is common, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so this Treatise might bee as common. For the good, reading this, shall be confirmed in the loue of Vertue, &amp; being deeplie grafted into it, they shall take deepe roote in it: they that be not good, perhaps shall vnderstand by this what they haue lost and forgon. With thys our labour, good Parents may instruct and teach theyr chyldren, when they are but young; that they may be accustomed from theyr infancie to haue Vertue in honor &amp; reuerence, and to bee studious of it; seeing it is the greatest ioy that a Father hath, to see his sonne whom he loueth, to bee a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Vertue, honest in very deede, and beautified &amp; adorned with all kinde of Vertue.</p>
   <p>This doctrine moreouer will be especially profitable to thē, whose dutie it is in the Church to teach the people, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to embrace Vertue: for heere are deliuered in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the chiefest instructions, titles and reasons, which make vs debtors vnto Vertue; to the which also as to common places, euery thing may bee reduced, which is written of this matter. And seeing that heere are handled those graces and blessings, which are promised in this world to Vertue (which are displaied and vnfolded in her twelue notable and famous preheminences and prerogatiues) and seeing that it is true, that we haue all these
<pb n="7" facs="9"/>
good things and blessings by Christ; it consequently followeth, that this doctrine shal bring much light to the vnderstanding of the holy Scriptures, especially to those places which intreate of the misterie of Christ, and the inestimable benefite of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: of the which (amongst others) the Prophet Esay, Salomon in his Canticles, and such others, doe write more of purpose.</p>
