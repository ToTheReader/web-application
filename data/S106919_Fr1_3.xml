   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Lord is my witnesse whome I
serue in my spirite, and to whose
gaine I am desirous to bestowe my
talent, and whose glory I studie to
aduance, by all such meanes as of his
mercy he hath affoorded me, that I
haue not written this, or any other
treatise, because I am desirous to
contend, for we haue no such custome, nor the Churches of
God: much lesse to purchase prayse of learning, wherein vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly
I acknowledge my want and weaknesse: but onely
for defence of the trueth, which in this countrey of ours, is
quite forsaken of many, by reason of ignorance in all sortes,
which hath possessed men through their owne negligence
and carelesse securitie of their owne soules health, and is
cherished and increased, through softnesse and sufferance of
some superiors. For if such gifts of knowledge or vtterance,
as God lendeth vs, be they great or little, be giuen vs to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and doe good vnto others: then let vs vse the same to his
greatest glory and gaine, for feare of his heauie displeasure,
if when hee call vs to a reckoning, we bee found not to haue
occupied to our masters profite, because he will be angry with
such as hide their talent in their napkin.<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 26.</note> But if wee abuse
<pb facs="7"/>
these his good graces, to darken therewith the light of the
trueth, and to encrease the mistes of errour, how fierce shall
be his wrath? how hard shall be our iudgement? For if to be
negligent to maintaine the trueth, be blame-worthie: how
great then is their sinne that impugne the same, and that
with those weapons that God hath bestowed vpon them to
defend it withall? Let vs therefore, my wandring brethren
from the plaine pathes, let vs I say remember for what we
striue. Is it not for the trueth? where may it be found? In
Gods eternall and vndoubted word. VVhat is this word? we
truely affirme it with many of the Fathers to bee contained
in the Scriptures of the old and new Testament. But of your
vnwritten verities, you haue iust cause to doubt. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there be in you any loue to this trueth, for the which you
say you striue, any care of Gods glory, any regard of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
who are (the Lord knoweth, soone led the wrong way)
any due respect to your owne soules health,<note place="margin">Philip 3. 16</note> or any feare of
Gods iust wrath: let vs proceed by one rule, that wee may
minde one thing. Folow not I pray you, those false apostles,
those craftie workemen that can transforme themselues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Angels of light.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 13.</note> Deale plainly and truely in Gods cause,
yea, let vs on both sides waigh the goodnes of the proofes not
cauilling about words, the trueth of the matter, not the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of handling of it. If we speake of antiquitie, let it be most
ancient. For that is truest, but by and by came in heresies: so
that that onely which was first, can bee true, as vpon good
ground Tertullian affirmeth.<note place="margin">De praescript.</note> If wee bring the Fathers, let
them be of the soundest, and those not maimed nor mangled.
Neither must we rest vpon any of their doctrines, but such
as haue their warrant in the worde, and being taught of
them by a generall consent, doe iustly obtaine the name of
Catholique. And for sundry points of your religion, I can
neuer be perswaded, but such among you as haue any vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="7"/>
desire to attaine to true godlinesse, doe euen within your
selues confesse and acknowledge, that many things which
are commended to the simple, as holy and helpfull for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of their soules, whatsoeuer shewe of godlines they may
seeme to haue, are yet farre from the power thereof. For it
cannot be, that any man or woman that maketh due account
of the price of our redemption, the ransome for our sinnes,
the precious bloud of that lambe without spot Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 19.</note>
can euer become so sottish as to thinke, that obseruing of
dayes, abstaining from some meates, buying of buls, pardons,
halowed graines, and Agnus deis, offering to Saintes, pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
going barefoote, with haire-cloth next the skin, cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
or any such like bodily and trifling exercises or works,
may euer be thought of woorth, to make any recompence for
our offences. If without sheading of bloud there could bee no
remission,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22. Heb. 9. 12. &amp; 10. 14.</note> (and that the bloud of Christ) by which wee are
freed for euer, from the danger of sinne, and haue eternall
redemption, what can these trifling toyes helpe vs therein?
yea, what blasphemie is it to match them in this worke, with
that inestimable and peerelesse price? Nowe therefore as
Ambassadours from Christ,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 20.</note> as though God did beseech you
through vs, we pray you in Christes stead, not onely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to God (whom you haue grieuously offended:) but
also that you will deale plainly with Gods people, and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and sincerely in matters of religion: returne from whence
you haue straied so long, and so farre, yeeld to the truth, giue
glory to God. Lead them not any longer into the pit of error,
whom Christ hath bought with so rich a ransome. Hide not
the trueth from them henceforth with those false visardes
of antiquitie and vniuersalitie, which can neuer be prooued
to be in the Romish religion. And seeing your selues, if you
haue any consciences, must confesse that many things are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
in that you teach: bee content to follow the godly and
<pb facs="8"/>
wise counsel which Cyprian giueth, that we should goe backe
to the head,<note place="margin">Ad Pompeium contra episto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam Stephan.</note> if any thing bee wrong in religion, and so try
where the fault is. As if the water faile, we will begin at the
conduit, and so from thence search where it stoppeth: so we
must saieth he, come to that was taught in the beginning by
Christ and his Apostles. And this he saieth, is the readiest
way to leaue errors, and to find out the trueth. Let vs then I
pray you walke in that way, let vs vse that man, to reforme
religion. But if you haue sold your tongues &amp; pennes to serue
the Pope, and as much as in you lieth to maintaine supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
you shall find vs by Gods grace ready at all times, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
whatsoeuer you shalbe able to say. And although I bee
not worthy to cary the bookes of many among vs, that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
and knowen to be learned: yet will I (encouraged
by the goodnesse of the cause) apply my time and studie, and
slender abilitie to that end, knowing those howers to be most
happily spent, that are imploied to the glory of God, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the Church, and the furtherance of the Gospel. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that you may ioine with vs, I pray God if it bee his good
will, to turne your hearts, &amp; open your eies to see &amp; know
that which now you striue against. As for your secret
practises against God and his people, the Lord for
Christ his sake confound them, and bring
them to naught. So be it.
