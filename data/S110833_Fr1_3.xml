         </gap>rxes.</hi> For, knowing your Lordships loue to learning, (for <hi>Ars non habet inimicum nisi ignorantem</hi>) and hauing no inuention of mine owne, I haue boldly aduentured to draw water from another mans fountaine, and to commend this poore translation to your fauourable censure and honorable protection. Which I do the more humbly desire, for that I know your Lordships honorable name will be a sufficient bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke against those snarling dogs, <hi>Quibus innatum est, vt non pro feritate, sed pro consuetudine latrent,</hi> which barke

more of custome then of curstnesse; which being guiltie to themselues of their owne imperfections, and hauing such muddie wits, that a man would sweare they were borne at Puddle wharfe, do notwithstanding labour to build their owne reputation vpon other mens disgraces; and by disgorging their malicious censures vppon the painful indeuors of all those which either diligētly write, or painfully translate, do thinke to purchase a lease of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall commendation. I will not blot my paper with any commendation of my Author, who was so noble for his birth, so famous for his learning, and so admirable for his inuention; lest I should seeme to hang out a bush where good wine is alreadie knowne to be sold, or to light a candle when the Sunne is in his vertical point. For if he proue any where distastful to your iudicious vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, I must ascribe the fault to my selfe, which haue done him iniury, to cloath him with a sute so ill fitting to his proportion. But how meane soeuer it be, my humble request is, that your Lordship will accept it as a pledge of his dutifull loue, which is desirous to be euer at your Lordships commandement. And so humbly presuming to kisse your faire hands, I pray continually for the happie successe of all your honorable deseignements.</p>
