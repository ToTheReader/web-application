   <head>❧ The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E bee taught by many and sundry examples of holy Scriptures, that vpon occasion of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar punishments, afflictions, and perils, which God of his most iust iudgement hath sometimes sent among his people, to shew his wrath against sinne, and to call his people to repentance, and to the redresse of their liues, the godly haue bene prouoked and stirred vp to more feruencie &amp; diligence in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, fasting, and almes deedes, to a more deepe consideration of their consciences, to ponder their vnthankefulnesse and forgetfulnesse of Gods mercifull benefites towards them, with crauing of pardon for the time past, and to aske his assistance for the time to come, to liue more godly, and so to be defended and deliuered from all further perils and dangers.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 24</note> So king Dauid in the time of plague and pestilence which ensued vpon his vaine numbring of the people, prayed vnto God with wonderfull feruencie, confessing his fault, desiring God to spare the people, and rather to turne his ire to himward, who had chiefly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that transgression.<note place="margin">2. Chro. 2 2. Reg. 19</note> The like was done by the vertuous kings Iosaphat and Ezechias in their distresse of warres and foreine inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. So did Iudith and Hester fall to humble prayers in like perils of their people. So did Daniel in his captiuitie,<note place="margin">Iudith 9.2 Ester 14.1 Dan. 9 4.</note> and many other moe in their troubles. Nowe therefore calling to minde, that God hath bene prouoked by vs to visite vs at this present with the plague and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grieuous diseases, and partly also with trouble of warres: It hath bene thought meete to excite and stirre vp all godly people within this Realme, to pray earnestly and heartily to God, to turne away his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued wrath from vs, and to restore vs as well to the health of our bodies by the wholesomnesse of the aire, as also to godly and profitable peace and quietnesse. And although it is euery Christian mans due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of his owne deuotion to pray at all times: yet for that the corrupt nature of man is so slouthfull and negligent in this his dutie, hee hath need by often and sundry meanes to bee stirred vp and put in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his duetie, For the effectuall accomplishment whereof, it is ordered and appointed, as followeth.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>First, that all Curates and Pastours, shall exhort their Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to endeuour themselues to come vnto the Church, with so many of their families as may be spared from their necessarie businesse, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing yet a prudent respect in such assemblies to keepe the sicke from the whole, in places where the plague reigneth) and they to resort, not onely on Sundayes and holy dayes: but also on Wednesdayes and Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, during the time of these present afflictions, exhorting them, there reuerently and godly to behaue themselues, and with penitent hearts to pray vnto God to turne these plagues from vs, which wee through our vnthankefulnesse and sinfull life, haue deserued.</p>
   <p>Secondly, that the sayde Curates shall then distinctly, and playnely reade the generall Confession appoynted in the booke of Seruice, and the Absolution following.</p>
   <p>Then shall beginne the Lordes prayer. <hi>Our Father &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Then likewise shall followe. <hi>O Lord open thou our lips. &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Then shall be sayde this Psalme following. <hi>Psal. 95. O come, let vs sing vnto the Lorde, &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Afterwardes, some three of these Psalmes. <hi>Psal. 6.39.51.90 91.94.130.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Then for the first Lesson one of these Chapters. <hi>2. Samuel. 24. 2. Reg. 24.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Then <hi>Te Deum</hi> shall followe.</p>
   <p>Then for the second Lesson one of these Chapters. <hi>Matth. 6.24.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Then <hi>Benedictus,</hi> with the other accustomed prayers.</p>
   <p>Then the <hi>Letanie.</hi> And after the ende of these Collectes, <hi>O God mercifull Father, &amp;c. Wee humbly beseech thee, &amp;c. O Lord our heauenly Father, almightie &amp; euerlasting God, &amp;c. O almightie God, King of all Kings, &amp;c. Almightie God, which in thy wrath, &amp;c.</hi> shall follow this Psalme: one verse sayde by the Minister, and an other by the people.</p>
