   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is profitable, and considering the
times we now liue in, very necessarie,
that the liues &amp; deaths of Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
seruants, (such as was this worthy
Person) be registred, and commended
to Posteritie (as well for examples to
the liuing, that they may know how to walke in a good
Conscience before God, as to preserue the fame of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
after their death, from the reprochful detractions
of the wicked. And this last, charitie towards our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
departed, requires of vs then especially, when the
wrong done vnto their memories, tends to the discredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the seruice, wherein they were by God imployed
in the time of their life. For though it be true, that lyes
and calumnies can neuer long preuaile, and that Truth,
by some rightly called the Daughter of Time, will at last
breake forth, as the light, and shine as the noone day, to
the iustifying of them that haue feared the Lord, and
beene carefull to approue their courses vnto him: yet in
the meane while, preiudices may possesse the minds of
many not euill affected: and while they lacke better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
by mis-reports they may be made to thinke
and speake of persons and matters otherwise then they
should. Neither can we be excused, if wee shall keepe si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb facs="3"/>
and forbeare to giue witnesse vnto the Truth,
when peruerse men take such libertie, as we see, to vent
lies both by speech and writing, onely to confirme others
in wicked and rebelli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>us courses. This respect, albeit
there had been no other, is a sufficient reason for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of this Discourse; written by that faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of God, of himselfe, some two yeeres before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting,
and since found amongst his papers: for as
in his life there wanted not enemies to charge him with
many false imputations, whereof himselfe did often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine;
so yet after his death, when humanitie it selfe
might teach them not to disquiet the ashes of the dead,
they forbeare not to lay vpon him and the manner of his
death, false and foule aspersions, albeit no man, while he
liued, did walk in all his wayes with a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tter conscience;
nor any of the Saints of God did euer conclude his dayes
more peaceably, and with better Resolution.</p>
   <p>Concerning his life, which was not idle or fruitlesse,
as his writings already come forth, and others that
shortly will see the light, may sufficiently witnesse; wee
remit you to this Discourse penned by himselfe, as it
seemes, when he found his sicknes beginning, which put
an end to his dayes: And for his death, whereof there
were many witnesses, the forme and manner thereof we
haue annexed, to stop the mouthes of vngodly men, and
giue all that feare the Lord, an example of dying, and
occasion of thankefulnes to Almighty God, who vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
so mercifully to rid his seruant of the miseries of
this life, and receiue him to his ioy, and that place of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie,
where we are perswaded now he rests.</p>
