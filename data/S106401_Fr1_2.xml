      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He reasons that moued me (good christian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to preach this short Sermon vppon shorter warning than gladlie I woulde, haue preuailed with me to set it downe in writing also at more leasure, &amp; to publish it. For both the godly subiectes may bee stirred vp thereby to greater thankfulnes for the manifolde blessinges that God by her <hi>Maiesties</hi> means, and in her safetie, hath bestowed vpon vs: and the disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted may be put in mind to content thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with

In the latter, I hope, I shall not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Vnlesse with Religion both witte &amp; reason haue forsaken them: that they care as little for honesty, as for piety; for
<pb facs="4"/>profit, as for honesty. Eor what can they looke for at the handes of foreiners, though knit in neuer so strait confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie with them, &amp; ioyned in profession of the same faith, or perfidiousnes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the falsly named <hi>Catholike</hi> religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more then the <hi>Iewes</hi> had of the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians?</hi> by whom for al their

Let them leaue their
<pb facs="4"/>brainsicke desires and diuelish purposes of bringing a <hi>Facinus Canis</hi> into their countrie: least by experience they feele (which God forbid) that though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues be <hi>Catholikes,</hi> their goods may bee <hi>Heretikes;</hi> perhaps some <hi>Heretick-blood</hi> in their bodies also, by cōtagion of ours.
