      <hi>THE</hi> PREFACE TO AL ENGLISH <hi>PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the receaued saying <hi>(Nothing is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, but by wordes, (or eloquence) it may be made probable)</hi> can in any case, or time be justified: most like it is, to be proued true, when in time of question and controuersie of things, corrupting, falsifying, perucrting, misapplying, and such deceitful dealing with Authorities (to delude the ignorant hearers, or readers) is joyned and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to free wordes and writings, on the one side: And vnto the other, by al wary and vigilant preuention, al disputing, preaching, writing, printing, publishing, or reading any thing, to confute and controule it, is forbidden and with seuerities pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented. As no man can be ignorant either of the controuersies of this time in matters of religion, or that the state of the recited difficulties (to answere their aduersaries) is the case of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, disgraced, silenced, and persecuted in England: So that the former, of corruptions, falsyfications, &amp; joyned with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and liberty of speech and writing, to promote their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, is a thing frequently vsed of English Protestant Doctors, wil sufficiently (euen by their owne present testimonies) appeare in this Treatise. Then resolution is easily made, by what meanes, by way of learning, that religion is maintained.</p>
   <p>And because these Protestants themselues (to be cited here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) <note place="margin">Cap. 1. s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> acknowledge this corrupting, and falsifying infection, to be so ordinary, or general among them, that neitheral, many,
<pb n="4" facs="3"/> nor one writer, nor one booke of quantity of their penning, can be thus examined and censured, but with great loathsomnesse both to the examiner, and reader of such vile and prophane abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, of God, Religion, Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, and al Authorities, as may appeare in the publikely priuiledged workes of these men; as namely <hi>D. Willet,</hi> stiled <hi>Professor of Diuinity,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Willet Loydor. in Titul. Parkes against Lymbom.</note> in his booke named <hi>Loydoromastix, a whip for a railer,</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging <hi>M. Parkes</hi> his fellow in religion, of hundreds of such demeanors in one booke, and he againe the other in like order, and al with priuiledge, with such others. For which cause desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in this vnsauoury subject, to affect as much breuity as may be, to giue satisfaction in this matter, I haue of purpose passed ouer al that be these notoriously infamous among themselues, by publike priuiledge: And singled forth one among them, a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, Deane, and great writer, Doctor <hi>Morton,</hi> which in diuers bookes, especially three, his so named, <hi>Ful satisfaction, Preamble,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Morton ful sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>act. Prefat. Preamb. Epist. dedicat. against Higg. ep. dedic.</note> and booke against <hi>M. Higgons</hi> (a late Minister among them, leauing them and becomming a Catholike by such their corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions) and to three great personages, his Majesty, the right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Earle of Salisbury Lord Treasurer, and the Lord Eurc the Lord President of Wales, absolutely justifieth himselfe in wordes to be a <hi>professed publisher of truth,</hi> and no <hi>falsyficator,</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter, or such wicked dealer: and is so not only valued by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but likewise esteemed of (as I vnderstand) by most and many his Protestant readers and auditors. Therefore before al others I haue made choise of this man, so sincere and of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, by so great Protestant applause. I haue made choise before al others of his writing, to examine the principal part of his booke named by him, <hi>A ful satisfaction;</hi> because in this he <note place="margin">Ful satisfact epist. dedicat.</note> protesteth to our Soueraigne, most great and rare sincerity from such crimes: and intituleth his booke <hi>A ful satisfaction,</hi> which in sincerity and true dealing, must be deuoide of al cunning, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and counterfait behauiour, which doe offend and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize, and neither fully nor at al satisfie honest minded readers. Againe, I haue chosen this booke, because it, was written, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, published, and by great Protestants priuiledged, (if not hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in composing) in time of Conuocation. And further, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="3"/> choose this, not only because it was written against my selfe Authour of the <hi>Moderate answere</hi> to his positions: but in respect he complaineth in his <hi>Preamble,</hi> why I had not written against that, his named <hi>ful satisfaction</hi> also: speaking as though I had got a scratch (some foile he meaneth) at his handes, neither refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting vpon any vnworthinesse in his owne worke, or difficulty which Catholike Students in England haue to publish little, though they write much, and often with no great ease or his helps to aide them. But although I neuer judged (as I shal hereafter demonstrate) that his booke to be any satisfaction to my answere, nor of it selfe worth my labour to confute; yet (as I can proue <note place="margin">Morton Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amb. chap. of Stage, &amp;c.</note> by many witnesses) I had censured both that, and his <hi>Preamble</hi> also, within six weekes (and lesse) of their first birth; And my prints prouided taken or hindered (one of those my bookes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to be printed) I had no meanes to publish either, vntil his bookes were out of date (as neuer in much) or were otherwise answered. Whether I feare any Protestants scratch in schooles or no, he may know, if they wil graunt vs disputation, now they deny vs printing. And I not only for these reasons doe now cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him, but because in his Preamble it pleaseth him to bring me vpon the stage (as he calleth it) to play a part with his Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man aduersary, and himselfe: where although I doe not finde, that I am either scratched or bitten vvith his nailes or teeth, though bawled and barked at with his tongue, as <hi>Latrantes</hi> vse. Yet now I am enforced to enter the stage; and I feare his part wil proue to be that, which his Greeke name signifieth, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in Comedies and Tragedies Actors be chosen, to make better resemblance of thinges.</p>
   <p>I also choose that part of his booke not only because it is the first in order: But is the defence and propugnacle of the very ground of al his writing against vs, in that kinde, as himselfe hath <note place="margin">Rom. pos. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>at. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</note> written, and that failing al his building is ouerthrowne. Againe, I choose his defence of that maine argument; because it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth more of my booke, then any other, and more then many of some of the rest. And yet notwithstanding al this, and more causes, vrging or rather (by his behauiour) necessitating me to <note place="margin">Morton against Higg. ep. dedic.</note> write, I could haue beene silent (hoping better of him hereafter)
<pb n="6" facs="4"/> but that I see him newly glory of his innocency, and singular sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in this behauiour, whereof I am to accuse him: and busie himselfe further (as I am informed) then either honour or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph wil be his reward.</p>
   <p>Therefore to passe ouer other authorities, partly because he <note place="margin">D. Mortons corruptiō how great in that first part of his booke to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and proued in this Treatise.</note> hath heard of his sincerity in them before, as also they are not so easie to be examined of ordinary readers: I wil omit al thinges whereof he hath beene by others admonished, and take leauings, only his citations of my writing in that his sincere part of <hi>ful sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> (as he tearmeth it) and directly demonstrate not only that among al those (being many) there is not one which is not either fasly and corruptly cited or applied, but often times in one citation diuers and sundry corruptions, and such like abuses, are committed by this man of sincerity: and not one citation among them al, to be found free from such dealings.</p>
   <p>Neither by ending my examination there, doe I free any of his arguments, or citations following, but end there at this time, only for my (before) alleaged reasons. And if it shal be needful <note place="margin">D. Mortons like corruption in the whole booke follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, against the Moderate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>e, offered to be proued, in the same manner, &amp;c.</note> hereafter to discouer the rest, if print may be permitted, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Morton</hi> wil truly print my booke, word by word, in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vnto it, I shal procure it to be sent written vnto him. Wherein (to giue an vndoubted patterne of a perfect Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Professor) I now vndertake to proue likewise of al his cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my writing following, that among them al, there is not one among foure, which is free from corruption, falsifying, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting, or some such abusing. I doe not absolutely say that al following without exception be such, (but not one among foure to be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eed) for that were more then monstrous in him, and would otherwise depriue him of his <hi>pittiful shifts</hi> and practizes, to auoide arguments, and abuse other authorities, which his <note place="margin">Offer of conf.</note> owne bretheren in religion charge him, to haue committed in that his booke against me. <hi>And now to my promised purpose.</hi>
