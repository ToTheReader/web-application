   <head>A PREFACE TO THE
READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Sober veine best suits Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie:
If therefore thou expect'st
such Elegancy as takes the
times, affect some subject as
will beare it. Had I laboured
with over-abundāce of fictions, or flourishes,
perhaps they had exposed mee, censurable,
and disprized this sacred subject: Therefore
I rest more sparing in that kinde.</p>
   <p>Two things I would treate of: First, the
<hi>matter,</hi> secondly, the <hi>manner</hi> of this History.</p>
   <p>As for the <hi>matter,</hi> (so farre as I have dealt)
it is Canonicall, and indited by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, not lyable to errour, and needs no
blanching.</p>
   <p>In it, Theologie sits as Queene, attended
by her handmaid Philosophy; both concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to make the understanding Reader a
good Divine, and a wise Moralist.</p>
   <p>As for the Divinitie; it discovers the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
in his two great Attributes; in his
Mercy, delivering his Church; in his Iustice,
confounding her enemies.</p>
   <p>As for the Morality; it offers to us the

whole practick part of Philosophy, dealt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">

Chap. 1. 22. of the Husband to his Wife,
is ruling, Chap. 1. 22. Secondly, of a Father
to his Childe, in advising, Chap. 2. 7, 10. of a
Childe to his Father, in observing, Chap. 2.
20. Thirdly, of a Master to his Servant, in
commanding, Chap. 4. 5. of a Servant to his
Master, in effecting his command, Chap. 4. 6.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, in this history, the two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
faculties of the soule are (nor in vaine)
imployed.</p>
   <p>First, the Intellect, whose proper object is
Truth. Secondly, the Will, whose proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is good, whether Philosophicall, which
the great Master of Philosophy calls Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
or Theologicall, which wee point at
now, hoping to enjoy hereafter.</p>
   <p>Who the Pen-m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n of this sacred History
was, or why the name of God (as in few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the Bible) is unmentioned in
this, it is immateriall and doubtfull. For the
first, it is enough for anuncurious questioner
to know, it was indited by the Spirit of God:
for the second, let it suffice, that that Spirit
will'd not here to reveale his name.</p>
   <p>As for the <hi>Manner</hi> of this history (consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Periphrase, the adjournment of the
Story, and interposition of Meditations) I
<pb n="88" facs="52"/>
I hope it hath not injured the Matter: For in
this I was not the least carefull, to use the
light of the best Expositors, not daring to goe
un-led, for feare of stumbling. Some say,
Divinity in Verse is incongruous and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:
such I referre to the <hi>Psalmes of David,</hi>
or the Song of his sonne <hi>Salomon,</hi> to bee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
But in these lewd times, the salt, and
soule of a Verse, is obscene scurrility, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it seemes dull, and livelesse: And
though the sacred History needs not (as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
doe) Poetry, to perpetuate the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
(being by Gods owne mouth blest
with Eternity) yet Verse (working so neare
upon the soule, and spirit) will oft times draw
those to have a history in familiarity, who
(perchance) before, scarce knew there was
such a Booke.</p>
   <p>Reader, bee more than my hasty pen stiles
thee: Reade mee with advice, and thereafter
judge me, and in that judgement censure me.
If I jangle, thinke my intent thereby, is to to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>
better Ringers in▪ Farewell.</p>
