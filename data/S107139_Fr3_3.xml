   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any and great are the meanes which the Lord hath been pleased, since this latter Spring of the Gospell (begun above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares agoe) to afford unto his Church, for opening of the mysteries of the Gospell Never since the Apostles times were the Scriptures more truly interpreted, more fully expounded, more distinctly divided, or more powerfully pressed, then in our Times. The number of those who have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken good pain in this kinde, is not small. Wee may well put into the Catalogue of them, the Author of this <hi>Commentary upon the second Chapter of the first Epistle of S. Peter,</hi> Master <hi>Nicholas Byfield</hi> by name; who continued, for the space of twenty yeeres, to take more then ordinary paines in the work of the Lord. He had a singular gift in diving into the depth of those points which he undertook to handle. As the many other Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which in his life time be published, doe verifie as much; so, in particular, this <hi>Commentary</hi> here commended unto thee. In it thou shalt finde, besides the Grammaticall exposition, Logicall resolution, and Theologicall observations, many divine points co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously handled by way of Common place; which hath made the book to arise unto that bignesse that it hath. In this maner of han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling the holy Scriptures, hee hath not gone alone. Many of the main Pillars of the reformed Churches have beaten out a path be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; as, <hi>Martin Bucer, Peter Martyr, Musculus, Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius, Lavater, Perkins,</hi> and sundry others, The large vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of <hi>Peter Martyrs Common places,</hi> was gathered out of his <hi>Commentaries</hi> on the holy Scriptures. The Church of God hath reaped much good by such copious and distinct handling of
<pb facs="112"/>
heads of Divinity. Their labours therefore, who take paines therein, are not to be concealed from the Church. If it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Lord to have continued the life, liberty and ability of this his Servant longer unto his Church, he had (questionlesse) gone on further in this course which he so well began: and so might wee have had by his paines as compleat a <hi>Commentary</hi> on the two Epistles of <hi>Saint Peter,</hi> as we have upon the Epistle of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> published by this <hi>Author.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But seeing it seemed good to the divine Providence here to put a stop to the paines of this his industrious servant, wee must rest content with what he hath done, and expect the paines of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>me other to goe on in the finishing of that which he hath so well begun. I suppose it would be a great wrong to deceive Gods Church of these good beginnings, because the whole Epistle is not fully finished. If a Sermon on one verse be thought meet to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, as daily we see such Sermons to be published, why may not much rather many Sermons on many verses and chapters toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be published? That what was done by the <hi>Author</hi> in his life time, may be the better accepted, care hath beene had to note the heads of points in the margin, and to adde an <hi>Alphabeticall index</hi> in the latter end, that by the helpe of it, you may the more readily finde out such points as you most desire to reade.</p>
   <p>If the <hi>Author</hi> be of force to commend a Work the more, this Work may receive no small commendation from the <hi>Author</hi> of it: for, he was a man of a profound judgement, strong memory, sharp wit, quick invention, and unwearied industry. Hee was in his Ministery very powerfull, and that unto all turnes, as we speake. When he had to doe with tender and troubled consciences, he was a <hi>Barnabas,</hi> a sonne of comfort: but when hee had to doe with impudent and obstinate sinners, he could make his face hard and strong, and shew himselfe like a <hi>Boanarges,</hi> the son of thunder. Grave, sober, and temperate he was in his cariage; and yet, with his intire familiar friend, he could be modestly pleasant. God gave him a great measure of patience; and he had in his very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that which tryed his patience: for, it appeares, that he caried a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rturing stone in his bladder fifteene yeeres together, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="112"/>I have heard it credibly reported, that fifteene yeares before his death, he was by a skillfull Chirurgion searched; and that, upon that search, there was a stone found to be in his bladder: whereupon he used such meanes as were prescribed to him for his ease, and found such help thereby, as he thought, that either the Chirurgion which searcht him, was deceived; or that the meanes which he used, had dissolved the stone. But time, which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festeth all things, shewed, that neither his Chirurgion was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, nor yet his stone dissolved: for, it continued to grow big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and bigger, till at length it came to be of an incredible great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
   <p>After his death he was opened, and the stone taken out; and being weighed, found to bee 33. ounces and more in weight; and in measure about the edge, fifteen inches and a halfe; about the length, above 13. inches; about the breadth, almost thirteen inches: it was of a solid substance; to look upon like to a flint. There are many eye witnesses besides my selfe, who can justifie the truth hereof.</p>
   <p>A wonderfull worke of God it was, that hee should be able to cary such a stone in his bladder, and withall to doe the things which hee did. Hee was a close student, witnesse the many Treatises which time after time hee published in print. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e was also a diligent Preacher; for, constantly hee preached twice on the Lords Daies: and in Summer, when many of the Gentry and City came to his Parish at <hi>Isleworth,</hi> and dwelt there, hee spent an houre on Wednesday, and another on Friday, week after week, in expounding the Scripture in his Church: very seldome was he hindered by the forementioned stone in his bladder.</p>
   <p>This course <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ee kept till about five weeks before his death; when the paine came so violently upon him, as it wasted his vitall vigor, yet did it no way weaken his faith: but, as the outward perished; so was the inward man renewed in him. Hee earnestly prayed, that the extremity of the paine might not make him utter or doe any thing unbeseeming his vocation and profession: but withall, hee advised his friends to consider, that hee was but as other men; and
<pb facs="113"/>
thereupon to judge charitably of his cariage in that case. Many heavenly meditations issued from him in that time of his visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unto the last period thereof. Quietly, meekly, and patiently be endured; till that surest Chirurgion of all, Death, had eased him of all his pain. In his soul he ever liveth: and in his name he will continue to live so long as the Church enjoyeth his Works, more lasting then Marble Monuments.</p>
   <p>Now, O blessed Saviour and Head of thy Church, as thou transplantest some of thy Plants out of thy Nurcery, the Church militant; plant others, we beseech thee, in their roomes, that thy Church may never be unfurnished of able, painfull, faithfull, and powerfull Ministers.</p>
