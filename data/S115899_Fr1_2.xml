I would bee glad to arme them with some better merite, and to endeuour any other thing that might be more acceptable vnto you: in the meane time, I shall acknowledge my selfe more beholding vnto you, to vouchsafe me a reading, then my little skill is able to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite by writing.
