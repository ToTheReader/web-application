   <head>❧ To his assured good friend <hi>I. O. Stationer.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, you hauing manie times beene in hand with me about a booke intituled, <hi>The Queene of Nauarres Tales;</hi> which (as you say) you haue caused to be translated out of French, at your proper charges, on mind to Print it, and you haue seuerall times bin in hand with me to write you a Preface. You know I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer read the Booke, and therefore I am not able to say what argument it holdeth, nor otherwise what it concerns, which were behouefull to be knowne to him that shal write a Preface: but the Title is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to grace the Booke, bearing the name of <hi>the Queene of Nauarres Tales;</hi> whereby any man may coniecture that the contentes are some pithie Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, written for pleasure and recreation: and so great a Princesse vouchsafing so to honour them with her owne name, who can thinke but that the pleasure is contained within the limits both of wit &amp; modesty? For the curious conceited fellows that liue now in the world, thogh not possest with any
<pb facs="3"/> great store of malice nor wit, but are yet of such a fine iesting humor, that they wil dry-bob any man that writes, of what subiect soeuer. In steade of a Preface I will present them with a peece of an olde tale, a fiction, and fained, I know not by whom; but if the Author wil not be found, let me father it my selfe, the fable is this.</p>
   <p>Nature hauing many yeares agoe so wasted her treasures, in the perfiting of womans beauties, that by her former prodigalitie, her perfections are so consumed and spent, that the women of this age are enforced to supply their defects by periwigs &amp; painting, by bombasting, and bolstering, and such other artificiall helps; the poore Lady (finding her owne scarcitie, not able to performe that excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as before she had done in the feminine sex) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined yet to make proofe, and to trie her cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what she could do in the masculine. Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the taske, with this setled curiositie, she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned a man of such excellent perfection in all his limbs and lineaments, that Nature herselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to wonder at her owne worke: and as the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Artificer, who thinkes his labor to be but lost, that is still concealed and neuer brought to sight, so Nature bringing forth this superexcellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage to be viewed, appointed him in such a place where the people of seueral Nations had their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall recourse: the first that passed by was a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, who taking a full suruey of this new formed man, crossing himselfe, both his forehead &amp; breast; then throwing vp his handes with admiration to the heauens, hee saide with a lowde voice; O most
<pb facs="3"/> glorious &amp; excelent creature in countenance, more amiable and louely than our lady of <hi>Loretta,</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage more comly than S. <hi>Iago</hi> of <hi>Compostella:</hi> but how shall I extoll thy prayses? my comparisons are too weake; I will therefore leaue thee and blesse Nature, who hath blessed her selfe in featuring of thee. Nature that stoode fast by, where she might both heare and see, and yet vnseene her selfe, was wel pleased with this first salutation, and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard thus departed. The next that came by was an Italian, and he (as the Spaniard before, but with alitle more circumspection) taking the view of this goodly creature, fell first into a fit of wondering; from that, into an extasie of praising, then to prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, that for a thousand duckats hee woulde not haue his wife to haue a sight of this temtation: and now he fell to swearing, that to preuent all perills, he would keepe her still lockt vp in a chamber; and thus he went his way. With this Nature smiled to see the passionate demeanor of the iealous headed Italian. And let it suffice that I deliuer (though not in this particular sort) how the people of sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations as they passed by, what praises and commendations they would all of them attribute to this handiworke of Nature, imputing it to bee without fault, blemish, imperfection, or any maner of defect: till at the last there fortuned to come by an Englishman, I think some of the same trauelling fellows whereof there are some, that running tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the world to seeke new fashions abroade, doe lose al their wits that they carried with them from home; or perhaps it might be some worthy souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb facs="4"/> that if he hath but discharged a case of pifle-pots out of a Gentlemans chamber, seene an Ensigne three times spread in the field, puts himselfe by and by into the arming doublet, the poyntes with the great siluer tagges, tied in the pitch of the shoulder: then at euery word he must be caled Mas Captain: then if hee haue but learned thus much of the new Discipline, as to say, Double your Rankes on the right hand, now againe as you were, double your Files on the left hand, close your Ranks, open your Files: why so, this is enough to make him able to coosin an hundred and fiftie souldiers of their pay. Now for table-talke you shal heare nothing out of their mouths, but of the scaling of forts, the assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of breaches, the taking of citidales, &amp; by theyr words they will seeme to vndertake the winning of a greater towne than <hi>Lysbourne,</hi> but with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging two or three volies of oths. To conclude, when they are angrie, there is nothing in their mouthes but the stab; and when they are pleased, their greatest friendship is not woorth an ordinary of eighteene pence. I speake not to preiudice anie gentleman that hath trauelled for his owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereof there bee many worthy of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, nor to disgrace any souldier that is of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, whereof there are none but are worthy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: but I speake of those counterfeit Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that vnder these titles and pretenses do coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce themselues, taking authoritie to slander, iest, scoffe, and find fault at any thing. One of these priuiledged people now passing along the streete, his gesture so gouerned as if he caried a whole com
<pb facs="4"/> mon wealth in his head, his eyes so fixed as if hee were in the meditation of his mistresse, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nāce so graced, as a man might see a dicker of fools in his face, his salutation to such as passed by was a nod with his head, and his hand clapt ouer his lips, which they do call the <hi>Bassiles manus,</hi> his speeches compendious and shorte, nothing but sentences: this finicall fellow being now come to the place where Nature was yet abiding, reioycing to heare herselfe so glorified for this excelencie of her work, he began as the rest had done, to suruey euery part, euery proportion and lineament, from the top to the toe, he went about him, and round about him, behinde, and before, prying, and beholding wyth more curiosity than any of the rest had done before him, and when he had lookt til he was wearie, said neuer a word, but shaking a little his head was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, till nature seeing this strange demeanor called him backe, and in curteous sort demaunded of him how he liked of the obiect, that hee had so aduisedly perused: to the which he answered; In faith it is not to be misliked, it is a very goodly pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sence, hansome, comely, God had done his part, and he saw nothing but the man was well inough. But I pray saide Nature againe, what is it that you mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like? I perceiue by your speeches there is somthing amisse, and therefore tell me what it is that you do thinke might be amended. Gentlewoman (saide he) seeing you presse me so farre, I wil deale plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with you; the fault that I finde is this, It is pitty that he is not an English man borne, but if hee had beene an English man borne, I coulde then haue
<pb facs="5"/> commended these perfections, which I will nowe forbeare. And it is pitie (said Nature) that thou art an Englishman borne; for if thou wert not an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishman borne, I woulde so display thy imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which in regard of that renowmed Nation now I wil omit. This poore pedant meeting with such a counter-buffe, thought it not good to fall a scolding with a Gentlewoman, but caling her curst queane, went his way scratching of his head. And here an end of an olde tale.</p>
   <p>Now M. <hi>Oxenbridge</hi> I wil direct my text again to your priuate selfe, how shal you and I escape the gentle frump from these same perillous conceited fellowes, that will not omit to finde a fault at anie thing, nor wil not forbeare to breake a iest vppon any man? mary Ile tell you how weele stop their mouthes if we can, wee wil giue them the foole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand: I do not meane to any friendly Reader, that will sooner winke at a fault, than finde a fault, but to these mungrell curres, that although they cannot bite, will yet stand aloofe and barke. And this <hi>Misacmos</hi> in his Apologie of Aiax saith is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and he calles it <hi>Prolepsis</hi> or Preuention. Now if we by giuing the foole aforehand, could preuent them that they should not snarle at vs, twere a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tricke. And why not? For now I remember me, I knew the practise of it long before I knewe <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacmos,</hi> and learned it of a Gentlewoman that had borne a bastard before shee was married, who for preuention sake would cal whoore first, &amp; would raise slaunderous reportes of euery other woman, how honest soeuer, because she would brand them
<pb facs="5"/> all with her owne marke. Call you this a Figure? No sir, it was wit, and I warrant you it proceeded from a very quicke conceit: as how? Mary shee would not venture vpon a husband, til she had made triall how she was able to endure the bearing of a child: for <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia probata</hi> wittrieth all things. Sir, I do commend her for her wit; but by your leaue, if my wife were but halfe so wise, I would thinke that a Carte were fitter for her than a Coach.</p>
   <p>Well, I thanke you <hi>Misacmos,</hi> we haue made a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bold with your Figure, and I hope without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and I see preuention is very good, but I like not of his preuention, that being a knowne cuckold himselfe, and to preuent ill language, woulde hang hornes in the night at his neighbours doore: Like to a cunning fellowe that I know, I will not say a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie-catcher, but a scaulled squire named <hi>Will Cogge,</hi> a trencher scraping cullion but this other day, who in lesse then a yeares cogging (being skilfull in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie) hath got more, then nowe by his trade heele get these seuen yeeres. This Canniball (I say) in the night would hang vp horns at his neighbors doors, that they might seeme as shamefull to the worlde, as hee shamelesse: and nowe associating himselfe with one, a iolly fellowe, who though hee seeme to the view of the world (by the cariage of his body) a well accomplisht K: at armes, yet otherwayes, but a paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try shifting wenching companion, when a man hath made the best of him; who because hee might not haue the maidenhead of his neighbors wise the first night, but Iacke Drummers entertainment, after hee had shamefully demaunded it, runnes vp and downe
<pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>(threatning highly) in his hose and dublet like a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterlesse man, with his collar turned downe round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, making way for the halter, as one that were going to be hangd, to mince them as small as flesh to the pot. Well, birdes of a feather wil hang together; these two, knaues I found them, &amp; knaues I leaue them, and that is all the reckoning I make of them. Well, let them winch that are rubbed on the gall, but if they kicke, I will stand aloofe and crie, guppe olde Iade are you coltish? And when I haue a little laughed, I will leane my selfe to this olde axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome, Qui moccat moccabitur; the which in our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tongue may thus be interpreted, shee is a sorie Lady that hath neuer a Ioynter. Thus M. <hi>Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> if you shall accept of these lines thus hastily hatched, I hope the curteous Reader will not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and for the malitious I care not. Thus with my commendations to your selfe I ende.</hi>
