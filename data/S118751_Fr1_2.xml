my owne abilities, as to think their fruits worthy of such a patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. And I must deale plainly with you, I am altogether time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, (if not a little presumptuous) to shrowde your Honours name in the forhead of such vnliterate lines; yet since that not onely your Noble desires for my good, but also your intensiue &amp; extensiue exhibition of more then common loue, doe iustly challenge some testification of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse (without which I might rightly incurre <hi>Claudius Caesars</hi> censure vpon ingratitude) therefore <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ingratos reuocauit in seruitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> Sueton.</note> instead of a better acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I dedicate this poore widowes mite, this formlesse first borne issue, and in that my selfe, my best deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted seruice to your noble protection. I remember what <hi>Socrates</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to <hi>Aeschines</hi> his schollar, when being poore he tooke it to heart that he was not able to gratifie him in a more ample manner, <hi>An non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligis</hi>

      <hi>quam magnum munus mihi dedisti? nisi forte teipsum parui aestimas;</hi> Doest thou not know (saith his Master) how great a gift thou hast giuen mee? belike thou accountest thy selfe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worth. Implying that hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his gift (though poore) more precious than theirs who were rich; because (though his gift was but very small) yet he cast in all that he had; Likewise it is granted that there is no proportion betweene such a seeming something, such a lesse then nothing as this, and the great loue &amp; obseruance which you haue condignlie merited at my hands; Yet seeing the Moralist tells mee, that where onely the qualitie of the affection and not the quantity of the present is to bee attended: <hi>Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum non differt à magno,</hi> it skils not whether the present bee great or small, so that your affection may alwaies rest beyond desert, and
<pb facs="4"/>
gracious acceptance, farre excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding expectation, in which hope resting, I craue leaue for writing, and take leaue of writing: praying God to blesse you still in this life, and to crowne you with blessednesse it selfe in the life to come.</p>
