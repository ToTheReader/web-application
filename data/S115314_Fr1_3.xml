   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a saying of the Psalmist, <hi>The foole hath said in his hart, there is no God:</hi> this is an Atheisticall foole; and amongst other markes, hee is knowne by this, that this wicked foole <hi>calleth not vpon God.</hi> He doth not pray, for he cannot pray, is not a gift of nature: but a worke of Grace. Wee know not how to pray as we ought, but as the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, to pray with groanes that cannot be expressed. <hi>Iohn</hi> taught his Disciples to pray: this Christs Disciples obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb facs="5"/> and also saw their owne want, and therefore desired the Lord to teach them to pray. Wherevpon hee gaue them, and in them to vs, a perfect pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne and forme of prayer. After this all our prayers are to be directed. It is then necessary that this short prayer be well vnderstood: for which cause I haue made this short exposition, and drawne out briefly manyfold obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations, the better to acquaint such as know it not, with the meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. It will administer sufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for meditation, at all times, and vpon any occasion, to enlarge our thoughts in prayer: the practice wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the speciall grace of a Christian. It is the fruit of Faith, so as hee that beleeueth, prayeth; and so excellent a duty is this, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, <hi>Pray continually,</hi> as if mans life consisted
<pb facs="5"/> in it. And Christ sayth, <hi>Watch, and Pray,</hi> It is a meanes of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation from euill, and a conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of vs in an estate which is good. Wōderfull is the effect of prayer. <hi>Moses</hi> by it makes way thorow the Red sea, ouercame the Amalekites, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained pardō for the people. By this, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sua</hi> had the Sun standing still the space of a day, waiting vpon him in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute of his enemies; by this, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> reuersed the sentence of death, and had his life prolonged; by this, <hi>Peter</hi> esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the hands of <hi>Herod; Ionah</hi> gate out of the Whales belly. By this, <hi>Eliah</hi> shut heauen three yeeres; and againe brought raine from heauen. By this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisha</hi> raised one from the dead, &amp; got sight to <hi>Gehezi</hi> to see vision of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Incredible is the power of prayer; the prayer of faith auaileth much, if
<pb facs="6"/> it be feruent. Let therfore here in euery good Christian exercise himselfe, and this let him know; that it is a great honour to be admitted into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, to put vp his requests vnto so high a Maiesty. The due esteeme of prayer, will make vs exercise our selues in prayer: for as wee prize a thing, so we practise, so we employ our selues about it. Therefore little pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing argueth, we make little account thereof: but the lesse we esteeme and practise it, the lesse grace wee haue, and the more corruption of heart is in vs. The truth of this is cleared in such as wee see to make no conscience of this duty. But this euill be farre from the faithfull, in whom the gift of prayer is euer found, as a peculiar property of them that shall inherit Glory.</p>
