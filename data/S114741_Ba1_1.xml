For the tyrannouse behauer in their cruell predecessours ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue they no maner of shame. Neyther yet repēt they their own blasphemouse trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son againste God and his veryte, what though their most wretched consciences do daylye accuse them therof. The king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of God,<note place="margin">Kyngedō of God.</note> which is a true faythe in his worde or a perfighte knowlege of the gospell, do not they seke to vpholde. But violentlie thei speake yll of it, trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble it, persecute it, chace it, and bannish it, by cause it is of him and from within Luce vii. The kyngdome of the pope,<note place="margin">Popes kyngedom</note> which cōmeth with outwarde obserua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion of dayes, persones, places, tymes, meates, garmentes, and ceremonyes, they magnifie aboue the moue, bicause it is from without, and to their peculiar aduauntage in the loyterynge reigne of ydelnesse</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="48"/>They haue thought and yet thynke by their terryble turmoilinges to turne ouer all, &amp; to chāge the most noble enter pryse of our kinge,<note place="margin">A change.</note> yet ones again laiser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie, to their popes behoue.

They thinke also by condempninge and burninge our bokes, to put vs to silence. But that wyll sureli bringe double vpon them, if they be not ware. Apoc. xviii.

Ye shall not nowe heare a worde spoken agaynste him at Paules crosse, nor yet agaynst his olde iuglynge feates. And in dede it is a good wyse waye to set hym vp againe. Wynchester and Sampson made a lyttle bragge at the begynnynge, to seme yet to do sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, but sens they haue repented, and made a large amēdes for it other wayes Fryre Peryn begāne to wryte in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of theyr monstruouse Masse,<note place="margin">Perryn.</note> but now of late dayes, and he can not fynde ther in one blasphemouse abuse iustlye to be reprehended.

   <p>So outragyously to rayle in theyr prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chynges, of the noble and lerned Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes (which of al nacions loueth our kynge mooste intyerlye) for secludynge their pope and chaunginge theyr masses they do not most wysely for themselues They are not so yl beloued of theyr coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treie marchaūtes,<note place="margin">Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> which customabli tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uayle thyder, but they knowe what is ther both sayd &amp; done agaynst thē.

agaynst the sayd Germanes, hys brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge begles were not ashamed to boast it in the open stretes of Vtrecht in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, that the pope shulde agayne haue hys full swaye in Englāde. Of a lykely hode they knowe there, some secrete my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>steries in workynge. I saye yet, be ware of that subtyle generaciō, which seketh not els but to worke all myschefe.</p>
   <p>Gentyl and soft wyttes are oft tymes offended, that we are nowe a dayes so vehement in rebukes.

How paycyēt they wolde be and howe gentil if a rauenous wolfe came vpō thē, they hauynge able weapon to put him a syde Surelye I knowe no kynde of Christen charyte to be shewed to the deuyll. Of non other nature is Moses serpent, but to eate vp the serpentes of Pharaoes sorcerers. Exo. vii.

   <p>Salomon saythe, there is as well a tyme to speake, as a tyme to kepe sylen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and a tyme as well to hate,<note place="margin">Hate them</note> as a time to loue.
