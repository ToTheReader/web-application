                 <title>The grand imposture of the (now) Church of Rome : manifested in this one article of the new Romane creede, viz: the holy, catholike, and apostolike Romane Church, mother and mistresse of all other churches, without which there is no saluation. Proued to ba a new, false, sacrilegious, scandalous, schismaticall, hereticall, and blasphemous article (respectiuely) and euerie way damnable. The last chapter containeth a determination of the whole question, concerning the separation of Protestants from the present Church of Rome: whereby may be discerned whether side is to be accounted schismaticall, or may more iustly pleade soules saluation.

   <head>TO ALL ROMISH PRIESTS, WHETHER Iesuites or Others, of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Seminaries where-soeuer; Mercy, Truth, and Peace in <hi>CHRIST</hi> IESVS.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S some of weake and queazie stomackes abhorre to receiue any Wholsome Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because the very name of Physick is loathsome vnto them; so might I doubt that this <hi>Salutation,</hi> wishing you <hi>Mercie, Truth, and Peace in Christ</hi> (whereby I doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite you to the Reading of this ensewing Treatise) may be reiected by you, because the Title therof may seeme odious vnto you: but that I haue Considered, that I write not vnto your <hi>Laicks,</hi> men commonly of weake Apprehension, and voide of the Infusion of so much as necessary knowledge of Christianity; but vnto your selues, called to the Order of <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> and professed Aduocates for defence of the <hi>Romane Church, [quà</hi> RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANE.] And now hauing said but thus much, I seeme to heare Some of you inueighing against me, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb facs="8"/>
      <q>This is a bold Assumption, or rather an impudent and impious Presumption of this Heretike, so to charge our Romane Church with an Imposture, in this Arch-Article of her Romane Faith: which Church all the world knoweth to be (as the Fathers of the Councell of Trent not long since defined) for birth and breeding the Mother, and for Direction and Dominion the Mistresse of all other Churches Christian. Neuerthelesse dares this busie Vndertaker attempt to perswade vs, that the Church of Rome is Schismaticall; and her Article, concerning the Vniuersality of the same Church, Imposterous: neuer considering that ancient and Catholike Theoreme, <hi>Hee hath not God for his Father, who hath not the Church for his Mother.</hi> How then can this Perswader make good his Assertion?</q>
   </p>
   <p>I were certainely Witlesse, if, after I had professed so much, I should not expect such broad language from Some of you, which I haue formerly receiued: And as faithlesse should I be both to <hi>God</hi> and you, if endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (as I am Commanded) <hi>To haue compassion of some, pulling them out of the fire</hi>;<note place="margin">S. Iude v. 23.</note> I should not patiently suffer words of disgust and disaffection from you, which I ought willingly to suffer for you, and your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>pirituall good. Or else, if because some are fierce (I had almost said furious) in oppugning the <hi>Truth,</hi> I should therefore bee more remisse to defend it: especially seeing that (which was the saying of an Antient and holy <note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Leo.</hi>
      </note> Pope) <hi>Qui alterum ab errore non reuocat, Seipsum errare demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat.</hi> Neither yet can I conceiue how you can iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Reading of this Tractate, by reason of a fower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Obligation that lyeth vpon you. The first is that diuine Direction, giuen especially to iudicious Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.21.</note>
      <hi>To trie all things, and retaine that which is good,</hi> that is to say, True. For if <hi>Truth</hi> were not <hi>good,</hi> no <hi>Goodnesse</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>
could be <hi>True.</hi> Next is the Bond of your Profession, who will be thought to be the onely <hi>Catholikes,</hi> that is the Professors of the <hi>Catholike Faith,</hi> and possessors of that <hi>Fold of Christ,</hi> which in the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi> is called the CATHOLIKE CHVRCH; the defence of which (truly called) <hi>Catholike Church, without which there no Saluation,</hi> is the Subiect of this whole Treatise. Wherein you may finde that your <hi>Romane Church (quà Romane)</hi> is excluded from the Prerogatiue of <hi>The Catholike Mother Church,</hi> as by the Iudgement of the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> it selfe, so also by the same <hi>Catholike Theoreme,</hi> which you so Commonly obiect and glorie in, <hi>viz.</hi> HE HATH NOT GOD FOR HIS FATHER, WHO HATH NOT THE CHVRCH FOR HIS MOTHER; according to the plaine and euident Sence of that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Cyprian. See Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>of this Treatise.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Father,</hi> who was the first Author thereof. A Third Obligation ariseth from your owne Practise, who are so vrgent, vehement, and (in a sort) violent in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a <hi>Necessarie Vnion</hi> with the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> and in inueighing against our <hi>Separation</hi> from it, as against a deadly and damnable <hi>Schisme.</hi> Wherefore it were in you a perfidious Tergiuersation to heare (as hath beene partly <note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Epist. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory.</hi>
      </note> pointed at) your Answers refuted, and your Obiections retorted vpon you; and not to make <hi>Triall</hi> whether you haue beene able to stand vnto your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and Defiance, or no.</p>
   <p>Lastly, in your asking HOVV this Assertion can be made good? your owne Interrogatorie exacteth of you a Diligence, to vnderstand the Answer to the same HOVV? Whereunto (for this Present) I shall Answer but in a Generality, to wit; that I haue endeuored to Insist, 1. Concerning the <hi>Antecedents,</hi> vpon Grounds immoouable, such as are the Common <hi>Rules of Faith,</hi> and good <hi>Conscience</hi>; 2. Vpon <hi>Consequences</hi> vndeniable,
<pb facs="9"/>
such as are your owne <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Conclusions</hi>; 3. For Testification of both the former, vpon <hi>Witnesses</hi> least partiall to vs-ward, such as are (for the most part) your owne Writers; and 4. Concerning the Credit which you may require, in alleaging your Authors, vpon such an <hi>oculata fides,</hi> as whereunto you will take no Exception: and although some of them may happen to bee vrged <hi>Iudicio errante</hi>; yet sure I am, <hi>animo reluctante</hi> not One. But What needs more Prefacing? These and the like Questions, which may appertaine to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in hand, may bee more particularly satisfied in the Discourse it selfe: which I shall desire you to accept with the same <hi>Right-hand</hi> of Christian Affection, wherewith it is offered vnto you: and that if Any shall addresse an Answer thereunto, that then he iudge and censure it vpon the same Caution and Condition, wherewith it is written and tendred vnto him; euen as (for his <hi>Sayings,</hi> or <hi>Gain-Sayings</hi>) he will answer God at the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Fare-you well.</p>
