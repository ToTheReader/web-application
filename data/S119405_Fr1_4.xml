   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>OCTAVIVS the Emperour did rather chuse to violate the will of <hi>Virgil,</hi> then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume <note place="margin">Inter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> fragmenta.</note> those laborious <hi>AEneids</hi> of his in the flames of Obliuion. Why then should not this example of his, excuse me from blame of the Author of this following Worke, for attempting to commit to the Presse, and commending that to others in publike, which he but lent to me in priuate? since good things are best knowne, by their vse; and well considering, how acceptable it may prooue to our hopefull times. The end of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, when hee first began this Treatise (I am well assured) was onely to satisfie his owne priuate Iudgement, esteeming it (through his too much Modestie) so farre vnfit for the publike view, as for the space of tenne or twelue yeeres since the finishing of it, hee suffered it to rest obscure, amongst his other priuate Labours; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his industrie and abilitie may appeare to be made yet more transparent, in his owne vnder-valuing of what hee hath so exactly performed: Which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thus accidentally to my hands, and viewing the matter it treated of, and the malicious slanders it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, I could not chuse but euen blame the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Author, that would haue made the very Wombe of this his seasonable Off-spring, the Tombe, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it at one and the same time both life and dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion together.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>I haue therefore aduentured my Endeuors (without his knowledge, beyond his expectation, and I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, against his desire) for the publishing of that which I knew might prooue so vsefull: which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning obscure, and in silence, neither should the Cause nor the <hi>Parsons</hi> be vindicated; nor yet the soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this Antidote against that dispersed Poyson, haue beene discernable, or serued for publike benefit. And though the man opposed be (as I conceiue) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of defence, yet there remaine many of his Labors, that like the Vipers brood haue suckt a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Poyson from his death. Nor want there many of his Iesuited Disciples, who may yet doe him right, if they thinke him iniuried; though it be true, <hi>Vni Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sari multi insunt Marii.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Suat. li. 1. c. 1.</note>
   </p>
   <p>All I desire, is pardon from the Author, vpon whose Worth so well knowne, and Loue so often tryed by me, I haue thus farre presumed; not doubting, but the publike good that may ensue his owne Labour, will ouer-sway his resolued retyrednesse. As for thy acceptance, I doubt it not, because the benefit is thine owne; and accounting it reward enough to my selfe, that I am but the Instrument of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating this to others. Farewell.</p>
