      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not without reason (right deare and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bretheren) that the Church of Christ is called militant vpon earth: and compared as well to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in trauaile of child from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, as to a ship vpon the sea tossed with tempests, and to a field tilled, vpon which the plowe is drawne to cut it. The present estate of the Church exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by so manie dissipations, assailed so mightelie by continuall warres (the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and nurse of all calamities) and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by reuolts, by Libertines, by people prophane, and by so many heretiques, is to vs a liuelie mirrour, a manifest seale, and an example good to be marked. Now, as the infirmitie of the flesh which dieth not in the verie children of God, but at their death, taketh from thence, and from other matter, occasion of temptations most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and many assaults: so the bounden
<pb facs="7"/>duetie &amp; affection which I beare towards you, driueth me to testifie vnto you the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent desire which I feele continuallie in my heart, of your comfort, constancie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance in the way of saluation. For this cause it is that in my voiage frō
<hi>Germanie</hi> I made this little treatise <hi>Of the markes of the children of God, &amp; of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations in their afflictions:</hi> the which (being GOD be thanked returned) J was willing, with the aduise of my brethren and fellowes in the holie Ministerie, to put to light &amp; dedicate vnto you, to the end that reading it you might knowe and feele more and more the incomprehensible grace of GOD towards you, by the testimonies of your adoption, and the full assurance of the certaintie of it: and that in the middest of your so long and heauie afflictions, you might bee partakers of the vnspeakable comforts which GOD setteth forth to his children in his word: whereby also you feeling your selues truelie happie, you maie constantlie perseuer in his holie trueth and obedience of his will, aspiring with contēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ioy of the holie Ghost to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of that kingdome of glorie, the right
<pb facs="7"/>and possession whereof is purchased for you, and kept in your head Iesus Christ. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, J pray God with all my heart to shewe me this fauour, that this my little labour may bee acceptable vnto you, and that it will please him to blesse it, by the efficacie of his holie spirit, to your comfort and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and to the aduancement of the Kingdome of our Lord Iesus Christ: <hi>Harlem 15.</hi> Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember <hi>1586.</hi>
