      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader, how farre soeuer thou art, thou maist here see (as through a Perspectiue-Glasse) the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble estate of <hi>London,</hi> in this heauy time of conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. It is a picture not drawne to the life, but to the death of aboue twelue thousand, in lesse then six weekes. If thou art in the Countrey, cast thine eye towards vs here at home, and behold what wee indure. If (as thou canst not choose) thou art glad thou art out of this Tempest, haue a care to man thy Ship well, and doe not ouer-lade it with bad merchandize (foule Sins) when thou art bound for this place: for all the danger will be at thy putting in. The Rockes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section lye hid in our deepe Seas, and therefore it behoues thy soule to take heed what sayles she hoyses, and thy body, what Pylote it carries aboord. Wee doe not thinke, but numbers of you wish your selues here againe: for your entertainement a far off cannot be courteous, when euen not two miles from vs, there is nothing but churlishnesse. But it is to be feared, some of you will get such falls in the Corne-Fields of the Country, that you will hardly bee able (without halting) to walke vp and downe <hi>London.</hi> But take good hearts, and keepe good legges vnder you, and be sure, you haue hung strong Pad-lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>es vpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> your doores; for in many Streetes, there are none to guard your goods, but the Houses themselues. If one Shop be open, sixteene in a row stand shut vp together, and those that are open, were as good to be shut; for they take no Money.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>None thriue but Apothecaries, Butchers, Cookes, and Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin-makers. Coach-men ride a cock-horse, and are so full of Iadish trickes, that you cannot be iolted sixe miles from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> vnder thirty or forty shillings. Neuer was Hackney-flesh so deare. Few woollen Drapers sel any Cloth, but euery Church-yard is euery day full of linnen Drapers: and the Earth is the great Warehouse, which is piled vp with winding-sheetes. To see a Rapier or Feather worne in <hi>London</hi> now, is as strange, as to meet a Low-countrey Souldier with Money in his Purse: The walkes in <hi>Pauls</hi> are empty: the walkes in <hi>London</hi> too wide, (here's no lustling;) but the best is, Cheape-side is a com fortable Garden, where all Phisicke-Herbes grow. Wee wish that you (the Run-awayes) would suffer the Market-Folkes to come to vs, (or that they had hearts to come) for the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of fore-stalling is sued vpon you. Wee haue lost your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and not content with that, you robbe vs of our victuals: but when you come backe, keepe open house (to let in ayre) and set good cheere on your Tables, that we may bid you welcome.</p>
