   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable, if there were so many good reasons to moue your Honour graciously to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept these my labours, as I haue iust causes to induce me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them to your Honor; then I should haue good hope, that as they haue most willingly come from mee, so they should haue good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce at your Honors hands. For besides your late Honorable fauour extended vnto me requireth this and al other duties of me, wherby I might shew my selfe thankefull to your Honour for the same; euen so the desire also that I haue, that this truth of GOD might come forth with the best credite, hath moued me in the conscience of mine ovvne tenuitie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come humble sutor in the behalfe thereof for your honorable gracious protection. Wherein if I haue intruded my selfe further then I ought, and pressed neerer to your Honor, then it becommeth mee, crauing your Honorable pardon for this my bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, I beseech your Honor to accept either my fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent desire to tender all duties vnto you, or my great care to purchase best fauour for this worke, or both,
<pb facs="3"/> vvhich haue compelled me hereunto. And herein I am so much the more importunate vvith your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, not for my selfe, but for this part of Gods holie truth, that it might be countenanced as one of your Honors fauorites, because as wee be fallen into these euil daies, wherin too many are readie vnaduisedly to set themselues against whatsoeuer they dislike, and therfore the best causes are driuen to seeke patronage where it maie doe them most good. So the Lorde hauing inlarged your honorable name, aboue a great manie, which as a precious ointment flowing from your selfe, comfortablie refresheth and perfumeth a great number, this part of Gods trueth also might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioie the common benefit of it with other, to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadowed thereby, and by that meanes haue enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment there, where otherwise happily it should be finally regarded. And so it becomming for your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors sake a welcome guest vnto them, it might deliuer vnto them in the name of God as sent by your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that message of his that it centaineth, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of his name, to whom all honor is due, from whō all honour commeth, whome trulie to honour is the greatest honor. Thus ceasing anie further to interrupt your Honor from your weightie affaires, my praier vnto God is long to preserue your Honor, zealous of the glorie of God, faithful to her Maiestie, profitable to the whole realme, and comfortable to your owne soule; most humblie with all dutifulnesse taking my leaue.</p>
