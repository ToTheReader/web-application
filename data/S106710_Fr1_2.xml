                 <title>Three questions ansvvered : I. Question. What should our meaning be, when after the reading of the fourth Commandement, we pray; Lord incline our hearts to keepe this law? II. Question. How shall the fourth Commandement, being deliuered in such forme of words, binde vs to sanctifie any day, but onely the seauenth, the day wherein God rested, &amp; which the Iewes sanctified? III. Question. How shall it appeare to be the law of nature to sanctifie one day in every weeke?</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is sarce any point of doctrine more controverted, then the doctrine of the Sabbath,<note place="margin">Two points of difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs are: when the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth, &amp; what worke may be done therein.</note> as D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Bound</hi> telleth vs: indeed, not only we Protestants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our selues, but the Papists also among their selues, differ in opinion hereabout. Againe, there is (in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) iudging one another, there is doing things doubtingly, and there is doing things with offence: which were they to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable in the Church of Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> S<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Paul would not haue spent a whole chapter about these matters. Moreover, whereas the Papists praying in latin doe pray without vnderstanding; many amongst vs doe pray with a sinfull vnderstanding: for as in words, so in meaning, they desire God to incline their hearts to keepe the <hi>7<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
      </hi> day for Sabbath, and to doe no worke therein. Farthermore,<note place="margin">It was printed last <hi>1618.</hi>
      </note> some in their booke often printed (to say nothing of other) haue these and the like passages: <hi>The 4<seg rend="sup">th</seg> commandement is no more Ceremoniall, then all the rest: the observation of the 7<seg rend="sup">th</seg> day is a morall and perpetuall duty: we may not pick vp a few sticks on the Sabbath: there is asmuch difference betweene the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
<pb facs="3"/> and other dayes, as betweene Sacramentall bread and common bread. &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The knowledg and consideration hereof (among other things) causeth mee greatly to desire, that the doctrine of the Sabbath may once at length be throughly discussed by men of sound iudgment: and doubtles, what the Scriptures sentence is in this matter, would soone be knowne, were it (as <hi>D<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> sometime advised) well handled by the learned men of our Vniversityes:<note place="margin">Act. and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> no man amongst vs should need any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to halt betweene two opinions, as (the more to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) many of long time haue done, and still doe; yea, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the better order be taken, no doubt will doe even vnto the end of the world.</p>
   <p>Now to provoke herevnto I haue written this little booke: and partly also, as hoping it will conduce somthing to the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of the trueth, when the time commeth, that it shalbe more carefully sought after which time God hasten for his sake which is <hi>the trueth,</hi> Iesus Christ; vnto the illumination of whose Spirit I commend thee (gentle Reader) and so rest.</p>
