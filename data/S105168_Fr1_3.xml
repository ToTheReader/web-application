<pb facs="3"/>vhich is done the more vvillingly in respecte of the greate and zelouse desire that many of our poore countrye hath, rather to occupye them selues deuoutly by begging pardone for their sinnes, thē curiously by searching the secrete mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of God, to spende their time in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and insolente contradictions, tendinge to no other ende, but onely to roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="4"/>specially for that they are collected and translated out of dyuers famous and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Authors, as vvell auncient as of the time presēt, and are to the great increase of deuotion published in many countries and in dyuers tongues, before this my collection &amp; translatiō: vvhich if I may request to be gratefully accepted of thee good catholicke and christian Reader, it shall gyue me the radiar occasion, to take the lyke paynes in any such profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table action, vvhich hereafter maye be offred: and thus vvishing, that increase of grace to the reader, vvhich I desire to my selfe, and desiring hartye repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce to be vvrought in the hartes of all my deare country-men, I bid thee gentle reader hartely fare-vvell.</p>
