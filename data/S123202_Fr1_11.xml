         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O you I dedicate this worke of Grace,</l>
      <l>This frame of Glory which I haue erected,</l>
      <l>For your faire mind I hold the fittest place,</l>
      <l>Where virtue should be fetled &amp; protected;</l>
      <l>If highest thoughts true honor do imbrace,</l>
      <l>And holy Wisdom is of them respected:</l>
      <l>Then in this Mirrour let your faire eyes looke,</l>
      <l>To view your virtues in this blessed Booke.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Blest by our Sauiours merits, not my skil,</l>
      <l>Which I acknowledge to be very small;</l>
      <l>Yet if the least part of his blessed Will</l>
      <l>I haue perform'd, I count I haue done all:</l>
      <l>One sparke of grace sufficient is to fill</l>
      <l>Our Lampes with oyle, ready when he doth call</l>
      <l>To enter with the Bridegroome to the feast,</l>
      <l>Where he that is the greatest may be least.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Greatnesse is no sure frame to build vpon,</l>
      <l>No worldly treasure can assure that place;</l>
      <l>God makes both euen, the Cottage with the Throne,</l>
      <l>All worldly honours there are counted base;</l>
      <l>Those he holds deare, and reckneth as his owne,</l>
      <l>Whose virtuous deeds by his especially grace</l>
      <l>Haue gain'd his loue, his kingdome, and his crowne,</l>
      <l>Whom in the booke of Life he hath set downe.</l>
   </lg>
   <pb facs="20"/>
   <lg>
      <l>Titles of honour which the world bestowes,</l>
      <l>To none but to the virtuous doth belong;</l>
      <l>As beauteous bowres where true worth should repose,</l>
      <l>And where his dwellings should be built most strong:</l>
      <l>But when they are bestow'd vpon her foes,</l>
      <l>Poore virtues friends indure the greatest wrong:</l>
      <l>For they must fuffer all indignity,</l>
      <l>Vntill in heau'n they better graced be.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>What difference was there when the world began,</l>
      <l>Was it not Virtue that distinguisht all?</l>
      <l>All sprang but from one woman and one man,</l>
      <l>Then how doth Gentry come to rise and fall?</l>
      <l>Or who is he that very rightly can</l>
      <l>Distinguish of his birth, or tell at all,</l>
      <l>In what meane state his Ancestors haue bin,</l>
      <l>Before some one of worth did honour win?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Whose successors, although they beare his name,</l>
      <l>Possessing not the riches of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>inde,</l>
      <l>How doe we know they spring out of the same</l>
      <l>True stocke of honour, beeing not of that ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>d?</l>
      <l>It is faire virtue gets immortall fame,</l>
      <l>Tis that doth all loue and duty bind:</l>
      <l>If he that much enjoyes, doth little good,</l>
      <l>We may suppose he comes not of that blood.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Nor is he fit for honour, or command,</l>
      <l>If base affections ouer-rules his mind;</l>
      <l>Or that selfe-will doth carry such a hand,</l>
      <l>As worldly pleasures haue the powre to blind</l>
      <l>So as he cannot see, nor vnderstand</l>
      <l>How to discharge that place to him affign'd:</l>
      <l>Gods Stewards must for all the poore prouide,</l>
      <l>If in Gods house they purpose to abide.</l>
   </lg>
   <pb facs="20"/>
   <lg>
      <l>To you, as to Gods Steward I doe write,</l>
      <l>In whom the seeds of virtue haue bin sowne,</l>
      <l>By your most worthy mother, in whose right,</l>
      <l>All her faire parts you challenge as your owne;</l>
      <l>If you, sweet Lady, will appeare as bright</l>
      <l>As euer creature did that time hath knowne,</l>
      <l>Then weare this Diadem I present to thee,</l>
      <l>Which I haue fram'd for her Eternitie.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>You are the Heire apparant of this Crowne</l>
      <l>Of goodnesse, bountie, grace, loue, pietie,</l>
      <l>By birth its yours, then keepe it as your owne,</l>
      <l>Defend it from all base indignitie;</l>
      <l>The right your Mother hath to it, is knowne</l>
      <l>Best vnto you, who reapt such fruit thereby:</l>
      <l>This Monument of her faire worth retaine</l>
      <l>In your pure mind, and keepe it from al staine.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And as your Ancestors at first possest</l>
      <l>Their honours, for their honourable deeds,</l>
      <l>Let their faire virtues neuer be transgrest,</l>
      <l>Bind vp the broken, stop the wounds that bleeds,</l>
      <l>Succour the poore, comfort the comfortlesse,</l>
      <l>Cherish faire plants, suppresse vnwholsom weeds;</l>
      <l>Although base pelfe do chance to come in place,</l>
      <l>Yet let true worth receiue your greatest grace.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>So shal you shew from whence you are descended,</l>
      <l>And leaue to all posterities your fame,</l>
      <l>So will your virtues alwaies be commended,</l>
      <l>And euery one will reuerence your name;</l>
      <l>So this poore worke of mine shalbe defended</l>
      <l>From any scandall that the world can frame:</l>
      <l>And you a glorious Actor will appeare</l>
      <l>Louely to all, but vnto God most deare.</l>
   </lg>
   <pb facs="21"/>
   <lg>
      <l>I know right well these are but needlesse lines,</l>
      <l>To you, that are so perfect in your part,</l>
      <l>Whose birth and education both combines;</l>
      <l>Nay more than both, a pure and godly heart,</l>
      <l>So well instructed to such faire designes,</l>
      <l>By your deere Mother, that there needs no art:</l>
      <l>Your ripe discretion in your tender yeares,</l>
      <l>By all your actions to the world appeares.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>I doe but set a candle in the sunne,</l>
      <l>And adde one drop of water to the sea,</l>
      <l>Virtue and Beautie both together run,</l>
      <l>When you were borne, within your breast to stay;</l>
      <l>Their quarrell ceast, which long before begun,</l>
      <l>They liue in peace, and all doe them obey:</l>
      <l>In you faire Madame, are they richly plac'd,</l>
      <l>Where all their worth by Eternity is grac'd.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>You goddesse-like vnto the world appeare,</l>
      <l>Inricht with more than fortune can bestowe,</l>
      <l>Goodnesse and Grace, which you doe hold more deere</l>
      <l>Than worldly wealth, which melts away like snowe;</l>
      <l>Your pleasure is the word of God to heare,</l>
      <l>That his most holy precepts you may know:</l>
      <l>Your greatest honour, faire and virtuous deeds,</l>
      <l>Which from the loue and feare of God proceeds.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Therefore to you (good Madame) I present</l>
      <l>His louely loue, more worth than purest gold,</l>
      <l>Who for your sake his pretious blood hath spent,</l>
      <l>His death and passion here you may behold,</l>
      <l>And view this Lambe, that to the world was sent,</l>
      <l>Whom your faire soule may in her armes infold:</l>
      <l>Louing his loue, that did endure such paine,</l>
      <l>That you in heauen a worthy place might gaine.</l>
   </lg>
   <pb facs="21"/>
   <lg>
      <l>For well you knowe, this world is but a Stage</l>
      <l>Where all doe play their parts, and must be gone;</l>
      <l>Here's no respect of persons, youth, nor age,</l>
      <l>Death seizeth all, he neuer spareth one,</l>
      <l>None can preuent or stay that tyrants rage,</l>
      <l>But Iesus Christ the Iust: By him alone</l>
      <l>He was orecome, He open set the dore</l>
      <l>To Eternall life, ne're seene, nor knowne before.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>He is the stone the builders did refuse,</l>
      <l>Which you, sweet Lady, are to build vpon;</l>
      <l>He is the rocke that holy Church did chuse,</l>
      <l>Among which number, you must needs be one;</l>
      <l>Faire Shepheardesse, tis you that he will vse</l>
      <l>To feed his flocke, that trust in him alone:</l>
      <l>All wordly blessings he vouchsafes to you,</l>
      <l>That to the poore you may returne his due.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And if deserts a Ladies loue may gaine,</l>
      <l>Then tell me, who hath more deseru'd than he?</l>
      <l>Therefore in recompence of all his paine,</l>
      <l>Bestowe your paines to reade, and pardon me,</l>
      <l>If out of wants, or weakenesse of my braine,</l>
      <l>I haue not done this worke sufficiently;</l>
      <l>Yet lodge him in the closet of your heart,</l>
      <l>Whose worth is more than can be shew'd by Art.</l>
