      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may bee you haue not, as yet, heard the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of our proceedinges, and carriage, towards those two Reverend Brethren, who came latelie hither, to recommend to vs, and our People, the <hi>LATE COVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANT</hi>: Wee declare therefore to you, That we hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their comming, and intention, and beeing of a contrarie mynde, resolved, that before wee should giue consent, that they should preach to our People, wee would propone to them, by way of certaine DEMANDS, the chiefe reasons which made vs to bee averse from their proceedings; promising to admit them to our Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, if they should giue vs satisfaction, concerning the <hi>LATE COVENANT.</hi> Wee intended not to Print these DEMANDES at the first; but afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering howe much our People might bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by them, in that pious resolution which they haue, to continue in the obedience of the Lawes of this Church and Kingdome, concerning <hi>EPISCOPACIE,</hi> and those thinges which were concluded in <hi>PEARTH ASSEMBLIE</hi>; wee thought good to put them to the
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
Presse, but determined not to make vse of them, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulgating them, except we saw that our people stood in present neede of them; which indeede came to passe: for vpon Fryday, the twentie of <hi>Julie</hi> last, these Reverende Brethren came to this Towne, and having that same night receaved our DEMANDES in writ, they returned their <hi>Answeres</hi> vnto <hi>them</hi> on Saturday following, late in the evening: but they came not to our handes, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed vnto them, vntill Sunday in the morning. Neyther had we leasure to reade, or consider, vntill both the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were ended in our Churches. Wherefore wee did meete together that day, at foure houres afternoone, that wee might peruse them. And at that same tyme, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that these Reverend Brethren had preached in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of dyverse of our people, conveaned in the court of a noble man his lodging, not having obtayned our consent thereto, and in their Sermons had vsed a forme of <hi>Answering</hi> to our DEMANDES, which they did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licklie reade, affirming, that they had given full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to vs, in a written coppie of their <hi>Answeres,</hi> which they had sent to vs: and by that meanes, had laboured to disswade and draw our People from their obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>PEARTH,</hi> &amp; the Lawes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ratifying them: wee knowing how insufficient their <hi>Answeres</hi> were, to giue satisfaction to anie, who would duelie ponder our DEMANDES, gaue licence to the Printer to divulgate them, and the next day did wryte our REPLYES to their <hi>Answeres,</hi> intending to put them to the Presse on Tuesday. But wee were earnestlie entreated by a noble Man, to send backe to them the copie of their <hi>Answeres,</hi> that they might revise and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them, &amp; also to delay the printing of our REPLYES vntill Fryday following. Which wee willinglie granted. But wherefore this was desired of vs, you may conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; seeing they neyther added, nor diminished, nor
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
altered anie thing in their <hi>Answeres.</hi> Vpon the next Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day at night, wee gaue our REPLYES to the Printer: and to these Reverende Brethren, who returned not to this Citie, vntill Saturday following, wee sent a copie of our <hi>Replyes</hi> in writ, on the <hi>Lords Day</hi>: vnto which we recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not their <hi>Answeres,</hi> vntill they came from the Presse, to wit, on Tuesday the fourteenth of <hi>August</hi>: that is, eyghteene dayes after they had receaved our REPLYES. What successe these Brethren had in their Sermons, which they preached here, vpō two severall <hi>Lords Dayes,</hi> it is sufficientlie knowne: neyther haue they reason to talke so much of it as they doe, in their Preface to the Reader. The first of these <hi>Dayes,</hi> some few who were thought to bee that way inclined before, subscry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their <hi>COVENANT</hi>: But the next <hi>Lords Day,</hi> they scarce prevailed with anie at all. And a great many, who heard them both these <hi>Dayes,</hi> professed, that they returned from their Sermons, more averse from the <hi>COVENANT,</hi> than they were before. Now good Reader, wee present to thee our REPLYES, to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Answeres</hi>; which for shortnesse cause, wee haue called <hi>DƲPLYES</hi>: wee pray you consider them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiallie. And if you reape anie benefite by perusing them, let it not be ascrybed vnto vs, but to the invincible force of divyne Trueth. Wee conclude with <hi>Zorobabell,</hi> saying▪ <hi>Blessed bee the GOD of Trueth</hi>: And let all the People shout, and saye, <hi>Great is Trueth, and mightie aboue all thinges.</hi>
