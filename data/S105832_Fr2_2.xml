                 <title>Greenes neuer too late. Or, A powder of experience: sent to all youthfull gentlemen : to roote out the infectious follies, that ouer-reaching conceits foster in the spring time of their youth. Decyphering in a true English historie, those particular vanities, that with thei frostie vapours nip the blossoms of euery ripe braine, from atteining to his intended perfection. As pleasant, as profitable, being a right pumice stone, apt to race out idlenesse with delight, and follie with admonition. Rob. Greene in artibus Magister</title>

I haue from the loue of a lasciuious Curtizan, brought him to the VVife of his youth: the storie necessarie for yong Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and not offensiue vnto graue eares: for the most seuere Stoick of all that seekes a knot in a rush, may herein finde some sentence woorth the marking. And though you as <hi>Virgill</hi> hold <hi>Ennius,</hi> yet you may out of his drosse gather

some golde. They which thinke there is no God to their Goddesse, may here finde that wanton loues are the readie paths to preiudice, and that effeminate follies are the efficient causes of dyre disparagement, and that there is no Iewel like the gift of an honest wife. But whatsoeuer it is, all is shrowded vnder your fauour: which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping you will as gratefullie patronage as the former, I wish your VVorship as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie good fortunes as your self can desire, or I imagine.</p>
