<pb facs="6"/>
bringeth soorth men so rarely qualified, and of such ripe preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant conceipts, that they can gather out of their soft beds, and full dishes at home, better abilitie to iudge, bolder audacity to speake, and a quicker insight to discern and censure other mens sufficiences, then others can in many yeares trauell abroad with many carefull thoughtes, industrious penuries and paineful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences belonging vnto that life attaine vnto: it was not so in <hi>Homers</hi> time, for he vnder the person of <hi>Vlisses</hi> indeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to deseribe and patterne forth the most perfect and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished Gentleman of Greece, hee did not praise him for the nimblenesse of his tongue, the gainesse of his cloathes, nor the <note place="margin">Vlisses praised by Homer for hauing seene many coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tries and the fashions of many men.</note>boldnesse of his face, no nor for his superficiall smattering in many bookes, but he said, <hi>Multornm mores vidit &amp; vrbes,</hi> making that the foundation whereupon to build the rest of his prayses, in fine how succesles soeuer their vertuous endenours fall out, there is no kind of people with whome I do willinglyer conuerse, as being fruitfull and pleasing in their discourses, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so through their acquaintance with the ciuilitie of other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, moderate and offenceles in their behauiour, of which sorte it hath been my happinesse to be beholding to many of sundry nations for their friendly conuersation, who neuer were so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at any time to speake, as I euer was ready to receiue their discourses with an attentiue eare, wherein I alwaies especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obserued one thing, that whether they with whom I conferred were Englishmen, French men, Spaniards, Germains, Poloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yea or Italians borne in the bordering prouinces, as of each sort I haue beene acquainted with many, though sundrie of them had been in the farthest parts of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> yet comming once to speake of the cittie of <hi>Venice,</hi> they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force their speech to the highest of all admiration, as being a thing of the greatest worthinesse, and most infinitely
<pb facs="6"/>
remarkable, that they had seen in the whole course of their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels.</p>
   <p>Some of the youthfuller sort, would extoll to the skies their humanitie towardes straungers, the delicacie of their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, the beauty, pomp, &amp; daintines of their women, &amp; finally the infinite superflutties of all pleasure and delightes.</p>
   <p>Other of a grauer humor would dilate of the greatnes of their Empire, the grauitie of their prince, the maiesty of their Senate, the vnuiolablenes of their lawes, their zeale in religiō, and lastly their moderation, and equitie, wherewith they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne such subiected prouinces as are vnder their dominion, binding them therby in a faster bonde of obedience then all the cytadels, garrisons, or whatsoeuer other tyrannicall inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could euer haue brought them vnto. These and such like reportes haue from time to time kindled within me so greate a desire to acquaint myselfe with the particularities of this famous Cittie, that though during the time of my trauell, (destinate to more vnhappy courses) I was not so fortunate as to bee a beholder of the glorie thereof, yet I haue not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from time to time to gather such obseruations as well by reading the best and choicest authors entreating there of, as also by conference with sundry wel experienced gentlemē, as might not onely satisfie the curiositie of my own desire, but also deliuer vnto other a cleare and exact knowledge of euery particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie worthy of note, that thereunto appartaineth, which cannot as I imagine (the noblenesse of the subiect considered) but bee <note place="margin">All other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gouern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within that of Venice.</note>pleasing and agreeable to the best conceipted spirits, who may out of this one commonwelth of <hi>Venice,</hi> gather and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the fruite of all whatsoeuer other gouernments through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world▪ that are of any same or excellency: for in the person of the Venetian prince, who sitting at the helme of this citie shineth in all exterior ornamentes of royall dignitie;
<pb facs="7"/>
(neuerthelesse both he and his authority, being wholy subiected to the lawes) they may see a straunge and vnusuall forme of a most excellent Monarchie.</p>
   <p>Then what more perfect and liuely pattern of a well ordered Aristocraticall gouernment can there in the worlde bee expressed, then that of their Councell of Pregati or Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which being the onely chiefe and principall members of all supreame power; yet haue not any power, mean, or possibility at all to tyranize, or to peruert their Country lawes?</p>
   <p>Lastly if they desire to see a most rare and matchlesse president of a Democrasie or popular estate, let them beholde their great Councell, consisting at the least of <hi>3000.</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whereupon the highest strength and mightinesse of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state absolutely relyeth, notwithstanding which number all thinges are ordered with so diuine a peaceablenes, and so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all tumult and confusion, that it rather seemeth to bee an assembly of Angels, then of men.</p>
   <p>In fine, whithersoeuer you turne your eyes, they shall not encounter any thing but obiectes of admiration; their iustice is pure and vncorrupted: their penall Lawes most vnpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably executed: their encouragements to vertue infinite: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by their distribution of offices &amp; dignities, which is orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in such so secrete, strange, and intricate a sort, that it vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ouerreacheth the subtiltie of all ambitious practises, neuer falling vpon any but vpon such as are by the whole assembly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for men of greatest wisedome, vertue and integritie of life, as by the following discourse most euidently shall appeare.</p>
   <p>But besides these before rehearsed, there are sundry other so maruellous and miraculous considerations, and in their owne exceeding singularitie, beyond all resemblance or comparison with any other Commonwealth so vnspeakeablie sirange, that their wonderfull rarenesse being verified, maketh the straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
<pb facs="7"/>
impossibilities not seeme altogether incredible: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: first touching the situation thereof, what euer hath the worlde brought forth more monstrously strange, then that so great &amp; glorious a Citie should bee seated in the middle of the sea, especially to see such pallaces, monasteries, temples, towers, turrets, &amp; pinacles reaching vp vnto the cloudes, founded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Quagmires, and planted vppon such vnfirme moorish and spungie foundations, there being neytherwood, nor stone, nor matter fit for building within tenne miles thereof, for so farre distant from it was the nearest maine land, at such time as the first foundation was laide?</p>
   <p>Besides, what is there that can carrie a greater disproportion with common rules of experience, thē that vnweaponed men in gownes should with such happinesse of successe giue direction &amp; law to many mightie and warlike armies both by sea and land, and that a single Citie vnwalled, and alone should command &amp; ouer toppe mighty kingdomes, and such famous farre extended prouinces, remayning euer it selfe inuincible, and long robed citizens to bee serued, yea and sued vnto for entertainment by the greatest princes &amp; peeres of <hi>Italy:</hi> amidst which infinit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of glorie, and vnmeasurable mightinesse of power, of which there are in soueraignty pertakers aboue 3000. gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet is there not one among them to bee found that doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire to any greater appellation of honour, or higher tytle of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie then to be called a Gentleman of <hi>Venice,</hi> including in the same the height of all imaginable honour, so deare vnto this generous people is the name and loue of their noble country?</p>
   <p>And lastly, though not least to be wondred at, they haue (as it were entertayning a league &amp; intelligence with the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powers) preserued this royall Citie of theirs this 13. hundred yeares since the first foundation thereof, in an estate so perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally flourishing &amp; vnblemished, that though sundry &amp; mighty
<pb facs="8"/>
kinges and Emperours being enamored with her beauty and goodlinesse, haue with maruellous endeuour and multitude of armies sought to possesse themselues of so faire and precious a pray: yet haue they hitherto kept her like a pure and vntouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed virgine, free from the taste or violence of any forraine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement.</p>
   <p>The strange beginning, mighty increase and long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatnesse of this happy commowea th hath serued to many present writers for the glorious subiect of their learned histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: among the rest he that hath written thereof with greatest iudgement &amp; authoritie in my opinion, is the Cardinal <hi>Gasper Contareno,</hi> by birth a Gentleman, and by desert and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse at that time a Senator of <hi>Venice:</hi> but being now aboue fourescore years since he wrote the same; since which time there haue succeeded many alterations of lawes, and changes of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in his country, I thought it not unnecessarie to adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto sundrie other particularities, gathered (as I said) partly by conference, partly by reading of other learned Authors, as <hi>Donato, Iustinian, Munster, Bodin, Ant, Stella, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>souino, Domenico Francesco, Girolamo Bardi</hi> &amp;c.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Contareno</hi> did first write this treatise in Latine, the same being since his time translated into Italian by a Gentleman of <hi>Italie,</hi> which translation I haue here chiefly followed, though still comparing the same with the Latine originall, in regarde of my desire to expresse the proper names of their Magistrates, lawes, and ceremonies according to their common appellations, which is much altered in the Latine stile: I will not speake of my paines herein, nor enter into any insinuating challenge of thankes, for in truth I haue neither taken the one, nor deserued the other, hauing written it at idle times when I had nothing els to doe, being at much more leysure then willingly I woulde bee.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="8"/>
But me thinkes I heare it vbrayded vnto me, that it is now rather a time to doe then to write: I confesse it to be so for him that is well set on worke: and yet hee that writeth well is neuer the farther off from doing well: so that for my part I holde it no disgrace to write so long as my penne vttereth no d shonestie. My education hath been in the wars: this I onely doc to beguile time; wishing that whosoeuer shall herein censure mee amisse, would be as ready as my selfe, both in minde and body, when ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cōmandement of my prince, or the occasion of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie shalinioine me to other courses: in the meanetime vtterly carelesse of mine owne praise, I yet intreate them that shal reade this discourse, to intertaine this famous Common wealth with all friendlinesse and fauour, if in no other regarde, yet in this, that therest of the whole world honoreth her with the name of a Virgin, a name though in all places most sacred &amp; venerable, yet in no place more dearely and religiously to bee reuerenced, then with us, who haue thence deriued our blessednesse, which I beseech God may long continue among vs.</p>
