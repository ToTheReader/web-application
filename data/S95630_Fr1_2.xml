   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, It is now more then two yeeres, since I published (for some speciall respects) A little Booke intituled, <hi>A briefe view of the weake grounds of Poperie.</hi> Of late there came to my hands; <hi>A refutation of Master</hi> Bels <hi>Treatise, Intituled, the triall of the new Religion, and a short view of</hi> Thomas Rogers <hi>vntrueths; with a short Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum for</hi> T. V. <hi>otherwise called</hi> Thomas Vdall, <hi>by one</hi> B.C. <hi>Student in Diuinitie,</hi> as he stileth himselfe: wherein he presents me with <hi>A short sample of such fowle flawes as are in my Booke,</hi> as he suggesteth: <hi>VVhich subiect hee minds heereafter to prosecute with a more full hand.</hi> If his mind chaunge not, <hi>Or that the happie newes of my Conuersion, crosse not his designe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Whereof hee seemes so confident, that in two places of the three last leaues of his Preface (which is all that concernes me, in that Tract) hee boldly affirmes, that hee sees no cause to dispaire of; <hi>If true zeale of trueth, and sauing my soule, haue set me a worke:</hi> Which two principall
<pb facs="3"/> motiues (with a feruent desire I had, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw some of my best friends from that Egyptian darkenesse of Popish superstion: which to Gods glory is since effected) I doe ingenuously confesse, to haue bene the sole and only cause of that small Tract.</p>
   <p>But I cannot but maruell, vpon what ground, or hope, this confidence of my conuersion should be so presumed; (vnlesse it be to gull some of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish dependantes with the hope thereof) since in this little, he hath deliuered, hee hath onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted against fiue particulars, which he hath se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of seuerall places in my booke: And yet, if they were all graunted, It nothing impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the summe and substance therof; but that it may be notwithstanding sound and good inough: vnlesse in Master <hi>B. C.</hi> Logique, these be good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences. <hi>T. V. hath mistaken, or misalleadged some fewe authorities, in his Booke: Ergo, he hath not shewed the weakenesse of the grounds of Popish Religion: Ergo, the Papists are wrongfully charged with blasphemie: Ergo, the Scriptures defended by the Papists are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced to bee Apocripha, &amp;c.</hi> But it seemes by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>B. C.</hi> proceeding, both with mee and others; That such is the simplicitie of the Popish vulgar Catholiques, that he assures himselfe, if he can but conuince a few places, among many, to be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or misalleaged; it is sufficient to perswade them, that the whole booke is nothing but lies, and vntrueths: Albeit, they must be very simple, That seeing tenne or twelue witnesses produced, eight or ten whereof, prooue the point directly (though two of them faile) will not iudge the truth
<pb facs="3"/> sufficiently approoued: especially, if the witnesses be without exception. And surely he must needes be very well perswaded, either of his owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, or of my insufficiency, that doth thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume of my conuersion, without iustifying his own grounds, or laying open the weakenesse, of those Engines of mine (as he phraseth them) wherewith (he saith) I labour so much <hi>to vndermine, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable grounds of the Catholique Church:</hi> which grounds are so sufficiently battered and beaten downe, by the answere of that learned and Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Minister, Master <hi>VVootton,</hi> to <hi>A. D.</hi> Treatise of faith, That it rests not in the power of any Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Procter, euer to repaire them. But that I may not hold thee too long in so short a subiect, I will truely acquaint thee with such substantiall stuffe, as Master <hi>B. C.</hi> hath gathered, (as he saith) <hi>Either for my spirituall profite, or the commoditie of other, or the common good of both:</hi> which shall be set downe <hi>verbatim</hi> with peculiar answere to euery Section; in hope that when <hi>hee prosecuteth the laying open of the maladies of my Treatise,</hi> (as he tearmeth them) I shall receiue the same equitie from him: that it may appeare what hee answereth, and what hee omits. And for the better vnmasking of that, which he hath excepted against in my Booke; I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour first to deduce my owne reasons, and then his answeres thereunto, into true forme of Sillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme. That it may be euident to the iudicious, that if all, wherewith I am charged, were granted; yet is the summe and substance of my Booke, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, or vnanswered. And may not I pray you, his seduced fellowes, glory to haue gotten so stout
<pb facs="4"/> a Champion, that can with such dexteritie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch three bookes at once. And is not this suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to discredite all <hi>T. V.</hi> Booke? No doubt it will stay the languishing desire of many Papists; that there is now some hope, the grounds of their Religion, shall be particularly defended; and <hi>Tho. Vdals</hi> Booke wholly confuted: though Doctor <hi>Norris</hi> had it sixe monethes, before it was printed, and said nothing: and that it hath beene now two yeeres, since it was published, and onely fiue poore places of no consequence at all, for the substance, pretended to be falsified. But I had well hoped, that Master <hi>B. C.</hi> professing himselfe a student in Diuinitie: And an accepter of Master <hi>Bels</hi> Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, (with so many and seuerall coniurations; wherewith <hi>he vrgeth, presseth, and prouoketh him to disputation;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Sect. 18. of B.C. Preface.</note>) hauing seene in the Preface of my Booke, with what earnestnesse I had requested; and by so many seuerall reasons vrged, to haue had my Booke answered: I had well hoped, I say, That Master <hi>B. C.</hi> would, euen for the merit of winning soules, And for the greater glory of that Catholique trueth, whereof he so much boasteth; haue made a full, and perfite answere to the same: And not haue wronged the learning and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we might haue conceiued him to haue had; with such triuiall exceptions. But no doubt this is sufficient to perswade some of his credulous crew, that the booke is answered. And yet, if I should charge him with the like exceptions, as Master <hi>Bell</hi> doth; and tell him, <hi>It stands not with the credite of the Catholique cause or Romish Diuines, to answere by pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and peeces:</hi> I must looke to receiue the same
<pb facs="4"/> answer, he hath made to him, in this his Preface to vs all, <hi>That he hopes the good Reader will consider, that as he was not bound to meddle with the Pamphlet at all: So was it at his choice to leaue what he listed, and take what hee pleased; especially making open profession of that course:</hi> An answere no doubt worthy of such a refuter, since children, where they cannot read, skip ouer. And therefore good Reader, thou maist see by this little, what thou must expect hereafter: That when hee hath shewed <hi>the flawes, and mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of my Treatise,</hi> (as hee supposeth) and disgor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himselfe, of some carping exceptions, against some mistaken questions (if any such happen to occurre) The substance of the Booke will stand sound and firme, against all the cauelling Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of the Romish Synagogue. And so wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing them all increase of knowledge to Gods glory, I bid them Farewell in Christ.</p>
