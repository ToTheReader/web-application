      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, the Author of this little Pamphlet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing how vehemently (yet without iust cause) the vse of <hi>Tabacco</hi> hath of late beene by common speach detracted, &amp; by diuerse, publikely written against, desireth herein briefly, by his owne example and experience (being a man of good quality, learning, and iudgement) to satisfie and direct his friends and countrimen, in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, and taking of that hearb; And
<pb facs="3"/>
hath, to that end, set downe such a perfect and sound. Rule, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, as may confirme those who do rightly vse the same, in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance there of, and confute others, who vniustly, speake euill against that, of whose true vertue they are vtterly ignorant, themselues either not vsing it, or abusing it, <hi>Extm, &amp; vltra modum,</hi> know not, that, <hi>Insani sapiens nomen feret, aequusiniqui vltra quam satis est virtutem si petat ipsam.</hi> And that the best things may loose their naturall propertie, being disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and misapplied, as continuall experience in most thinges dooth too well witnesse.

without any exception, one that hath practised the same (and that very profitably,) on his owne body, which, by the power thereof, hee hath recouered to perfect health, &amp; strength, as a man of so many yeares may haue, so as to his own comfort, and for others to follow in the same directions, he may iustly set it down <hi>probatum est.</hi> There are (I knowe) many others, who by the like right vse of <hi>Tabacco</hi> haue found the like happy effects, but through want of kinde affection to their countrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or like miserable <hi>Euclioes</hi> (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that any should participate with them in their golden felicitie) do smother the vertue of that which no charitable mind would haue to
