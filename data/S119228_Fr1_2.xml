   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll faire and fortunate Princesse, the
glorie of <hi>England,</hi> the gemme of all
the world: so worthie of the highest
renowne, as no one is worthie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
thy name. By whom next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God wee not onely liue, but labour
with ioy our heartes ease, our soules
peace. Liue vnder whom <hi>England</hi> liueth in the farther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
part of the world▪ and raigne for euer vnder whom
it hath beene a long time most graciously gouerned at
home.</p>
   <p>Vouchsafe noble Princes, who descendest of a princely
race. Vouchsafe gracious Soueraigne, who condescendest
to thy poorest subiects requestes. Vouchsafe worthie of all
praise, this small-worth present, which although it bee
but a harsh discourse of a sometime happie countrey, yet it
is with a heartie wish it were not so greatly weaned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">

thee.</p>
   <p>Too much presumption it may seeme, to presse vpon a
Princesse so sleight a works protection. But the common ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the wind to take aduantage against whatsoeuer is
written, compelleth men to flie to those who can and will
defend, which none will sooner then such a Princesse, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to her heart her meanest subiectes loue, and thinketh
<pb facs="3"/>
their harme doth touch her owne honour, none may better
then such a Princesse, as whose gracious looke can make it
a most pleasing lure, &amp; whose readie fauour can fast-locke
all others iudgements in aliking.</p>
   <p>A pleasing subiect are thy prayses, if by any they could
be worthily desciphered, but they doe so much exceed the
arte both of penne and pensell, that men should wrest their
wittes in vaine, that would do more then wonder at them.</p>
   <p>Thy felicitie then being so great, thy bountie so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as no one who needeth thy patronage may iustly either
distrust, or dispaire thereof, hauing declared what most
humblie I desire, and earnestly wish I may deserue, I cease
&amp; admire thee, with those who neuer cease to admire
thee, and wish vnto thee what thou hast
not, aboue all mens wishes.</p>
