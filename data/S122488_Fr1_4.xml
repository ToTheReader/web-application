      <salute>GENTLEVVOMEN:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have heere presented
vnto your view one of
your owne Sexe; One,
whose improved Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will bee no blemish
but a beautie to her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Peruse her, and I
make little doubt, but
you will so approve of
her Behaviour, as you shall acknowledge her right
worthy the title of a <hi>Sister.</hi> More shall you
finde in her, by freely conversing with her, than
in those <hi>YOVNG</hi> but loose <hi>ENGLISH
GENTLEWOMEN,</hi> whose long mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinarie
Prostitution vpon the <hi>Stall,</hi> hath brought
them out of Request, and made them grow too
<hi>Stale,</hi> by being exposed to publike <hi>Sale.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Countries hath shee coasted, sundry Dangers
<pb facs="7"/>
accoasted, Courts and Cities hath shee frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to returne home better freighted, and re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
the benefit of that fraught to this <hi>Iland,</hi> where
shee was first bred and now arrived. Doe yee itch
after <hi>Fashion?</hi> She is for you; yet not that, which
the vanity of this Age admits; but what Modestie
onely affects. She hath observ'd much in forraine
Courts, which deserv'd rather <hi>Contempt</hi> than
<hi>Imitation;</hi> this shee would not for a world intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
into a well-govern'd <hi>State;</hi> so tender shee
is of her Fame, as no <hi>place</hi> nor <hi>person</hi> shall derive
from her the least staine. Whatsoever shee hath
commended to be seene, is no lesse fully than faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
showne, and with that temporate style drawne,
as in every line some one precept of <hi>Vertue</hi> seemes
to shine. Neither in this her strict or serious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Times, doth shee resemble those <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miae,</hi>
who vse to take their eyes with them when
they goe abroad, but lye them aside when they come
home: No; so little doth shee favour her selfe, as
shee preferres others Censures before her owne; and
in no one particular so much expresseth her owne
true glory, as in the constant practise of Humilitie.
Hence it is, that shee is no curious pryer into others
actions, nor too cens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rious a reproover of others
Directio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s; being indeed, a <hi>TYRESIAS</hi> in the
eying or descrying of others errors, an <hi>ARGUS</hi> in
her owne. What is good and amiable in the eye
of Vertue, she imbraceth with an affectionate tender;
making it her highest honour, to promote the glory
of her Maker. But least by being too serious, shee
<pb facs="7"/>
might become tedious; she will not sticke to walke
abroad with you into more pleasing groves or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
of Delight: where shee will converse with
you of Love, and intermixe her Discourse with
such time-beguiling Tales as varietie shall no lesse
sharpen your attention, then the modesty of her
Method beget admiration. Every Subiect she treats
of, you shall finde so equally tempered with <hi>profit</hi>
and <hi>delight;</hi> as the one shall no lesse benefit your
minde, than the other solace your Eare. Shee
can reprove without <hi>gall,</hi> blush without <hi>guilt,</hi> love
without <hi>guile,</hi> live without <hi>gaine.</hi> Her <hi>gaine</hi> is
to purchase <hi>vertue</hi> more followers; her <hi>guile,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
the <hi>world</hi> of her favourers; her <hi>guilt,</hi> to
defeat all vitious pioners; her <hi>gall,</hi> to disrelish all
Voluptuous practisers. She can discourse of Love
without lightnesse; converse with Love without
loosenesse; and consort with those shee loves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leudnesse. She knowes how to retaine a seeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
state without pride; to expresse her selfe praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
without selfe-praise; and in all her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to make <hi>Vertue</hi> her highest prize. <hi>Humilitie,</hi>
which is the princesse of Vertues, the conqueresse of
Vices, the mirror of Virgins, and Crowne of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
shee so much honours, as shee values it above
all humane glory: whence it is, that shee hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reapt more spirituall profit by <hi>dis-esteeme</hi> then
<hi>selfe-esteeme.</hi> Day by day shee recreates herselfe
in her <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>goodwill;</hi> and in her recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
shee makes this her soule-solacing Meditation:
<hi>Who be they that neighbour neare me, and
<pb facs="8"/>
whose weake estates stand in need of me?</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
with this charitable resolution: <hi>There is
none so poore, but to my power I will relieve,
so long as I live, for the honour of his Image
whom I love.</hi> Shee devides her day into houres,
her houres into holy taskes. Employment takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all occasions of distraction. Should she suffer
a light or indisposed thought to worke upon her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination:
or giue way to any such intruder to di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sturbe
the peace of her <hi>inward house,</hi> she would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
her selfe worse for many yeares; and inflict
vpon her extravagant affections such a censure, as
might deterre them thenceforth to wander. She
distastes none more than these <hi>busie house-wives,</hi>
who are ever running into discourse of others fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
but forget their owne. Neither holdes shee it
sufficient to be onely an <hi>House-keeper;</hi> or Snayle-like
to be still vnder roofe: she partakes therefore of
the <hi>Pismire</hi> in providing, of the <hi>Sarreptan</hi> wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
in disposing: holding ever an absent providence
better then an improvident presence. She is no
common frequenter of publique feasts, but if neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
require it, she will admit of it: wherein
she demeanes her selfe so civilly, as there is no dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>creete
person but ioyes in her society. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
must beget in her a distemper, having ever
a tender eye o're her honour. In the report of others
praises she is attentive, but deafe to her owne. Bee
she in places of publique resort or privately retyr'd,
she ever enioyes her selfe; neither can excesse of
mirth transport her; or any crosse occurrent much
<pb facs="8"/>
perplexe her. There is nought that aliens her mind
more from those with whom shee consorts, than an
immodest discourse, which shee interrupts with a
discreet anger. Wheresoever she sets her rest, shee
makes <hi>Vertue</hi> her guest, whom she entertaines with
so sweet an embrace, as nothing can divide them:
so firme and inviolable is the league that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them. She conceives no small delight in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducating
the young and unexperienced Damsels of
your sexe: wherein she retaines an excellent facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and facility. It shall not be amisse therefore for
you who have Daughters, to recommend them to
her direction; whose government is such, as neither
her too much indulgence shall spoile them; nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
dull them. Whatsoever she in many yeares
hath learned (so desirous is shee to benefit where
her <hi>Observations</hi> may afford profit) she is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to impart; to the end shee may procure <hi>her</hi>
mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> servants, whom she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> religiously hath ever
vow'd to serve. Long hath she beene a Learner,
neyther is she asham'd to be so still. Onely for <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi>
honour, is shee become a Teacher; that the
<hi>Younger</hi> may be instructed by those that are <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi>
the vndisciplin'd by such as are riper. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall you find her slow in performing, what she
hath so perfectly learned. For her very Life is a
continued line of Direction, being solely dedicated
to a vertuous profession. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reprove a rich woman, for comming into the
Lords Temple without her Oblation: But this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
she would be loath iustly to incurre: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="9"/>
she goes better prepar'd, that her portion of
Glory may be sooner shar'd: having an Oblation in
her hand, Devotion in her heart, and a Crowne of
consolation in hope. You then, who love modesty,
entertaine her; for she will sort well with your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and through her acquaintance improve your
honour. For such who sacrifice the Morne to their
Classe, the Afternoone to the Stage, and Evening to
revelling; she holds no correspondence with them.
These she holds for no employments; nor the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of them worthy her knowledge. They must not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
time, that are commended to her trust. She is
not so weary of time, neither doth she so disvalue it,
as with such impertinences to consume it. Those like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
who preferre <hi>Fashion</hi> before <hi>Decency,</hi> formal
<hi>Punto'es</hi> before reall <hi>Formality,</hi> &amp; will suffer thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be deluded by Vanity; they must not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into her family. She hath learned <hi>better
things</hi> than to foole her selfe in a painted disguise, or
to labor of that Vniversall disease, which the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a full and flourishing State usually produceth.
She hath learned with that <hi>better Sister,</hi> to <hi>chuse</hi>
the <hi>better part.</hi> Constant be her purposes, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
her desires, consonant her delights. Be it then
your <hi>honour</hi> to be informed by her, seeing her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
are equally mixt with <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
Now if you obiect, that shee hath beene too
flow in comming, seeing her <hi>GENTLEMAN</hi>
so long since arrived; heare mine answer; and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
your Censure, by imputing this fault to our
English Error. Where <hi>Venus</hi> is longer in trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
<pb facs="9"/>
than <hi>Mars</hi> in training. Many provisions
were required by her, before the World were to be
possessed of her. Much likewise expected from
her, before the World had knowledge of her; this
made her the longer to retire, that shee might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
the more in her returne. May you,
<hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> bee the instance of it; so shall
both the <hi>Author</hi> and his <hi>labour</hi> reioyce in it.
To draw then to a Conclusion, lest my <hi>Portell</hi>
rise too high for my <hi>building;</hi> as you are not
to expect from her any guga-tyres, toyes, or trifles;
love-sented gloves, amorous potions, perfumed pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
or love-sicke pouders; so shee doubts not, but
to finde in you an <hi>Eare,</hi> prompt to attention; a
<hi>Tongue,</hi> cleare of invection; a <hi>Spirit,</hi> free from
detraction? with an <hi>Heart</hi> apt to harbour affection.</p>
   <p>Now for the <hi>Volume,</hi> I had purposely made it
more portable, that it might become your more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable
follower; had not my observation told mee,
that albeit <hi>amiablenesse</hi> consist in a lovely feature,
the <hi>goodlinesse</hi> of a <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> rests in her
comely Stature. Besides, this corresponded better
with the Portraiture of the <hi>ENGLISH
GENTLEMAN,</hi> her affianc'd Lover. For
the <hi>Margin,</hi> I have not charg'd it with many Notes,
lest you should neglect the <hi>Garment,</hi> by being taken
too much with the <hi>border.</hi> Improve it to
your best profite, and let <hi>GOD</hi> have
the glorie of it.</p>
