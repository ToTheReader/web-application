      <salute>Sir,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aint <hi>Hierom</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the heate
<hi>of his Youth writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
an allegoricall
Exposition upon
the Prophet <hi>Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Hieron. in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oem. ad Obad.</note>
did in his riper Age solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bewaile unto his Friend <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machius</hi>
both his rashnesse in that
attempt, aud his infelicity further
heerein, that what hee thought had
beene buried amongst his private
papers, was gotten into the hands of
<pb facs="3"/>
a certaine Young man, and so saw
the Light. The selfe same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
am I forced to make tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
this little Manuell of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
Meditations, which
I humbly put into your hands. It
was written with respect onely to
mine owne private use many yeares
since, when I was a young Student
in the Vniversity, as my first Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall
Essay. And now lately, by
meanes of a private Copy long agoe
communicated unto a Friend, it had
without my knowledge received a
Licence for the Presse, my earnest
care was upon the first notice thereof
wholly to have suppressed the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication:
but the Copy which had
beene licenced, being, by I know not
what miscarriage lost, I have found
<pb facs="3"/>
it necessary, for feare of the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
againe to review a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Copy which I had by mee, and
have rather chosen to let it passe
forth with some briefe and sudden
Castigations of mine owne, than
once more runne the hazard of a
surreptitious Edition. Mine Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
shall bee no other than that of
the good father, <hi>Infanseram, nec
dum scribere noveram. Nunc,
ut nihil aliud profecerim, saltem
Socraticum illud habeo, scio
quod nescio.</hi> And now since I
finde that the Oblation of the first
fruits, though haply they were not
alwayes the best and ripest, did yet
finde favourable acceptance with
God himself, I have bin embolden'd
to present this small Enchiridion,
<pb facs="4"/>
(the very first fruits of my Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall
studies) unto the hands and
patronage of so greatly learned, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent,
and judicious a person, and
that upon this assurance; That as
many times aged men when they
walke abroad leane upon the hand of
a little Childe, so even in this little
and youthfull Treatise, such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Trueths may bee, though
weakly, delivered, as may help <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>n
your journey towards a better Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to refresh and sustaine your aged
thoughts. The Blood of Christ, and
the Food of Life,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 5. 2, 3.</note> are subjects worthy
of all acceptation, though brought
unto us in an earthen vessell. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha</hi>
was not a whit the lesse valued
by that noble <hi>Naaman,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Sam. 17. 17.</note> though it
were an handmaid which directed
<pb facs="4"/>
unto him.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30. 13.</note> Neither was <hi>Davids</hi>
comfort in rescuing of his Wives,
and recovering of the spoiles from
the <hi>Amalakites</hi> any jot the smaller
because a yong man of <hi>Egypt</hi> made
way for the discovery. The Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
of the Gospell is herein most
excellently set forth in that it many
times leadeth the Soule by the hand
of a childe,<note place="margin">Isai 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. 6.</note> and is as truly,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 12.</note> though
not as abundantly powerfull from
young <hi>Timothy</hi> as from <hi>Paul</hi> the
aged. As christ can use weake ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to exhibite, so can hee also use
a weake penne to expresse the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and comforts of his Body and
Blood. In this confidence I have
made bold to prefixe your name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these Meditations, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I might make a publike acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
<pb facs="5"/>
of my many and deepe
engagements for your abundant fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and might with most hearty
prayers commend you and yours to
that Blood of sprinckling, which
speaketh better things for us than
