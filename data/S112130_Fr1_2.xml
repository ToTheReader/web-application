   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S ACCORDING</hi> to the saying of Saint Paul,
<note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> all that is written is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our instruction and learning, that wee might fashion oure selues to the good wyll and pleasure of GOD, in follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of vertue and embracing that is good, forsaking vice and detesting that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. I therefore hereby moued and occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, did peruse of late a booke of small volume which hath to name, the Triall of truthe, set forth a yeare passed and more, in the which booke, as the Auctor zealouslie made a briefe discourse of the sundrie visitations and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God for our forgetfulnesse of him tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe our sinfull wickednesse, so did he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise brotherly warne &amp; admonishe vs to leaue, forsake, and abhorre our accustomed euill, and Christianlike exhorte vs to liue in newnesse of lyfe, putting vs in remembraunce that the Fier which fell frō heauen, so quickely defacing the buge Temple of Paules, the straunge and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous shape as well of Children as of beastes,
<pb facs="3"/>(wherof there were diuers and sundrye,) with also the vnseasonable time then thorow the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye dropping showers, were altogither plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and tokens of Gods vengeaunce and heauy wrath to come vpon vs and more sharply to punnishe vs than euer he did before, where of we might assure our selues, vnlesse with hearty repentaunce and specty amendment of our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked life wee tourned vnto the Lorde our God. And this in maner was the effect of that little worke, wherein it appeareth that the Auctor was more carefull for vs than wee are for oure selues. For notwithstanding that he, with also many others, haue not ceassed thorow their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, daily and painefull trauaile in writing and setting forth of Godly Bookes, wherof neuer since Christes time more plentye than of late yeres hath bene, teaching, instructing, persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, exhorting, admonishing, and in Goddes behalfe threatening vs, &amp; by all meanes possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble seeking to drawe vs from euill to good, from worse to better, from sinne to godly lyfe, that we might learne to do the wil of our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yet are wee for all this so vnmindefull of GOD and of his good gifts in his creatures, and our mindes so set and busied in the vaine and transitory things of this worlde, that wee
<pb facs="3"/>are not at laysure to know God, nor by hearing and reading to learne how to attayne vnto the world that is permanent and euerlasting: but eyther the workes so set forth for our instructiō are so long that we cānot intend to reade them thorow (although in the meane we bee neyther idle nor yet wel occupied) or else if they be short, then soner red ouer than wel cōsidered and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as the crooked conditions and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of vs wretched people of England, doth to euidently declare, whose abhominations are so vile &amp; detestable in the sight of God, as that I cānot but maruell how either wee dare presume to aske or hope to haue any thing at the hands of our Heauēly Father, that might be benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or necessary for vs, but rather loke for present destruction, &amp; to be roted from the face of the Earth, nothing regarding the many and often warnings of God by his ministers, neither yet his louing correctiō, which with fauor hitherto we haue had▪ alas how oft hath he called vs hōe so carefully, so louingly, so fatherly, tendering vs euen as the Father his children, &amp; yet we will not come but still so muche neglect his mercifull goodnes, that nedes he must of his iustice, being a gelous god that hath pmised to visit the sins of the fathers vpō the children, vnto the thirde &amp;
<pb facs="4"/>fourth generation of them that hate him, euen punnish with sorrowe to vs our sinnes, and laye vppon vs the heauie burthens that oure wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes hath worthilye deserued, for where the shaking of the rodde will not helpe or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, there must needes sharpe strokes followe, and wee shall haue them, let vs assure our selues thereof, except spedie amendement of our wicked life and carnest reformation of our mō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous manners, which as I heartilye wishe, and bicause I woulde (as much as in mee is) be a meanes to prouoke and stirre vp my brethren thereto▪ (whose forgetfulnesse of their duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God I heartelye lamente and bewaile) haue therefore thought it my part, though with eloquēce vnacquainted by pleasantnesse of stile to please the Reader, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> this simple sorte plainely to declare my good will, tendering (as nature forceth mee) the welfare of the whole body of this Realme of Englande, whereof although I be but a weake, yet thorowe the grace of God, a well willing member.</p>
