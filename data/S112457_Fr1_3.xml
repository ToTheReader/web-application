      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD Christen reders, where as of late, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnynge of my writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Frithes booke, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysed this order.</p>
   <p>Firste to set forthe by it selfe, what maner of state it is, wherin an Heretike lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his life.</p>
   <p>Secondarily, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of foundation it is, that Frithe bildeth his wycked purpose vpon.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, how falselie he dothe vnderstande, not onlie the holy scripture, but also the olde holie Fathers, and auncient Doctours of the Catholike churche.</p>
   <p>Fourthly how crafty, false, and foolishe, his reasons, and argumentes are to be founde, yf they be well and truely tried.</p>
   <p>Fiftly, what is to be sayd against his opinion, that one body cannot be in two places at once.</p>
   <p>Sixtlie, that the possibilite therof, maie be proued by very good reason.</p>
   <p>Ye shall vnderstand, that of this diuision, the first and seconde parte, I haue perfourmed and put foorthe all ready, although but rudely and not in all poynctes euen as I wolde, if my hast to the rest, had not ben the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But yet sufficiently, and euen more then enoughe, to showe the due prouse of so much as I thereby did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende. And now therefore, here dothe folowe the thirde
<pb facs="3"/>
parte, for which, I dispatched my handes with the more quicker speede of the other two paste. And that not with out cause. For in thys consisteth the very chiefe pithe of my principall purpose in all the reste. Which is to make his false vnderstandinge of the olde holye Doctours and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> trew meanynges playnly to appere. And therefore I wishe, all those in especiall, whiche hath moost nede therof, to loke well, and wisely vpon it. And therin to haue no respecte vnto me, nor yet to any payne or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour bestowed of my parte in that behalfe. But to haue good respecte only to the trewth, which is and may cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be founde therin. Whereof I dare say, they shall not misse, if they be of suche good wyll, as without whyche, they cannot be saued. For if good will, be to vs in all thinges so necessari, that we can nothing do rightly with out it, how muche more necessary is it to be had, aboute the trial of trewth, in so weighty and worthy a matter, as is the very reall presence of the blessed body of our Sauiour Christ in the holy Sacrament? For to euen by the trewth, of a most weighty, &amp; worthy thing, there is alwaies required a moste pure, and parfit good will. Whiche is neuer mixed with pride, nor vayne glory, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer infected with disdayne, nor enuy, neuer yoked with stout stubbernes, nor obstinacie, but euer indewed with meekenesse and humilite, wyth dew feare of God and charite, with patience and pitie of mannes weaknes and infirmite, for onely to men of that sorte were, these moste gratious and mercifull promyses made. <q>
         <hi>Petite et dabitur vobis, quaerite &amp; inuenietis, pulsate &amp; aperietur vobis.</hi>
      </q> That is to say. <q>Aske, and to you it shall be geuen, seeke, and ye shal finde,
<pb facs="3"/>
knocke and it shalbe opened vnto you.</q>
   </p>
   <p>And therfore what is more precious, and more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to be had, then the trewth of this holy Sacramēt? wherfore, let him take hede whiche hathe it not. For when shall he haue it, yf he wyll not so muche as aske it? when shall he fynde it, if he wyll not vouchesafe to seeke it? or when shall he enter into it, if he wyll not knocke to be let in? The doore is not to be opened, but onely to them that wyll knocke. The thynge is not to be founde, but onely of them that wyll seeke. Neyther is it to be graunted, but onely to theym that will aske. And who doeth aske for it? who doeth seeke after it? or who doeth knocke, to enter into it? In verie deede, none rightlie, none wysely, nor anie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, but onely those, that be of good wyll. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onelie to them (as I sayde) those promyses were made. And therefore it is not enoughe, to reade, to talke, or to reason, and question of the matter. But it is muche more to be wayed and considered, wyth what maner of wyll, and intente, all that is done. For trueth is a Lady, alwaies of that straingenes, that she wyl not vouchesaufe to showe her amiable face, but onelie to them that be of good will. For yf any other by chaunce fortune sometyme to see her, (specially there, where they haue no lust or desyre to meete with her) indeede vnto them, for all her bewtifull countenaunce, she ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth but a lowrynge looke, wyth smale occasion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie credence. And no maruell whye, for those be they, of whome the Scripture doth say.<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note>
   </p>
   <p>They see and see not, They here and here not.</p>
   <p>And that is not all for lacke of knowledge, but in very
<pb facs="4"/>
deede for lacke of good will. For as the common say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge is.</p>
   <q>Who is so blinde as he, that will not see.</q>
   <p>Therfore good will (Gentle reders) good wyll is it, whiche dothe bothe aske and obteyne, seeke and fynde, knocke and is harde, and so let in. For without that, most trew it is, that nothing can speede in thys kynde of thynges. Wherfore this matter, is to be weyed, and pondered therafter. For who dothe not knowe, that readers there be of dyuerse and sundry sortes.</p>
   <p>Wherof some wyll sone conceiue myslykinge, if they fynde but the matter any thinge longe in readinge, and say, it is to tedious. How be it in very deede those be they, of whome men may say.</p>
   <p>They are sone wery of well doninge.</p>
   <p>Some other therbe whiche in reading, falleth strayte into mislikyng, if they fynde any thinge passe their vnder standinge, saying it is very darke and to obscure. And all because, they loue not in such good labour, any while to tarry or longe indure. But of that, they do fyrste, they will make the last, and so giue it ouer.</p>
   <p>Some, yf they finde not the matter, sette out wyth paynted speeche accordinge to theyr pleasure, streyght, they wyll say it is verie grose, and but rudely dunne, without witte or learninge, and so make that an excuse of theyr mislikinge.</p>
   <p>Some will mislike the matter, because of the wryter. And some the writer, because of the matter.</p>
   <p>And some not eche for other, but euen indifferently bothe together. But what estemers, or louers of trewth shall we recken all these, which wyll thynke it to derelie
<pb facs="4"/>
bought, with bearing the light burden of a litle tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? or to paynfully gotten, with the labouring awaye of a litle obscuritee, and darkenes? or to be the lesse worthy good acception, for lacke of some fyne and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious expression? or to be regarded after the writer.</p>
   <p>And not, as it ought to be, euen after the matter? what estemers (I saye) or louers of trewth shall we recken these? how vnworthy of trewth be they, whiche wyll other refuse it, or set the lesse by it, for these causes or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other lyke? specially in so great a matter, as thys holy Sacrament is? Wherfore thys muche haue I sayde, for a louinge warnynge, and a frindly monition, only to them, whiche hath neede therof. Trustinge, that when this, that foloweth shall come to their redynge, they wyll not forget this necessary warninge, but well and wisely will beare it in mynde, and vse them selues accordingly. For otherwise, reade they may, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit they can not. And therfore now good Christen rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, because no man is, or can be herein, sufficient of hym selfe, but as the holy Apostle dothe say.</p>
   <p>¶Our sufficiencie is of God, I wyshe vnto you,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3</note> as euen to my selfe, the perpetuall succour and helpe of that holie Spirit, whiche is the worker and mercifull giuer of euerie good will. To whome wyth the Father, and the Sonne, be honour and glorye now and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Amen. ☞ ♣</p>
