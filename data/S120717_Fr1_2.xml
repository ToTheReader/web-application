   <head>¶ To Christian parentes, and Housholders, grace, and mercie in Christ.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He blessings of God powred vpon this Realme, in so great abundance, as the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell, peace, prosperitie and wealth, vnder the rule and gouernement of our merciful Queene, causeth me in thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuing to ioy. But the contempt and abuse of these blessinges, mingleth my ioy with greefe and causeth Gods children for sorow to mourne and lament. And this gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Gods Spirite in his children, shall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of children, and maisters of housholdes (though manie other do greeuously offend) especially answeare for before GOD. The great blessinges sent of God, the lawes made by the Prince, the woorde preached by the Ministers, take small effect, and bring foorth little fruite: because parentes and maisters shew such examples of loose libertie in them selues, and throwe the raines of licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse into the neckes of others. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not the honourable calling whiche they haue of the Lorde, that he hath placed
<pb facs="3"/>
them as it were in his owne roome, and geuen them his own names, that they might gouerne, teache, and direct others, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and serue him, vppon whom their preeminence doeth wholy depende. But (alas) they do not their duetie in gouerning, they applie not themselues in teaching them that are committed to their charge: and therefore youth not gouerned, nor taught, nor praying at home, can not pray, nor learne in the congregation. But as the deuises of men are ready to find excuses, so seke they vp figge leaues in this, to couer their shame. First they wil say, We geue thē meate &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for their worke, what should we do more? So do you bestowe vpon your beasts, in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; feeding them: but your seruantes are more pretious in the eye of the Lord, &amp; you are charged in the fourth commaundement, to see that they serue GOD. Some say, they sende them to the Church on the Sabbaoth, and so answeare that charge: But the Lorde cōmaundeth you your selues also to rehearse his lawes to your children and housholdes. <hi>Deu. 6.7.</hi> If they plead ignorance, it wil be but a weake answeare to the Lord. Some say, they are ashamed to teache and pray with their housholdes. I say, because it is good, they are
<pb facs="3"/>
ashamed, else euerie thing they are ready to performe with brasen browes in open pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Some say, it is hypocrisie to performe their dutie: let such pray for new hearts: for if their owne consciences condemne them of hypocrisie, God is greater than their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences. Some say, it will let and hinder their seruantes from worke, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> obiected to <hi>Moses. Exod. 5.4.</hi> But our Sauiour answea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth such, in his answeare to <hi>Martha, Luke. 10.41.</hi> (This I speake, not to nourse anie in idlenesse, for such should not eate, <hi>2. Thess. 3.10.</hi>) Some say, they shalbe scorned by worldlinges: If you seeke to please men, you are not the seruantes of Christ, <hi>Galat. 1.10.</hi> Yet this was Christes portion, and they are but faint souldiours that flee for a woorde, for we must buckle with the diuell hande to hande, who will not leaue vs, till death, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by Apostasie we yeelde to him both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and soules. Some say, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring the vnlearned in letters to this knowledge: but they do not remember, that God geueth knowledge of his mysteries, euē to the simple that feare him, <hi>Psalme. 25.14.</hi> And in foure monethes space, I haue seene these principles and answeares learned by Gentlemen, Yeomen, Horsekeepers, Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes,
<pb facs="4"/>
Carters, Milkemaides, Kitchen-boyes, &amp; al in that houshold (where these or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were obserued) excepting three or foure whose capacitie was but meane &amp; simple, &amp; yet the simplest went not without some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. Some say, youth are so stubborne, that they will abide no such orders: I say, better is the roome of suche then their companie, for if admonitiōs appointed by the Lord, winne them not, auoyde them: and so shalt thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde the infecting of the rest of thy house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde by them, so shalt thou make others to feare, so shalt thou by making them ashamed of their sinnes, driue them to repentaunce, &amp; principally thou shalt auoyde Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against thee and thy houshold. If thou knowest that thou keepest an ignorant &amp; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Papist, a blasphemous swearer, a disobediēt subiect, to God, Prince, &amp; Ruler, a licentious and loose liuer, which giueth his bodie to fighting, whooring, and stealing, &amp; his tongue to quarelling, filthie talking, and lying, &amp; thou seeke not to refourme him by the order of God, doest thou not make thy house his stewes, &amp; thy selfe his bawde? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue such, lest God remoue thee. Is it writtē in vaine, that the plague shall neuer goe from the house where the swerer is? &amp; that it shalbe
<pb facs="4"/>
full of plagues? Will not the Lord perfourme that which he hath spokē by his prophet <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie.</hi> 5.5. That there shal remain a plague in such houses, to consume them with the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber &amp; stones therof? I would they would cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what God saide to <hi>Elie</hi> in the like case, Thou honorest thy children aboue me, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wil cut thee and them off. The comfort he had of his youthes in the ende, was this, the Arke (the witnesse of the Lordes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ence) was lost, thirtie thousand of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple slayne, his two sonnes killed, this liued he to heare, and so in sorrow fell backward, and brake his necke: then his daughter in lawe fell in trauell, and in trauell died: the remnant of his house were glad to crouche and begge for a small peece of siluer, and a morsell of bread, If our Englishmen could beholde these plagues, the remouing of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to a people that shall bring foorth fruit of it, the taking away of our Queene, the wayling of their wiues, the murdering of their children, and the cutting of their owne throtes by straungers: they woulde looke better about them. O Fathers of children and housholdes, if you woulde before hand arreigne your selues before Gods iudgment seate, and there finde your selues endited
<pb facs="5"/>
readie to be condemned, for sending your posteritie to begge at straungers doores, for spoyling your children of their liues, this realme of religion, Queene, and peace, and that you shoulde see there your children, wiues, countrie, Churche of GOD, and Queene, accusing you for murtherers, and traytoures, what will you answeare? what can you say? Turne your musicke to mourning, your feasting to fasting, your riotting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting: and say with Dauid, and with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel. <hi>2. Sam. 12.13. Dan. 9.5.</hi> We haue sinned, and committed iniquitie, done wickedly, &amp; haue rebelled against thee, O Lorde: righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse belongeth vnto thee, and vnto vs open shame and confusion of faces. Say with the men, <hi>Actes. 2.37.</hi> and with Paule, <hi>Act. 9.6.</hi> say, Lorde what shall we doe? And you shall be taughte to ioyne amendement to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, you (I say) which were woont to aske how you shoulde passe the long Winter eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings without gaming, shall learne to turne your playing at Cardes, and Dice, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, to singing of Psalmes, teaching your housholde, and praying with them. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough (as Paule sayeth. <hi>1. Ephe. 4.3.</hi>) that you haue spent the times past after the fashion of the world: and how yll, madde, or straunge,
<pb facs="5"/>

      </gap>hey account of the matter, that you runne not with them to the former excesse of riot, say you and performe with. <hi>Iosua.</hi> 24.15. We and our housholds will serue the Lord. And you O Ladies, Mistresses, and Dames, say e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of you with <hi>Hester,</hi> I &amp; my maides will do the like. <hi>Hest.</hi> 4.16. And howsoeuer the world cōdemne you, the Lord will reuele himselfe vnto you, powre his blessinges of knowledge, of peace, of religion, of good rulers, and will continue the same vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the remnant of our children and posteritie, which shall come after vs, which he graunt for his Christes sake. Amen.</p>
