   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Vrteous Reader, who tenderest the
poore Countrey schooles, for which
this labour hath beene vndertaken, or
didst euer feele or know the wants in
many of them, accept my vvilling
minde for their good. And take this first impression
as not set forth: but chiefely to the end, to haue store
of copies, to goe to many learned wel-willers to the
Worke, for their help: like as it hath heretofore, to
sundry much reuerenced for their learning and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Of all whome, I humbly intreat their kinde
assistance, for amending that which is amisse; by
adding what is vvanting, cutting off whatsoeuer is
superfluous, changing what is vnbefitting, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
euery thing into the right order: That it may
speedily come forth more plaine and perfect; and
thereby, if not themselues, yet their friends may
reape some benefit of their labours. For the liberty
and boldnesse vsed in it, consider that it is but a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
to incite and encourage others; as, I tooke it,
farre more profitable and delightsom to reade, then a
<pb facs="12"/>
bare narration. All who are friendly and vnfained
fauourers of good learning, will I hope thinke so
of it. It shall wrong no man willingly: farre be that
from mee. I will right them againe, so soon as I know
it. Be the faults neuer so many, thorough my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and want of meete leasure (as they must needs
bee the moe, by my absence from the Presse) yet
time, I trust will reforme them. In the meane while,
let my trauell and the good things weigh against the
rest. For the length of it, remember for whome I
write, euen the meanest teachers and learners: with
whom though I sometime vse repetitions, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee ouer-plaine; sith they commonly get so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of short Treatises, be they neuer so learned. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
also that I would hide nothing, which GOD
hath vouchsafed mee in my search: that out of all,
the most profitable may be selected, and in the meane
time the best onely vsed. And for the matter of the
Dialogue, take it as that which is desired to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in time; and which I hope all shall finde, when
once the helpes belonging hereunto, shall bee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
and perfected.</p>
   <p>Account this, but as a meere entrance into the
worke: which if seuen yeares shall bring to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fully to accomplish that which is wished, I shall
thinke my paines most happily bestowed, if GOD
so farre forth prolong my daies. I seeke not my self:
if I may do some little seruice to God and my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
I haue enough. I oppose my selfe to none.
Shew my ouersight in loue, and I will amend it. I
prescribe to none: no, not the meanest; but onely
desire to learne of all the learned, to help the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned.
<pb facs="12"/>
In the worke I take nothing to my selfe, but
the wants. What I receiued of others, I receiued to
this ende; after full triall made of them to publish
them for the common good. This I haue professed
from the beginning of my trauell. I would also giue
euery one his due particularly, what I haue had of
him; and will, if it shall bee thought meete. I haue
promised nothing but my labour: that I haue and
doe desire to performe to my abilitie and aboue.
The vveaker I am, the fitter shall I bee to apply my
selfe to the simplest: and the more honour God shall
haue, if hee shall giue that blessing vnto it, which I
doe humbly begge. If any man shall oppose, and
detract from these my labours; forasmuch, as hee
shall therein (as I take it) shew himselfe an enemie to
the common good of the present Age, and of all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie
(the benefite whereof, as God is my witnesse,
I haue intended principally in these my endeauours)
I can but be sory, and pray for him.</p>
