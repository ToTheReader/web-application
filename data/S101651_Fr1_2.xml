                 <title>A true discription and breefe discourse, of a most lamentable voiage, made latelie to Tripolie in Barbarie, in a ship named the Iesus : vvherin is not onely shevved the great miserie, that then happened the aucthor hereof and his whole companie, aswell the marchants as th marriners in that voiage, according to the curssed custome of those barbarous and cruell tyrants, in their terrible vsage of Christian captiues: but also, the great vnfaithfulnesse of those heathnish infidels, in not regarding their promise. Together, with the most wonderfull iudgement of God, vpo the king of Tripolie and his sonne, and a great number of his people, being all the tormentors of those English captiues.

This poore man although he dwelt quietlie with his new found hoast, and might also vse and take such as he got in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, yet louing libertie, on a time g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="3"/> den, and being seene of the espials which his maister had laide for him, was by them taken and brought to him, who caused him to be sent to Rome, to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented among other condemned men, at such time as the Emperour should make anie solemne feast or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. It fortuned afterward, this same Lion to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and sent also to Rome, to be there kept among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sauadge and wilde beasts. Not long after this, the same condemned bondman, was amongst others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed also to the slaughter, &amp; brought into the field called Campus Circulus, to trie his fortune with some wild beast, and to conclude, it was his good hap to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with that Lion which hee before had cured: Assoone as this hungrie ramping Lion had espied that man, as one desirous of his praie, he ran towards him to haue deuoured him, but when hee perceiued well that he was the verie man that had lodged with him in his den, and done him good, he straightwaie stood ouer the man, defending him from the crueltie of anie other beast. When the man who exspected nothing but death, had well considered the humanitie of the beast, and throughlie regarded him, he was then assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it was his quondam hoste in the deserts, and therevpon made the bolder to touch him, and so stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and cherished him. The Emperour and the whole state of Rome stood still, abashed at this strange &amp; rare sight, and after a little staie made, caused to be inquired of the man, whether he were a Nigromancer, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had inchanted the Lion, seeing that he was hunger-prickt, and yet had no power to hurt him: to this he answered, that his safetie came by the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the beast, and not of anie power of his owne, and reported at large the cause of that clemencie, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="3"/> is expressed. To be short, the man had his life, and licence to beg vp and downe the streets of Rome, leading the Lion in his hand, vpon whose breast was written as followeth. Hic Leo est hospes, huius hominis. and in the forepart of his coate was set downe, Hic homo est medicus huius Leonis. To auoid this horrible sinne, I haue (Right worshipfull) presumed to dedicate vnto your worship, the true reports of my troubles, &amp; of certeine others in Turkie, which although they be not set out with braue termes, yet is in them set downe nothing but plaine troth, easie to be told, but hard to be tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: beseeching your worship, as frēdlie to accept of the same, as I willinglie present it, which if it were answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to my desires, should then signifie what heart I carrie to your worship, vnto whom I confesse my selfe most wholie bounden, and least my rude speeches should sauor of flatterie. I here leaue your worship to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, who send you health and heauen.</p>
