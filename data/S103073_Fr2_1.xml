      <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ertuous Gentlewomen, It was the respect which I owed unto your father, and to your fathers house, that first moved me to translate <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rards Prayers,</hi> and being translated to dedicate them unto you: But the Stationer (whom I would not name, because he is dead; and yet I must name, for fear lest by my silence I may seem to wrong others) <hi>Richard Jackson</hi> of Fleetstreet, to whose trust I committed the book to be printed, usurped the dedication, and obtruded it upon a Religious Countesse, whose name for honour I conceal: Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="177"/>
I committed it unto the presse at Cambridge, being first purged from innumerable errates. Since <hi>Jacksons</hi> death, the copie it seems came to one <hi>Williams</hi> his hands Stationer in Popes-head-alley: With him I had conference as one desirous to restore unto you what of right belonged unto you: But in stead of satisfaction, I received nothing but ill language. To conclude, I bade him, if he thought good, go on to do you wrong: but I promised withall that you should finde one to do you right as long as I lived. In part I hope I have made good my promise: If you accept of this my service as a scholars New-yeares-gift (for so the time of the Edition makes it) I have my desire, and shall alwayes remain</p>
