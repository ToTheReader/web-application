   <head>To the venerable Artists and youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Students in Diuinity, in the famous Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity
of CAMBRIDGE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OV nobly-witted, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously-studied
<hi>Academians:</hi>
whose excellency in all kinds of
learning, all forraigne <hi>Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
doe admire, and none atteine
vnto. I here present you a <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi>
to <hi>Cholcos,</hi> though not the
<hi>Golden-fleece</hi> with it: the <hi>Searche,</hi>
I meane, but not the <hi>finding;</hi> of that so much talkt
of, so often sought for, <hi>North-West Passage,</hi> and
neerer way into the <hi>South-Sea.</hi> That, wherein so
much <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Treasure</hi> haue beene expended, so
many braue Spirits employed, and yet none discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Perchance, there is no such <hi>Passage</hi> to be found:
and that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by the gullery of their false
<hi>Sea-Cards,</hi> and the fable of an old <hi>Greeke Pilote;</hi>
haue but diuerted our <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Sea-men,
from their golden <hi>Indyes.</hi> This plot of theirs hath
taken, for these many yeeres: and it appeares to bee
but a plot, for that themselues neuer make vse of
this <hi>Passage.</hi> For mine owne part, I suppose that
the <hi>Philosophers stone</hi> is in the <hi>North-West Passage.</hi> My
argument for it is, For that theres so much <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi>
in the way to it.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="72"/>
So much, and such variety: such variety, and that
so various, (I thinke) from what is receiued in the
<hi>Schooles:</hi> that it were well worth the disquisition of
an <hi>Vniuersity,</hi> (and I wish you the first honour of it)
either to find out, how these <hi>Obseruations</hi> may bee
reduced to <hi>Aristotles Philosophy:</hi> or whether they need
any other enquiry, and ought to be examined by
some other <hi>Rules,</hi> then <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath yet light vpon.
This is my purpose of inscribing it vnto you. Of
this one thing am I confident: that you are all so
<hi>rationall,</hi> and <hi>ingenuous,</hi> as to preferre <hi>Truth,</hi> before
<hi>Authority: Amicus Plato, amicus Aristoteles,</hi> but <hi>magis
amica veritas.</hi> Your <hi>Sciences,</hi> then, being <hi>Liberall;</hi>
your <hi>Studies,</hi> I know, haue so farre passed into your
<hi>maners,</hi> that your minds are so too, and that such
as haue already profited beyond the credulity requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in a yong learner, and are themselues promoted
to be <hi>Masters</hi> of the <hi>Arts;</hi> though they still reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
their <hi>old Greeke Tutor,</hi> yet they will not suffer
that of <hi>Pythagoras Schoole,</hi> so to domineere in <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi>
as to let an <hi>Ipse dixit,</hi> goe away with it: much
lesse allow it the authority of a <hi>Mayors hammer,</hi> with
one <hi>knocke</hi> to silence all arguments.</p>
   <p>Vpon this confidence, I, with all due respects,
here preferre two <hi>Propositions</hi> vnto your discussing.
The first this, <hi>Whether those Rules of Aristotles Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
be to be allowed so Vniuersall, that they hold all
the world ouer.</hi> The second this, <hi>Whether they ought
to be so magisteriall, as to prescribe against all other exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</hi>
The first of these, I shall but <hi>problemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
propound vnto you: but in the second, I hope
a man of my cloathing, may bee allowed the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of being something more earnest.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="72"/>
But that I may not come with preiudice to the
making of these motions, or bee thought, vpon
some <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>ambition,</hi> to speake against the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Aristotle;</hi> I shall desire all my <hi>fellow Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demians</hi>
to allow me so much discretion, as to know,
That he that shall in your hearings, oppose your <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle;</hi>
does like the Ship here spoken of, runne
against a Rocke, endanger his owne bulge, and the
stauing of his vessell. No, I so farre honour the old
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> that I well allow him to bee <hi>Master</hi> and
<hi>Moderator of the Schooles:</hi> and that there is the same
respect due to him in the <hi>Schooles,</hi> which, by <hi>Reason</hi>
and <hi>long Custome,</hi> is due to one of the <hi>Kings Ships</hi> in
the <hi>Narrow Seas; That in acknowledgement of a Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
euery other name ought to strike sayle to him.
Aristotle</hi> (it must be confest) hath made all learning
beholding to him: no man hath learned to confute
him, but by him; and vnlesse hee hath plowed with
his heyfer. He had the most incomparable wit, and
was the most Logicall and demonstratiue deliuerer
of himselfe, of all the Sonnes of nature: One, who
best of all deserued to be cald <hi>Her Principall Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi>
one, who not onely <hi>adornes</hi> a <hi>Library,</hi> but
<hi>makes</hi> it: <hi>Qui habet Aristotelem, habet Bibliothecam,</hi>
is truer of him, then of the <hi>Great Comparer.</hi> This
is my opinion of him; and I wish him more stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed.</p>
   <p>Tis not,<note place="margin">1.</note> therefore, the name, or the authority of
the great <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that my Propositions meddle
withall: but whether his obseruations gathered out
of this part of the world alone, could, like a
<hi>royall Passe</hi> or a <hi>Commission,</hi> carry a man all the world
ouer?</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="73"/>
It must be confest, That in respect of the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall</hi>
and the <hi>Latitude</hi> that <hi>Aristotle</hi> liued in, hee
was but a <hi>Northern man:</hi> and twas his owne Rule,
that <hi>Nihil agit extra Sphaeram actiuitatis suae.</hi> So then,
it would bee put to voyces to consider, whether he
that knew but these Northerne parts, and the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean</hi>
Sea; could possibly make such collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by what was here to be learned, as should bee
vnfaileable in the <hi>Southern Haemisphere</hi> and the two
<hi>Indyes?</hi> Plainely, those that are conuersant in the
<hi>nauigations</hi> and <hi>bookes of voyages</hi> into those parts;
haue found so many contrarieties to obserue; that
it were rather <hi>tedious,</hi> then difficult, to fill vp a <hi>Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booke</hi>
with them.</p>
   <p>The Ancients, wee know (as if they had measured
the world by the Yeard-wand) restrained the <hi>limits</hi>
of <hi>temperature,</hi> and <hi>habitation,</hi> by the fiue <hi>Zones:</hi>
without consideration of any interloping or concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
causes, which experience hath now found out,
to haue quite altered their obseruation. I adde, that
a good leisure and diligence might obserue, how in
the contrary part of the world, there be found cleane
contrary <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Effects,</hi> vnto those in this part
of the world. The <hi>South-wind</hi> there, brings <hi>cold</hi> and
<hi>Winter:</hi> and the <hi>North,</hi> is the rainy wind. How will
the <hi>Thunder</hi> and the <hi>Wind,</hi> be made agree with <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi>
definition of a <hi>Meteore?</hi> In some places of the
Mountaines <hi>Andes</hi> by <hi>Peru,</hi> it thunders euer. The
<hi>East-Indyes</hi> haue their <hi>Monsons</hi> and their steady
winds, constant for sixe moneths together: and who
shall assigne their causes? Then the <hi>doctrine</hi> of
the <hi>Tydes,</hi> nothing so vncertaine: which <hi>ebbe</hi> and
<hi>flow</hi> in some places, <hi>different;</hi> and in others <hi>contrary,</hi>
      <pb facs="73"/>
to the <hi>Moone</hi> and her <hi>motions.</hi> This (as I remember)
is Aristotles definition of a <hi>Meteore,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Aristoteles, 1. Meteor 1.</note> That it is, <hi>An
imperfect mixt body, generated out of an infirme and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant
concretion of the Elements; which therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be durable.</hi> Now the <hi>Monson,</hi> is both constant
in his continuance this yeere, and in his returne next
yeere; most constantly keeping his seasons halfe yeere
one way, and halfe yeere another way, for all ages:
nothing more constantly or durably; and therefore
nothing like <hi>Aristotles Meteore.</hi> And so for the <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
vpon the <hi>Andes:</hi> it is first perpetuall; secondly,
not caused by a <hi>dry exhalation,</hi> (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> wills) but
hanging ouer such hils as are couered with snow and
a perpetuall winter. Witnesse the <hi>Thunder</hi> on the
<hi>Alpes</hi> also: yea and that in the middle of the Sea,
500. leagues from shoare, or any thing that is dry.
yea, it frequently both <hi>Snowes</hi> and <hi>Thunders</hi> vpon the
<hi>Andes,</hi> at one instant: and in <hi>dry</hi> places that are hard
by, scarce euer <hi>Thundering.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But not to passe the <hi>Line</hi> for it; You see in this
little Booke, how <hi>Charlton Iland,</hi> which is no more
Northerly then your <hi>Cambridge;</hi> is yet so vnsuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
cold, that it is not habitable: and that there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
so many different, (at least so seeming) occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of nature, as were well worth the disquisition
of a <hi>Philosopher.</hi> I could, (in my smal reading) instance
in many many other particulars: which I had rather
should be found out by some industrious searchers
after <hi>Nature,</hi> in the <hi>Moderne Relations</hi> of our <hi>Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers,</hi>
then in this my short <hi>Proposition.</hi> Tis not to
be doubted, but that the carefull reading of our
<hi>Books of Voyages,</hi> would more elucidate the <hi>History
of Nature,</hi> and more conduce to the improuement of
<pb facs="74"/>
      <hi>Philosophy,</hi> then any thing that hath beene lately
thought upon. These <hi>Navigations</hi> haue in part ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
that of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Dan. 12. 4.</note>
      <hi>Many shall passe to and
fro, and knowledge shall be encreased.</hi> This, I suppose,
might be obserued from this study, That the great
and infinite <hi>Creator</hi> hath so disposed and varied euery
thing, that it is impossible for mans reason and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
to conclude him: and therefore, though vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
and receiued <hi>Philosophie,</hi> may giue a man a <hi>generall</hi>
hint, all the world ouer; yet no <hi>Vniuersall</hi> and vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
certainty.</p>
   <p>This brings mee to my <hi>Second Proposition,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2.</note> That
seeing God will not haue his works, (no more then
his Kingdome) to come by obseruation;<note place="margin">Luke 17. 20.</note>
      <hi>Whether,
then, ought any humane dictates to be so Magisteriall, as to
prescribe against all other examination?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>No humane study more conduces to the setting
forth of Gods glory, then the contemplation of his
great workes, in <hi>Philosophie:</hi> for though a smattering
knowledge in <hi>Second Causes,</hi> warps the mind towards
<hi>Atheisme;</hi> yet a higher speculation of them, brings
about againe to Religion. No man, I beleeue,
will thinke it fit for vs to haue a <hi>Pope in Philosophie;</hi>
one, that no body shall presume to censure of: but all
be bound to aduance his <hi>Decretalls,</hi> aboue the <hi>Holy
Scriptures.</hi> This is the scandall that my selfe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
good men take, at the vndue authority in some
heates pinn'd vpon the <hi>Stagerite.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I am sorry that the <hi>Israelites</hi> dotage vpon <hi>Salomons
Philosophie,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Suidas, &amp; Rabbini.</note> should haue caused the zealous <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
to call in and to suppresse those vnualuable <hi>Physicks:</hi>
for feare, I suppose, lest their credit should haue as
much derogated frō the authority of the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi>
      <pb facs="74"/>
as the <hi>brazen Serpent</hi> (which he destroyed about
the same time) had done from <hi>Religion.</hi> None will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that <hi>Salomons Philosophie</hi> was contrary to the
<hi>Scriptures;</hi> seeing the <hi>Scripture</hi> commends <hi>Salomon</hi>
for them. Twas not <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> feare, therefore, (or
not onely) lest there might haue beene a competition
betweene them, but a neglect of one of them: he was
iealous lest the <hi>Scripture</hi> might haue any writing set
vp <hi>by</hi> it, though not against it.</p>
   <p>Can <hi>Diuines,</hi> then, be blamed for speaking, when
they heare <hi>Aristotles Philosophy</hi> to be solely magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and the study of the <hi>Scripture Philosophy,</hi> disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected?
Or that when tis confest, That such a thing
is true in <hi>Diuinity,</hi> and yet the <hi>Moderating</hi> of the point
<hi>determine</hi> for <hi>Philosophie?</hi> Nay, to heare it cald <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd</hi>
and <hi>ridiculous,</hi> to haue Scripture vrg'd at all, in
point of <hi>Philosophy?</hi> No doubt there is, <hi>But whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
is false in Diuinity, is also false in Nature,</hi> how
much show of truth soeuer it passes with, in <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.
Philosophy</hi> hath taken its turne in the <hi>Schooles:</hi> and
the <hi>holy Texts</hi> by the <hi>Schoolemen,</hi> haue euen been sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vnto <hi>Aristotles:</hi> yea, to the great corruption
of <hi>Theologie,</hi> as the complaint is, hath this man been
so farre aduanced, That <hi>Contra est Philosophus, &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
est Apostolus;</hi> haue familiarly passed vp and down,
for equall <hi>Oppositions:</hi> so that it hath been a <hi>measuring
cast</hi> oftentimes, betwixt the <hi>Prophet</hi> and the <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick:</hi>
and by foule play hath the measure beene made
to stand the harder at the <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> for that the
<hi>Prophet</hi> hath beene enforced to comply with him by
a <hi>wrested interpretation.</hi> Thus had S. <hi>Paul</hi> need giue his
caveat vnto <hi>Theologie,</hi> as well as vnto <hi>Theologues, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
lest any man spoyle you through Philosophy.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="75"/>
All this were to no purpose, vnlesse the <hi>Text of
God</hi> were excellent in this kinde; and embellished,
here and there, with most admirable <hi>Philosophy.</hi>
What incomparably rare foot-steps of it, haue we in
the Bookes of <hi>Genesis, Iob,</hi> and the <hi>Psalmes?</hi> How
noble a Study then were it, and how worthy the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of some excellently learned; to bestow some
time vpon it? <hi>Valesius</hi> the <hi>Physician,</hi> hath in his <hi>Sacra
Philosophia</hi> done something in this kinde: who yet
might haue done better, here and there, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Scriptures. I am not so sottish to beleeue,
That euery particular is to be drawn out of <hi>Scripture:</hi>
tis none of my doteage, that. Or that <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
did intend, euery where, the accuratenesse of
<hi>Philosophy;</hi> or stand to be so curious in <hi>definitions</hi> and
<hi>decisions.</hi> Nor so foolish would I be thought, as to
haue all <hi>Philosophy</hi> taken in pieces, and new moulded
by the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Nor, that nothing should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
on, till a <hi>Text</hi> confirmed it. But this, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
might profitably be thought vpon: That
where the <hi>Scriptures</hi> haue any thing in this kinde, it
should more reuerently be esteemed; Collections
out of scattered places, (as is done out of <hi>Aristotle</hi>)
made: these compared, and their <hi>Resultances</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
This, surely, would amount to more, then is
yet thought of: and, a-<hi>Gods</hi> name, let Schollers be so
bold with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as to examine him vpon good
assurance, by what is <hi>Truths Touch-stone:</hi> Receiued
<hi>Philosophy</hi> is a most necessary hand-maid to the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi>
but let her not be set aboue her Lady, nor no
competition be maintained betwixt them.</p>
   <p>Something else remaines to be thought of: That
seeing the same <hi>God,</hi> who gaue <hi>Aristotle</hi> these good
<pb facs="75"/>
parts; hath, in like manner, raised vp many excellent
Spirits moe: whether it were not iniurious vnto
what is done, and a discouragement to what might be
done; to haue the inuentions or obseruations of those
excellent wits and great industries, so abasht with
<hi>Aristotles</hi> authoritie; that they can haue no credit in
the world, for that his <hi>Dictates</hi> haue pre-occupated
all good opinion? Let it not then be thought vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall,
to examine the <hi>first cogitations</hi> of the <hi>old Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,</hi>
by the <hi>second thoughts</hi> of our more moderne
<hi>Artists:</hi> for that the same improuement may by this
meanes accrew vnto our <hi>Physicks,</hi> that hath aduanced
our <hi>Geography,</hi> our <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and our <hi>Mechanicks.</hi>
And let it not be thought so insolent, to refuse <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi>
authoritie singly, where his reason is not so
concluding; seeing other men haue taken the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to doe that before vs, in seuerall kinds. Some
haue perfected, and others controld his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> by
the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> as <hi>Scultetus, Wallaeus</hi> and some others.
<hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> sir-named the <hi>Philosopher,</hi> hath purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
written <hi>Contra dogmata Aristotelis: Basson</hi> and <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sendus,</hi>
(two braue men) haue newly written point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blanck
against him: nor haue they taken away all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
from those that are to follow them.</p>
   <p>And thus, with renewing my former protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for mine owne respects to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> I conclude my
two <hi>Propositions:</hi> which I desire may receiue a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
construction from all ingenuous, imcaprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Schollers.</hi> I meant them, out of good will to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
learning; to encourage and countenance future
vndertakings: and in such a case, a little too much
saying, may be thought not to haue exceeded an <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Rhetorication:</hi> for I would not be thought too
<pb facs="76"/>
earnest in it. The hint for all this, I tooke from this
booke: which in mine owne and some better Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
is (to say no more) as well done, and enriched
with as sure and vsefull obseruations, as any in this
kinde. I was desired by the able Author, and some
other friends; to ouer-looke the written Copy of it,
and to amend the <hi>English</hi> here and there; in which I
did not despaire of doing something: for that, in my
yonger time, I had a little acquainted my selfe with
the <hi>language of the Sea.</hi> That which put me in the
head to inscribe it vnto your Names (most excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
learned <hi>Academians</hi>) was, for that the place of
this <hi>Wintering,</hi> was within a <hi>minute</hi> or two, of the
<hi>heighth</hi> of our <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Which my prayer to <hi>God</hi>
is, that your Studies may make famous.</p>
