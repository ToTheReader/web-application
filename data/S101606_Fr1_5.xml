      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ARKEN</hi> daughter to the commaundmēt of God thy Master: and inclyne the eare of thy hart, and willingly rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aue the admonition, of thy pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Father, and put it in execution; to the end thou mayst retourne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto him by the labour of thy obedience; from whom thou deddist depart by the negligence of thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. To thee therefore, which
<pb n="2" facs="6"/>
dest renounce thyn owne will with intention to fight vnder Christ the true king, and to take vppon thee the strong armour of obedience thes wordes are addressed; first of all desire thou by most instant prayer, that that good worke which thou purposest to begin, in the may bee perfected, that hee who hath vouch safed to accūt vs in the numbre of his Children might not bee contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stated by our misdemeanour; and soe wee must alwayes obey him with those good parts that are in vs, that not onely hee may not at any tyme like an angry Father desinheritt vs his childrē, nor like a dreadfull lord prouoked by our offences, adiudge
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
vs as naughty seruants to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all punishment, which would not follow him to his Glory; Now the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore at lenght lett vs rise, the holy Scripture exciting vs saying. Now is the hower to rise out of sleep and with open eyes and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue eares let vs behould the deuine splendor, and heare that which the voyce of God dayly crying doth admonish saying. If this day you shall heare his voyce harden not your hartes. and againe: hee which hath eares to heare lett him heare what the spirritt sayth to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; ād what sayth it. Come he ther Children giue eare to mee, I will teach you the Feare of our lord God
<pb n="4" facs="7"/>
Runn while you haue the light of life▪ lest the darcknesse of death ouerreach you. And God seeking his labour our amongst the Comon sort of people, sayth furthermore: what man is hee that wisheth life and hath a desire to see gooddayes? and if thou hearing this dost make answeare saying, I am hee. God sayth vnto thee againe, it you wilt enioy a true euerlasting life refray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne thy tonge from euill and thy lipps from vttering lyes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, shunn ewill and doe that which is good, seeke peace and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue it; and at what tyme you shall doe this, myne eyes shall watch ouer you, and myne eares shalbee
<pb n="5" facs="7"/>
attentiue vnto your prayers &amp; before you shall call vppon mee I will say vnto you, be hold I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, what thing deare Sisters can bee more pleasant to you, then this voyce of God which thus doth in vite you behould how our lord of his Bounty, hath Vouchsafed to shew you the way of life; hauing therefore our loynes girt with fayth and the obseruance of Good VVorkes, and our Feete shodd by guydance of the Ghospell, lett vs goe forware in this way, that wee may deserue to see him in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome whoe hath bestowed vppon vs this holy Vocation; In the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of whose kingdome if wee
<pb n="6" facs="8"/>
desire to dwell, lett vs laboure earnesly to doe good workes, for none commeth thither, but by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their good deseruing; lett vs demaunde of God, saying vnto him with the holy Prophet, lord whoe shall dwell in thy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle or whoe shall rest in thy holy hill? after wee haue asked this questiō, lett vs giue eare vnto God answearing, and shewnig vs the way, leading vnto this Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle saying, hee that walketh without blemish of Sinne, and doth that which is most iust and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who speaketh truth in his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hart, and forgeth noe Guyle in his toung: who doth noe wrong to
<pb n="7" facs="8"/>
his Neighbour, and receaueth noe reproath against his Neighbour, who hath cast out of his harte that wicked Tempter the deuill with all his perswasions, and hath brought both him and his sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions to naught, ād hath taken his Cogitations whyle they were new and little, and hath dashed them against the Rooke, which is Christ who fearing god take not pride in their well doing, but beleiuing that the good they haue proceedeth not of any power of theirs, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from our lord, and therefore they prayse and gloryfy him, thus working in them saying with the Prophett. Not vnto vs lord not
<pb n="8" facs="9"/>
vnto vs, but giue Glory vnto thy holy name, as S. Paul the Apostle attributed not vnto him selfe, that followed of his preaching, for hee sayth, by the grace of God I am that I am, and moreouer hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, hee that will glory, lett him glory in our lord. And therefore our lord sayth in the Ghospell, euery one that heareth these my words and doth them, shalbee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kned to a wise man, that buylt his house vppon a Rocke, the Floods came the winds blew, and they beate against the house and it fell not, for it was founded vppon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> Rocke, our lord proceeding with vs in the same manner dayly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
<pb n="9" facs="9"/>
that wee should bee corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent to his holy admonitions; and therefore the dayes of this present life are afforded vnto vs in a manner of a truce, that there▪ in wee might amend our wickednesse as the Apostle sayth, knowest thou not that the benignitie of God brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth thee to Penance, for our morcifull lord sayth, I will not the death of a Sinner but that hee should be cōuerted ād liue, therefor my good sisters when wee haue Demaunded of God, that person which is to dwell in his holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, wee vnderstand the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept annexed to that habitation, soe that if wee full fill the duty of
<pb n="10" facs="10"/>
Inhabitants wee shalbee Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the heuenly kingdone, Come therefore ād lett vs prepare our harts and bodyes to serue in the holy obedience of his Comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undements, and that which nature is not able to worke in vs, lett vs beeseech Almighty God that hee will assist vs with his holy grace, ād if wee desire to Fly Hell Paynes, and to attayne vnto euerlasting life, whyle now wee may, and that wee are in this mortall life, that wee may atchiue all these things by the light of grace, now must wee run, now must wee labour for that which may bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for vs for euer hereafter
<pb n="11" facs="10"/>
wee must therefore sett vpp a Schoole to teath the Seruice of God therein, wherein wee hope nothing shalbee tought by vs to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>igerous or to heauy, but if wee proceede some what the more stricktly according to the Rule of Reason, for the correcting of Vice and Conseruation of Charitie, thou must not therefore vppon Feare fortwith abandon the way of thy Saluation, which cannot bee begun but by a narrow En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, not with standing after some tyme rymployed in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation at pleasure thou shalt run in the way of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, hauing they hart</p>

dilated by true Fayth and with vnspeakeable sweetenesse of Charitie, in such sort as wee neuer forsaking the Schoole of God, but persisting in his Doctrine, perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring there in euen vntill death in the Monastery, wee may bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de pertakers of Christs paynes and Passion. soe that hereafter wee may deserue to bee his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partners in his glorious kingdome.</p>
