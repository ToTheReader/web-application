flock of sheep without a particular shepheard; and if
thou hadst leave to name his successour, thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
seeke from one end of the land to another in thy
choice, and yet not find in all points a man matchable
to him; he was a bright and a shining lamp, if any of
thy inhabitants doe sit in darknesse, their ignorance
is altogether inexcusable: hee lifted up his voice in
this place many yeares together like a trumpet; if any
of thy inhabitants are not awakened out of the sleepe
of sinne, they may now goe on more securely in this
dead sleep;<note place="margin">The losse of a good Minister.</note> but wo to them, it will be easier for <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> at the day of judgement than for
them. I pitie your case (good friends) and bewaile
your losse: but why do J name your losse? It is my
losse, and a common losse, we are all of us sharers,
though not all alike in this judgement. LORD, that
thou shouldest suffer such a wretched sinner and an
unprofitable servant of thine as I am yet to live, and
deprive the visible Church of so worthy an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thy glorie as M. <hi>Bolton!</hi> Holy Father, we may
think, had it stood it with thy holy pleasure, that it had
been good for thy Church, if his life had been spared
with the losse of many of ours: he was a deep chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,
in whose justly deserved commendations the
streames of eloquence which in former ages flowed
from those great and godly Orators, the two <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
both of <hi>Nazianzum</hi> and <hi>Nyssa,</hi> from great <hi>Basil</hi>
and golden-mouth'd <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> from S. <hi>Ambrose</hi>
and S. <hi>Austin,</hi> might have emptied themselves, and
yet not over-flowed the banks: and what do I then
come hither with my distracted thoughts and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
heart, which if ever I had any gift in encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
<pb n="3" facs="2"/>
and laudative Orations have many years since
willingly neglected it, and so lost it. As <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi>
spoke of his <hi>Basil,</hi> I have for my part as great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to speake of our sometimes deare and now blessed
M. <hi>Bolton:</hi> J admired him while he lived, and honoured
him in my heart; &amp; to speak of his excellencies wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the LORD had plentifully inriched him, is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
too heavy for my shoulders, and a very hard task
for those who doe nothing els but study Oratory: all
that I can speak in the praises of this godly man, falls
short by many degrees of his worth, whose memory
is precious, and shall be kept greene and flourishing as
the rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> laid up in the Tabernacle.</p>
