      before his child-birth, by the which losse, who knoweth not the miseries that such occasions inuite miserable people vnto: The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> herein is a perfit forme for such as true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent, in the 37. <hi>Psalme,</hi> the 25. <hi>verse,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>J haue beene young and now am old: and yet saw I neuer the righteous forsaken, nor his seed beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their bread:</hi> The other reason, is, because whosoeuer he be, that doth truery read it, first, the efficacie and pith of the words; secondly, he paines of the poore Author, in digesting and framing the same; thirdly, the profit and benefit of them whose zeale thirst after eternal felicitie. And thus desiring your friendly acceptance, of my poore endeuors, I humbly, and in all bounden dutie rest;</p>
