<pb facs="3"/> liuing, and I know the fragrant smell of a bruised rose, will not be vnwelcome, though dead. I could not then wish her to liue still in misery; I now desire shee may liue in memory; according to the promise of God, made vnto his Saints; <hi>Psal. 112.6. Prou. 10.7.

   <p>Worthy Sir, if you may hereby reape any comfort, I shall haue the more content; if God may haue any glory, the Church any benefite, religious Woemen en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement hence, the Author, I know, obtaines his expected reward: who otherwise was vnwilling to feele againe the lashes of this censuring Age. Thus, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to finde a kinde acceptance of a good meaning; I commit all to the blessing of God, leauing you and yours to the rich mercies of God our Father in Christ, and rest now as euer,</p>
