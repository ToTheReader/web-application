      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Father of all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
having takē this
worthy <hi>Author</hi> to
himselfe, pitty it were
to entombe his labours in the
grave of silence together with
him; the rather considering how
usefull a member he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
beene to the Church of
God, and what prosperous suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
his endeavours have found
in the hearts of Christians. The
thing hee chiefly aimed at, was
<hi>fruitfulnesse</hi> in the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God had set him; which oft
he enjoyed experiment of (to the
cheering of his spirit) in no smal
<pb facs="3"/>
measure. It cut the very heart
strings of his righteous soule, to
see many dry &amp; withered bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
(fit for nothing but the
fire) cumbering the precious
ground of the Almighties gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
and possessing the roome of
more growing plants. Hee was
wonderfull active in the cause
of Christ, and desired as well to
<hi>doe good</hi> as to <hi>be so,</hi> where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hee came. It was not the
least of his care, not to live unto
himselfe: He knew he served
a good Master, which made him
studious of improving every ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for the best advantage; wel
may hee bee called good, that
makes others far the better for
his goodnesse: And indeed set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this aside, what hath the
creature to commend him to
God, or releeve his soule in any
distresse?</p>
   <p>Thou hast here in briefe the
soule of man unbowelled before
thine eye, and that masse of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb facs="3"/>
lodging in a carnall
heart (together with its <hi>power</hi>
and <hi>plague</hi>) discovered unto
thee, wherein is plainely demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
the miserable condition
of a man guided by the <hi>flesh,</hi>
and the happinesse attending
such as are led by Gods <hi>Spirit;</hi>
as also the bitter conflict of these
two opposite inmates in a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
soule, with the meanes of
victorie.</p>
   <p>Our life is nothing but a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
warfare, every moment wee
are more or lesse to encounter
with adversaries; Satan al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
labours the destruction of
the Saints, though his wayes to
effect it are not one &amp; the same;
sometimes he inticeth men to sin
by allurements, sometimes by
vexing and disquieting their
inward peace, at least he aimeth
to make the life of a Christian
uncomfortable by his manifold
assaults; hee is vigilant to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
upon all occasions as he can
<pb facs="4"/>
espy opportunity, and will not
cease to assaile, though he be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome;
when hee cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
by flatteries, he seekes by
force and violence to overthrow
the poore servants of Christ.</p>
   <p>Amongst his many snares
to entrappe our poo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e soules, this
is not the meanest, that he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to divide the kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it selfe, and to use men
as <hi>his</hi> instruments for their
<hi>owne</hi> destruction; Satan well
knowes that comming in his
owne likenesse, he would seeme
very odious and soone be resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
therefore he maskes under
a vaile of <hi>humility</hi> that he may
the more securely withdraw us
from our hold in God.</p>
   <p>But we have a valiant lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
let us sticke unto him, even
Iesus Christ the righteous, who
is a <hi>Lion</hi> of the tribe of Iuda, <hi>a
mighty Prince</hi> able to tread all
our enemies under foot; well
may Satan barke and roare but
<pb facs="4"/>
he can stir no further then God
gives him liberty; he cannot
tempt whom he will, nor when
he will, nor how he will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
permissiō frō above; he may
desire to sift us <hi>as wheat,</hi> but
the Lord wil make choise of the
temptation, and set bounds to
our enemies malice, thus far you
shall goe and no further.</p>
   <p>If a child have his father by
the hand, though he be in the
darke, or sees any danger ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
yet he feares no hurt;
neither shal we be dismaid with
any temptation, whilest by the
eye of faith we see that <hi>invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
one</hi> ready to support us; the
chiefest strength of soldiers ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in their captaine, who yet
must fight for themselves and
him, but our whole strength ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in Christ, who by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
power subdueth all
things for us; of our selves wee
have no ability to prevail against
the strong one in the world, all
<pb facs="5"/>
our victories come from God;
we are too weake to withstand
the least temptation through
our owne strength, but relying
upon the Lord we shall be more
than conquerors over the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.</p>
   <p>It had been much to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
that this holy man had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
the publishing the residue
of his worthy labours, that so
they might have come more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
&amp; polished into the worlds
view, however, pitty it is that
goodly childrē should be brought
to the birth, and there perish for
want of helpe to bring them
forth. These things in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
found much acceptance
and wrought effectually in the
hearts of many, who knowes
whether a further blessing doth
not yet attend them?</p>
   <p>Deare Christian next unto
the glory of God, thy good was
chiefly aimed at in bringing this
worke to light; be not therefore
<pb facs="5"/>
wanting to thy selfe, and thy
soules blisse. Remember the
<hi>day</hi> cannot alwayes last, the
<hi>night</hi> will come, and thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not how soone: This may be
the last booke that ever thou
shalt reade, and this the last
houre that ever thou shalt spend
here on earth; Oh use it consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably,
and blesse God for any
furtherance in thy way to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
While thou hast the light
beleeve in the light, and walke
in the light, that then maist bee
the child of light. Occasions
are headlong, being once past,
they cannot be recovered. The
five foolish <hi>virgins</hi> came too
late, and were shut out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Thy time is short, the art
of well doing long: on this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
depends eternity, of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse
if it be well, of misery if
it be ill imployed. Hee that is
not ready for God to day, will
be lesse sit to morrow. It is no
time to begin to live, when thou
<pb facs="6"/>
art ready to dye; then to seeke
after heaven, when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
to thy Crutches; At length
grow spiritually wise, let the
best things have the best place
in thee. It will be too late when
thou art in hell to say, oh that I
had been more religious and
provided better for my soule;
be exceedingly abased for thy
former neglects; let it wound
thy soule that thou settest out no
sooner, and art yet no further in
the race of godlines; get ground
of thy corruptions <hi>now</hi> daily;
count that a lost day, in which
thou art not somewhat bettered,
and labour for such infallible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
of Gods love, that no
reprobate under heavē <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

attain unto▪ get such truth of
grace in thy inner man as may
distinguish thee from all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
professors (meere empty
caskes of Religion) and such as
is not common to hypocrites,
and castawayes together with
<pb facs="6"/>
thy selfe. To which end seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
peruse this following trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
wherein thou shalt finde
sufficiency of real worth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it selfe. Looke up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for a blessing upon it, and
desire the Lord to goe along
with thee in it, and prosper the
same for thy soules good, which
he heartily desireth who rests,</p>
