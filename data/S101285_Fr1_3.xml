                 <title>Peters fall : Two sermons vpon the historie of Peters denying Christ. Wherin we may see the causes of mans falling from God, and the manner how, both of the wicked thorough incredulitie, and of the godly by infirmitie: and also the way that God hath set downe in his worde to rise againe.

      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing taken in hand to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (according to my poore talent, wherwith God hath enabled me) I was very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly requested by some of my friendes (such as feare God vnfainedlye) to put the same in printe for the benefite (as they said) of others But considering with my selfe, the greate number of learned and godly treatises already extant, &amp; how vnnecessary it should be for my greene &amp; vntimely blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to appeere in this age of the ripe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest, and also howe readye mans nature is to cauill at the doings of others: and like the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to suck poyson out of the finest Flowers, I was fully determined it should neuer shew it selfe in the worlde: yet beeing mooued wyth their earnest suite, and at length being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with their forceable perswasions, I haue
<pb facs="6"/>
penned the same as neere as I can remember. Now (good Reader) if thou be desirous to knowe what benefite thou shalt reape by the same, I am very loth to indent with thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand for if I should promise nothing, I were to be blamed to trouble thee, which else mightest be better imployed. If I shoulde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that which peraduenture thou maiest finde: I might seeme to arrogate too muche vnto my selfe, &amp; therfore I commit it to thy godly consideration and iudgement. But for the place of scripture it selfe, thus muche I dare say (and that I trust with the consent of all the godlye learned) that if thou desire to vnderstand how the wicked doe begin to fall from the Lord: what causes doe concurre, and in what order they proceede vnto the height of iniquitie: If thou desire to know what it is that mooueth the godly to fall &amp; offend god And lastly if thou be willing to vnderstand what things bee necessary and expedient for thy selfe, being fallen to returne vnto god, &amp; to stand in his fauour when thou art in it, I am sure thou maiest learne it out of this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. Now if I haue not so fully discoursed of euery point, as thou couldest wish, nor so lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nedly proceeded, as the matter doth require:
<pb facs="6"/>
I praye thee beare with me, and praye to the Lord to encrease his beginnings in me, &amp; sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply my want? concerning the last parte of al, which is repentance, I haue of purpose beene sparing in it, because others haue learnedlye and at large intreated thereof: whoseful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty if thou desire, haue recourse vnto those their writings. To conclude, if any thyng doe here please thee, giue God his due for it (to whome all honour belongeth) If ought be lacking, helpe me I beseeche the with thy praiers to God our father, that it woulde please him to direct al our indeauoures to the aduancement of his glory, the benefite of his Church, and comfort of our consciences that we may walke warily and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly amongst this frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard &amp; crooked generatiō. </p>
   <closer>Amen.</closer>
