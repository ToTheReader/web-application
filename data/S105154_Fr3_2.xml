      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable my singuler good Lord, there came to my hands of late a booke conteyning all the tunes of the Psalmes, as they are ordinarilie soung in the Church, composed into foure parts by M. William Damon late one of hir Maiesties seruaunts, which booke being found not onely in my poore opinion, but in the riper iudgement of some speciall Musicions to be excellentlie sette, either to serue for voices or instruments: for the great vse that might come thereof, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to preserue the labours of the Auctor, so worthie and skillfull a man in his profession: also to leaue his Religion and pietie herein witnessed, that so careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and speciallie laboured to aduaunce the vse of singing the Psalmes: I was earnestlie dealt with all not to deteyne that as a part of my priuate store in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, that of it selfe conteyned matter so worthie publiquelie to enterteyne and to receiue enterteynment. Therefore with their perswasions and reasons, I was brought to publish them for the vse and comfort of all, especially of the godlie. And now right honorable my verie good Lord, calling to minde the dutie, honor, and seruice due by mee vnto your good Lordship, for the great loue and fauour which I haue alwaies receiued at your L. hands. (For I acknowledge my selfe to none more bound then to your honor:) I haue beene the more emboldened to present this simple worke to passe vnder your L. fauour and protection. Wishing that the same may chieflie serue to the glorie &amp; praise of God. And then at your L. pleasure, at some times for the recreation of your minde, after your worthie and great trauayle from day to day taken in the most weightie affaires of this common wealth. And so I commend your good L. to the mercifull keping of thalmightie God.</p>
