   <head>❧ <hi>A Letter written to a</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble personage of the Cittie of Mentz, <hi>by a Gentleman of credit, who sawe</hi> this murderer executed.</head>
   <p>RIght honourable and my especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all good freend, I haue not at this time any newes wherewith to acquiant you, but only this straunge and admirable occasion which lately happened: the truth whereof I trust my credit is sufficient with your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to confirme, and the rather, for that I not only heard the murderers examination, but was also an eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his death. And albeit it may seeme incredible, yet thus much I can assure you, that I saw the scrole which was found in the murtherers Caue, wherin he had written the names of al one that he had murdred, and I heard him also affirme it with his owne mouth. The discourse thereof follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, which I commit to your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so I commend your honor to the heauenly protection.</p>
