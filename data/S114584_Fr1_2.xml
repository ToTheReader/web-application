      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Oble Sir, I shall need (I hope) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther long-winded Periods, nor circklings and trauersings to discouer, how much I am in duty for euer engaged to you: since it's apparant enough that my whole maintenance hitherto hath beene from you alone, nor thereby to draw you to thinke that I meane as I speake: which I am already fullie perswaded you doe. Let it suffice then, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, there was no other motiue or inducement of publishing this Sermon, but onely a desire the world should take notice, that if I could doe any thing, it should bee to you principally directed. God knowes I am farre from thinking any thing in this worth a good thought, it being a thing fashioned and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in the extremity of my sickenesse (and so will seeme I know to all of sound iudgement) and in the minority and infancy of my studies in Diuinity: yet it is by iust title yours, whose I was then, and am <pb facs="3"/>still, and for Whose seruice it was then deliuered. And I trust you are able to quitte me from any peece of pride or ostentation in this matter: So that all my ambition in this publication is (next Gods glory) to please you, who perchance in not assenting to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, do many times affoord mee the commendation, whereof I confesse my selfe altogether vnworthy, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it deserue any prayse, that I am, and euer will be a faithfull honourer of you, and your Noble Lady, beseeching the highest not to take his blessings from you, nor from your children after you.</p>
