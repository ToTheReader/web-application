Whereof the one acknowledgeth, and numbers vp aboue three hundred differences of opinion, maintained in the popish church. The other confesses neere threescore differences amongst their owne doctors in one onely point of their religion. Gathered faithfully out of their writings in their own words, and diuided into foure bookes, and those into seuerall decads. Whereto is prefixed a serious disswasiue from poperie. By I.H</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OV challeng'd mee for my bold asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your manifolde diuisions, I doe here make it good with v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury. Those mouthes that say they teach you the truth, say al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so (and you haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued them) that they all teach the same. As you finde them true


<pb n="2" facs="6"/>
in this, so trust them in the other: For me, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without indignation see, that in this light of the Gospell, God and his truth should thus bee loosers by you: and that a miserable soule should suffer it selfe thus grossly couzened of it selfe, and glory: Many can write to you with more profoundnes, none with more sincere feruency, and desire to saue you.</p>
   <p>I call heauen and earth to record against you this day, that if you relent, or answere not, your perishing is wilfull. We may pitty your weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but God shall plague your Apostacy; if you had beene bred in blindnes, your ignorance had beene but lamentable, now your choice and loue of darkenes is feareful and desperate. Alas you can not be condemned without our sorrow &amp; shame: What should we do? We can but intreat, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, protest, mourn, &amp; gage our souls for yours; if these auaile not, who can remedy that which will perish? Heare this yet (you weake Reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) if there be any care left in you of that soule which you haue thus prostituted to errour; if you haue any regard to that God whose simple truth you haue contemned and forsaken; what is this that hath driuen you from vs, allured you to them? For Godssake, let me but expostulate a litle ere my

silence: Either be conuicted or inexcusable: Our badde liues haue set you off; Woe is me that they are no holier; I bewaile our wickednes, I defend it not; Onely aske how they liue in Italie; if they be not (for the more part) filthes to the worst of ours, goe with them and prosper. Let all indif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferent tongues say, whether that very See where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your faith depends, euen within the smoake of his Holines, be not (for vitiousnes) the sinke of the world; we may condemne our selues, their liues shall iustifie vs: But you lift not to looke so farre; you see their liues at home, you see ours: The Comparison is not equall; they take this for the time of their persecution; we of our prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The stubbornest Israelite, and the most god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Marriner could call vpon God in his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: we are all worse with libertie: Looke backe and see how they liued in former times while they prospered, No Turks (saith <hi>Erasmus</hi>) more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominably: thogh now at the worst, how many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Professors might you finde, which would scorn that the most strict Hermite, or austere Cappu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, should go before them in a gratious life, and in true mortification? euen amongst twelue, there will be one diuell: I wish they were so good that we might emulate them: but for my part, <hi>I</hi> neuer

yet could know that Papist, which made consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all Gods ten morall lawes: Shortly, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is vpbraided to vs; the truth is pure, thogh men be vnholy; and God is where he was, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer becomes of men: For you, if you had not fallen to coole affections, and a loose life, you had beene still ours: It is iust with God to punish your secure negligence with errour and delusion; and to suffer you thus to loose the truth, who had lost your care of obedience and first loue. And now you doe well to shift off this blame to others sins, which haue most cause to accuse your owne.</p>
   <p>From manners to looke towards our Doctrine: the noueltie of our Religion (you say) hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged you: theirs hath drawne you with the reuerence of her age. It is a free challenge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs, let the elder haue vs both: if there be any point of our Religion yonger then the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes and Prophets, Christ and his Apostles, the Fathers and Doctors of the Primitiue Church, let it be accursed, and condemned for an vpstart: shew vs euidence of more credite and age, and carrie it. The Church of Rome hath beene aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, not the errors; neither doe we in ought dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from it, wherein it is not departed from it selfe. If I did not more feare your wearines then

my owne, forgetting the measure of a Praeface, I would passe through euerie point of difference betwixt vs, and let you see in all particulars, which is the old way; and make you know, that your Popish Religion doth but put on a borrowed visor of grauitie vpon this Stage, to out-face true antiquitie. Yet least you should complaine of words, let me without your tediousnes haue leaue but to instance in the first of all Controuersies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs; offering the same proofe in al, which you shall see performed in one. I compare the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ancient Church with yours, see there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and be ashamed of your noueltie.</p>
   <p>First our question is, Whether all those bookes which in our Bibles are stiled <hi>Apocryphall,</hi>

      </note> The holy Synode decreeth that the old vulgar latine Edition in all Lectures, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, Sermons, Expositions be held for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall, saith the counsell of <hi>Trent</hi>: And her Champion <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath these words; That the fountaine of the Originals in many places run muddy and impure, we haue formerly shewed, and indeed it can scarce be doubted, but that as the latine Church hath beene more constant in keeping the faith then the Greeke, so it hath been more vigilant in defending her bookes from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Yea some of the Popish Doctors maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the Iewes in hatred of the Christian faith did on purpose corrupt many places of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: so holds <hi>Gregory de Valentia, Iacobus Christopolitanus</hi> in his Praeface to the Psalmes, <hi>Canus</hi> in the second booke of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places. But in stead of all, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> shal shut vp all with these wordes; The Heretickes of this time in hatred of the vulgar Edition, giue too much to the Hebrew Edition, as <hi>Caluin, Chemnitius, Georgius Maior</hi>: All which would haue euery thing examined and amended by the Hebrew text, which they commonly call a most pure fountain: See now whether that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesses to haue beene the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

   <p>Yet one step more: Our question is, whether the Scripture be easie or most obscure, and whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther in all essentiall points it doe not interpret it selfe, so as what is hard in one place is openly layd forth in another: Heare the iudgement of the old Church and ours: All things are cleare and plaine and nothing contrary in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; saith <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> Those things which seeme doubtfully and obscurely spoken in some places of Scripture are expounded by them, which in other places are open and plaine,
saith <hi>Basil:</hi> What could <hi>Caluin</hi> or <hi>Luther</hi> say more?</p>
   <p>There is no so great hardnesse in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to come to those things which are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to saluation, saith <hi>Austen</hi>: In those things which are openly layd downe in Scripture, are found all those things which containe our faith and rules for our life, saith the same Father; who yet againe also saith thus: The spirit of God hath Royally and wholsomely tempered the


<pb n="13" facs="11"/>
holy Scriptures so, as both by the plaine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he might preuent our hunger, and by the obscure hee might auoyd our nice slouthful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse; for there is (scarce) any thing that can be fetch't out of those obscurities, which is not found most plainely spoken else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
   <p>And because <hi>Bellarmine</hi> takes exception at this (<hi>Feré Scarce</hi>) compare this place with the former; and with that which he hath in his third, Epistle thus:<note place="margin">Aug.

The second is, that though the Scripture be cleare of it selfe, yet to the proud and vnbeleeuers it is hard, by reason of their blindnes and euill affections: so the Lutherans (saith <hi>Eckius</hi>) contend that the Scriptures are cleare and plaine: so <hi>Duraeus</hi> against <hi>VVhita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers:</hi> so the Rhemists in their annotations; and generally all Papists.
