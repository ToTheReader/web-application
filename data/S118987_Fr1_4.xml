      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>H Master <hi>Smith,</hi> I would for your owne sake you had not written with such affirmation, Many things which you haue also made so publike, the which you can neuer call home againe: although you your selfe doe finde them false, whereby also you haue made your selfe more vnable and vnwilling to reuoke them, though they be proued so. Much better therfore had it bene for you to haue left that Paper vnstained by your hand, that should paint forth an vntruth, and neuer haue set Pen to write, but to the vnchangeable truth of God, of which you neuer neede repent, and whereof the Church of Christ is the piller, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering also how great a danger euery one doth fall into, that is found to adde or diminish from or to the intent and purpose of the word of God.</p>
   <p>I would therefore you had beene better aduised before you had published your bookes. You thought your selfe as fully satisfied when you were of another minde. You know, or at the lest, there be that know them that haue three, foure, nay, fiue times changed their Religion, that thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues as fully satisfied euery time as you thnike your selfe now: what they are now (some of them) I wil not say. And if euery man should publish bookes so often as they change their mind, how many Religions then should spring from one man, and he perhaps be author of so many sects, what heapes of bookes are there at this day of seuerall opinions? Make therfore no more matter for the fire, there is straw and stubble enough already. Speake truth, for the day of burning is at hand. And whatsoeuer you do, looke to the maine, leaue not the foundation as some haue done: Hold fast the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings least you neuer come to the endes. And I pray God deliuer you from the Curse of <hi>Sinai</hi> and her sonnes, <hi>Hagars</hi> children. And bring you all vnto the blessings of mount Sion and into the rest and freedome of her children, euen <hi>Saraes</hi> sonnes and daughters.</p>
