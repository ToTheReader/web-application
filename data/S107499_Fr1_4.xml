And for thys cause chefely are hysto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes worthy to be called the bokes of great pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and lordes.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>Seinge now, that it is necessary that euery man had nede of two maner of powers, namely, the poli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tike or external, and beside this by the faith and dre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de toward God, the examples of ether of them are propoundid and set before vs in the histories. And that we maye first speake of ciuil powres, Princes, and all suche as are set to gouerne greate thynges, must fyrste and chefelye considre and beholde those<note place="margin">What muste be marked in the exāmples of princes.</note> examples and histories, by the which they maye be admonished howe they also maye faithfully behaue themselues in gouerning a cōmune weale. In this must they set befor them the examples of good prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces and kinges, and must learne of them by what meanes &amp; wyth what vocacions chefely they haue vsed in gouernynge or rulinge empyres, that they haue had respect to nothinge saue only to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune profyt, that they haue only considered and ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ercised iustice and equite, that they haue punished greueously sinne, that they haue not warred for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery cause, but that they haue oft kept peace by the polytyque forberynge of iniuryes.

      </gap>y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: and soo there happened deadly alterations in
<pb facs="4"/>
the commune weale. Of thys wyse is it euident that Pharao peryshed by reason of tyranny, and for lyke cause were the Romane kynges dryuen out. Oftymes also haue Princes vndone themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues ech other by reason of pryde, enuy or hatred, the whych somtyme grew of a thynge of no value. Lyke as Pompeius had no cause to oppresse Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Cesar, saue only enuy. The lawes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyans amonge the Romanes do beare wytnesse, that newe alteracyon or chaunge, doeth oft geue occasyon of cruell warres. Nother hath the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kysh empyre hys ofsprynge by any other occasyon, saue by heresy and dissentyon of learnynge and doctryne of the fayth. Daungerous conspyracy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cause oft tymes that kyngdomes are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, the whyche wytnesseth the example of the Athenians, whyche loste theyr gouernaunce and goodes by reason of such leagues as they had made. To obserue and marke such thynges in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of hystoryes, doth greatly auayle them that beare rule, that thereby they maye learne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware in theyr gouernaunce, lest any suche lyke do befall: For such cases do dayly befall. Yea though the persons do somtyme chaunge in cōmune wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, neuerthelesse so much as is concernynge the equalytye of mattiers, the worlde is and alwayes abydeth lyke to hymselfe.</p>
   <p>Wherfore Thucydydes (whych was excellent<note place="margin">The say say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng of Then cidides cōcer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning histories</note> both in knowledge of Martyall affayres, and had himselfe endured a great &amp; contynuall warre, the which he him selfe wrote, wyth dyuers other thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges) said most truely: Histories is a treasure which

         </gap>.</note> such examples, which do profet euery priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son seuerally, such as these be: The magistrate must be obeyed. They, which rebelled against the higher powers, were neuer vnpunished, as Absalon, Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lma, Brutus, Cassius and such like that were ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore punished. Of faithfulnesse of frendes, as Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thas, which saued the life of Dauid. Of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for aduoutry and suche like wicked dedes, as it appeareth by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> example of Dauid. What nedeth many wordes euen as in al sciences are set forth ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>amples to be folowed: so are in histories set forth &amp; painted examples of al kind of vertues. Yee and in examples and thinges cōmitted is more euidently sene the worthinesse of vertues, yea &amp; also of what vnclennesse and dishonesty vices are, than in precep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes or doctrinees: Because that examples being set before vs as images, do not only teache openly, but do also admonish, sturre, and inflame the myndes y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> are honestly brought vp, that they maye be kindled toward vertues and honesty with a certain plesur and loue. For who could be so cruel of minde, which shulde not be moued, yf he did reade some excellent and laudable dede, or an example of vengeaunces.</p>
   <p>I haue brefely shewed, how the examples of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike
<pb facs="5"/>
vertues and ciuill causes must be obserued in<note place="margin">A Christen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man muste searche the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes of sayth and feare out of hystoryes.</note> readynge of histories: Nowe doth it pertayne to a Christenman, to whome godlynesse appertayneth that he maye knowe that out of historyes are to be gathered instructyons of fayth and feare of God. For these are the chefeste vertues of Godlye men, that are allowed before God. And thoughe the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storyes of the Gentyls do not teache vs that God careth for vs, or that God worketh wyth vs: a godlye harte neuerthelesse shall marke thys, name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye, how commune welthes are kept and preserued in the worlde from heauen, and that it is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge and dede of God, to reuenge violence and wronge, and that God doth oftentimes distribute hys excellente vertues amonge the Heythen. For princes can not kepe their kingdomes against Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, without the singular benefite of god, &amp; the aide or assistaūce of great vertues. And of this wise shal the mind of a godly man think by himself, that such notable actes &amp; punishmentes are the worck of god and shal by them learne to fear God, that is to saye, that tiraunces are greueously punished, according to that sentence: he that taketh the sword, (that is, he that taketh vpon hym the authoryte of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce, without a commaūdement,) the same shal pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rish with y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> sword. Contrary wise maie be sene also that good princes are kept and preserued of God: &amp; the same haue the heithen perceued also, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> princes do rest vpon the aid of the goddes. For Homer the poet sayeth, that God holdeth for the hys shyide in battail, to defend princes. He faineth also that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye prince is in sauegard by the defence of his god,

as it appeareth that the goddesse Pallas was wyth Achilles in battayll. &amp;c.</p>
   <p>Althese thinges are moost clerely expressed in y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> histories of the holy scripture, as in Abraham, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Ezechias and other kinges, whome God hath defended. And their examples are prepounded to euery prince, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they may be assured that god doth of likewise defēde the good. For the histories of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">The distrēce of holy and proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="3 letters">

   <p>Therfore ought euery Christen man chefely to know the holy scripture, that out of them they may<note place="margin">What holy histories do teache.</note> learne the doctrine and confirmation of faith. First how al thinges are created of God, how sinne dyd beginne, that Christe hath set vp his kingdomes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne, that he hath geuē his word, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste was promised, and that he is come to abandon sinne and to saue vs. Item how God, whan he had geuen his word, hath alway preserued and mainte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned Christes kingdome, and that Christes king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that is the true beleuing, haue alway ben cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaunt vnder the crosse sence the beginninge of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> worlde, and yet neuerthelesse are saued, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan with the greatest power of the world hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted the word of God. Item that God hath wō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derfully alway kept his promise, aboue the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standynge
<pb facs="7"/>
and thought of mens wit or wisedome. Item that God hath set before vs bothe the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his dredefull vengeaunce, and also of grace or fauour. Of this wise haue king Dauid and other gotten remission and forgeuenesse of sinnes, that by theyr examples we may be comforted, and beleue that God wil forgeue. Nether is y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> to be omitted, that God hath geuen vs al maner of prophecyes of exterior kingdomes, to stablish our mindes, that of the accomplishment of their chaunce, we myghte haue wytnesse, that our word is come of God, and that none other faith saueours is true. Item that we shuld be warned whan Christe muste come, and whan the ende of the worlde is to be loked for. Itē for so muche as we knowe that all thynges spoken of in the prophetes are come to passe, that we may beleue, that those shall happen also, the which holye scripture sayeth shall befal.</p>
   <p>Moreouer to vnderstande prophecyes arighte, it is greatlye necessary to knowe the order of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, the nombre of the yeares, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thynges, whyche in readynge of Heathen hystoryes do offer them selues: the knowledge whereof is chefelye necessarye for Chrysten men, that they may the better vnderstande the propheti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es, and haue the better iudgment of them.</p>
   <p>Of all thys truely maye euery man iudge, how muche profyte is taken oute of the readynge of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storyes, and the greate profyte or frute that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myth of them ought dylygently to steare and driue euery man to knowe them.</p>

The Germane princes, and chefely the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors ought to estime grearly this their honour, that they haue such high autoritye cōmitted them of God, to preserue religyon, iustice and commune peace. For verely, it is of great force that thys mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy be preserued, thoug it be not so very great. Therfore ought y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> princes to beware, lest ther ryse

any sedes of sedition &amp; discord among them, which might geue occasion to cause this empire to decay. For whan this empire, wyich is the head of al good gouernaunce or administratiō in the worlde now a<note place="margin">The empyre must be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and kept by all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> daies, shuld be diuided, pulled asunder or waisted, it could not be but that ther shuld folowe a pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of al degrees in euery part of Christendom: the which is gretly to be doubted, without God do preuent such misery with his last cōming. For holy scripture doth cōforte vs, &amp; teach openly, that after y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> this Germaine empire shal decay &amp; faile, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> latter day shal straight waye folowe. This is sufficient to be spoken of monarchies, lest any man be ignoraunt that al histories, and al thinges done in the world, must be referred to these monarchies. And besides that y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> obseruing of the order doth ayde y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> memory it doth also not a litle helpe thervnto, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> one may se how &amp; for what causes kingdomes are chaunged: wherby is to be learned how al those things are to be eschued, which cōmunely bring chaūges of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
