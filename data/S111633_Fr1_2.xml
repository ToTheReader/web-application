So that it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red if vve banishe them not the sooner, vve and our posteritye shall yet come into farre greater sorovv, then vve are already vvrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in.

only the great pompe, vainglory, riot, forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, open idolatry, periury. &amp;c. of mighti men and rulers, vvhich vvast the vvorld mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably, the space euen of many dayes vvold scase be any thing sufficient thervnto.

vvhich hold nothing of God, the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of goodnesse, and laugh his vvorde to scorne, of vvhom vve can knovve nothing, but that is there shevved vs: saue that small knovvledge, that is of beholding of the crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures▪ vvhich neuerthelesse declareth rather that there is a God, then vvhat he is, &amp; hovv he vvill be pleased. And though al the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture serue vs to enioy Gods blessings, yet as in a compound medicine, all the simples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holsom, some one may lesse be spard thē the other so the article of resurrection, clear and ofte inculcated in Sc ipture, is moste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable, so that it vnknovvne, all vices svvarm and roste in vs. For vve, not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our end, vvherein saluation &amp; life stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, or paines prepared for the accursed, vvill but staine our selues in voluptuousnes.

Contrarivvise, the learned in Goddes vvorde, knovving that this life is a death from sinne, and a vvaye to the life to come, vvhich Christ vvith his crosse hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vnto them, for desire thereof runne forth in the race of godlinesse: assured of the revvard, sith Christ, therfore bidding deathe battaile, that vve mought liue, hath broken her bondes and risen againe. For goodes are not the possessors, as the Philosopher saithe, and Christe alludeth in the parable of the tvvo strong men, but the more valiant mās. VVherfore, gentle reader, I hauing this litle but absolute vvorke of Christes and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and that there is an eternall life and damnation, vvherin the deuill hath sore assaulted the churche, by men, this only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, of greate authoritye and learning: thought it my duety, to put it in Printe, not keping that priuate, vvhich might doe suche good common.
