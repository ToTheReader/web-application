   <p>
      <hi>I</hi> am not ignorant (beloued in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus) how fruitful this age of ours is in bringing forth, to the viewe of the world, many new bookes, in somuch that wise men doe accompt it a fault of these times, that so many simple pamphlets are suffered to bee committed to the presse. VVherin, if I be iustly blamed with the rest, for publishing these my rude &amp; raw meditations: accept of my iust excuse, which is not (as commonly others alleadge for themselves) importunity of friendes, for then I had printed my sermon, assoone as I had preached it: being ther vnto ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desiered by many that heard me, as well strangers, as of my familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But vnderstanding since, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny copies, as they were taken by note, are scattered abroad in <hi>Londō</hi> &amp; else where wherof some haue come vnto my hands, and finding them to be very vnperfect: I am the more willing to publish the same, as <hi>I</hi> delivered it, not adding, or detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting,
<pb facs="3"/>any one worde in the whole. And wheras in the secōd generall part, I larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amplyfied the severall circumstauntes, whe I first penned the I do now only point at them, in this printed copte, partly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide tediousnes, &amp; partly because I was constrated so to do, when I preached this sermon beeing then cut off by the vnsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonablenes of the weather, and shortnesse of the time. But how simple &amp; vnperfect soever it bee yet for the arguments suke, befitting these heave times (which vvas an other cause of my printing it) I am the rather bould, to offer it to the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every well-disposed Christian: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching God, who giueth a happy successe to alour labours, so to blesse it, that he who readeth the same, may so meditate on the partence and long-suffering of God, and of his iudgement and iustice: that by the one be may be allured vnto repentance, by the other deterred from sin. That as the people of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> bearing the wordes of <hi>Ionas</hi> Sermon, did all turne from their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill waies so the people of <hi>England,</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="3"/>an exposition on <hi>Ionas</hi> sermon may all become newe converts vnto the Lord. That as the Lorde in mercy dealte vvith them, in with-houlding his punishments so he may as mercifully deale with vs as this time, in removing his heavy plagues, and fearefull iudgments from vs, and from our Land. Thus recommending is to thy Christian meditation, and my selfe, &amp; all my studies to thy daily praiers, I bad thee hartely fare well in the Lord. From <hi>Palioll Colledg in Oxford October. 10. 1603.</hi>
