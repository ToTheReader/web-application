I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant also, that to write obseruations of a mans practise, is a way, by which the Reader may be as much and perhaps more dangerously abused, then by any other, namely, if the Author should be vnfaithfull, or conceited in his owne priuate opinions, which by this meanes he would seeke to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish and obtrude vnto the credulous reader, but as the later of these can not be obiected against you, if the whole behauiour of your life may be taken for a testimonie, so neyther may the former be suspected by any that haue care to guide their iudgements by the rule of charitie. Adde heereunto, that beside the protestation you haue made in the word of a
<pb facs="12"/>
Christian, concerning the veritie of these things, and your sincere and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right meaning in the penning thereof, I am able, and will be ready in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry poynts, and namely, in your medicines and prescriptes, to testify that you haue concealed nothing from the Reader. As for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>t, with those also that I speake of, if their likelihood and probabilitie may be sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the learned and artistes of iudgement to gather their voyces, I doubt not but your side shall be full. But you say, your encouragement is greatly hindered, when you consider and call to minde, in what euill part things are nowadayes taken, that were not euill meant, and that such as would seeme wise men are become so foolish, that they can not heare the euill partes of base abusers disgraced, but by and by they must deeme themselues in like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ort thereby defaced. I see the vlcer you appoynt me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>erne it to be <hi>Cacoethes,</hi> and the malignitie thereof to be greater then any man can cure: but withall I deny, that it should be any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy cause of your discouragement, nay rather I hold, that you are afresh to take courage agaynst it, for dyuers reasons, fyrst, for that the burthen shall not lye onely vppon your backe, but that others are charged in lyke sort with you, who will not shrinke the shoulder from you in the bearing thereof, and many handes (you knowe) make quicke and easy worke. My second reason is, because the Deuill entendeth thus by their meanes to vpholde hys kingdome of ignorance and wickednesse still among vs, agaynst which, if we be enemyes of hys kingdome, we must needes make warre with all our might. Thirdly, because this is an infallible truth, which you may write vppon, that no man will misiudge, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne your inuectiues agaynst the wicked and theyr practises, or take themselues defaced by theyr disgrace, but such as haue guylty consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and are priuie to themselues, eyther of the same or lyke enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or atleast, that they do mayntayne or wincke at the same in others, when as rather by theyr places they should punish them: this latter sort (I hope) will be more wise, then to be found guylty of vpholding ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and if there haue been ouersightes committed heeretofore (as the best aduised will not denye) I trust they will become more warie for the lyke heereafter, but the former <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>orte are rightly touched in the olde and common prouerb of a galde horsse backe. When a great many kicke at our dressing of two or three me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s, it is a signe that they are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the lyke, and do therefore feare, least we would lay handes on them also, and then what reproche can that be to vs, when as our writings agaynst a fewe notoriously naught, shall discouer vnto the world a greater number that are in secret: as naught, they can not say we haue accused them, when as in deed their owne consciences haue fyrst condemned them, wherein, if they had stood sounde towarde their owne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearts, nothing could haue touched them, so that we see these sayings well con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>med, <hi>A good conscience is as a brasen wall.</hi> And agayne, <hi>An euill conscience is as a thousand witnesses against a man.</hi> Of these things, if I would stand long, I could say much, that should worthely redound
<pb facs="12"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o the shame and confusion of all such, but remembring the length of an Epistle, I will shut vp the rest in this briefe. One verie aptly compared the conscience of a man, to the minor, or assumption of such Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismes as do conclude particularly vpon a generall charge or accusation propounded for example. The Lawe sayth, <hi>He that killeth or maymeth, must be killed or maymed,</hi> the guilty conscience then assumeth thus: <hi>But I haue killed or maymed,</hi> and so this conclusion commeth vpon hym, <hi>therefore I ought to be killed or maymed agayne,</hi> all writers in Chirurgerie do giue this proposition, <hi>All vnskilfull men do wickedly abuse this Arte, and ought to be punished,</hi> then the guilty conscience euery where maketh this assumption: <hi>But I am an vnskilfull man,</hi> now followeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion on the neck of it, <hi>Therefore I do abuse the Arte, and ought to be punished.</hi> So when any Writer describeth the properties of wicked practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, he perhaps doth not say, this man is one, or such a man is such, but the consciences of those men, to whome such propertyes pertayne, do tell them so much in theyr bosomes. Who then (I pray you) is theyr accuser but themselues? Yea, but (will some say) in your inuectiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst abusers, you describe the men so by theyr propertyes, as euery one may knowe who you meane. I aunswere, fyrst, I haue knowne some, who thynke themselues no small men, that haue greatly stayned theyr wisedomes in misiudging such descriptions, therefore I wish men to be well aduised in theyr Interpretations. Secondly, if it be so, as they saye, that a man by hys propertyes may bee poynted out as with ones finger, my counsell is, that euery man must labour to change away hys euill qualityes for good, that so, when they shall be spoken of, they may commend hym, and not disprayse hym. And verely me thynke, it is full of reason, that they, who are so angry for hearing of theyr quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, should be much more ashamed to vse them.</p>
   <p>Feare not therefore (<hi>Mayster Clowes</hi>) in the loue of mans health, to shewe your selfe euen a vehement enemy, to all that hate, or hurt the same: Mans health (I saye) craueth it at your handes to decypher such counterfaytes in all theyr colours, that they may (at least) be auoyded of the people, though they be not also punished of the Magistrate, which notwithstanding were most of all to be wished. I see you euery where carefully except the sonnes of arte, and all honest and diligent men in our calling, of purpose because you would not haue your inuectiues applyed to any that deserue them not. If then there shall be any one that wyll needes take the things that are spoken to himselfe, and so beyng angry at his owne shadow, will also play <hi>Will Sommers</hi> part, in striking him that standeth next him: if any (I saye) shall thus deale with you, imagin therein what good successe you haue had, that in laying for one Foxe, you haue caught a couple, one, whome before you knew by speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertyes: and another, who hath now reuealed himselfe by the guiltinesse of his conscience, double gayne (you know) bringeth double reioycing. In such sort verily, should I thinke the matter meetest to be taken, as namely,
<pb facs="13"/>
if I should declare of one that I knowe did giue a Gentleman common praecipitate (as it seemeth) but mixt with a little vnguent out of his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, for a pill to purge him with: and another that to remoue a defiled bone, applyed a faire Mallet and a Chissell to the matter for more speede: and by the declaring of these, I should also rub the galled backs of others, whome I knewe not before to be sick of that disease, were there not as good cause for me to be glad of the successe of my discouery, as for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men to take it to their aduantage for the shunning of such impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors? the best men, I doubt not, will giue their voyces to this: the worst sort, I am sure, you meane not to make your iudges. You haue heard my iudgement of your labours, and my opinion of your aduersaries, the latter, your owne experience and working shall dayly confirme, the other, the Chirurgians practise, and orderly imitation, shall abundantly ratifye.</p>
   <p>And as I do entreate you for the publishing of this present fruite, so do I no lesse exhort you, to the keeping of other obseruations heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to the like vse. In both suites I perswade my selfe, (for the good will you beare vnto me) that I shall preuayle.</p>
