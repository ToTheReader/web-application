sacred issue
of Apollo, I
dedicate this
booke, because you onely
are capeable▪ and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
<pb facs="9"/>
of the quicke &amp;
nimble conceptions, and
of the grosse ignorance,
contained in it. you can
quickly discouer a Bull,
when with his hornes▪ he
gores &amp; murders sence.
Also you well understand
the lawes, and nature of
<hi>Apothegmes.</hi> You
know their proper time to
be chiefly at boord, when
the mind is to be vnben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and digestion aided
by mirth. You are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb facs="9"/>
that there is an
<hi>Antipathy</hi> betweene
them, and all places
where either sicknes, or
sorrow have dominion,
and therefore do alwaies
produce them in their
sence. You are taught by
wisedoms selfe, that they
are to mixe with our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
not to be made
the subiect of it, as also
that they should resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Lastly you can truely
iudge of their dignitie,
being rightly informed,
that men excellent both

For your recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and mine owne, I
wrote them, yet dare not

commend one of them,
til I know how you stand
affected. Since I freely
confesse that my liking
depends on yours. And
heere I leave them to
their fate, and you
to the custodie of
your better
