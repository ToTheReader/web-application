   </p>
   <p>These be the Argumentes, made to
perswade thee, to <hi>BEVVARE</hi> of M. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,
And these I haue confirmed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
by their propre and peculiar Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.
What remaineth then? Any
other thing, thau that such a destroyer &amp;
<pb facs="3"/>
spoiler of Soules, should be brought to
his Answer? This in deede should be
done with the first, if there were that
care in men, of their Soules, as should
be in them, that acknowledge any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie
of the Soule.</p>
   <p>But I may wel compare, the seeing
and suffering of false and blind Teachers
that now take cure of Soules, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
&amp; honouring of Mountebanks,
that goe abroad with diuerse thinges for
mens Bodies.</p>
   <p>These Mountebanks,<note place="margin">Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>or the Body.</note> are a free kind
of Wanderers, Pedlars, Surgeans,
Physitians, Historiographers, Poetes,
or what so euer name besides you wil
geue vnto them, men altogeather for the
penie, which is the cause that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
so many thinges. They take vp
their standing in Market places, or void
roomes meere for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>course of people,
there they set a stoole to stand vpon, or
make a litle scaffold for the purpose, from
which they play their part.</p>
   <p>Their Greatest Grace is in the
Countenance &amp; Tongue, through which,
they looke so Saddely, and speake so
<pb facs="4"/>
eloquētly, that a man would sweare vpō
a booke for them, that they thinke as they
speake, &amp; speak nomore, than they wil do.</p>
   <p>What so euer thing they haue to sel,
as <hi>Newes out of India,</hi> Or <hi>The Original
of the Turkishe Empire,</hi> Or <hi>Mery Tales,</hi>
Or <hi>Songes and Ballets.</hi> Or <hi>a Pouder to kil
wormes,</hi> Or <hi>A Preseruatiue againste the
Plague,</hi> Or <hi>A Water to make the skynne
faire and white,</hi> Or <hi>Pinnes, Pointes, Laces,
whistles,</hi> &amp; other such ware, whatsoeuer it
be, they commend it and praise it before.
But they do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> it with such a Grace, with
such a Constancie, with such Copie of
words, with such mouing of Affectio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s,
that it is wonderful. As</p>
   <p>If it be a Water, a Pouder, an Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente,
a Confection not worth twentie
pence, he wil make such a doe about it, as
though it could scarse be bought for halfe
a Kinges raunsome. And standing first
vp like a worshipful man, Arayed in his
silkes and veluettes, And al to be rayed
with braslettes &amp; bowed peeces of golde,
And chained about the neck with a great
thing (of copper and gylt, as many iudg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>,
but) of pure and fine gold, as farre as the
<pb facs="4"/>
eye seeth, he wil tel his Audience: That
he is come vnto them for good wils sake,
moued in him by the Fame and Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of them and theyr Citie or Toune:
He will tell them, that he can not tarie
long, &amp; that, before he depart, he would
fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e bestow vpon them some token of
his good affection: Then wil he bring<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>furth
that water or pouder, or conceipt,
which he would vtter, and say, That it
was brought from beyonde Calecut, or
the Red Sea: and then wil he point with
his finger towardes Calecut, and make a
like disgressiō, to declare how far that is
of, from their Countrie, as M. Iewel
doth to praise (after his maner) y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Popes
of Rome: after this, he wil shew the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and strength of his Pouder: And
further declare, how much thereof hath
been bought in greate Cities, and of
noble Personages which he wil name:
and further yet, he wil make them think,
that it is al that he hath leaft, that which
he offereth to be bought of them: He wil
also disgrace other Mountebankes that
goe abroad the Countrie, and say, That
their wares are but counterfeit, but that
<pb facs="5"/>
his are fine, and pure, and fresh. For why
he se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>keth not after gaines▪ as the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ous
and beggarly knaues doe, but as it
becommeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> good Gentleman, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth
farre and wide vpon his owne
Charges to get such geare, as may bring
Commodities to whole Countries. In
Cōclusion, when he hath spoken as much
as he can, then he prouoketh the hearers
againe and againe to bye. And if it be
a water which he commended, he putteth
in Glasses, made for the purpose, halfe a
skore or a skore of droppes thereof: If
it be a pouder, he putteth as much as he
can hold betwen his Thombe and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger,
in seueral papers, and beginneth
to make merchandise. And that which
as it should seeme by his tale, should be
wel worth a Croune a droppe, he wil sel,
with good gaines, for a myte or two, of
which, twelue do make but a penie.</p>
   <p>Such maner of Fellowes be the
Mountebankes. But what say the
Lordes and Signiours of the Townes
vnto them? They contein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
in their Iudgement▪ &amp; thinke
it not al worth the taking vp, which they
<pb facs="5"/>
so highly commend. Yet they laugh at
them, and say that so good and eloq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ent
an Oration, as they make to the people,
doth them a farthing worth of g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>od, at y<seg rend="sup">•</seg>
least, in relieuing their spirits, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
their Affections. So th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t there
is no greate harme done, although it be
nothing worth, that which they vtter.</p>
   <p>Especially wheras some of the Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bankes,
do either by Singing, or plai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ng
vpon Instrumentes, so hold the peo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>le
in the meane tyme, whiles th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>y looke
for their merchantes, that for theyr fitte
of mirth onely, they are worthy of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.
And besides this, al is not coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
that they put furth to sale, and
though they make it more in words▪ than
it is worth, yet if they should hold their
peace altogeather, it is not nothing that
which they sel. And in Conclusion,
whiles they hurt not the Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e and the
Common welth, let the peo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>le and them
cope togeather, what is that to great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires?</p>
   <p>A Montebank then, may crake, and
lie, and outface his Aduersarie, and make
somewhat of nothing, and mingle sport<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="6"/>
with sadnesse, and play what part he wil
in the sight of the people, and hundreds
wil gase vpon him, but none wil reproue
him.</p>
   <p>Like vnto these, in an other kinde,
there be other Mountebankes,<note place="margin">Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bankes for y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Soule.</note> men so
fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e, that they be lawlesse, So ful of faire
promises, that they sel, for one comming
vnto them, euerlasting life, So louing &amp;
kind harted, that they forsake their owne
Countrie, and without asking of licence,
or directly against commaundment, bye
and sel within other mens Iurisdiction.</p>
   <p>Yet, in Faith, they doe it somewhat
manerly, they rush not into Cities and
Townes at the first, but, without the
Towne walles, they choose out a place
in the open fielde, or in some wodde, and
xx. or xxx. tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>es being cut &amp; set one vpō

the Mountebanke beginne to open.</p>
   <p>But what stuffe it is▪ that he there
openeth, it can not be declared in a short
time and Preface▪ the So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>me yet is this:
That he commeth vnto them with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
wares: That he commeth from
<pb facs="6"/>
farre Countries: That except they wil
be thankeful and receiue the Grace that
he bringeth, he wil depart againe: That
he wil aske nothing for his labor: That
he deliuereth them quite, from feare of
Purgatorie, and Hel also (for Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
there is none at al, and to hel he wil
warrant them neuer to come) That thei
shal haue no more bonde of fasting, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
praying, performing of lawfull
vowes, &amp;c: That they shal haue no more
Signe of Crosse, or Christ, or our Lady,

   <p>And then he instructeth them in the
Doctrine of Caluin, Or (if the Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banke
be a Lutheran) in the Doctrine of
Luther, Or (if he be an Anabaptist) in

they haue spoiled Innocentes, Or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Proceedinges, O ye feruent and hote
sprited Merchantes of this worlde, and
send no letters of praise to the Lorde for
this victorie, which cōsisted in oppressing
of Innocentes, and in plaine robbing of
Churches. Came our Sauiour into
the world with such terrour? Did the
Apostles conuert the worlde, by violent
and felonious entring into any places?
Did they deny lawful Obedience vnto
the Magistrates, and the Princes &amp; Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of any Countrie? The Procedings
of these daies, are no more like the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinges
of the Apostles, or the Primitiue

I haue seene and readen as much
<pb facs="9"/>
as any man, yea as <hi>all the learned men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue:</hi>
I haue trauailed vnto the very <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
Church</hi> it selfe: I haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant
with <hi>Old Catholike Doctors, and
Fathers, and old General Councels.</hi> As
for these Priests, Cardinals and Popes,
whom you folowe, they bring nothing,
but Conclusions of Scholemen, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises
of Later Doctours, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of their owne making, &amp;c. But I
will bring you no other thing, but that
which is Auncient. I wil bring you back
to the Institution of Christ himself. You
shal haue al things ministred vnto you,
as they were in the time of the Apostles.
You shal heare God himself speake vnto
you. The Priestes shall robbe you no
more of halfe the Sacrament. You shall
knowe, what you heare readden in the
Church. Ye shal haue no Supremacie of
Pope, no Real Presence of Christs body
in the Sacrament. Ye shal be brought to
<hi>Old Customes,</hi> which y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Councel of Nice
would haue to preuaile: And Tertullian
shal teach you, how <hi>that is true, that was
first ordeined.</hi> And, as I saied before, so
say I now againe, <hi>If any man aliue</hi> be
<pb facs="10"/>
hable to reproue me, I will become his
obedient Scholer. But I know, there is
not one that is able to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> it, and because
I know it, therefore I speake it. So
beginneth, the Mountebanke.</p>
   <p>But in further processe he is proued
to be so vaine in Craking, So crafty in
Shifting, So demure in Coūterseiting,
So false in Affirming, So desperate in
Abusing of his Aduersarie, of old Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
and Doctours, yea and of new also,
that it is perceiued wel inough, euen of
them that say, <hi>God saue you my Lorde,</hi> vnto
him, that al is not so as he saith. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
they haue a good sporte, to see
the prety Shiftes, and Defenses, and
Scapes, that the Mountebanke canne
make, And though it be euident that he
li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>h, yet they thinke not, these maters
to be so great or necessary, but men may
suffer them wel inough to be mainteined
how so euer it be, as long, as neyther
Trade of Merchaundise, nor Study of
Temporal Law, nor Pastime abrode, nor
Pleasure at home, is hindered by it.</p>
   <p>For, like as we may vnderstand

goeth, So, when it is in sight, that in
Countries and Cities of greatest policy,
priuate mens goodes are not without
punishment touched, but the Common
Churches of the whole Countrie, are
openly spoyled: And when Papistes are
neither suffred to speak▪ nor to go abrode,
but Caluinistes, Lutherans, and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistes,
are not only suffred to speake,
but to speake one against the other, And
in one Citie or Countrie, to set fur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>h and
maintaine contrary Doctrines: it is easy
to perceiue, that, <hi>The vvisedome of God, is
but folly emong men.</hi> And that al is for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
and nothing for Religion, and that
men haue so forsaken the old Faith, that
they are not s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ttled in any new, And that
Faith in deede is almost extinguished, by
