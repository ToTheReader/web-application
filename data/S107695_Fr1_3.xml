   <head>THE MASKE OF THE
Gentlemen of the two combin'd houses,
or Inns of Court, the Middle-Temple,
and Lincolns Inne.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the house of the most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely
honour'd preferrer and
gracer of all honorable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and vertues, (Sir <hi>Edward
Philips</hi> Knight, Master of the
Rolls) al the Performers and their Assistents
made their <hi>Rendes vous,</hi> prepar'd to their
performance, and thus set forth.</p>
   <p>Fiftie Gentlemen, richly attirde, and as gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
mounted, with Foot-men perticularly
attending, made the noble vant-guarde of
these Nuptiall forces. Next (a fit distance
obseru'd betweene them) marcht a mock-Maske
<pb facs="4"/>
of Baboons, attir'd like fantasticall
Trauailers, in Neapolitane sutes, and great
ruffes, all horst with Asses; and dwarfe Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fries,
with yellow foot-cloathes, and casting
Cockle-demois about, in courtesie, by way
of lardges; Torches boarn on either hand of
them; lighting their state as ridiculously,
as the rest Nobly. After them were sorted
two Carrs Triumphall, adornd with great
Maske heads, Festones, scroules, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
leaues, euery part inricht with siluer and
golde. These were through-varied with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
inuention, and in them aduanc't, the choice
Musitions of our Kingdome, sixe in
each; attir'd like Virginean Priests, by whom
the Sun is there ador'd; and therfore called
the Phoebades. Their Robes were tuckt vp
before; strange Hoods of feathers, and scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops
about their neckes, and on their heads
turbants, stucke with seuerall colour'd fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
spotted with wings of Flies, of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
bignesse; like those of their countrie:
And about them march't two ranks of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Then rode the chiefe Maskers, in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
<pb facs="4"/>
habits, all of a resemblance: the ground
cloath of siluer, richly embroidered, with
golden Sunns, and about euery Sunne, ran a
traile of gold, imitating Indian worke,: their
bases of the same stuffe and work, but betwixt
euery pane of embroidery, went a rowe of
white Estridge feathers, mingled with sprigs
of golde plate; vnder their breasts, they
woare bawdricks of golde, embroidered
high with purle, and about their neckes,
Ruffes of feathers, spangled with pearle and
siluer. On their heads high sprig'd-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
compast in Coronets, like the Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Princes they presented. Betwixt euery
set of feathers, and about their browes, in
the vnder-part of their Coronets, shin'd
Sunnes of golde plate, sprinkled with pearle;
from whence sprung rayes of the like plate,
that mixing vvith the motion of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
shew'd exceedingly delightfull, and
gracious. Their legges were adorn'd, with
close long white silke-stockings: curious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
embroidered vvith golde to the Midde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legge.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>
And ouer these (being on horse backe) they
drew greaues or buskins embrodered with
gould, &amp; enterlac't with rewes of fethers; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
estrangfull, and <hi>Indian</hi> like.</p>
   <p>In their Hands (set in seueral postures as they
rode) they brandisht cane darts of the finest
gould. Their vizerds of oliue collour; but
pleasingly visag'd: their hayre, blacke and
lardge, wauing downe to their shoulders.</p>
   <p>Their Horse, for rich show, equalld the
Maskers them-selues; all their caparisons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enchac't with sunnes of Gould and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentall
Iewells. To euery one of which,
was tackt a Scarffing of Siluer; that ran sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuousely
in workes ouer the whole capari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
euen to the daseling of the admiring
spectators.</p>
   <p>Their heads, no lesse gracefully and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
deckt with the like light skarffing that
hung about their eares wantonly dangling.</p>
   <p>Euery one of these horse, had two Moores,
attir'd like <hi>Indian</hi> slaues, that for state sided them;
with swelling wreaths of gould, and
watshed on their heads, which arose in all to
<pb facs="5"/>
the number of a hundred.</p>
   <p>The Torch-bearers habits were likewise of
the <hi>Indian</hi> garb, but more strauagant then
those of the Maskers; all showfully garnisht
with seueral-hewd fethers. The humble va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
whereof, stucke off the more amplie, the
Maskers high beauties, shining in the habits
of themselues; and reflected in their kinde,
a new and delightfully-varied radiance on
the beholders.</p>
   <p>All these sustaind torches of <hi>Virgine</hi> wax,
whose staues were great canes al ouer gilded;
And these (as the rest) had euery Man his
Moore, attending his horse.</p>
   <p>The Maskers, riding single; had euery
Masker, his Torch-bearer mounted before
him.</p>
   <p>The last Charriot, which was most of all
adornd; had his whole frame fill'd with moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
worke; mixt all with paintings, and
glittering scarffings of siluer; ouer which was
cast a Canopie of golde, boarne vp with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
figures, and all compos'd <hi>a la Grotesea.</hi>
Before this in the seate of it, as the Chario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere;
<pb facs="6"/>
vvas aduanc't a strange person, and as
strangely habited, half French, halfe Swizz;
his name <hi>Capriccio;</hi> wearing on his head a
paire of golden Bellowes, a guilt spurre in
one hand, and with the other mannaging
the reignes of the fowre Horses that drewe
it:</p>
   <p>On a seate of the same Chariot, a little
more eleuate, sate <hi>Eunomia,</hi> the Virgine
Priest of the Goddesse <hi>Honor,</hi> together with
<hi>Phemis,</hi> her Herald: The habite of her Priest,
was a Robe of white silke, gathered about the
necke; a pentacle of siluered stuffe about her
shoulders, hanging foldedly downe, both
before and behind.</p>
   <p>A vestall vaile on her head of Tiffany,
strip'twith siluer, hanging with a trayne, to
the earth.</p>
   <p>The Herrald was attyr'd in an Antique
Curace of siluer stuffe, with labells at the
wings and basses; a short gowne of gould
stuffe; with wide sleeues, cut in panes: A
wreath of gould on his head, and a Rod of
gould in his hand.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
Highest of all in the most eminent seate
of the Tryumphall sat, side to side, the coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
Goddesse, <hi>Honour;</hi> and the earthy
Deity, <hi>Plutus;</hi> or Riches. His attire; a short
robe of gould, frindg'd; his wide sleeuesturn'd
vp, and out-showd his naked armes: his
Head and Beard sprinckl'd with showrs of
gould: his Buskins, clinckant, as his other attire.
The Ornaments of Honor were these:
a rich full robe of blew silke girt about her,
a mantle of siluer worne ouer-thwart, ful ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
and descending in folds behind: a
vaile of netlawne, enbrodered with Oos and
Spangl'd; her tresses in tucks, braided with
siluer: The hinder part shadowing in waues
her shoulders.</p>
   <p>These, thus perticularly, and with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie
adorn'd, were strongly attended
with a full Guard of two hundred Halbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:
two Marshals (being choice Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
of either house) Commaunder-like attir'd,
to and fro coursing, to keepe all in
their orders.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>
A showe at all parts so nouell, conceitfull
and glorious, as hath not in this land, (to the
proper vse and obiect it had porpos'd) beene
euer before beheld. Nor did those honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Inns of Court, at any time in that kinde,
such acceptable seruice to the sacred Maiesty
of this kingdome, nor were return'd by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
degrees, with so thrice gratious, and roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
entertainment and honor. But, (as aboue
sayd) all these so marching to the Court at
White Hall, the King, Bride, &amp; Bridegroom,
with all the Lords of the most honord priuy
Councel, and our chief Nobility, stood in the
Gallery before the Tilt-yeard, to behold their
arriuall; who, for the more ful satisfaction of
his Maiesties view, made one turn about the
yeard, and dismounted: being then honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
attended through the Gallery to a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
appointed, where they were to make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for their performance in the Hall, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>The King beeing come forth, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skers
ascended vnseene to their scoene. Then
for the works.</p>
   <p>First there appear'd at the lower end of the
<pb facs="7"/>
Hall, an Artificiall Rock, whose top was neere
as high as the hall it selfe. This Rock, was in
the vndermost part craggy, and full of hollow
places, in whose concaues were contriv'd, two
winding paire of staires, by whose greeces
the Persons aboue might make their descents,
and all the way be seene: all this Rocke grew
by degrees vp into a gold-colour; and was run
quite through, with veines of golde: On the
one side whereof, eminently raised on a faire
hill, was erected a siluer Temple of an octan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
figure, whose Pillars were of a compos'd
order, and bore vp an Architraue, Freese, and
Cornish: Ouer which stood a continued
Plinthe; whereon were aduaunc't Statues of
siluer: Aboue this, was placed a bastarde
Order of Architecture, wherein were keru'd
Compartements: In one of which was written
in great golde Capitalls, <hi>HONORIS FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVM:</hi>
Aboue all, was a <hi>Coupolo,</hi> or Type,
which seem'd to be scal'd with siluer Plates.</p>
   <p>For finishing, of all, vpon a Pedistall, was
fixt a round stone of siluer, from which grew
a paire of golden wings, both faign'd to bee
<pb facs="8"/>
Fortunes: the round stone (when her feet trod
it) euer affirm'd to be rouling; figuring her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy:
the golden wings, denoting those
nimble Powres, that pompously beare her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the world; On that Temple (erected to
her daughter, <hi>Honor;</hi> and figuring this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome)
put off by her, and fixt, for assured signe
she would neuer forsake it.</p>
   <p>About this Temple, hung Festones wreath'd
with siluer from one Pillars head to another.
Besides, the Freese was enricht with keruings,
all shewing Greatnes and Magnificence.</p>
   <p>On the other side of the Rocke,
grewe a Groue, in whose vtmost part appear'd a vast,
wither'd, and hollow Tree, being the bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
of the Baboonerie.</p>
   <p>These following should in duty haue had
their proper places, after euery fitted speech of
the Actors; but being preuented by the vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
haste of the Printer, which he neuer let
me know, and neuer sending me a proofe, till
he had past those speeches; I had no reason to
imagine hee could haue been so forward. His
fault is therfore to be supplied by the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="8"/>
and reference of the Reader, who will
easily perceiue, where they were to bee inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
   <p>After the speech of <hi>Plutus</hi> (who as you may
see after, first entred) the middle part of the
Rocke began to moue, and being come some
fiue paces vp towards the King, it split in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with a great crack; and our brake <hi>Capriccio,</hi>
as before described. The peeces of the Rocke
vanisht and he spake as in his place.</p>
   <p>At the singing of the first Song, full, which
was sung by the Virginian Priests; called the
Phoebades, to sixe Lutes (being vsed as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phean
vertue, for the state of the Mines ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning):
the vpper part of the Rock was sodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
turn'd to a Cloude, discouering a rich and
refulgent Mine of golde; in which the twelue
Maskers vvere triumphantly seated: their
Torch-bearers attending before them. All
the lights beeing so ordred, that though none
were seen, yet had their lustre such vertue, that
by it, the least spangle or spark of the Maskers
rich habites, might with ease and cleerenesse
be discerned as far off as the seate.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="9"/>
Ouer this golden Mine, in an Euening sky,
the ruddy Sunne was seen ready to be set; and
behind the tops of certaine white Cliffes, by
degrees descended, casting vp a banke of
Cloudes; in which, a while hee was hidden:
but then gloriously shining, gaue that vsually-obseru'd
good Omen, of succeeding faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
   <p>Before he was fully set, the Phoebades (shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the custome of the Indians to adore the
Sunne setting) began their obseruance with
the Song, to whose place, wee must referre
you for the manner and words; All the time
they were singing; the Torch-bearers hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vp their Torches to the Sun; to whome
the Priests themselues, and the rest, did as they
sung obeisance: Which was answred by other
Musique and voices, at the commandement
of <hi>Honor,</hi> with al'obseruances vs'd to the King
&amp;c. As in the following places.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="9"/>
TO answer certaine insolent obiections made against
the length of my speeches, and narrations; being (for the
probability of all accidents, rising from the inuention
of this Maske; and their aplication, to the persons, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
for whome, and by whome it was presented) not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
but necessary; I am enforct to affirme this; That: as
there is no Poem nor Oration so generall; but hath his one
perticular proposition; Nor no riuer so extrauagantly am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but hath his neuer-so-narrow fountaine, worthy to be namd;
so all these courtly, and honoring inuentions (hauing
Poesie, and Oration in them, and a fountaine, to be exprest,
from whence their Riuers flow) should expressiuely-arise;
out of the places, and persons for; and by whome they are
presented; without which limits, they are luxurious, and paine.
But what rules soeuer are set downe, to any Art, or
Act (though, without their obseruation; No Art, nor Act, is true,
and worthy) yet are they nothing the more followd;
or those few that follow them credited. Euery vulgarly-esteemd
vpstart; dares breake the dreadfull dignity of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and autenticall Poesie: and presume Luciforously, to
proclame in place thereof, repugnant precepts of their owne
spaune. Truth, and Worth, haue no faces, to enamour the
Lycentious, but vaine-glory, and humor. The same body:
the same beauty, a thousand men seeing: Onely the man
whose bloud is fitted, hath that which hee calls his soule,
enamourd. And this, out of infallible cause; for, men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not these of <hi>Maenanderâest mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
<pb facs="10"/>
oportunitas</hi>
   </p>
   <q>Animae, quodictus, vulnus accipit graue.</q>
   <p>But the cause of all Mens being enamourd with Truth.
And of her slight respect, in others; is the diuine <hi>Freedom;</hi>
one touching with his aprehensiue finger, the other, passing.
The Hill of the Muses (which all men must clime in the
regular way, to Truth) is said of ould, to be forcked. And the two points
of it, parting at the Top; are <hi>Insania,</hi> and, <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinus
furor. Insania,</hi> is that which euery Ranck-brainde writer;
and iudge of Poeticall writing, is rapt withal;
when hee presumes either to write or censure the height
of Poesie; and that transports him with humor, vaine-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and pride, most prophane and sacrilegious: when <hi>diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
furor;</hi> makes gentle, and noble, the neuer so truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
writerâ</p>
   <q>Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros.</q>
   <p>And the mild beames of the most holy inflamer; easely,
and sweetly enter, with all vnderstanding sharpenesse, the
soft, and sincerely humane; but with no Time; No Study;
No meanes vnder heauen: any arrogant, all-occupation
deuourer (that will Chandler-like set vp with all wares;
selling, Poesies Nectar and Ambrosia; as wel as musterd, and
vineagar.) The chast and restraind beames of humble truth
will euer enter; but onely grase, and glaunce at them: and
the further fly them.</p>
