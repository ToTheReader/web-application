   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>THus, reading M. Shacklockes tryumph in the behalfe of Osorius and other hys leaguelowlers, ioyned with so vniuersall disabling of all gospellers and namely D. Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, I thought good to make this search, which I haue here set before all mennes eyes, takynge the beginning therof at Osorius his first propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition or entrance vnto his mattier, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuinge the chase vnto his pytyfull conclusion. Which collections runne so much on one figure called <hi>Rixa</hi> or <hi>Conuicium,</hi> &amp; are such declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie and generall stuffe, that a man maye trulye say, they haue one especial property, that is, they may serue more martyrs then one. For euen so, as he in these his centons or fragmentes impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our religion, might he thunder against He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rostrotus for burning the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so against the wilfull murther of Orestes, Nero, Mithridates, Cambises: euen so against the sensualitye of Xerxes or Sardanapalus: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom and what he pleased, euen so. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that in diuers places he merueilously mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh our doctrine, beating downe manfullye that we neuer set vppe, like a counterfeyt <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> making monsters vnto him selfe whiche
<pb facs="16"/>
he may easely vanquish, and so losynge his dayes labour to the greate pitie and compassion of the godly reader. thus much (and what so euer elles) whether it may bee trulye saide or no, let other men iudge. This I dare depose, that there is not halfe so much here vttered, as is forced by thim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of his <hi>Subscriptor</hi> M. Shacklock. In the whole what I haue pretermitted (that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted which you shall here fynde by D. Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don confuted) let euery man loke. fewe Doctors (I warrant you) or scriptures, which in Osorius his Epistle are very straunge gestes (and as they sticke not commonlye to say, in that engyne of pollycy needed not. Which his Epistle so tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting (as you wold say) vnto a mother strength, al good helpes of Scriptures, Doctours, or coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles set aparte, for eloquence so well thought of, by the trāslatour so priced, &amp; that syngeth in the eares of all Papistes so incōparable har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, (for so much therof as I haue layd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my preface) I dare auouch it to cōteine so nedeles braules, idle &amp; friuolous replyes, cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietye with goddes holye worde .iii. fowle faultes, regardinge eyther the man or the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer, that (as you maye see in the margine,) I
<pb facs="17"/>
thought them worthy to be poynted at. Why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che .iii. whether they be there to be founde or no, I besech the reader to looke, freelye depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe that I haue in those collections vsed plain dealing, not chaunging or adding one iote, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye here and there pretermitting that I thought needelesse. What I haue done is all for May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Shacklockes sake. I will not go farre, nor vtter that whyche I hardelye conteyne, onelye for Mayster Shackelocke a lyttle curtesye. Nowe in good faythe, haue I not for his good comparison, verye good occasion to take one of his funeral verses,<note place="margin">
         <hi>The begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ninge of a brainsicke verse of in. Shack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockes. of the buriall of b. Scot, in Louain.</hi>
      </note> and sing <hi>Hei mihi ridiculis</hi>? What no comparison? not of charitye? not so much as a wyde comparison? no fauour? no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welles of mercy, but starke naught in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of you and yours? I feare me I see your face and facyng euen through your vysard. I se how all men see, that at Louaine it hath bene agreed on, not to sticke for craking, I se, (that is, is not) a prouerbe that will neuer fayle in them. Yet haue we one veine of comfortable bloud, that they shal neuer perswade al, neuer shal the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill go further then his cheine. They may doo what they will and can. Their bokes and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
<pb facs="17"/>
haue they and must haue at scope vnder Antichrists banner, according vnto the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes, and wide woundes both in word &amp; dede must we beare for a time. Yet of modesty, let not M. Rich. Shacklock so churlishlye set him self against M. D, Haddon, euery peasant against euery Peere, euery iangler against euery sage, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery shackled Papist against euery good Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peller. O, this is a secure perswasion, &amp; the high way to blind bussardly boldnes, some thing to say and to thinke wel of them selues. And this rule (I may say) is now wel taken vp. Els wold not such a man as M. Shacklock, hauinge seene such streames of bloudshed in his natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, of poore pined Protestants,<note place="margin">

that yong Caluinist and old Papist that vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to call the History of their owne late ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannye, a doūghill of stinking martyrs. A thing soone sayde. And yet is that notable cronicle (so lightly tearmed) such a monument as shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worldes ende, not with wordes, but liuely recordes of tormentes, imprisonment and horrible murther of good persons and vertuous refute all their lyppe labour. Auaunt with thys your barkynge after your bloudye bittes, you monstruous howlyng wolues. You haue by your accursed crueltye geuen mattyer vnto that hystory which now maketh you to yerne, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch causeth your teeth to grate &amp; chatter in your mouthes. You your selues made those Anty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian fyers, you behelde the naked bodyes burning so long as the synewes wolde contein them, and now they are all lyes, or elles you are lyers. Which registers and rowles of your Cains actes, require and chalenge, by stronge reason, to bee beleued, because they bable not Romyshe bastarde miracles comminge after the date, but testifye vnto all generations to come thaccusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tormenting and tossing of good men by the hande of their stepmother the fleshe and

the world, from piller to post, frō pain &amp; agon<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> vnto death. Whiche thynges are suche as dayly happen, and are commonly practised of the euil against the symple and iuste. Whereof also are witnesses yet lyuinge infinite, and partlye that were partakers of the same in their fleshe and bloude, hauing sette aparte all will and vanitye of lying and fablinge, muche vsed in tymes past of the wanton and idle Cloisterers. Who being alwayes warme and quiet, nor hearing of anye such blusteringes and tempestes, turned theym selues vnto lewed &amp; light inuentions, the right fruites of munkishe ydlenes. Nowe sir, what bitchfox was it that bibbed vp all the bloude? heresy. heresy? what meane you by that, papy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry? no mary, but the ghospell so called. Fy, M. Shacklock, for pure shame. <hi>Mentiris egregiē.</hi> the ghospell (I dare say) hath bene a sower mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres: <hi>Haec vapulando illa verbarando, vs{que}, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hae defessae sunt.</hi> Charme your rauing muse vntil she be sober and vtter truthes. Play not the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite thus bothe to byte and whine. As for <hi>cruor</hi> (that is bloude) it is the papistes peculier and lineal badge. Popelinges they are of whom it is written: <hi>Effuderunt sanguinem sanctorū
<pb facs="19"/>
et in eo inebriati sunt</hi>: They shede the bloud of sainctes, and sucked thereof, vntill they wear droncken. We sillye soules on thother syde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes suffring, and euer forbearing, the sworde now put into our handes, strike not one stroke, being content to beare in our banner the fishe called <hi>Gladiolus,</hi> a sworde fishe, whiche hath growing in his forehede a long sworde, but he lacketh a hart, he woūdeth not, he striketh not, ne profereth one blowe. But let go the rest, and winke we at the rest of that licencious stile. I beseche thee (good reader) to accepte this my translation of M. D. Haddon against M. Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimus Osorius, &amp; to gather by dew conference of euerye percell, all dewe and Christian fruite. Consideringe that all payne eyther of wrytinge or translating is employed to quench thy thirst, and to geue the a depe tast of that swete worde which must be thine endeles comfort. And let it not come to passe, that when the incessante payne and trauaile of godly learned men desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng euen to sweate their bloude for thy sake, tendeth all vnto thine edifying and instruction, thou stil continue deafe &amp; blind, tarying nothīg but goddes vengeaunce and wrathe perpetuall.
<pb facs="19"/>
So both reade and heare, that thou kepe one eis fixed on the worde of god, who is thy best fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; wil not beguile thee. the sonnes of men are deceitfull, but god is truth. Neyther attend vnto the preachinge Papist, that monstrous <hi>Sphynx,</hi> which hath already beaten &amp; boūced thee with the stone in one hand, and now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth bread with the other. Take hede, I say, of that bread. it is offred with the left hād. Repose thy trust in god, &amp; take vnto thy soules vse that parcell of his deuine pleasure, that is contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this lyttle treatise. Fare well and remember to worshyppe in spyrite and truthe. Dat. at Cambridge the .xxvij. of May. 1565.</p>
