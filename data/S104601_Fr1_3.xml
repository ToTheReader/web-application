   <head>¶ The Authours Epistle vnto his friende.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, it woulde be too manifest an Argument of a nature degeneratyng from al gentrie, if I shoulde not consider of your request, you asking and vrging both honest and profitable thyngs. I therfore to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you, that I am not forgetful of your demaund, presumyng like blynd Bayard to this my boldnesse, haue not with <hi>Apolloes</hi> Pensile, but with <hi>Pans</hi> pleasantlesse Pen, indeuoured to endite that which you are so desirous to haue done. And although I once translated for you, <hi>Ouid, De remedio amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> as you said, to your contentation, we beyng then in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where aske helpe, and haue helpe, might be had: yet nowe I wyl en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you, lyke one amazed, I haue strayned my strength vnto the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>termost, being desirous to finish this woorke. You know that Loue matters be agreeing with <hi>Caliopes</hi> Quill, euery Apprentise can of such matter, make a Meter. But how hard a thing it is to compell <hi>Clio,</hi> with her boysterous banners, to couch vnder the compasse of a few metered lines, I referre you vnto the good <hi>Turberuile,</hi> who so soone as he began to take the terrible Treatise of <hi>Lucan</hi> in hand, he was inforst to vnyoke his Steeres, and to make holy day. Shal I then with <hi>Bochas</hi> Pen declare the falles of the vnfortunate Princes of the olde worlde? O intollerable presumption, that timorous <hi>Tyro</hi> shoulde dare to deale with menasing <hi>Mars:</hi> or that a young infant should offer to put on the Buskins of <hi>Hercules:</hi> shal I then with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ceasse to accomplish your request? O singuler ingratitude, that any friend should refuse to sweate, to pleasure and profite his friend. Doo you not consider, that al the fine wyts that England hath inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these many yeres, haue busied their braynes very much, to make an English <hi>Mirrour for Magistrates,</hi> which booke is left euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day, like the vnperformed image of <hi>Venus,</hi> paynted by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi>? No man is able to finish the work, which they with <hi>Homers</hi> hawtie Heroycal style haue begunne: and yet you woulde haue me (the least of the <hi>Poets</hi>) to make trial what I am able to doo therin. But me thinke I do heare you say, as you were woont, we being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant together, What meane al these wordes? thou knowest that the vayne of thy verse doth most delight my humor. And seeing


<pb facs="4"/>
it is but for my priuate Study, what meane you to allege all these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, as though <hi>Orestes</hi> were <hi>Zoilus?</hi> Syr, I confesse al this to be true: yet this I speake, to signifie vnto you, howe willyng the good wyl I doo beare vnto you, hath made me, being otherwise vnwil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="4 letters">

      </gap>o beare a sayle in such rough weather, where euery Sea is ready to deuoure me. And when with sayles and Oares (as they say) I with al my diligence endeuoured to compasse the thing now<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> accomplished, I founde my selfe euen in the myddest of the matter, clapt close with <hi>Theseus,</hi> in a returnable Labarinth, to fight with <hi>Despayre</hi> that miserable <hi>Minotaur:</hi> where, when I could finde no <hi>Ariadne,</hi> to lende me a bottome of Twist, I looked that <hi>Parcae</hi> shoulde haue shread my twyne before my returne. Yet at the last wandring <hi>Erato,</hi> with her sister <hi>Terpsichore</hi> perceiuing me with such diligence to trauise that Maze, they willing to helpe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of my mynd▪ said thus vnto me: <q>
         <l>Come forth thou wandring wight this way,</l>
         <l>Doo followe vs outright:</l>
         <l>We geue thee leaue with Poets penne,</l>
         <l>On Princes Falles to write.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Wherewith they leadyng me vnto the fountayne <hi>Permestus,</hi> I without any further determination, gallopped through the rest, whiche when leysure shall geue you leaue to reade, ceasse then to thinke on the <hi>L. Buchurst,</hi> or <hi>Sackuyll,</hi> let <hi>Gascon</hi> and <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde</hi> be forgotten. And if you chaunce to see the Meter, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not so well polished, as beseemeth, then remember, that they whose falles I haue here penned, were not of late tyme, but suche as lyued presently after the Incarnation of Christe: and I haue not thought it decent, that the men of the olde worlde shoulde speake with so garnished a Style, as they of the latter tyme.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, you may, if you please to consider, that Souldiers, of whiche I am one by profession, wee be not alwayes lusking in our Forte or Castle, but be as tyme and occasion wyll permyt, here to day, wee knowe least our selues, where to morrowe. And I wyll ensure you, the most part of these my Princes dyd pleade their causes vnto me, euen in the Sea, a place in fayth, not meete to penne Tragedies. And as for bookes, I was altogether destitute: for


<pb facs="4"/>
when I, to please my fantasie, trauayled (as you knowe) I could not beare about with me a librarie but for cariage sake, contented my self with these foure: With the thirde <hi>Decade</hi> of <hi>Titus Liuye,</hi> with <hi>Boswelles Concordes of Armorie,</hi> with <hi>Monsignor de Lange,</hi> that notable Warriour, &amp; with the vnperfect <hi>Mirrour for Magistrates:</hi> whiche bookes made nothing to this purpose. I had not those Chronicles whiche other men had: my Memorie and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention were vnto me in stead of <hi>Grafton, Polidore, Cooper,</hi> and suche like, who dyd greatly ayde other men. And last of al you must consider, that the other part of the miseries of those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Princes were written, I sittyng on a Rocke in the Sea, not in <hi>Spaine, Italie, Fraunce, Scotlande,</hi> or <hi>Englande,</hi> but in <hi>Garn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie</hi> Castle, where although there be learned men, yet none whiche spende their tyme so vainely as in Poetrie. So that the complaintes of these men were written (as I say) where the want of helpe dyd diuersly daunt me with despayre. You haue greatly requested me by your last letter, to make vnto you a Discourse of the Ile of <hi>Garnzie,</hi> and howe it is possible for the Castle to be a place so pleasaunt for habitation, as I haue reported it, seeing it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the Sea, separate from any lande. Good Syr, to write thereof (so manyfolde be the commodities and thinges woorthy the writyng of) woulde rather require a good volume, then a peece of an Epistle. Let it therefore suffice for this tyme, that I by writyng vnto you some fewe lines of the Couernour, I may briefely declare what the gouernement and commodities be. The right woorshipful Maister <hi>Thomas Leighton</hi> is her Maiesties Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunt there.</p>
   <p>Syr, I doo remember, howe constant <hi>Constantine the Great</hi> was in Religion, and howe that noble Emperour mynded the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation thereof. You knowe howe carefull <hi>Licurgus</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> were for making of good Lawes, and ministring of iustice. And Histories doo recorde, howe passing happye <hi>Epaminundas</hi> was in al his affayres: But what a seemely sight is it, to see al these vertues so to concurre in one man, that hee who shoulde, compare hym with them, should, I wyl ensure you, doo hym great iniurie?


<pb facs="5"/>
for (that I may briefly conclude) vndoubtedly a few such men as he is, being plaste at a Princes elbow, were sufficient to keepe the most ruinous common weale that is, from ruine and destruction. And now, iudge you the commodities of the Countrey, by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Gouernour, for as <hi>Seneca</hi> sayeth:
<q>
         <l>Where Gouernours be good, and rule their charge aright,</l>
         <l>Without an ebbe, there flowes the flood, which vertuous minds delight.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>And heere I doo turne me from these thinges, vntill by talke with you, I may dilate more at large therof, and returning my selfe vnto my former purpose, I haue not thought it conuenient to write the complaynts of these men, with so obscure a stile as some other haue done, but with so playne an exposition, that he who doth reade them shal not neede to be <hi>Oedipus,</hi> for euery playne <hi>Dauus</hi> shall by reading them, easely vnderstand the Authours drift. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Memorie</hi> bee all the helpers that I haue, therefore I haue ordayned them, as the chiefe workers of my wyll. <hi>Higgins</hi> vsed (I know not what) <hi>Morpheus,</hi> the God of dreames, But I dreame not: the other had <hi>Baldwine</hi> for their hearer, but I haue diligent <hi>Inquisition,</hi> who can finde out al things, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, who knoweth al thinges, for the Arbiters of my matter. Take you therefore, the fruites of these my idle howres, sent vnto you with a good wyll, and according vnto the trust reposed in you, keepe these trifles from the view of all men, and as you promysed, let them not raunge out of your priuate Study. And thus wishing vnto you honour and long lyfe, I ende, the .15. daye of Maye, An. 1577.</p>
