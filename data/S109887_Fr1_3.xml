   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>THat at first I made choise of this argument, I haue not as
yet repented mee, for if the Muse haue not much abused
me, it was most worthy to haue found a more worthy pen
then mine owne; for the <hi>Barrons warres,</hi> (omitting the
qualitie of those Armes, whereof I haue not heere to speake) were
surely as well for their length in continuance, as for theyr mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
bloodshed, and multitude of horrid accidents, meet matter
for trumpet or tragedy. Therefore as at first the dignity of the
thing was the motiue of the dooing, so the cause of this my second
greater labour was the insufficient handling of the first, which
though it were more then boldnesse to venture on so noble an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
without leisure, and studie competent, eyther of which
trauaile hardly affoords; yet the importunitie of friends made
mee contrary to mine owne iudgement take, vndertake, &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
it so as the world hath seene; but heerin I intend not to be too
exact, as if either it needed to much excuse (knowing that euen
as it was, it ought to haue passed for better then some would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
who can hardly thinke any thing hath sauour but their own,
though neuer so vnsauorie) or as if I should seeme now to haue
excelled my selfe, and failing in my hopes be kept without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse.
<hi>Grammaticasters</hi> haue quarreld at the title of <hi>Mortime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riados,</hi>
as if it had beene a sin against <hi>Syntaxis</hi> to haue inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
it in the second case, but not theyr idle reproofe hath made
me now abstaine from fronting it by the name of <hi>Mortimer</hi> at
<pb facs="3"/>
all, but the same better aduise which hath caused me to alter the
whole; And where before the stanza was of seauen lines, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there are two couplets, as in this figure appeareth,
<figure>
</figure>
the often harmonie thereof softned the verse more then the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
of the subiect would permit, vnlesse they had all been Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
or couplets. Therefore (but not without new fashioning the
whole frame) I chose <hi>Ariostos</hi> stanza of all other the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete,
and best proportioned, consisting of eight, sixe interwouen,
and a couplet in base.
<figure>
</figure>
   </p>
   <p>The Quadrin doth neuer double, or to vse a word of Heral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie,
neuer bringeth foorth Gemells. The Quinzain too soone.
The Sestin hath Twinnes in the base, but they detaine not the
Musicke, nor the Cloze (as Musitions terme it) long enough for
an Epick Poem; The stanza of seauen is touched before; This of
eight both holds the tune cleaue through to the base of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne
(which is the couplet at the foote or bottom) &amp; closeth not
but with a full satisfaction to the eare for so long detention.</p>
   <p>Briefely, this sort of stanza hath in it maiestie, perfection, &amp;
soliditie, resembling the piller which in Architecture is called
the Tuscan, whose shaft is of sixe diameters, &amp; bases of two. The
<pb facs="4"/>
other reasons this place will not beare, but generally all stanzas
are in my opinion but tyrants, and torturers, when they make
inuention obey theyr number, which sometime would otherwise
scantle it selfe. A fault that great Maisters in this Art striue to
auoyde. Concerning the deuision which I vse in this Poem, I am
not ignorant that antiquitie hath vsed to distinguish workes into
Bookes, and euery one to beare the number of theyr order, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
Iliads,</hi> and <hi>Vlysiads</hi> indeede are distinguished by seuerall
letters of the Greeke Alphabet, as all the world knowes, and not
by the numerall letters onely, which to Iota are digit, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
compound, the Alpha beeing our vnit, for the Greekes had
no figures nor cyphers in their Arithmeticke. <hi>Virgils AEneis,
Statius Thebais, Silius</hi> worke of the Carthagenian war, <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Argonauticks, Vidas Christeis,</hi> are all deuided into books.
The Italians vse Cantos, &amp; so our first late great Reformer Ma.
<hi>Spenser,</hi> that I assume another name for the sections in this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
cannot be disgratious, nor vnauowable.</p>
   <p>Lastly, if I haue not already exceeded the length of an Epistle,
I am to intreat, that he who wil (as any man may that wil) make
himselfe a party to this of ours, would be pleased to remēber that
<hi>Spartan</hi> Prince who beeing found by certaine Embassadors play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among his children, requested them to forbeare to censure til
also they had some of their owne. To such I giue a sample power
and priuiledge as euer <hi>Ius liberorum</hi> could in Rome, crauing
backe againe at their hands by a regrant, the like of that which
I impart, for great reason there is that they should vndergoe the
licence which themselues challenge, &amp; suffer that in their fames
which they would wrongly put vpon others, according to the
most indifferent law of the <hi>Talio.</hi> Fare you well.</p>
