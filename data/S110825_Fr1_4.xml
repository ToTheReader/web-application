   <head>The Argument.</head>
   <p>THe most Christian Poet in a matter of truth (hauing made his invocation vpon the true God) addresseth himselfe to describe the creation of the world, against the truth whereof bicause many opinions of heathenish Philosophers might be opposed, he cutteth them downe, as they stand in his way. Some dreamed of eternitie, and seeing the briers of antiquitie growing over the cleere account of the worlds age, lost themselues as in a labyrinth, for wane of a directorie thread, to leade to the originall point of the first entrance of the same. Others stumbled at the beginning thereof, and did seeme to hold the circumstance of time, and a former commencement of motion, yet did they denie the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and miscall the author therof: for they affirmed the world to haue bene patched vp of meats, and sodainely so iumbled together by a casuall concourse of the same. Our Poet treading the steppes of the true Prophets, findeth out an Immortall author and preseruer, being the ancient of daies, a Father of lights, wich is he that protesteth of himselfe, I am before the light was created. And if the Epicure demand what that Author did before he made the world, here is returned the same answere that Spiridion gaue to the like question in the councel of Neece, <hi>He built a hel for curious questionists:</hi> &amp; for his company, he was alone and yet not solitarie, he had his essentiall vertues, his distinct persons all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in the fulnes of his Godhead which was al in all. Some of the Philosophers harped vpon this point, but their brains were out of tune, and therfore neuer found out the perfect vnion of those three parts in one. Our Poet expresseth the Author God, the instrument his word, being the very beginning and alpha of those lines written in the royall parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the heauens, and made legible to all lands and languages. This whole frame and organ of the world tuned by the finger of God and breathed into by his spirit, serueth as vocall musicke to conueigh the significant dittie of his power and glorie into euerie sence. Neither is this world a worke of Imitation seconded by any former and externall patern: but of meere nothing was made a rude something at the first, by sixe daies leasure poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed &amp; extended in such ample compas as we behold, to the intent there might be but one whole entire mound, without whose pales there might neither be purleis nor pluralitie of worlds. As it had a beginning, so also must it haue an end, though Plato (of prophane men the most deuine) shuld affirme the contrary, &amp; al the stife conceited sect of Stoickes shuld necessarity implead a sempiternitie: Yet such an end shall it haue as euerie venturous. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologer is not able to discouer; no, nor any bus the vnsearchable knowledge of the highest. God therefore proued the Author and destroier, is proposed as a president to vs in that he tooke six daies to finish that which at a trice he could haue performed. Amongst his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue labors the cōfortable light is preferred in time, &amp; made the first fruit of his creatures: the substance thereof vncertaine, the beautie and profits therof most certaine: what cause moued the almightie to distinguish betweene day and day, light and light, with intercourse of night and darkenes expressed. The angels creation being touched &amp; (according to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral opinion) attributed to this daies work, the fal of som of them, malice of these apostate relapses: the persistance and diligent seruice of others in the desence of Gods beloued, and offence of his enimies described, the Poet takes his farewell for the first day.</p>
