   <head>TO The Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and truly Noble Lord, ROBERT Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> Lord RICH, Baron of <hi>Leeze,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
   <head type="sub">Encrease of Honour here, and euerlasting Glory hereafter.</head>

      <salute>Right Honorable Lord;</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ay it please you to take in good worth this my bold attempt, in that vpon so little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and far lesse deserts, I haue aduentured so far, as to grace these my weake labours with your Noble name.</p>
   <p>Besides some personall
<pb facs="3"/>
and particular respects which I here let passe; I haue had some generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements hereunto; and this aboue the rest, Your Honours loue vnto the Truth, and great regard of the Ministerie thereof; which your more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie paines taking to heare holy Instructions, together with the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect your Honour giues to such as bring glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of peace (whose feet (and much more their face)<note place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15.</note> are esteemed by you as beautifull) are sufficient arguments to euince. By which and other fruits of pietie you still merit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne to your Noble Name, and are zealously honoured of al that know you and loue goodnesse. into which number (I hopefully presuming) haue thrust my selfe, as being loth to bee hindmost in that acknowledgement which is so nobly deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and ioyfully rendered of all; desiring (as far as in
<pb facs="3"/>
me lieth) to make knowne vnto the world that grace which lies lodged in your noble brest, which being vnited to your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, maketh so happie a composition, as that they who had no more than Natures light, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it only for true<note n="a" place="margin">Nobilitas sola est at{que} unica vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. Iuven.</note> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.</p>
   <p>For whereas great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse makes some men scornefull and imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: yet what<note n="b" place="margin">Nec quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in te mutavit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunae ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo nisi ut prodesse tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundem pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses &amp; velles Plin. epist. ad Vespas.</note>
      <hi>Plinius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> may be truly said of you; It hath changed nothing in you but this, that your power to doe good should bee answerable to your will.</p>
   <p>Yea, it may be iustly thought, that your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would teach men to take the measure of your greatnesse, by your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; of so euen a length and equall pace are they. And indeed so it must be, for should Honour out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne Honestie, it would hardly bee ouertaken.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>But I must remember to whom I speake, euen to such a one as careth not for long salutations in the Markets: I haue done when I haue once againe craued pardon for my boldnesse, and humbly requested at your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours hands (whose goodnesse hath not wont to magnifie it selfe more in giuing, than in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing such like holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents) acceptation and countenance to what is here offered by a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart.</p>
   <p>As for the Matter here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in handled, I will not feare to say it deserues it: And for the Manner I must say it needs it; whatsoeuer it bee, bee it not as it should be, yet my will wisheth it to be well; but as it is</p>
   <p>
      <hi>I humbly betake it to your Honours fouourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: And so your Honour to the protection of the Highest.</hi>
   </p>

      <signed>Your Honours humbly and officiously deuoted in all dutie, NEHEMIAH ROGERS.</signed>
