   <head>TO THE HONOVRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sir THOMAS FLEMMING <hi>Knight, Lord Chiefe Iustice</hi> of England</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>The same reason which first incited mee to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this taske, hath beene a principall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue likewise, embolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me to offer it vnto your Lordships view, and to presume to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish this discourse, vnder the protection of your Lordships name. The matter heerein handled is a notable &amp; famous controuersie, arising between the ancient and renowned Vniuersity of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the new and infamous, yet cunning and powerfull sect of the Iesuits, referred vnto the determination of Law &amp; Iustice, and vpon the pleadings formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and iudicially argued and discussed: the Actor a man of Law, a learned and famous Aduocate, as this his elaborate Argument doth sufficiently te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie; and by a learned Doctor and Rector of the
<pb facs="3"/>Vniuersity of <hi>Paris,</hi> stiled <hi>os Themidis, fori deliciae.</hi> The persons and place, before whom, and where it was represented; the Presidents and Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, in that great Court Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> the sterne and guide of the Common-wealth and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of <hi>France,</hi> the iustice and authority whereof amidst the cruell rage and tempests of ciuill wars, as a firme anchor vpheld and preserued the same, from most apparent shipwracke. As then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accounted, I trust, superfluous and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent in me, whose studie is conuersant in the Lawes of this Kingdom, to intermeddle with that which is within the compasse of my profession, and to ioine the view of the Lawes &amp; customes of other Nations, and their manner of proceeding with those of our owne, since that all humane Lawes haue but one soule, which is reason; &amp; one onlie function, which is the peace and quiet of Estates and Common-wealths: So I hope it will not be deemed presumption or rashnesse, in that I present it vnto your Lordship, who worthily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideth in a supreme Court of Iustice, not inferiour vnto that of <hi>Paris,</hi> in regard either of antiquity or Maiestie, the <hi>Basis</hi> and pillar of this great Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, the firme supporter of the roiall Crowne and dignity. To you (my Lord) who in regard of the place, to which your worth, learning, piety, &amp; eminent virtues haue iustly aduanced you, do bear that honorable stile of <hi>Lord Chiefe Iustice;</hi> a most significant title, denoting the speciall charge and interest wich is committed vnto your Lorship in the execution of Iustice, which you most sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="3"/>wisely, and religiously, doe exercise, with all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity &amp; moderation: to you who by reason here of, are of the Law and professors thereof <hi>Deus tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telaris,</hi> a Patron and Protector; and therefore what our industry can effect, is but a smal acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; retribution, of duty to be offered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated vnto you. Besides, the subiect of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, is chiefely against that new excesse of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, and King-daring doctrine of the Iesuites; which like a contagious disease, hath infected all the quarters of <hi>Europe,</hi> bred strange combustions in Estates, and bene the cause of most desperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; against the venimous poison whereof, there is not a more forcible preseruatiue, then the seuerity of your Iustice; nor hath there bene euer any stronger bulwarke &amp; defence of the sacred au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority &amp; persons of our Kings, in all times and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, then the common Lawes of this Land, &amp; Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Realme, of the which your Lordship is the Chiefe-gardian, and by due execution doe addelife &amp; soule vnto them. These reasons (my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Lord) haue moued me, though with the discouery of mine owne imperfections, to hazard these first &amp; vntimely fruites of my idle houres on your Lordships fauourable acceptance; wherein I shall haue receiued full content, my desire &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, beeing only to yeeld vnto your Lordship, an humble acknowledgement of that reuerent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and due respect I owe vnto you, and to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that I am,</p>
