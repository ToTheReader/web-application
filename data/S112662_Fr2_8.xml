                 <title>An exposition of the lawes of Moses : Viz. Morall. Ceremoniall. Iudiciall. The second volume. Containing an explanation of diverse questions and positions for the right understanding thereof. Wherein also are opened divers ancient rites &amp; customes of the Iewes, and also o the Gentiles, as they haue relation to the Iewish. Together with an explication of sundry difficult texts of Scripture, which depend upon, or belong unto every one of the Commandements, as also upon the ceremoniall and iudiciall lawes. Which texts are set downe in the tables before each particular booke. All which are cleered out of the originall languages, the Hebrew and Greeke, and out of the distinctions of the schoolemen and cases of the casuists.

   <p>Pag. 171, the Lord gave his people the morall Law and the ceremonies; and the Gospell; when the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law was given, it derogated nothing from the morall Law, there was nothing abrogated or changed in the first Law, or subrogated in place of the morall Law, but when the Gospel came in, the ceremonies were abrogated, <hi>et superinducta est spes melior.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Pag. 137, 35.</p>
   <p>Some Lawes are naturall and ceremoniall, some are judiciall and ceremoniall, and some are meere cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall; naturall and ceremoniall, where the ground of the Law is naturall, and the ceremony annexed, the ceremony being taken away the naturall part may stand. Example, the father was bound to give his sonne a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble portion, because he was his strength, and because he was a type of Christ; take away the type, the morall part standeth. So where the Law is Iudiciall and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall. Example, Cities of refuge were appointed to save the mankiller, and he was to abide there untill the death of the Highpriest; take away this ceremony, and Cities of refuge may remaine. Thirdly, where the law is ceremoniall and Iudiciall, a Magistrate cannot make the ceremoniall part, a part of the Iudiciall; Example, this was a judiciall and ceremoniall Law, that the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor should be hanged upon a tree, and that he should be cut downe before the night, because he defiled the land, a magistrate may cause hang a theefe now, but he cannot cause hang him as accursed or not suffer him to hang all night, because he defiled the Land.</p>
