      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a principall part of that Christian care which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to soueraigntie, to endeauour by all meanes possible, aswell to beget as to increase among their people the knowledge and pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ise of all Artes and Trades, whereby they may be both wained from idlenesse &amp; the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities therof, which are infinite, and exercised in such industries and labours, as are accompai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with euident hopes, not onely of preseruing people from the shame and greefe of penuire, but also of raysing and increasing them in wealth and aboundance, The scope which euerie free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne spirit aymeth at, not in regard of himselfe onely and the ease which a plentiful estate bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to euerie one in his particuler, but also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the honor of their natiue country, whose
<pb facs="4"/>commendations is no waie more set foorth then in the peoples actiuenes and industrie. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration whereof hauing of late occupied our minde, who alwaies esteeme our peoples good our necessarie contemplations, we haue cōceiued as well by the discourse of our owne reason, as by information, gathered from others, that the making of silke might as well be effected heere as it is in the kingdome of France, where the same hath of late yeares beene put in practise: For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the clymate of this Ile so far distinct or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in condition from that countrie, especially frō the hither parts therof, but that it is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that those things which by industry prosper there, may by like industrie vsed heere haue like successe: and many priuate persons who for their pleasure haue bred of those wormes, haue found no experience to the contrarie, but that they may be nourished and maintained heere if prouision were made for planting of Mulberie trees, whose leaues are the food of the Wormes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee haue thought good hereby to let you vnderstand, that although in suffering this inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to take place, we doe shew our selues some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what an aduersary to our profit, which in the matter of our Customes for silk brought from beyond the Seas, will receiue some deminution: Neuerthelesse, when there is question of so great and publique vtilitie to come to our kingdome
<pb facs="4"/>and subiects in generall, and whereby (besides multitudes of people of both sexes and all ages) such as in regard of impotencie are vnfitte for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther labour, may bee set on worke, comforted and releeued; We are content that our priuate benefit shall giue way to the publique, and therefore beeing perswaded that no well affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Subiect will refuse to put his helping hand to such a work as can haue no other priuate end in vs, but the desire of the wel-fare of our people, we haue thought good in this forme onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you (as a person of greatest authoritie within that Countie) and from whome the generalitie may receiue notice of our pleasure (with more conueniencie them otherwise) to take occasion either at the quarter Sessions, or at some other publique place of meeting, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade and require such as are of abilitie (without discending to trouble the poore, for whome we seeke to prouide) to buye and distribute in that Countie, the number of ten thousand Mulberie plants, which shal be deliuered vnto them at our Cittie of &amp;c, at the rate of three farthinges the Plant; or at sixe shillings the hundred, containing fiue-score plants. And because the buying of the said Plants at this rate, may at first seeme charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our said subjects, (whome we would bee loath to burthen) wee haue taken order, that in March or Aprill next, there shall be deliuered at
<pb facs="5"/>the saide place a good quantitie of Mulberie-seedes, there to be sold to such as will buy them, By meanes whereof the said plants will bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered at a smaller rate them they can be afforded being caried from hence: hauing resolued also in the meane time that there shall bee published in print a plaine Instruction and direction, both for the encreasing of the saide Mulberie-trees, the breeding of the Silke-worms, &amp; all other thinges needefull to be vnderstood, for the perfecting of a work euery way so cōmendable &amp; profitable as wel to the planter as to those that shal vse the trade; Hauing now made knowne vnto you the motiues as they stād, with the publik good, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in euerie man is interessed, because wee knowe how much the example of our owne Deputie-Lieuetenants and Iustices, wil further this cause, if you and other your neighbours wil be content to take some good quātities hereof, to distribute vpon your owne landes: wee are content to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thus much more in this direction of ours, that all thinges of this nature tending to plantations, increase of Science, and works of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie, are thinges so naturally pleasing to our owne disposition, as wee shall take it for an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of extraordinarie affection towards our person, besides, the iudgement we shall make of the good dispositions in all those that shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse in any kinde their ready mindes, to further
<pb facs="5"/>the same, And shal esteeme that in furthering the same, they seeke to further our honour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, who hauing seene in few yeares space past, that our Brother the French King hath since his comming to that Crowne, both begun and brought to perfection the making of Silkes in his countrie, whereby he hath wonne to himself ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to his subiects a meruailous increase of wealth, would account it no little happines to vs, if the same worke which wee begun among our people with no lesse zeale to their good (then any Prince can haue to the good of theirs) might in our time produce the fruits which there it hath done; wherof we nothing doubt if ours will be found as tractable and apt to further their owne good, now the way is shewed them by vs their Soueraigne, As these of France haue bene to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themselues to the directions of their King.</p>
