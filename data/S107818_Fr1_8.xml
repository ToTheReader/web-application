we knowe the sweete sauour of the Gospell, is, and shall be death to the sonnes of perdition, but we haue chiefe respect to our weake and infirme brethren, to whome we woulde communicate the bottome of our hearts, lest that they be troubled or carried awaie by diuersitie of rumours, which Satan spreads abroad against vs, to the defacing of this our moste godlie enterprise: protesting that if anie man shall note in this our confession, anie article or sentence repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Gods holie worde, and doe admonish vs of the same in writing, we by Gods grace doe promise vnto him satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the mouth of God, that is, from his holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or else reformation of that, which he shall prooue to be amisse.</p>
   <p>For God we take to record in our consciences, that from our hearts we abhorre all sectes of heresie, and all teachers of erronious doctrine, and that with all humilitie wee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the puritie of Christes Gospell, which is the onelie foode of our soules, and therefore so precious vnto vs, that we are determined to suffer the extremitie of worldlie daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, rather then that we will suffer our selues to be defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the same: for hereof we are moste certainlie perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that whosoeuer denieth Christ Iesus, or is ashamed of him in the presence of men, shall be denied before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and before his holie angels.

Not that we thinke that one pollicie and one order in ceremonies can be appointed for all ages, times, and places: for as ceremonies, such as men haue deuised, are but temporall, so maie and ought they to be changed, when they rather suffer superstition, then that they edifie the Church vsing the same.</p>

      <p>AS the fathers vnder the law besides the veritie of the sacrifices, had two cheefe Sacramentes, to wit, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and the Passeouer, the despisers and contemners whereof, were not reputed for Gods people: so we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confesse, that we now in the time of the Gospell haue two chiefe Sacraments onelie, instituted by the Lord Iesus, and commaunded to be vsed of all those, that will be reputed members of his bodie, to wit, Baptisme, and the Supper or table of the Lord Iesus, called the communion of his bodie and his bloode. And these Sacramentes as well of the olde, as of the new Testament, now instituted of god, not onelie to make a visible difference betwixt his people &amp; those that were without his league, but also to exercise the faith of his children, and by participation of the same Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes to seale in their heartes the assurance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and of that most blessed coniunction, vnion, and socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which the elect haue with their heade Christ Iesus. And thus we vtterlie damne the vanitie of those, that affirme sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes to be nothing else but naked and bare signes. No,
<pb n="21" facs="30"/>
we assuredlie beleeue, that by baptisme we are ingrafted in Christ Iesus, to be made partakers of his iustice, by which our sins are couered, and remitted. And also that in the Supper rightlie vsed, Christ Iesus is so ioyned with vs, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the verie nourishment &amp; food of our soules.

         </gap>de vpon the bodie and bloode of Christ Iesus, which was once broken and shed for vs, which now is in heauen, and appeareth in the presence of his father for vs: and notwithstanding the farre distance of place, which is betwixt his bodie now glorified in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and vs now mortall in this earth▪ yet we must assuredlie beleeue, that the breade which we breake is the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs body, and the cup which we blesse, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his bloode, so that we confesse and vndoubtedlie beleeue, that the faithfull in the right vse of the Lords table, doe so eate the bodie and drinke the bloode of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, that he remaineth in them, and they in him. Yea they are so made flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones, that as the eternall Godheade giueth to the flesh of Christ Iesus (which of the owne condition and nature was mortall and corruptible) life and immortalitie, so doeth Christ Iesus his his flesh and bloode eaten and drunken by vs, giue vnto vs the same prerogatiues. Which albeit we confesse are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giuen vnto vs at this time onelie, neither yet by the proper power and vertue of the Sacrament onelie, yet we affirme, that the faithfull, in the right vse of the Lordes table, haue such coniunction with Christ Iesus, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man cannot apprehend: yea, and further we affirme, that albeit the faithfull oppressed by negligence, and manly infirmitie, doe not profit so much as they would, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie instant action of the Supper, yet shall it after bring fruite forth, as liuelie seede sowne in good ground. For the holie spirit, which can neuer be deuided from the right instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of the Lord Iesus, will not frustrate the faithfull of the fruite of that mysticall action: but all this we saie commeth of true faith which apprehendeth Christ Iesus, who onelie maketh his Sacraments effectuall vnto vs. And therefore whosoeuer slaundereth vs, as that we affirme or beleeue Sacraments to be onely naked and bare signes, doeth iniury vnto vs, and speaketh against the manifest trueth. But this liberallie and frankelie we confesse, that we make distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt Christ Iesus, in his eternal substance, and betwixt the elementes, in the sacramentall signes. So that we will neither worship the signes, in place of that which is signified by them, neither yet do we despise, &amp; interpret them as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and vaine, but doe vse them with all reuerence, examining our selues diligentlie before that so we doe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee are assured by the mouth of the Apostle, that such as eate of that bread, &amp; drinke of that cup vnworthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, are guiltie of the bodie and of the bloode of Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus▪</p>

      <p>THat sacraments be rightlie ministred, we iudge two thinges requisite: the one, that they be ministred by lawful ministers, whome we affirme to be onely they, that are appointed to the preaching of the word, into whose mouthes, God hath put some sermon of exhortation, they being men lawfullie chosen there to by some Church. The other that they be ministred in such elements, and in such sort, as God hath appointed: else we affirme that they cease to be right sacraments of Christ Iesus.

         </gap> the societie with the papisticall Church, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of their sacraments, first, because their ministers are no ministers of Christ Iesus (yea, this is more horrible, they suffer women, whome the holie Ghost will not suffer to teach in the congregation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>o baptize:) and secondlie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue so adulterated both the one sacrament, and the other, with their owne inuentions, that no parte of Christes action abideth in the originall puritie. For oile, salte, spattle, and such like in baptisme, are but mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions: adoration, veneration, bearing through streetes
<pb n="23" facs="31"/>
and townes, &amp; keeping of bread in boxes or boists, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of Christes sacraments, and no vse of the same. For Christ Iesus saide, <hi>Take eate, &amp;c. Doe you this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance of me.</hi> By which words and charge, he sanctitied bread and wine to be the Sacrament of his holy body and bloode, to the end that the one should be eaten, and that all should drinke of the other, and not that they should be kept, to be worshipped and honoured as God, as the Papists haue done heretofore: who also haue committed sacriledge, stealing from the people the one part of the sacrament, to wit, the blessed cup. Moreouer that the sacraments be rightlie vsed, it is required, that the end &amp; cause for which sacraments were instituted, be vnderstanded, and obserued, as well of the Minister, as by the receiuers. For if the opinion be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the receiuer, the right vse ceaseth, which is most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by the reiection of the sacrifices: as also if the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er plainlie teach false doctrine, which were odious and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable before God (albeit they were his own ordinance) because the wicked men vse them to another end, then God hath ordained. The same we affirme of the Sacraments in the Papistical Church, in which we affirme the wholl action of the Lord Iesus to be adultered, as well in the externall forme, as in the end and opinion.
