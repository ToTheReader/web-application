   <head>THE PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O many Dictionaries of Latin and English (gentle Reader) haue now béene of late by diuers sundrye writers set forth, that except some kind of Noueltie should bring delite to the peruser, and some present profite also giue hope and courage to the same, it should be but a vaine thing, and counted but as lost laboure, in so common a kind, and in so familiar a matter, to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume againe, &amp; to begin a new, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> thing so often preuēted. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thought it good &amp; expedient, at the beginning briefly to let thée know and vnderstand what and how many commodities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides other dictionaries, seeme to be contained in the compendious compasse of this little booke, that thy hope may be certaine. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering therefore, that whereas he that writeth, meaneth euer to pleasure some body, or to profit many: and yet so that he may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the best, and helpe them that haue most neede, and seeing that the same thing then also commeth commonly to passe, when in the least charges and paines, most profit &amp; pleasure redoundeth to the perusers, therefore two things be here to be considered: first that the quantitie is small, so that the price being little the poorer sorte may be able to bie it: the other, that in the qualitie &amp; fourme of the little quantitie, as it is deuised, be moe commodities, (than in the common sort be founde) to be receiued: as for the quantitie, than séest what it is, certainely (as I call it) <hi>Manipulum,</hi> so it is but an handfull: but as for the qualitie wherein the vertue is conteined, mo peraduenture than thou wouldest easly thinke to be in so little a booke that is hid from thée: what (sayest thou) &amp; how many? surely these. First y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> for the pleasantnesse of the metre, delectable &amp; pleasant to reade (as it is in other tongs) both the wits be delited and comforted, and the memorie also is nouryshed and confirmed, so that a learned friend, being consulted concerning the edition hereof, said that it would not onely helpe them that were willing to learne, but also which is most necessarie in the negligent &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing youth, it would excitate &amp; stir them vp, so that they would be willing to reade and to learne of them selues. Secondly wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb facs="2"/>it foloweth the alphabet of the order of the last sillible (for ther is an alphabet well nigh as easie to be followed of the last sillable as of the first) it commeth to passe, that when al the simple and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoūded words be recited, and so many also of the compounds and Deriuatiues as we thinke necessary and conuenient, all the other, whether they be of Substantiues and Adiectines out of Verbes, or they be of Substātiues &amp; Aduerbes out of Adiectiues, or they be of Adiectiues out of Substantiues, or fynally of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiues out of Substantiues, &amp; of Adiectiues out of Adiectiues, and so forth of the rest, all the same I say by the rule of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, in whiche the Art of Deriuing and Compounding for the most parte both consist, wherein also the chiefe pointes of our Grammer, where vnto the amplification &amp; variation of our tong doth also properly belong, be here in many diuerse precepts, as their places require, set forth &amp; considered. Thirdly, it is necessarie for makers of meeter, so that it seemeth not only to redy him that maketh, but also to giue him the way to learne the arte of the same. Fourthly, wheras the chiefe grace and facilitie of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe tong, doth cheefly consist in long sillable and short, and in the true pronouncing &amp; writing of the same, and namely in the end of words, whervnto we haue most respect in this little worke, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it commeth to passe, that as wel children and ruder schoolers, as also the Barbarous countries and ruder writers, may not a little (if they wil enioy the offered occasion) well and easely correct and amend, both their pen and speache. Fynally, wheras in the Polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillables, by diuersitie of pronunciation, and voyce of great accent, oftentimes one worde maye haue diuers significations, as, <hi>differ, differre, id est, prolongare:</hi> and <hi>differ, differre, id est, discrepare,</hi> and such other, we haue cōmonly set the accent, which is onely acute, in that place, and ouer that vowell, where the sillable must go vp &amp; be long. And so in conclusion, whatsoeuer belongeth to the three chéefe poynts of Grammer, or Orthógraphie, Etimologie, &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sodie, there is little here omitted, that in suche a worke can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: wherfore if thou be minded to peruse this little booke, in consideration of these commodities that we haue described: then for thy better instruction in the order and vse of the same, peruse
<pb facs="3"/>first these articles and notes following, and so procéed to thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and profit. Amen.</p>
