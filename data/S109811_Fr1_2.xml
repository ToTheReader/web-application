of almyghty god / it is to be drade / leest for mercy that is euery where redy for hym that calleth / he proue the sore and rigorous iustice of god. Nowe let vs se whither it be more expediēt for a mannis saluaciō, either by iustice to be feared from synne, or by mercy to be enticed bothe to loue and to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Iustyce with her sore thretnynges cōpelleth a mā to flee vice / and engēdreth in hym a certayn bōdly feare / that it is an odious thyng vnto hym to cōmit synne / nat for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hate it selfe of sinne, but for feare of punishemēt. Mercy cōtrary to it put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before a mannes face the vnspekable loue of god towarde hym, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whiche so loued him, that he dyd nat spare his onely sonne for his sake / the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible benefites / the infinite desire of his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion / the continuall callyng vpon hym to brynge hym to the euerlastyng blysse. Of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> other side she sheweth hym as if it were in a glasse / the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and feblenes of a man / the perilles that he is compassed about with, the calamites, the miseri, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wretchednes that on euery side do vtterly hym wrappe, and that in so many mischeues, there co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth no succour but fro the mercy of god / do nat all these engēdre in hym a certaine childyshe loue towarde his father / that he wyl performe his cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemētes / nat for feare of punishement / nor for loue of rewarde, but for bicause it pleaseth his most louyng father? And that he accompted this a very great rewarde to do the thyng that dothe lyke suche a good father. And where as it is sayd that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> feare of our lorde is the beginnyng of wise<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome / 
<pb facs="4"/>
though the same feare somwhat cōcerneth the drede of iustice / yet I reken that it is nat to be taken for that bondly feare y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> maketh vs to drede the sore punyshemētes, but for that that maketh vs to loke about / that we do nothyng that shulde displease our most louyng father, orels feare with out loue longeth to a cruel tyrant / that careth nat for the peoples hatred, so they feare him / and nat to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> most mercifull lorde &amp; father of vs all / whose loue towarde mankynde neither with minde can be comprehended nor with wordes any thyng ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. The whiche seynge that he loueth vs so moche, and that all our helpe and soccour cometh from hym / let vs set al our trust and confidence in hym, withdrawyng al our trust and our hope frō al mortal thynges / &amp; from al mortal mē. Yf we be in nede / let vs cal vpō him, he is benigne / he is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral / he gyueth gladlier than other do take / if so y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> we make hym nat a nygarde in askyng of smal thȳges &amp; vnworthy of hym to be gyuē. If we be in synne let vs cal vpō his mercy / being sory &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentāt. Whan so euer a synner is truely repētant he forgyueth al maner of synne. Here amōge mē they y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> do forgyue syn haue nat al an egall power: som cases be reserued to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> pope / &amp; of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> popes him selle power som do put a great dout: but god him selfe is he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> hath rule both in heuē &amp; in erth, there is no dout y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> of his autorite &amp; power can be made. If we desyre to come to the euerlastyng felicite / &amp; eschewe the feareful peynes of hell / let vs beseche his mercy to kepe vs frō sinne / &amp; gyue vs strēgth
