      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas some of my Brethren in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> and some of my Aduersaries in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> expect of me an Answere vnto mine owne Booke of <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> and <hi>Prayer for the dead</hi> (sometimes published by mee in forreine parts) I assure them both, that I had made a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of sundry notes for this intent, and that they were growing into the proportion of a Book, had not the necessitie of publishing this Discourse so soone, preuented my desire in the other; which yet may follow in due time, if it shall please God to grant me better health of bodie (the state of it being much attenuated by infirmities) with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of such helpes, as are requisite for them, that enter vpon this controuersiall kind: for want of which necessary meanes (together with my bad health) in the priuate, and rusticane course of my life, I may be compelled to desist wholy from the same; contenting my selfe hereafter with the exercise of my Pastorall Office in that little Congregation, which it hath pleased GOD to commit vnto my charge. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
