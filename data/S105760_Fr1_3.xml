   <p>It hath beene the policie vniversall, from the creation of the World vnto this time, of all civile States, the replenishing of the World with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of their owne subjects. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eva</hi> did first beginne this pleasant worke to plant the Earth to succeeding posteritie. <hi>Noah,</hi> and his familie began againe the second plantation. And the confusion of tongues at <hi>Babel,</hi> made division of States, scattering as manie Colonies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the face of the Earth after the Flood, as there was diversitie of Languages: and their seede as it still increased, hath still planted new Countries, one after another; and so the Worlde to that estate whereinto it is.</p>
   <p>That the planting of Countries, and civilizing barbar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>s and inhumane Nations, hath ever beene the worke of the greatest Princes of the Earth, their ever-living actions hath testified; wherewith are filled both the records of divine Trueth, and the monuments of humane state; and whose heroicke actions (wee
<pb facs="4"/>
must not thinke) hath beene vndertaken vpon triviall motives, when as by that they did aswell inlarge the limites of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and enriche the revenues of their estates; as bridle sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at home, and settle securitie against their enemies abroad.</p>
   <p>These preceeding praise-worthie Fathers, and their memorable of spring were diligent to plant, that yet vnplanted to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-livers; wherein shined those worthie Founders of the great Monarchies and their virtues: the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> the <hi>Lacedomoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Gothes, Graecians, Romanes,</hi> and the rest from time to time in their severall ages.</p>
   <p>But to leaue these remote times, let vs take a view within these 60. yeeres of the discoveries, and plantations in <hi>America,</hi> by the <hi>English,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Spainard,</hi> the <hi>Portugale</hi>; by whose industrious paines are made knowne vnto vs alreadie their, so hudge tracts, kingdomes, and territories, peopled and vnpeopled, as vpon the hither side for the space of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>000. leagues at the least, and for 3000. more on the backe side in the South Sea.</p>
   <p>Manie discourses of the discoueries which hath beene there ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected within these few yeeres are made of worthie Personages: such as <hi>Columbus, Cortez, Pitzora, Soto, Magellanes,</hi> and manie others, who to the wonder of all ages hath successivelie se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded one another in those partes.</p>
   <p>Whole Decads are filled with discoveries there, and volumes with their actions of plantation: There wee see the renowned <hi>Drake,</hi> and memorable <hi>Candisch</hi> twise about the round circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the whole Earth. <hi>Virginia</hi> to perpetrat the memorie of her honourable Knight <hi>S<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Walter Ralegh, Amadas, Arthur, Whyte, Grenuile,</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> her first discoverers, and worthie Governours in her plantations. <hi>S<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Iohn Haukins</hi> in his <hi>Guinea. Iohn de Verrazano</hi> a Florentine, <hi>Iohn Rinault, Rene Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doniere, Dominique Gourgues</hi> in their Florida. The noble <hi>Cortez,</hi> and the other Spainards, and Portugalls in their golden Mynes of the 15. Provinces of new <hi>Mexico, Nueua Gallicia, Nueua Hispanna, Nueua Biscaia, Cibola, Quivira,</hi> and to the Gulfe of <hi>California</hi> on the back side of <hi>America.</hi> The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

      <hi>Cabot, Frobisher, Davis,</hi> whose memories shall never die in the North-west parts: and many innumerable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> Worthies, whom all after-ages shall eternize for their vertues, whose actions I leave to bee searched as they are registred in the monuments of their praise-worthie proceedings.</p>
   <p>The shining brightnesse of these (<hi>Gentle Reader</hi>) and such others, hath so beamed a path way to all posteritie for imitation; as that the basest minde that is, may bee induced to follow their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steppes. And for my selfe, hauing from the source of that ever and over-flowing fountaine, that was still a running to all, from our late Soveraigne of never-dying memorie <hi>King IAMES</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Patent of <hi>Cape Briton,</hi> which now, by his Royall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is intituled <hi>New Galloway</hi> in <hi>America</hi>: I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to follow the troden way of these others, whose happie suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse are so plainlie seene in such honorable designes.</p>
   <p>And since I doe propone to my selfe the same ends, which are first for the glorie of my great and mightie GOD; next the service of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> my dread Soveraigne, and my native Countrie: and last the particular weale, and vtilitie of my selfe, and such as shall bee generouslie disposed adventurers with mee: Why shall it bee lawfull for others, and not for mee: and not as possible and as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for mee, as vnto others of my qualitie?</p>
   <p>The chiefe (then) and the farthest poynt that my intention shall seeke to arrive at; shall bee to remove that vnbeliefe, which is so grounded in the mindes of men, to discredite most noble and profitable endevoures with distrust: and first, to shake off their colourable pretences of ignorance, and then, if they will not be perswaded to make their selfe-willes inexcusable; I shall make manifest the worthinesse of the cause to the mindes of such as are desirous to bee settled in a certaintie. As for my selfe, I doe giue trust to the relations of such, whose wisdomes (I know) are not so shallow, as easilie bee deceiued of others; nor consciences so wretched, as by pretences to deceive others: and having the personall tryall of so honourable and sufficient reporters, our owne Countrie-men, this naked contemplation, and idle knowledge can
<pb facs="5"/>
not content mee: but knowing that the chiefe commendation of vertue consisteth in action, I haue resolved a practise, and to trace the footsteppes of those heroicke fore-runners, whose honourable actions shall ever live vpon Earth; whiles their Soules live in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the Heavens, and shall increase heere, and multiplie; as their bodies in the grave shall putrifie.</p>
   <p>The inducements which hath incouraged mee to this enterprise, and to spend my time, and best abilities in these adventures, I shall heere sette brieflie downe without any inlargment of made wordes, but in single speach, as best beseeming a simple meaning; Intreating thee (<hi>Courteous Reader</hi>) that thou would with an affectioned mind consider these my subsequent motives, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I haue beene induced my selfe: ponder aright my endes: and then but weigh my willing and free Offers, which I doe make for the weale and furtherance of so worthie a Worke. Wee are not borne to our selves; but to help each others, and our abilities and meanes are not much vnlike at the first houre of our birth, and the last minute of our death: and it is our deades good or bad that all of vs haue to carrie vs to Heaven or Hell after this life. While wee are therefore heere, let vs imitate the vertues, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Predecessours, that heereafter worthilie wee may bee remembred as their Successours,</p>
