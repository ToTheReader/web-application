   <head>To the Gentlemen Readers, <hi>Barnabie Riche</hi> Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>sendeth greeting.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, vnder rhese Cloudes of fained Histories (if it please you to prie with aduised insight) you maie find the Anotomy of wantō youth, seasoned with ouer late repētance: And amongst you that bee staied, good lessons to confirme your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. For other that are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the world, maie finde whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some counsaile to preuent inconuenience.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Simonides</hi> hath now imitated <hi>Sophocles</hi> the <hi>Tragedian,</hi> who accused before the Magistrates of dotage, repeated before thē his <hi>Tragedie</hi> of <hi>Oedipus Coloneus</hi> (whiche at that instaunt he had made) so that his accusers confounded in their owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerweanyng, departed with a shamefull repulse: So our Spanyard amōgst our curious Precizians condemned of lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiousnesse, now concludeth their opinions to bee corrupt, whiche accuse hym by onely reportyng this his true intent, whiche vrged hym to publishe his owne follies.</p>
   <p>It was first his will to warne the vnstaied by his fall, and to instruct the inconstaunt, to gather vp the fruites of experience, so as the after repentaunce might not make them loathsome. He was counsailed by the aduise of aged <hi>Aristo,</hi> yet refused it. He was admonished by the fall of <hi>Porcia,</hi> yet he continued vnconstaunt. What women were, <hi>Lamia</hi> taught hym. What Loue was, <hi>Titerus</hi> made triall: and neither the perswasion of a gallant Soldiour, nor the aduise of an auncient Father, neither
<pb facs="4"/> yet the sharpe inuectiues of his trauailyng companion <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio,</hi> were euer able to withhold hym, but he would needes prosecute his follie to the ende.</p>
   <p>These medicines opertunitie offered hym in his first tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, now what succeedeth in this volume, let the aduised Reader be Iudge. The ende is <hi>Simonides</hi> found women incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunt, the worlde vnstable, pleasure still vadyng, hope vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, expence remedilesse, lost tyme vnrecouerable, and with a teare concluded thus. Good Gentlemen, let my <hi>Cantharus</hi> layd in <hi>Balme,</hi> that is, my youthly follies seasoned with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce call you home. And since at <hi>Ciuill</hi> Ladies haue beene stained, I beseeche you remember this, that as the Climate can not alter the effect, so this mischeef maie as well raigne in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> as in <hi>Spayne,</hi> and therefore my counsaile is, that you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther content your selues with <hi>Clarindas</hi> first repulse, then in the end to become partaker of <hi>Simonides</hi> too late repentance.</p>
   <p>But now Gentlemen, for that I knowe very well, that my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes shall assone finde a <hi>Scipio Nascica</hi> to reprehende, as a <hi>Ʋi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius</hi> to commende, a disdainefull iudgement to mislike, as a fauourable opinion to alowe, I haue concluded with my self to laugh at <hi>Naeuius</hi> when he findes fault, and to iest at <hi>Boldu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> when he cauelleth: so turnyng the furie of their reportes on my person, I doubt not but to finde shoulders to beare the burthen of reproof. For you curteous Gentlemen, I doubt not but you will wincke at that you would not see, and laugh at that you best alowe of. And thus leauyng my Booke vnder the benefite of some blessed asspect, and to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of your friendly reportes I take my leaue.</p>
