      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had made an essay in your Family, of this manner of Catechising, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed you so well to approue thereof, as to desire a written Coppie to instruct your Houshold, I promised it: but for that some other haue also requested the like of mee, I thought it fit (being thereto also intreated) to publish it for the greater benefit.</p>
   <p>This is easily learned of any that can say the words of the common Catechisme, so much neglected. This bindeth the Learner strictly to the words of that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme, in answering to the Questions here propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: And serues more to direct the Master of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to make questions out of that Catechisme, then for other to learne to make answere thereunto, if they, can but say the words, except in some few places.</p>
   <p>This manner of questioning to draw answers from the words as they lie in order, may bee obserued not onely in Catechismes, but also in reading holy Scrp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as is not vnknowne to my people here at home, with good fruit.</p>
   <p>This my labour such as it is for the present, I present you with. For I acknowledge your good fauour towards
<pb facs="3"/> my sonne, and I am very thankfull in his behalfe, as he also himself is, being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>r ready vpon any occasion to expresse it to your selfe, as also to that worthy honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Knight, Sir. <hi>Walter Earle,</hi> at whose request it pleased you so fauourably and freely to bestow the liuing.</p>
   <p>I cannot but make mention of him, when I write of Catechising to you, for his more then ordinary religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care in the well trayning vp of his family this way. In all my dayes, among all my acquaintance I haue not seene the like: and I rather admire it, when I consider his daily imployment sundry waies otherwise in publik businesses, the least wherof doth commonly draw most men from almost alea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> of instructing their housholds. But what cannot a setled resolution, an industrous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a holy zeale, and a godly care to haue religion in honour, make a pious and deuoted heart to doe.</p>
   <p>Sir, I pray you accept this vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>aigned witnesse of my thankfulnesse, and a some little furtherance for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of your familie, vpon which I heartily wish a blessing from God the Author of all good; to whose gracious guidance, I commend you and all yours, and so in all due respectfulnesse I take my leaue.</p>
