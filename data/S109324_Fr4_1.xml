      <signed>IOHN HALLE CHIRVRGIEN,</signed>
      <salute>vnto the yonge studentes of Chirurgerie,
and to all the louing readers sendeth greting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyng
first with this sentence of
the diuyne phylosophier
Socrates.</salute>

   <epigraph>
      <q>
         <l>He that will seke, and knoweth not</l>
         <l>Howe muche in more or lesse,</l>
         <l>Can neuer tell whan he doth finde,</l>
         <l>An ayde for his distres.</l>
      </q>
   </epigraph>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Herfore Galen, the Prince of phisiciens, in
the .vi. boke of his therapeulike methode affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
that Chirurgiens being ignorant of the
Anatomie, may erre in many thinges, specially
in their incisions. For (sayth he) if they knew
what vnitie and combination the members of
the body haue one with an other, &amp; howe they
procede: If hurte happen vnto thē, thei might
perceiue whether the nerues, or other mēbers
hauing proper office or nedfull action be cut or
not: and so to iudge truly of their worke, and to be certeyne in theyr
incisions.</p>
   <p>To the confirmation of whiche sentence, <hi>Henricus de Ermunda
villa,</hi> compareth the chirurgien ignorant in Anatomy, to a blynde mā
whiche would hewe a pece of tymber: For as a blynd man, that hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on a logge, knoweth not howe muche he should hewe therof, nor in
what maner, (and therfore commonly erreth, in hewyng more or lesse
then he ought to doe:) so lykewyse doth the chyrurgien that worketh
on the body of mā, not knowing the Anatomy. And that it is of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
the chirurgien to knowe the Anatomie, the sayde Henry appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
by an euident argument: for euery workeman (sayeth he) should
knowe the subiect of his worke. But the subiect of chirurgerie is the
body of man, whiche therfore ought to be knowne of the chirurgien.
Whiche knowledge of mans body or any part therof, can no wayse be
attained but by Anatomie.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Anatome</hi> so called of the grecians is sayth <hi>Carolus Stephanus,</hi> the
dissection of man his body, by reason and iudgement, administred as
as well in the symple partes as in the cōpounde, to the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of them. For truly, the perfect knowledge of partes doth chiefly
consiste in indagacion or diligent exquisition, of substance, quantitie,
forme, number, situation and connexion.</p>
