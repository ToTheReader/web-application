      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing waded (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minded Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier) through the censures of many both Honourable and worshipfull, in cōmitting the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of my bookes to their honourable opinions, as I haue found some of them not onely honourably to patronize my workes, but curteouslie to passe ouer my vnskilfull presumption with silence, so generally I am indebted to all Gentlemen that with fauors haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slipt my follies: Follies I tearme them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their subiects haue bene superficiall, and their intents amorous, yet mixed with such morrall principles, that the precepts of vertue seemed to craue pardon for all
<pb facs="3"/>
those vaine opinions loue set downe in hir periods. Seeing then (worthie <hi>Maecen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letters) my workes haue beene counted follies, and follies the fruit of youth, many yeeres hauing bitten me with experience, and age growing on bidding mee <hi>Petere grauiora,</hi> to satisfie the hope of my friends, and to make the worlde priuie to my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate resolution, I haue made a booke cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my <hi>Farewell to Follies:</hi> wherein as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce loue for a foole, and vanitie as a vaine too vnfit for a Gentleman, so I disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the generall abuses that are ingrafted in the mindes of Courtiers and schollers, with a Colling Card of counsell, suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing those actions that straie from the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den meane of vertue. But (right worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) some are so peremptorie in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that if Diogenes stirre his stumpes, they will saie, it is to mocke dancers, not to be want on, that if the fox preach, tis to spie which is the fattest goose, not to be a ghost ly father, that if <hi>Greene</hi> write <hi>his Farewell to Follie,</hi> tis to blind the world with follie, the more to shadow his owne follie. My reply to these thought searchers is this, I cannot

Martinize, sweare by my faie in a pulpit, &amp; rap out gogs wounds in a tauerne, faine loue when I haue no charitie, or protest an open resolution of good, when I intend to be priuately ill, but in all publike protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions my wordes and my deedes iumpe in one simpathie, and my tongue and my thoughts are relatiues. But omitting these digressions (right worshipful) to my book, which as it is the farewell to my follies, so it is the last I meane euer to publish of such superficiall labours, which I haue aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to shroude vnder the shelter of your worshippes patronage, as vnder his wing, whose generall loue bought with honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deserts, may defend it from the iniurie of euerie enuious enemie. I can shadowe my presumption with no o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>her excuse but this, that seeking to finde ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap> some one courtier, whose vertuous actions had made him the hope of many honours, at whose feete I might laie downe the follies of my youth, &amp; bequeath to him all the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruits of my ensuing age, finding none that either fame could warrant me, or my own priuatfancie persvvade to be of more
<pb facs="4"/>
hope then your selfe, I set downe my rest, and ventured boldly on your worships fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, which if as I haue found before, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine now, I shall thinke my selfe as fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in getting so honorable a patrone for my new indeuours, as vnhappie for blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing my forepassed youth with such friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous labours. And thus hoping my honest resolution to do well, shal be countenanst with your worships curteous accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I commit you to the Almightic.</p>
