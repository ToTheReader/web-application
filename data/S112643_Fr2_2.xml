And surely, such a patterne was M.

I did know whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and partly how it pleased God by effectuall calling to turne his heart vnto the true knowledge, and o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bedience of the most holy Gospell of Christ our Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiour.

      </gap>awes, he went to Cambridge, to studie Diuinitie, where he heard D. Martin Bucer diligently, &amp; was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ight familiar &amp; dere vnto him. In this godly course <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e did by Gods blessing so profit, that that blessed Martyr, D. Ridley, then Bishop of London, did, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>t were, inuite him &amp; his godly companion M. Tho. Horton, to become fellowes of Penbrooke Hall in Cambridge: And afterwards, the said D. Ridley <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>alled our Bradford to London, gaue him a Prebēd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>n Paules Church, lodged him in his owne house <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>here, &amp; set him on work in preaching. And besides often preaching in London, &amp; at Paules Crosse, and sundry places in the country, and specially in Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, he preached before K. Ed. the 6. in the Lent, the last yere of his reigne, vpon the 2. Psalme; and there in one Sermon, shewing the tokens of Gods iudgement at hand, for the contempt of the Gospel, as that certaine Gentlemen, vpon the Sabboth day, going in a whirry to Paris Garden, to the Bearebay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb facs="19"/>
were drowned: &amp; that a dog was met at Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gáte, carying a piece of a dead child in his mouth: he with a mighty and propheticall spirit sayd, I sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon you all, euen euery mothers child of you, to the iudgement of God, for it is at hand; as it folowed shortly after, in the death of K. Edward. In which state and labour of preaching he continued, till the cruelty of the papists cut him off, so as thou mayst reade in the history of his life &amp; death, compiled by that faithful seruāt of the Lord Iesus, M. Iohn Foxe.</p>
   <p>In deed he had many pulbacks, but God still hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forward his chosen seruant, in that trade of life, to the which he had called him: in which he ranne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward so happily, that he did outrun me &amp; other his companions. For it pleased God, with great speed to make him ready and ripe to Martyrdome; in which through Christ he hath nowe gayned the crowne of life. But in all stops and stayes he was much helped forward by a continuall meditation, &amp; practise of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance &amp; faith in Christ; in which he was kept by Gods grace, notably exercised al the daies of his life. Euen in this meane time he heard a Sermon, which that notable preacher, M. Latimer, made before K. Edward the 6. in which he did earnestly speak of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutiō to be made of things falsly gotten: which did so strike Bradford to the heart, for one dash of a pen which he had made, without the knowledge of his master (as full often I haue heard him confesse with
<pb facs="19"/>
plenty of teares) being Clarke to the Treasurer of the Kings campe beyond the seas, and was to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the King, that he could neuer be quiet, til by the aduice of the same M. Latimer, a restitution was made. Which thing to bring to passe, he did willingly forbeare &amp; forgo all the priuate &amp; certaine patrimony which he had in earth. Let all bribers &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>olling Officers, which get to themselues great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in earth, by such slippery shifts, followe this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, least in taking a contrary course, they take a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ōtrary way, &amp; neuer come where Bradford now is.</p>
   <p>But besides this, our Bradford had his daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises and practises of repentance. His maner was to make to himself a Catalogue of al the grosest &amp; most enorme sinnes, which in his life of ignorance he had committed, and to lay the same before his eyes when he went to priuat praier, that by the sight &amp; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brāce of thē, he might be stirred vp to offer to God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>he sacrifice of a cōtrite heart, seeke assurance of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ation in Christ by faith, thanke God for his calling from the waies of wickednes▪ &amp; pray for increase of grace, to be conducted in holy life, acceptable and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>leasing to God. Such a cōtinual exercise of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nce he had in priuate prayer, that he did not count himselfe to haue prayed to his contentation, vnlesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n it he had felt inwardly some smiting of heart for sinne, &amp; some healing of that woūd by faith, feeling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>he sauing helth of Christ, with some chāge of mind
<pb facs="20"/>
into the detestation of sinne, and loue of obeying the good will of God. Which things doe require that inward entring into the secret parlour of our hearts, of which Christ speaketh, and is that smiting of the brest, which is noted in the Publican, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. &amp; is the same to the which the Psalmist exhorteth those men loose in sinne, <hi>Psa.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Tremble ye and sinne not: speak in your selues,</hi> that is, Enter into an accoūt with your selues, <hi>When you are on your couches,</hi> that is, whē ye are solitary &amp; alone. <hi>And be quiet, or silent</hi>: that is, Whē ye haue thus secretly, &amp; deeply considered of your case and dealing, ye shal cease to thinke, speak, and do wickedly. Without such an inward exercise of prayer, our Bradford did not pray to his ful cōten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as appeared by this: He vsed in the morning to go to the cōmon praier in the Colledge where he was, &amp; after that, he vsed to make some praier with his Pupils in his chāber. But not content with this, he then repaired to his own secret praier, &amp; exercise in praier by himselfe, as one that had not yet prayed to his own mind: for he was wōt to say to his famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, I haue praied with my Pupils, but I haue not yet prayed with my selfe. Let those secure mē marke this wel, which pray without touch of brest, as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see did; &amp; so that they haue said an ordinary prayer, or heare a cōmon course of praier, they thinke they haue prayed wel, &amp; as the terme is, they haue serued God wel, thogh they neuer feele sting for sin, tast of
<pb facs="20"/>
groning, or brokē heart, nor of the sweet sauing helth of Christ, thereby to be moued to offer the Sacrifice of thanksgiuing, nor chāge or renuing of mind, but as they came secure in sin, &amp; senselesse, so they doe depart without any chāge, or affecting of the heart; which is euē the cradle, in which Sathan rocketh the sinnes of this age asleepe, who thinke they do serue God in these cursory praiers, made only of custome, when their heart is as far from God, as was the heart of the Pharise. Let vs learne by Bradfords exāple, to pray better, that is, with the heart, &amp; not with the lips alone, <hi>Quia Deus non vocis, sed cordis auditor est,</hi> as Cyprian saith▪ that is, because God is the hearer of the heart, &amp; not of the voice: that is to say, not of the voice alone, without the heart, for that is but lip la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. This cōscience of sin, &amp; exercise in praier had Bradford, cleane contrary to that cursed custome of those gracelesse mē, which do ioy to make large and long accoūts of their leudnes, &amp; do glory therein; so feeding their delights with their liues passed, as the dog returneth to smell to his cast gorge, &amp; the horse to his doūg; such as the Prophet Esay 39. saith, <hi>They declare their sinnes as Sodom, they hide them not, wo be to their soules.</hi> It goeth with thē, as Ieremy 3.3. said, <hi>Thou hast a vvhores forehead: thou vvouldest not be ashamed.</hi> God giue these men better grace; else assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly they shall finde woe, woe, to their very soules.</p>
   <p>Another of his exercises was this: He vsed to make
<pb facs="21"/>
vnto himselfe an <hi>Ephemeris,</hi> or a <hi>Iournall,</hi> in which he vsed to write all such notable things, as either he did see or heare, ech day that passed. But whatsoeuer he did heare or see, he did so pen it, that a man might see in that booke, the signes of his smitten heart. For if he did heare or see any good in any man, by that sight he foūd and noted the want thereof in himself, and added a short praier, crauing mercy &amp; grace to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. If he did heare or see any plague, or misery, he noted it as a thing procured by his own sins, &amp; stil added, <hi>Domine, miserere mei,</hi> Lord, haue mercy vpō mee. He vsed in the same booke to note such euill thoghts as did rise in him; as of enuying the good of other men, thoghts of vnthankfulnes, of not cōside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God in his works, of hardnes &amp; vnsensiblenesse of heart, when he did see other moued and affected. And thus hee made to himselfe, and of himselfe, a booke of dayly practises of repenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>.</p>
   <p>Besides this, they which were familiar with him, might see how he, being in their cōpany, vsed to fall often into a sudden &amp; deep meditation, in which he would sit with fixed coūtenance &amp; spirit moued, yet speaking nothing a good space. And sometimes in his silent sitting, plenty of teares shuld trickle down his cheeks. Sometime he would sit in it, &amp; come out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>f it with a smiling coūtenance. Often times haue I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tten at dinner and supper with him, in the house of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>at godly harbourer of many preachers &amp; seruants
<pb facs="21"/>
of the Lord Iesus, I meane M. Elsyng, when eyther by occasion of talk had, or of some view of Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits present, or some inward cogitation &amp; thought of his owne, he hath fallen into these deepe cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; he would tell me in the end such discourses of them, that I did perceiue, that somtimes his teares trickled out of his eyes, as well for ioy as for sorrowe. Neyther was he onely such a practiser of repentance in himselfe, but a cōtinuall prouoker of others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, not only in publike preaching, but also in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate conference &amp; company: for in all companies where he did come, he would freely reproue any sin &amp; misbehauior which appeared in any person, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially swearers, filthy talkers, &amp; popish praters: such neuer departed out of his cōpany vnreproued; &amp; this he did with such a diuine grace &amp; Christian maiesty, that euer he stopped the mouthes of the gainsayers: for he spake with power; &amp; yet so sweetly, that they might see their euil to be euil, &amp; hurtfull vnto them, and vnderstand that it was good in deede, to the which he laboured to drawe them in God.</p>
   <p>To be short, as his life was, such was his death: His life was a practise, an example, &amp; prouocation to repentance. At his death, as the foresaid history wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, when he was burned in Smithfield, and the flames of fire did flye about his eares, his last speach publikely noted &amp; heard, was this, <hi>Repent, England.</hi> Thus was our Bradford a preacher, &amp; an example

of that repentance which hee did preach. Ionas preached to Niniue repentance; and all Niniue, the King, Princes, people, olde and young re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented. To England Bradford did preach, and yet doeth preach repentance: and surely England hath nowe much more cause to repent, then it had when Bradford liued, and preached repentance: for all states and sorts of persons in England, are now more corrupt, then they were then.</p>
   <p>Let therefore now Bradfords Sermon, his life, his death, moue thee, O England, to repent all thy peril: I wish &amp; warne, that as in Niniue, so in England, all from the highest to the lowest, do vnfainedly repent. They which are of the Court, they which are of the Church, they which are of the Citie, they which are of the Countrey, Princes, Prelates, and people: let all &amp; euery one repent &amp; depart frō that euill which he hath in hand, and turne wholy to the Lord. And I do humbly beseech thy Maiestie (O glorious Lord Iesus) which didst come to blesse Israel, turning eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them from their sinnes, to worke nowe by thy Spirit in our hearts, the same sound repentance, which thy Holinesse did preach to men, when thou saydest, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdome of God is at hand.</hi> This work in vs, O gracious God our Sauior. Amen.</p>
   <p>And now, Reader, I leaue thee to the reading and practising of that repentance, which Bradford here teacheth.</p>
