      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen our aduersaries perceiue them selues conuinced by the Scripture, they doe as they of whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> speake: they set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scripture it selfe: accusing it of obscuritie, ambiguitie and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, &amp; maintaining that the truth cannot therein be found, by such as bee ignorant of Tradition, and that the great mysteries of Faith were not by the Apostles committed to his disciples, but by word of mouth, and not by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: In a word all that the ancient Fathers recite of their gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers, we see now a daies practised by ours, who not content, with those olde reproaches, doe defame the scripture with many contumelies, calling it the booke of heretikes, the blacke Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, Incke-Diuinitie, leaden ruler, nose of waxe, <hi>Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> his buskin, the apple of discord, <hi>Sphynxes</hi> riddle, a sword in a mad-mans hand, and other like tearmes, full of iniuries and blaspemies, wherewith they defame the booke of the couenant and testament of the Sonne of God, which the auncients called the mirrour of diuine grace and mans miserie, the touchstone of truth, the displayer of vanitie, the Squire, Rule, and most exact ballance of all things, the treasure of all vertue, a Shop of remedies for all euils, the sacred Anker in time of tempest, a strong Armie against heretickes, a safe retrait against
<pb facs="3"/> all dangers, a happie rest after all trauailes, the sure and only stay in time of tryall, the Pillar and foundation of our faith: the most parte of which titles, and the efficacie of them all, is attributed by our aduersaries to their Traditions, vvhich some of them dare euen preferre and oppose vnto the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note place="margin">Lind. lib. 2 panopl. c. 5</note> Witnesse he vvho calleth it the true Moly conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Christian faith, against the Enchauntments of Heretickes, because Catholikes (saith he) vvould be soone, poysoned vvith these Enchauntments (he meaneth the Scriptures) if they did not vse the Moly or antidote of Traditions.</p>

      <note place="margin">Pigh. de Eccl. Hic. lib. 1. c. 4</note>Another hauing affirmed that the authoritie of Ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall tradition hath more force and efficacie to assure our faith in euerie controuersie, than the Scripture; addeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if those of his side would remember, that Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes ought not to be conuinced by the Scripture, their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vvould goe a great deale better vvith them: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing endeuored to ouercome <hi>Luther</hi> by the Scripture, for to make ostentation of their good vvitt and great knovvledge, all is come to naught &amp;c.</p>
   <p>Truly it is an horrible combustion in Christendome, to see the Scriptures, vvhich make vs knovv Christ and become christians, vsed so vnvvorthily. No nation euer tooke this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vnto themselues, to defame the bookes containing the lawes either of their beliefe or policie. The bookes of the Sybills, the lawes of the tvvelue Tables, and other like vvritings vvere held sacred among the <hi>Romanes.</hi> The <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> did beare all honour, to the lawes of their Legislators, and to their Rituall bookes, as to this day the Ievves doe to their Thalmud, and the <hi>Turkes</hi> to their Alcoran. But among those that would be called Christians, he that can cast most reproaches against the holy Scripture, he that can obserue or imagine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in most imperfections, vvill be esteemed more fine witted, and more zealous in the faith then others: yea, there hath beene found one, vvho of late hath dared by vvriting to maintaine &amp;

      </hi> Bishop of <hi>Eureux,</hi> and to fall into some dispute vvith him, concerning this matter, he confesseth vnto me, that the most parte of the articles in controuersie betvveene the Romish Church and ours, haue no demonstratiue proofe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: As the Sacrifice of the Masse, Inuocation on Saintes, Prayer for the dead, vvorshipping of Images, Auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, vnction vvith the Crisme, the necessitie of satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Popes Indulgences, &amp;c. But he alleadged, that from the time of the old Testament, the Ievves did beleeue also manie things, as necessarie to saluation, vvhich notvvithstād<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their times vvere not contained in the Scripture: In vvhich point I found him not to agree vvith manie great Doctors of his side, vvho confesse that the Scripture of the old Testament containeth all the God knevv to be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and sufficient for the saluation of the Israelites: but that it is not so in the doctrine of the nevv testament, vvhich (say they) should not be vvrittē on paper, but preached by word of mouth, engrauen in the hearts of the hearers, &amp; so comit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

And being certaine, that these articles haue no more ground in Scripture than the rest, we may well say of them which beleeue thē, that which <hi>Tertulliā</hi> said of some in his time, they beleeue without the scriptures, that they might beleeue against the scripture.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>Nowe the conference hauing dured certaine daies, and finding more illusion on his part than instruction, I prayed him to continue it by writing, that the obiections of the one, and the solutions of the other appearing on paper, euerie man might at leasure consider, the knot of the one and the keene cutting of the other, shewing him that more fruite would come forth of a permanent writing, than from dazel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and vanishing words, that the one remayned subiect to the touch and ballance, and that in the other, a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borned flatterer gaue, and the ignorant hearer tooke often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times false Alarmes: But I could neuer obtayne it at his handes, who well considered that if hee should gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in paper, what hee had scattered in the ayre, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions would appeare to bee more prestigious in the one, than they seeme to bee specious in the other, and that it would bee as harde a thing for him to vnwrappe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, from selfe-contradictions by the pen, as it is easie for him to dazell and entangle the ignorant by his tongue. Hee made account also, perhaps, that his cause being grounded on the Word vnwritten, it could not well be defended by the word written.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding hauing intelligence since, that hee had compiled a little writing on this subiect, in fauour of some whom hee was desirous to subuert: I haue taken paynes to get a Copie of it, to which I haue made this aunswere, which may serue in st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

   <p>But heere, not beeing required the applause of men, nor any tickeling conceipt of vanitie, I entreate the Readeer to ayme vvith mee in this vvriting at the glorie of God onely, and the manifestation of his truth, for the teaching vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
