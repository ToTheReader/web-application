   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>YR: Bookes that in times past were accounted the Noblest Tributes which could come to the hands of Vertue, are now either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so disfigured, or by ignorance so sleightly esteemed, that Goodnesse is halfe afraid to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before great men; yet I that know the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of your temper, euer readie to adorne any shadow of modest and good proportion, am bold, out of my best loue, to solicite you with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment, in which is matter worthy your eare, being indeed those absolute parts of Musicke which make perfect the harmony of a true Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. I doe not offer it as a disturber of your
<pb facs="3"/> more serious Meditations, but as an attendant, to wait the leasure of those good houres, when you shall vnbend your minde from the troubles of grauer busines, then to recreate and erect your spirits with the exercises of these wholesome and well-allowed pleasures. I need not runne into any glosse or commendations of their natures, since the vse and allowance thereof (being seldome or neuer accompanied without vertue) are Letters-Patents of such strength as no malice, or strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life can infrindge or make of lesse value then an ample goodnesse. What euer they are, yours they now are, and with them my selfe euer to be disposed by you.</p>
