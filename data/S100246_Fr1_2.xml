God)</hi> and that vsual, auncient, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
of such as publish to the world their
writings, to dedicate the same to some or
other personage, eminent in the Church
or Cōmon-weale. What others ofttimes
doe, more for fashion then occasion, for
fauour then neede, thereto am I moued and euen compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by some Necessitie; because handling an argument
somewhat rare (for fewe they be that haue laboured in the
like) and though verie profitable for the Church of God
at all times, and in these exceeding necessarie, yet not very
pleasing to such as either by too much couetousnes, or too
little consideration may be carried with vnequal censure to
condemne that they like not, or reiect without iust cause,
that they vnderstand not; I neede the Patronage of such a
one, as by his authoritie countenancing it, might shielde it
from iniurie, and by his iudgement approc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ing it, defend
it from enuie.</p>
   <p>And to this purpose, after I had pend this my <hi>Treatise of
the Maintenance of the Ministerie,</hi> bethinking with my
<pb facs="3"/>
selfe whom to I might offer it, vpon some necessarie &amp; iust
causes I resolued to dedicate the same aboue any vnto your
<hi>Lordship.</hi> First▪ in regard of the very subiect and nature of
of the worke it selfe: which being such, as wholly concerns
the <hi>Fabrique</hi> (as I may say) of the Church, whereof your
Lor: is a principall vpholder; and the estate of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in the Church, of which no small number doe labour
(if I may so speake) in your vineyard, seemeth properly to
require such a one to vndertake the protection thereof, as
by his calling and dignitie in the Church, rather then the
common-wealth, is enabled thervnto. And then in regard
of my selfe who haue heretofore employed the first and no
small part of my ministery within your Lordships iurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Diocesse; and now againe (by Gods special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidēce)
called back to finish my course within the same, doe
acknowledge it to bee my duety to respect aboue other, as
the vine vnder whose shadowe I rest, that Architect vnder
whom and by whom I am set on worke: and doe hope I
may bee bolde to haue recourse as a Soldiour to his owne
Captaine, or a seruant vnto his owne Lord, for the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing
of my labours, where my selfe am entertained.</p>
   <p>Touching the worke it selfe; The scope whervnto I haue
therein principally, &amp; in maner onely aimed, is to declare
how necessarie and conuenient it is, <hi>That the Ministers of
the word</hi> in all places, &amp; in each seuerall congregation <hi>should
bee prouided of due and competent maintenance.</hi> In explaining
whereof I haue haue shewed, by whom, by what meanes,
and in what sort, this maintenāce should be yeelded: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
against such as affect new fashions, and whom nothing
pleaseth but what is deformed by some innouation, I haue
made it apparant that the ancient and most vsuall practise
of our land in this case is agreeable to the word of God, &amp;
practize of the most auncient and best times. Such indeed
as can not iustly by anie pensionarie or other like confused
<pb facs="3"/>
and strange course be bettered and amended. Where our
practize doth digresse, as best thinges seeldome stand anie
long time without some corruption and declination from
their integritie, I haue <hi>in hope of some redresse</hi> partlie noted.
It is a thing too manifest, that the estate of our ministerie at
this day is not such, that we may affirme of it, <hi>That it is euery
where duely prouided for:</hi> &amp; that we that are therin <hi>haue no cause</hi>
for want of maintenance and necessaries for our life <hi>to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine.</hi>
But contrariwise, howsoeuer in many places it is,
yet (God be thanked) <hi>Such as it ought to bee:</hi> yet in not a few,
by reason that that course which God himself hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
equitie approued, and ancient practise confirmed, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted,
and not in anie measure there obserued, it is such
as becommeth not the Gospel of Christ: such as not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
hindereth the prosperitie thereof, in a word such as the
ministers themselues haue a iust cause to complaine of, all
reasonable men must acknowledge needes amendment; &amp;
it behoueth those that are in place and authority therevnto
gratiously, to heare, farther to consider of, and speedily and
duely to redresse.</p>
   <p>Which beeing a worke acceptable to God, needefull for
our Church, profitable and honorable for the whole land,
will (no doubt) the more be respected, and the sooner bee
effected, if it shall please your good Lordship, together with
the rest of your brethren (the most reuerend fathers of our
Church, looking according to the experience &amp; wisedome
that God hath inriched you withall, into the estate of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
distressed and impouerished churches within your Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions)
to open your mouthes in the cause of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and according to the power &amp; authority, which God
hath giuen you for the benefit &amp; edification of the church,
indeuour to repaire the ruines, &amp; make vp againe the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
thereof. Wherein you may doe great seruice to the
Ch: much further the Gospell, and become euen founders
<pb facs="4"/>
of manie churches within your seuerall Diocesses, which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ow (alas) through vnreasonable customes, cruell▪ and hard
compositions, beggerly stypends, small endowments, and
non payement of personall tithes, bee in manner desolate;
and doe pittie the hearts of all such as duly regard learning
and religion, truly loue &amp; respect the ministers of the word,
rightly know what becommeth the house of God, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>einedly
wish the prosperitie of our Zion, to see howe they
lie in the dust. You are the Pillers vpon whom wee doe
stay, the mountaines from whence we doe looke for helpe,
and the rockes vnder whose shadowes we trust to be assisted
and sheltred against the rage and violence of such extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
&amp; miseries as manie of your churches are subiect vnto.
And wee hope that the loue you beare to learning, the care
you haue of the people committed to your charges, the
zeale you carrie vnto the Church of God, and the respect
you haue to vs of the ministrie vnder you, of whom manie
(hauing not in this plenty and peace wherewith God hath
blessed Israel, wherewith <hi>parcè &amp; duriter</hi> to sustaine their
liues) are discouraged not encouraged, vnabled not ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to the worke they should performe, and made euen
wearie of their calling, <hi>will mooue you,</hi> after the Gospell it
selfe now throughly setled, and the sects and schismes of our
church now quieted, as louing fathers, to relieue what you
may, the externall wants of your children; &amp; as good Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
what lies in you to prouide for the due pay of all such
Souldiours as are vnder your hands: that henceforth none
of them (as cōmonly yet many are) bee inforced, as it were
starting out of the camp, to entangle themselues with the
affaires of this life; but attending wholly the seruice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they are prest, <hi>may please you</hi> that haue admitted them, but
chiefly <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> the high Bishop of our soules, &amp; <hi>Primate</hi>
of the whole church, that hath called them to be souldiors.</p>
   <p>To further, and (if I may presume so to speake) as it were
<pb facs="4"/>
to open a way to this so godly, so good and necessary work,
I haue, occasioned therevnto aboue manie, (and which I
might not with good consciēce not prosecute) as the poore
widow offered my mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e, and as a plaine, but a willing hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
workman bestowed a little labour. Which if your good
<hi>Lordship,</hi> approouing my sincere and religious purpose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
mine abilitie (which, knowing my selfe to be, as from
my heart I doe acknowledge the meanest of a thousand▪ &amp;
most vnable of many thousands to put my hand to so great
a work, and open my mouth in so weightie a cause, I freely
confesse is very small) <hi>vouchsafe</hi> in good part to accept; and
whatsoeuer my desert or handling of the cause bee, to <hi>affect
and fauour the cause it selfe,</hi> which for <hi>it selfes sake,</hi> deserueth
all furtherance; that so what I haue spoken in the behalfe
thereof, beeing defended from the peruerse iudgement of
the ignorant, and iniurie of all, others may bee moued of
their abundance to cast in richer gifts, and as God hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them, like vnto <hi>Bezaleel</hi> the sonne of <hi>Vri,</hi> and <hi>Ahol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

till I see it come from seed to fruit, and purchase both
the thanksgiuing of many to God for your readines to this
worke of the Lord, and the prayers of mee &amp; manie others
with me vnto the Almighty for his graces &amp; blessings both
spirituall &amp; temporall, to be continued and increased vpon
you. The Lorde Iesus vouchsafe vnto you his heauenly
gifts, and so guide you by his holy Spirit, that you may sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely

&amp; in the world to come be crowned by him with celestiall
