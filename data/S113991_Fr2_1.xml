   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Xperience, the Daughter of Time, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Travell, and the onely Iewell of a fewe the wiser, is commonly, good Reader, set out at so high a price, &amp; valewed at so deare a pennyworth, that shee hath ever more Cheapners, then Chapmen, more lookers on her, then likers of her: and yet is shee bought of some, although one dramme of her cost them a whole pound of Repentance. To descend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="8"/>particulars, were but to tye thee to a wearisome tale, and to leade thee along tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe a tedious Labyrinth, stuffed full of Examples of former ages: a matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready so open to the view of the whole world, that for me to stirre further therein, were but to set a lighted can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the bright Sunne. Onely for proofe, it may please thee (good Reader) to admit the Instance in my selfe. VVhen I began first to shake hands with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of delights, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayed Youth are commonly carryed away with: and looking backe, (as it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="9"/>my shoulder) saw the vast Sea of sugered miseries that I had waded through, I then beganne to thinke it high time to set downe a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Compasse to direct the remnant of the course that I haue yet to runne. And although at that time I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in my purse sufficient wealth to support my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in my bodie sufficient health to maintaine my life; and those both so reasonable, as might haue satisfied a reasonable man, (were not <hi>Natura hominum novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis avida</hi>) yet found I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such content in the one, nor the other, as might lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb facs="9"/>content mee to continue in that state. But drawne on a while by this instinct, or infection (I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to callit) I was driven at last by a greedy kinde of jealousie, to envie the store that I saw in others, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of mine owne penurie: and therewithall I fell into consideration how I might become one of the smal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those, whom the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test number wondred at. To enter the straight path that many the learned had happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perfectly troden, I saw it almost unpossible, unlesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure I should get mee
<pb facs="10"/>where the Muses dwell, to Oxford and Cambridge, and there putting my selfe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice seven yeares to the seven liberall Sciēces, might afterward become as long journeyman I cannot tell to whō: and in the end (as too many the learned doe) get I cannot tell what. This course yelded so course a liking, as I sooner passed over it, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: and casting about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with my selfe, I was combred with a hundred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther odde crochets, all as farre beyond the compasse of my reach, as they were short of the condition of my like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till at lengh in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
<pb facs="10"/>of this muse, <hi>I</hi> met in my mind with two such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as in my conceit were the only Paragons of the rest: the one gallant and gorgeous garnished with gold and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, bedect with jewels, sole Ladie and Governesse of all the rich Mines and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls that are in the bowels of the earth: the other sweet &amp; odoriferous, adorn'd with flowers and hearbs, beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with delicate spices, sole Lady and Regent of all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant things that grow vpon the face of the earth. These I vowed to serue and to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, euen to the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sse of life and limme: neyther haue I
<pb facs="11"/>greatly broken promise with them, though they haue not kept touch with me. Goodly and many golden mountains they promised me, Mary hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto haue seantly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any leaden mole-hills. But howsoever the bargaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand between them and me, I am neither disposed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them, nor excuse my selfe. Wee agreed vpon wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and I weare their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries: their Cognusance, such as it is, I beare where I am not ashamed to shew it: divers and sundry their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres haue they imployed mee in, in the which I haue saithfully, painfully, and
<pb facs="11"/>chargeably applied my selfe, and attained by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, (to mine owne destruction allmost) many their hidden secretes aswell in Mettals and Mineralls, as in Hearbs and Spices: part wherof I haue diligently col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected together, and for non-payment of my board wages at their hands, am forced to set them with the residue of my skill to sale, with offer vnto thee (good Reader) of preferment to the best things I have: yet at a farre easier price then they cost me, being no lesse my <hi>Summa sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum</hi> cast vp, and the foot of my account set down,
<pb facs="12"/>then the wasting out of my former health, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the little wealth I had. So that what experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences soever I haue digged out of hard stones, blowne out from hot fire, raked out from foule ashes, with great cost, and greater travaile, that hast thou heere in my Booke to see, and in my shop to vse with great ease at thy commandement.</p>
