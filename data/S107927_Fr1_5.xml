setting forthe of this booke, the vtilitie and profitte of the same, the

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>EING it is the dewtye of all Christians (beloued Reader) to
la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by all meanes, that they maye profytte and ayde their bretherne, and to
hyde or kepe secrete no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, whiche they knowe maye bring greate vtilitie
to the cōmō wealthe: I thought it my dewtie (hauing perceyued the greate
commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie whiche this booke bryngethe to the Reader of what state and
qualitie soeuer he be) to make thee and all others to whose knowledge it
shall come per takers thereof. But least thou thynke that thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and
payne shoulde be lost in reading of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, seyng so many bookes
goyng abrode vnder glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious names, hauing in deade lytle or no vtilitie, but
wrapped al together with innumerable difficulties: I shall in fewe wordes
shewe the, the matter contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this booke, the methode and forme of the
same, howe easye it is aboue all others to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, howe thou
shalt applye it to all artes and sciences, and shortlie that no arte or
science maye eyther be taught or learned perfectlie without the knowledge of
the same. As fore the matter whiche it containethe, thou shalt vnderstand
that there is nothing appartayning to dialectike eyther in Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles xvij.
booke of logike, in his eight bookes of Phisike, or in his xiiij. bookes of
Philosophie, in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero his bookes of Oratorie, or in Quintilian (in the 
<pb n="8" facs="5"/> which there is almost nothing that dothe not ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appartayne to the inuention of argumentes a disposition of the same, but
thou shalt fynde it shortlie and after a perfecte methode in this booke
declared. For thou shalt fynde no argument which is not eyther referred to
one of the nyne argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes artificial, or to the vnartificiall: no sort of
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position whiche dothe not appartayne eyther to the iudgement of the
proposition, sylogisme or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode. But thou wylt saye howe is it
possible that this lytle booke is able to containe all that, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the
forenamed bookes (beyng so manie) do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the entreate? In deede thou hast no
lytle occasion to maruell, but (hauing more deapely considered the matter)
I beleue thou shall not maruell so mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che. For in this booke there is thre
documents or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les kept, whiche in deede ought to be obserued in all artes
and sciences. The first is, that in setting forthe of an arte we gather
only togeather that which dothe appartayne to the Arte whiche we intreate of,
leau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all other Artes that which is proper to them, this rule (which maye
be called the rule of Iustice) thou shalt see here well obserued. For
here is all w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich dothe appartayne to logike, and nothing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Grammer,
Rethorike, Phisicke, nor any other arte. This is that documente which Apelles
many yeares agoe dyd signifie to vs, for when as the Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker reprehended
the shoo of Apelles image, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles tooke it in good parte, because it dyd
apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to the Shoomakers arte: but when passing his boundes he began
to fynde faulte whith the clothes also, Apelles sayde to hym, <hi>Nihil
Sutor vltra crepidam,</hi> which signifie the that the Shoomaker shoulde
kepe hym with in the boundes of his arte. And therfore <pb n="9" facs="5"/>
(beloued Reader) all those which eyther write or teache either diuinitie,
Phisicke, the lawe or any other thing do violate and breake this documente,
when they degresse from their purpose and do rayle vpon other thinges
nothing partayning therto. For howsoeuer they write or teache (so it be
from their purpose) it is to be had of no estimation. Is he not worthie to
be mocked of all men, that purpose the to wryte of Grammer, and in euery
other chapiter mynglethe somthing of Logicke, and some thing of Rethoricke:
and contrarie when he purpose the to write of Logicke dothe speake of
Grammer and of Rethoricke? that takethe a text to preache of fasting and
disputethe the most parte of his howre of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or swearing? that
promysethe to shewe me the causes and signes of the stone, and
tellethe me many tales pertainning to the gowte? that when he is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of
contractes or obligations, aunswerethe of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie or bondage? Or if the
Astrologian being asked of the eclips of the sonne, shoulde aunswere me
some thing concerning the motion of the star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res? And yet we see the
most parte of our learned mē bothe in their teaching and writing (to the
greate hurte and domage of youthe) most vnshamfullie do vse the same
which I would to god were amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The seconde document (which diligently is
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in this booke) is that all the rules and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptes of thine arte
be of necessitie tru, whiche A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle requirethe in the seconde booke
of his Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litikes and in diuerse chapiters in his former booke. Thou shalt
violate this document, whensoeuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest thy precepts in writing or
teaching, thou shalt myngle any false, ambiguous, or vncerteine thing: as
if in theaching me my logicke, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistethe <pb n="10" facs="6"/> in
rules to inuente argumentes, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone and iudge the same, thou
shouldest begyn to tell me some trickes of poysonable sophistrie:
and when thou shouldest teache me the worde of God truly, thou goest
aboute to deceaue me by tellyng me mans inuentions: and if thou shouldest
(being destitute of good arguments to proue thy matter) be lie some
aunciant writer to beguyle the rude and ignorant people, or forge some
Authors to colour thy knauerie which neuer was, or wrote at any time. I doubte
not (gentle Reader) but thou hast read of suche felowes: alwayes call thou
vpon god that it wyll please his heauenlie Maiestie to plante this our rule
of veritie in the hartes of all men, but most chieflie in the breastes of
the Pastors of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, who haue the charge and dispensation of his
holye worde. The third documente which thou shalt note herein obserued, is,
that thou intreate of thy rules which be generall generallye, and those
whiche be speciall speciallie, and at one tyme, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any vaine
repetitions, which dothe nothing but fyll vp the paper. For it is not
sufficient that thou kepe the rule of veritie and iustice, without thou
obserue also this documente of wisedome, to dispute of euery thing
according to his nature. Doe not entreate therfore generall matters
particulerly, nor particuler matters generally, for in so doing thou
playest the Sophistes parte, as Aristotle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chethe in the first booke
of his posteriors, and shalt be compelled to vse tautalogies and vaine
repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whiche thow knowest to be most pernicious to all artes and
sciences. For if I aske thee what is Lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gicke? and thou aunswerest, that
which teachethe to inuente argumentes, thou aunswerest trulye but 
<pb n="11" facs="6"/> not wyselie, because thou intrearest a generall thing
particulerlie: I aske the for the definition of the w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole arte, and thow
geuest me the definition of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, which is but a parte of the arte. And
cōtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, if I aske the what is inuention, and thou aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerest an arte
whiche teachethe to dispute well, surely thou aunswerest not wyselie,
for thou intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test a particuler thing generallie: I aske of thee, the
definition of a parte of the arte, and thou geuest me the definition of the
whole arte. Note well these thre rules in reading of thyne Authors: see, if

      </gap>lye, and the
particuler particulerlie, if not, take <pb n="12" facs="7"/> thy rule of
wysdome, and do according as the third documente teachethe thee: abolyshe
all tautalogies and vayne repetitions, and so thus muche being do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, thou
shalt cōprehende the rest into a litle rome. And this muche concerning the
matter intreated in this booke. The forme and methode which is kept in this
arte, comaundethe that the thing which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely most cleare, be
first placed: and secondly that which is next cleare, &amp; so forthe
whith the rest. And therfore it continually procedethe from the generall to
the speciall and singuler. The definition as most generall is first
placed, next folowethe the diuision, first into the partes, and next into
the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and kyndes. Euery parte and forme is defined in his owne place, and
made manifest by examples of auncient Authors, and last the members are
limited and ioined togeather with short transitions for the recreation of
the Reader. This is that only perfecte methode which Plato and Aristotle dyd
knowe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by many noble wryters, bothe Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Orators,
and Poetes, and now last (beyng sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by ignoraunce many yeres)
raysed as it were from deathe, by the most learned and Martyr to God,
<hi>Petrus Ramus,</hi> who hathe not only proued with stronge argumentes, but
in very deede set before our eyes that this perfecte methode maye be
accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to all artes &amp; sciences. What shall we saye then of
those, that in teaching and writing (to the greate hurte of the memorie)
dothe put as it were the tayle formest, hauing no regard how euerie thinge is
placed, but euen as it chaunsethe to come into their Mouthes, so lettethe
it go. Dyd euer Plato or Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle so? no in deede. But that thou mayest
a lytle the better perceyue the vtilitie of this arte, and howe 
<pb n="13" facs="7"/> farre the vse of it dothe extende, I wyll shortly
shewe thee howe thou shalt accommodate the same to all artes and
sciences, setting before thyne eyes one or two for an example. And first
what arte so euer thou purposest to intreate of, thou must come
garnyshed with thiese thre, Iustice, Veritie, &amp; Wysdome, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is sayde: and then if thou be a deuine this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode willethe thee that in
place of the definition, thou sett forthe shortly the sōme of the text,
whiche thou hast taken in hand to interprete: next to parte thy text into a
fewe heads that the auditor may the better retaine thy sayinges: Thirdly to
intreate of euery heade in his owne place with the ten places of inuention,
shewing them the causesi, theffectes, the adioints and circunstances: to
bring in thy compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with the rest of artificiall places: and last
to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke thy matter playne and manifest with familiar exā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples &amp;
aucthorities out of the worde of God: to sett before the auditor (as euery
heade shall geue the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion) the horrible and sharpe punyshing of
diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and the ioyfull promises appartayning to the obedient and
godlie. Yf thou be a Phisition and willing to teache (as for exāple) of a
feuer, this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode willethe thee to shewe first the definition, that is,
what a feuer is, next the deuisiō, declaring what sor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te of feuer it is,
whether the quartane, quotidian, hecticke, or what other: thirdly to come to
the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of inuention, and shewe fyrst the causes of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer euery
one in order, the efficient, as maye be hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te meates, the matter as
melancolie, choler, or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me rotten humor, and so forthe with the formale
causes and finall. The seconde place is theffecte, shewe then what the
feuer is able to bring forthe, whether deathe or no. The third place wishethe
thee <pb n="14" facs="8"/> to tell the subiecte of the feuer, whether it be in
the vaines, artiers, or els where. The fowrthe to shewe the signes and
tokens which appeare to pretende lyfe or deathe: and to be shorte, thou
shalt passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughe the rest of the artificiall places, and do that
which is requyred in euery of them: And last come to the confirmyng of thy
sayinges by examples, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthorities, and (as Hippocrates &amp; Galen haue
done) by histories and long experience. After this methode Heraclitus the
Philosopher examyned the phisitions whiche came to heale hym, and because
they were ignorant and could not aunswere to his interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he sent
them away, and woulde receyue none of their Medicens: for (sayd he) yf ye can
not shewe me the causes of my sicknes, much lesse are ye able to take
the cause awaye. So the lawyer shall pleade his cause, in prouyng or
disprouyng after as his matter shall requier, with these ten places of
Inuention, &amp; dispone euery thing orderlie into his propositions,
syllogismes, and methode. So shall the Orator de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme: the
Mathematician sette forthe his demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations: and to be shorte bothe in
wrytyng, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, &amp; in learnyng, thou mayest alwayes kepe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se thre
golden documentes in intreatyng thy matter, and this most ingenious and
artificiall methode for the exacte forme and disposition of the same.
After the exacte obseruation of the forsaid materiall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments and
naturall methode thou hast this lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le booke sett furthe to the, whiche
beyng well peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is able to bring more profytt to the (I speake af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
experience) then all thy fower yeares studie in Plato or Aristotle as they
are now extant. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the greate vtilitie wiche thou shalt
apprehēde of this booke, the facilitie and easynes of the same 
<pb n="15" facs="8"/> is not a litle to be commended. For heare thou hast
nothing to learne (and yet thou shalt learne all) but onlye ten places of
inuention, with the disposition of the proposition, syllogisme, and
methode. Euery place of inuention and euery sort of disposition is made
so clere and manyfest with examples chosen out of the most auncyent
Authors, that almost by thy self (yf thou haue any quicknes of spirite)
thou mayest attayne in the space of two monthes the perfecte knowledge of
the same. Heare I will speake nothing of the enuious, that thinkethe it not
decent to wryte any liberall arte in the vulgar tongue, but woulde haue all
thinges kept close eyther in the Hebrewe, Greke, or Latyn tongues. I knowe
what greate hurte hathe come to the Churche of God by the defence of this
mischeuous opiniō: yet I woulde aske them one thing that thou mayest knowe
their deceiptfull policie, and that their saying hathe no grounde of veritie.
Whether wrote Moyses (the Hebrewe and deuyne) and after hym Esdras in the
Hebrewe and vulgar tongue or in some other straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge tongue? Did
Aristotle and Plato Greke Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Hipocrates and Galen Greke
Phisitiōs, leaue the Greke tongue, because it was their natiue lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
to seke some Hebrewe or Latin? Did Cicero who was a Latinist borne write
his Philosophie and Rethoricke in the Greke tongue, or was he content with
his mother tongue? and suerly as he testifiethe hym self he had the
perfecte knowledge of the Greke tongue, yet he wrothe nothing therin wich we
haue extant at this daye. Shall we then thinke the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyshe or Englishe
tongue, it not fitt to wrote any arte into? no in dede. But peraduenture thou
wylt saye that there is not Scottyshe wordes for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare 
<pb n="16" facs="9"/> and expresse all thinges contayned into libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
artes, truthe it is: neither was there Latin wordes to expresse all thinges
writen in the Hebrewe and Greke tongues: But did Cicero for this cause write
no philosophie in Latin? thou will not saye so, lest I take the with a
manifestlye. What then did Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro? he laborethe in the Latin tongue, as
Aristotle before hym did in the Greke, and thou enuious felowe ought to do in
thy mother tongue what so euer it be, to witte he amplified his natiue
tongue, thinking no shame to borrowe from the Hebru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Grecians
suche wordes as his mother tongue was indigent of. What, shall we thinke
shame to borrowe eyther of the Latin or Greke, more then the learned Cicero
did? or finde some fitt wordes in our owne tongue able to expresse our
meaning as Aristotle did? shall we I saye be more vnkynde to our natiue
tongue and countrey then was thiese men to theirs? But thou wilt saye, our
tongue is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and theirs is eloquent? I aunswere thee as Anacharsis
did to the Athenienses, who called his Scithian tongue barbarous, yea
sayethe he, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charsis is barbarous amongest the Athenienses, and so
are the Athenienses amongest the Scythyans, by the which aunswere he
signified that euery mans tongue is eloquent ynoughe for hym self, and that
others in respecte of it is had as barbarous.</p>
   <p>Thou seest (good Reader) what a grounde they haue to defende
their opiniō, and howe they labour only to roote out all good knowledge &amp;
vertue, and plāte mere ignoraunce amongest the common people. Now for to
conclude, it shalbe thy dutie to receiue this my litle paynes in a good
parte, and to call vpon God that the vse therof, maye tende to the glorie of
his holy name, and profitte of our bretherne.</p>
