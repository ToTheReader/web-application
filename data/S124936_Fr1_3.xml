      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, according to my promise, I haue set foorth this second part of Parismus, which I wish may prooue worthie your fauour and kinde esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the Ankors whereon my hopes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende: and though it deserue not so much, yet let my good meaning therewith purchase the same. If you find any imperfections, passe them ouer with a carelesse respect: and if ought please your fancie, let it counteruaile that which is amisse. If neither wel nor amisse, then I pray rest indifferent: and let your curtesie be greater then my boldnesse: and your fauour beyond my desert. My intent was to please, but if not, my labours are ill bestowed, and my hap the harder: If I may breed any delight to the well minded, or purchase any good opinion of the welwillers to learning, then I haue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I expect. One peraduenture will say, the inuention is barren: another, the English is harsh: and a third, all is naught. Yet let me an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere in my owne behalfe, that which is lightly discommended, is not easily amended: and the worke well done, that pleaseth all: and that very harsh that none liketh. But I submit my selfe to the wise, curtuous, and learned: whom I trust will vouchsafe to esteeme fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourably of my good intent: that though I am not able to compare with any: yet I am willing to proue worthy: and haue taken some paines to procure their good opinion, vnto which I submit my selfe. As for Momus mates, that are contented with nothing, yet desire most: I let them passe as regardlesse, whom I neither care to please, nor displease: but if my fortune be so aduerse, that I cannot procure their delight I would, then I pleade penitencie: protesting I was in good hope of their fauour. Knowing this, that which disagrees with ones fancie, may delight an others. So that I am in hope this poore
