   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Rethren, our hearts desire, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest requeste to almightye God for you day and night is, that you and al yours, might be inlightned by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, in your inward man, with the sound knowledge, steadfast faith, and holy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of his blessed trueth, for the good and comfortable directyng of you, in the daies of your pilgrymage heer, and that your bodies and soules may (when the troublesome time of the race that is set you, to runue in this life is expired) bee eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally saued, in that great and last day of the Lorde Iesus. Of this most certaine truth, wee haue many good and sufficient witnesses (I hope) both within vs and without vs, at home and abroad: As first the eternall God, before whome though vvee haue walked, in great weakenes and wonderfull vvants, yet he knoweth that his glory, and your good, hath bene not onely the principall, but euen the alone mark we haue aimed at, in our publike places And if men may be admitted as testes in their own cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, not onely the vnfeigned affections of our harts to you-wards, but euen our sound and sincere acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, spiritually as in regard of our ecclesiastical mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, and that in all the partes of it, both praiers and preaching, shalbe proofes, pregnant and plain inough. True it is, that our hearts and mindes (as which are inward) are indeed known only to God, who alone is the searcher of the heart and reynes, and in whose sight it shalbe sufficient for vs to rest as in this behalfe, in the perswasion of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
<pb facs="3"/> But for our outward dealinges and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour that way, we are willingly content, to referre and submit both it and our selues, not onely to the generall testimony, of all and euery one of you, but if any amongest you, bee lesse zealous and forward in the gospell then vvere to be wished, we will thus farre offer our selues euen by your sentences to bee tried, whether we haue dealt deceitfully vvith the worde, chopping and chaunging the same at oure pleasures, yea or no, or haue bene vnmindefull of you, in our pore prayers, and faint requests though they be. To seeke letters of credit from abroad els where, when you your selues will not, vvith your hands alone, but with your hearts also yeeld vs (as we hope) &amp; that without feare, &amp; flattery, our iust commendation, may seeme superfluous, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally sith we stand not vpon them that are vvithout, further than as we may, (keeping our selues in the compasse of an ordinary and settled vocation) doe them what good we can in Christ. And yet (to the praise of God be it written and spoken) vvee may haue in that respect, the most graue and assured te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, not onely of godly and good men of our place, ministers of the worde vve meane about vs, (vvhich sheweth that wee haue not vvalked by our selues, as the manner of some is, in a proud and a contemptuous manner, and yet without cause the Lord knoweth, refusing the company and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their brethren) but also if need be, of great numbers of such, as be soundly lincked vnto vs, in the vnfeigned loue, sincere knowledge, and holye profession of Gods eternal truth: who though they cannot in euery particular yeeld testimony of vs, as you your selues, yet hauing in som measure ben
<pb facs="3"/> faithful beholders of the holy conuersation, and at sundry times attentiue, and fruitfull hearers of the sound doctrine that God hath enabled vs, both to performe and deliuer, cannot but iustifie vs, yea, sure we are in both respects wil iustifie vs, and that to the comfort of our own consciences, and to the stopping of the mouthes of the vvicked, also what vvee haue done priuatly to procure your good, it vvere better you your selues shoulde faithfullie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and our christian conferences had vvith you and yours, (specially before the administration and participation of the Lordes Supper) trulye speake, than vve, for our selues this we can protest, in truth and sinceritie before God and man, that our care and toyle that vvay was not small. VVhat fruite it brought forth, vvould to God that your workes of pietie tovvards his maiesty, and of charitie towards all men, might as effectually declare, as your ovvne words haue plainely vvitnessed, many of you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing constantlye aduouched to your selues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that you haue bene by the same, not onelye vvell fitted for that holye action, but instructed for time to come, and comforted against the dayes of your distresses, yea som of you hauing further affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (whether rightly yea or no looke yee to that) that that in diuers respects hath bene as profitable vnto you, as the word of vvholsome doctrine, and spirituall comfort, that God hath inabled vs in som measure publikely to deliuer amongst you. In the ordinary exercises of our families, vve haue seldom ceased to offer vp holy sacrifices to the Lord, as on your hehalfe. And this we haue done, without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and respect of persons, though sundry of you haue giuen fearfull occasions to cause vs to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb facs="4"/> the performance of this most necessary duty: vve yet notvvithstanding morning and euening, bovving our knees, &amp; holding vp our hands to God the father of our Lorde Iesus Christ in our poore manner, praying him for you, that of his infinite goodnes it vvould please him, euen for his deare sonnes sake to pardon all our sinnes, that so in the forgiuenes of them, a way might be made vnto his mercies, and the same amongst many other means manifested in this, that our pore paines in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were not lost, neither the time that your selues spent in hearing perish, and so the vvorde become thorow negligence, carlesnes, or contempt of your hearts, and a secret iudgement of God against you for the same, the sword of death vnto your soules. Neither do vvee now write this, as in the vaunting and glorious spirite of proud hearts before God &amp; men (for we haue, and shall alwaies haue within vs from our selues, as in respect of our greeuous sinnes &amp; great insufficiencye and without vs from you, as in regard of your coldnes &amp; carelesnes, matter suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to humble vs, and cast vs down continualy) or as vnkindly to vpbraid you in any respect, vvith the christian care we haue had for you, &amp; the great good that we haue ment to do to you (though yet we must freely confesse it in that behalfe, vvee vvill not vvillingly suffer our selues to bee spoiled of our iust ioy in that behalf) but to the end that we might yet at the length earnestlye stirre you vp in some deepe consideration, sight &amp; feeling, of our vnfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned goodwils towardes you in Christ, not so much to shew your selues christianly kinde and soundlie louing vnto vs (though yet we cannot but say that the very beholding of it, if vvee might once see it,
<pb facs="4"/> would yeeld marueilous ioy &amp; comfort to our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy hearts) but first dutifull to the Lord, that euerye manner of vvay, in his rich liberality offereth you so infinit mercies, and aftervvards careful for your selues, not for the things of this world (for a lasse vvee knowe by a lamentable experience, that you vvade to farre, and vvalk to much vp and down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those craggy and barren rocks of carke &amp; care) but for spirituall and heauenly graces, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the sauing of your soules, in that great and last day of the Lord Iesus, for the better acomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vvhereof, vvee come yet again vnto you, and make offer of an other sure token of vnfeigned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: wee vvill not say the last testimony of our loue tovvards you (for vve hope that shall alwaies indure in the Lord, howsoeuer vve may be sundred from you by bodily presence) but in truth the last triall that vve mind to make of you, as in respecte of your steadfast faith to God, vnfeigned loue to men, and holy obedience to the Lords whole truth and euery part thereof, vvherein if by your ovvne good inclination, and the forvvardnes likevvise of those of your families, as vviues, children, seruants, &amp;c. (for all your good, yong and old, one vvith an other, haue we penned and pricked this short trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise follovving) you vvill make glad our spirits and crovvn your selues with honor and immortality in the sight of God &amp; men, committing to your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, for the increase of your knowledge, &amp; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in practise for the strengthening of your faith these good things that haue bene drawen for you, and are novv dedicated vnto you, vve shall humbly vpon the knees of our harts, thank the eternal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, for suffering that gracious vvorke in you, and
<pb facs="5"/> as his pore and vnworthy seruants, by continuance of our small traueiles, do vvhat we can euen to the vttermost for your grovvth, increase, &amp; holding on vnto the end, in all goodnes &amp; truth for euermore. But if notvvithstanding this, and other religious meanes before specified, reuerently performed for your good, as on our behalfe you vvill remaine as you haue done, in your old sinnes, of pride, vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalnes, couetousnes, carelesnes, hipocrisie, hatred hardnes of heart, and many other such like, we may (as vve shall haue iust cause) mourn all day long as the turtle, in that heauy iudgement of God against you, and vpon our labours also among you how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit vve shall rest in the persvvasion and peace of a good conscience before God, that vvee haue vsed tovvards you (as our weaknes vvould suffer vs) such good helps and aids, as the Lord hath bene pleased to bestow vpon vs, and to put into our minds and mouthes to profite you vvithall, and to build you vp into a holy temple for the lord, that ye might be a people zealouslye giuen, and prepared for euerye good vvork. God the only both searcher &amp; sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the heart and reynes, vouchsafe for Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus sake, the very meane and matter of all his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies tovvards vs, to make streight your declining steps, lest that which is halting be vtterly turned out of the vvay to soften your stony, yea, flinty harts, lest thorow hardnes in your invvard parts, you stop the course of Gods grace, and the loue of his saints tovvards you: and so powerfully and vnfeignedly to conuert you vnto himselfe, that you maye serue as precious vessels for honorable vses in his house which is his church, for euer &amp; euer: So be it.</p>
