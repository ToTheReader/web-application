   <p>IT is not without the special wisdome of God, to set forth the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Antichrist vnder the name &amp; title of <hi>a Beast:</hi> For looke as <hi>Beasts</hi> do exercise all kinde of cruelty, and no favour is to be expected from them: so it is with the inhuman <hi>Prelates,</hi> their delight is only <hi>in the blood of the</hi> Saints: and as for <hi>Pittie, Compassion, Charritie &amp;c.</hi> there is no more in them then in Dogs. I could giue many instances

   <p>The consideration of whose cruelty, is to advertise euery faithfull man, to looke to it, that he well prepare himselfe; to fight with these <hi>Beasts,</hi> that so whensoever the Lord shall call him to warree this way, he may by the power of the <hi>Lambe</hi> overcome, and possesse the Crowne of life.</p>
