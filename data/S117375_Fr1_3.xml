      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Esides that
deserved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
your

<pb facs="6"/>
fections and esteem of
this worthy man more
then any friend alive,
which might intitle
you to all that may
call him. Authour.
This small piece of
his acknowledgeth a
more speciall propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
unto your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
For though his
tongue was as the
Pen of a ready Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the hand of
Christ who guided
<pb facs="6"/>
him, yet your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
hand and Pen
was in this his scribe
and Amanuensis whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
hee dictated a first
draught of it in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
with intention
for the publique. In
which labour both of
humility and love,
your <hi>Ladyship</hi> did
that honour unto him
which <hi>Baruch</hi> (thogh
great and Noble)
did but receive in the
<pb facs="7"/>
like, transcribing the
words of <hi>Ieremiah</hi>
from his mouth: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
yet your <hi>Ladyship</hi>
did indeed, but write
the story of your owne
life, which hath beene
long exactly framed
to the rules herein
prescribed. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that are intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in the publishing
of it, deeme it but an
act of Justice in us to
return it thus to your
<pb facs="7"/>
Ladyship, unto whom
it owes, even its first
Birth: that so where
ever <hi>this</hi> little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
<hi>shall come, there
also this that you
have done, may bee
told and recorded
for a memoriall of
you.</hi> And we could
not but esteeme it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
an addition of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the worke,
that no lesse then a
Ladies hand (so pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="8"/>
&amp; so much honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
brought it forth
into the world, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in it selfe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth
as much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other this blessed
wombe did beare. The
Lord in way of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
write all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Contents of it, yet
more fully and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
in your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
heart, and all the
lineaments of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>
and <hi>seale</hi> up all unto
you <hi>by his</hi> blessed <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
