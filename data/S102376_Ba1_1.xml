   <head>THE EPILOGVE.</head>
   <p>ANd now for a farewell vnto this my small Pamphlet, I would haue my well-minded Country-men to know, that, had not this rude and vnciuill Aduersary of mine, most vntruely and disgracefully calumniated mee, and laid without
<pb facs="115"/>
any iust occasion vnto my charge, the vn suffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crime of Witch-craft, or Magick, which is odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous both to God and man; I would not thus farre haue hindred my greater businesse, and more weighty occasions, to haue satisfied his v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>reafo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and immodest appetite. And yet, I protest before God and the World, that I am so farre from enuying at his good qualities, (if he haue any) that in the first place. I pitty his indiscretion, and want of that modest and morall wit and behauiour in his writing, which becommeth a true Philosopher, for as much as in them he appeareth more puffed vp externally with the empty blasts of selfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, begirt on euery side, with the blasted fruit of scandalous detraction and enuy at other mens en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours, then stuffed internally with any solid va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity: Gay things (I say) to breed delight in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byes, or such as by reason of their darknesse in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, can not well discerne or distinguish the colours of Truth: But vnto the wiser sort (such, I meane, as regard with intellectuall eyes) they seeme as Bables, or things which prestigiously appeare vnto dull eyes, but in verity, are plaine nothing: and then in the second place, I wish him with all mine heart, more money in his purse, or else some good Benefice or Church-liuing to stop his mouth, the want whereof, (as it appeareth by his Epistle vnto the Reader) maketh him in his writing; first, so forgetfull of his Creators Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, that he presumptuously attributeth that, namely, the soueraigne gift of healing, vnto the Deuill, which from all eternity belonged vnto
<pb n="67" facs="115"/>
God: next, he most irreligiously and vniustly doth scandalize his Brethren, for ascribing that iustly vnto God, which only appertaineth vnto him; and consequently, not to any Deuill in Hell: and lastly, he seemeth to inueigh against some men of his owne Profession, yea, and also to murmur against his Superiours in the Church, as you may collect, partly out of his Dedicatory Epistle, and partly out of that vnto the Reader.</p>
   <p>I know his humour so wel, and his Pen hath made me so perfectly acquainted with his rayling and Satyricall disposition, that I expect nothing lesse from him, then a reply full of vnreasonable braua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and thundering exclamations. But although he should rayle and rore at me, as a Bull of <hi>Basan,</hi> or puffe forth the fire of his spight, and rage like one of the Buls of <hi>Colchus,</hi> yet shall my still patience serue in stead of another <hi>Iason,</hi> to charme his tongue, or dull the biting edge of his Pen, &amp; to extinguish the bitter flames of his malice against me. Let him therefore hereafter thunder forth, cry, &amp; proclaime what he please (for such is his vnciuill nature) I will from henceforth answer him (as a rayling and Cynick Writer ought to be,) with silence: for as much as I am assured, that neither by true Diuinity, or authenticall Philosophy, he will be able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twist that web of Truth, which this my small Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet hath wouen vnto him: But if he haue some other businesse or subiect that sticketh in his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack against me (as I haue heard he threatneth me with Mountaines, and I am assured they will proue in the end but Mole-hills, as well as the precedent)
<pb n="68" facs="116"/>
perchance if I finde him in his writing more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and mannerly, as well become<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth the name of a Philosopher, &amp; as a Master of Arts ought to behaue himselfe towards a Doctor, who is his Superiour, that is, if he strike hard and defend himselfe closely from being repayed with Theologicall and Philosophicall arguments, and not with misbeseeming termes, foule-mouthed language, and false slanders, as his custome is; he shall finde that I will not refuse or faile him, but will be ready to cope with him in the Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Campe of <hi>Minerua,</hi> when and how hee dare; and let him if he will beseech (as <hi>Mersennus</hi> his Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly Master hath done) all his Associats and Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, or Birds of one feather, to assist him in his quarrell: But if he perseuere in his immorall and slanderous veine of writing, I will keepe silence, and either smile at, or rather pitty his folly, and answer all his obiections in mine accustomed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine stile vnto <hi>Peter Gassendus,</hi> who is his chiefe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and a man that is to be preferred by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, not onely in Learning, and Philosophicall knowledge, before this my home-bred Aduersary: but also in ciuill morality, honest iustice, and freedome from enuious malice. I wish that Master <hi>Foster</hi> would imitate him, and bee his Scholler in these his vertues, &amp; then I should with the like true Christian affection bestow on him, being my home-bred Aduersary, the same commendations, which reason and vertue incite me to impart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Gassendus,</hi> although my forraigne Opposite.</p>
