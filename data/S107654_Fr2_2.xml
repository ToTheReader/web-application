By which you may vnderstand, that the commendation of Astronomy, and the crimination, or reprehension of Astrologie may well stand together, the one being a most liberall and learned science, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the a meere vnlearned, and witlesse bable. Wherefore I haue not, as some haply would suspect, with the Satyr in the fable, blowne hot and cold out of the same mouth. For these two things being so distinct &amp; di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>se men could wish, that I had giuen A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomie a blow too, that so they might catch better hold of me. But how far I am from disgracing or malicing any good arte, may appeare by this speech, which was deliuered wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>igh thirtie yeares before this Treatise was intended. Now that their counterfeit is discarded, they will no doubt no lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That your selues may be the better able to iudge in this controuersie, it were wel that you acquainted your selues with those ancient and sound Mathematicians Euclide, Archimed, Ptolemy, and the like, bid a long farewell to these late dimies and epitomies, which haue already welnigh spoiled all good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
