   <head>To the Ingenious and Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Readers.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, for the best of you I desire to be no more, and the worst, I hope, will prone no lesse, To you onely I offer the perusing of my labours. If any immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest <hi>Thalassius</hi> require mouing Epigrams, and lascivious Odes, able to corrupt a Vestall, and make <hi>Priapus</hi> blush at his owne rites, I pray him to abstaine his frustrated expectation. I loue not to set before my Reader, the head of <hi>Polypus,</hi> Nor do I account it a sufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for Poets to say; <hi>Lasciua est nobis pagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, vita proba.</hi> I would haue <hi>Carmina Ithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phallica,</hi> and <hi>Fescinina</hi> banisht from their Writings, and not onely themselues to liue well, but their lines to bee drawne out by their liues. I cannot satisfie neither those greedy pursuers of humours, that would haue Iests broken against Gentlemen Vshers little legs, euery Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalieres
<pb facs="5"/>bald pate vncouered, and the deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a hooded dame deelpher'd through her Maske. Nothing but Satyrs, Whips, and Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to such, I say: I will not defile my selfe with others pitch, iudging him alwaies a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious corrupted person, that best expresses the guilt in others, which hee findes liueliest cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractered in himselfe. Yet if any of them shall tempt me, they shall finde me an <hi>Archilochus,</hi> whose Standish can swarm with wasps as well as his Sepulcher. I request also those, that come as <hi>Cato</hi> into the Theater, <hi>tantum vt exirent,</hi> who seeing the Title of my booke take it vp, where
<q>
         <l>Lectis vix paginis duabus</l>
         <l>Spectant descatholicon seuere;</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Either not to begin to reade, or not to shew their dislike in their discontinuance. But as for you, whose squeamish nicenesse condemnes Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, because it is so, be as far from me, as I ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to be from your ignorance. 'Tis not to you, But, <hi>Ad sacra vatum carmen affero nostrum.</hi> Now a greater scarcity then you haue of wit befall you What meane you to moue in a Spheare aboue your knowledge, and censure exquisite
<pb facs="5"/>numbers, which your capacity cannot reach to? Know Poesy is Diuine: no maruaile if it sute not the humor of earthly clods; Grouell with your deiected cogitations, while they breath heauenly raptures.</p>
   <q>
      <l>—Quos Cantor Apollo</l>
      <l>Non patitur versare lutum.</l>
   </q>
   <p>'Tis not your scandalous imputations can sully the lustre of a Poet: the Arch-builder of this Vniuerse is so stiled; whom therefore they call <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. No lesse are those, whom that Diuinity with Coelestiall inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons abstracts from the society of men. As for my selfe so far am I from the slighted opinion of such, that it is my wish
<q>
         <l>—Me primùm ante omnia Musae.</l>
         <l>Quarum sacra fero, ardenti perculsus amore</l>
         <l>Accipiant, coeli{que} vias, &amp; sidera monstrent.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>And (oh you) that are <hi>Castalidum decus sororum,</hi> That haue beene rockt in the laps of the Nursing Muses, suffer me to tast of your Milke; as for your Hony I will not presume to touch. Though my want of industry denies mee your Crownes of Iuy, yet, <hi>Non sum adeo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formis,</hi> but that I deeme my selfe worthy of a
<pb facs="6"/>sprig of Laurell. But I feare my iust spleene, and zealous affection hath transported mee too far. I will therefore returne to you (ingenious Readers) whom I earnestly request, that it may be lawfull for me to liue, <hi>Occipiti coeco,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd in your approbations from all the dislikes which I almost desire may be sprinkled vpon me to kindle my more earnest flame. As for the Story I treate of, I will not vrge your faith, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the thing it selfe, nor the relation: for being a matter so diuersly spoken of amongst diuers Writers, I was vtterly ignorant, as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellicus</hi> saith vpon the same, <hi>In re tam anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua, &amp; fabulosa, quid certi dicerem.</hi> I thought it as good therefore to follow my owne fancy, as the vncertainty of others: hoping my authority will passe currant; when <hi>Omnibus hoc licitum est Poetis.</hi> If at any time, the frequency of reading about the History hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got imitation, impute it to the obaious aptnesse of the Authour; so copious, that scarce no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention liues from his lines, that another can imagine fit for the same matter. Howsoeuer community may excuse a bad custome. Few there are which are onely <hi>supposititij</hi> to themselues:
<pb facs="6"/>and for my selfe I am not often faulty in that kind. For I protest I haue many times tooke paines to shun his almost ineuitable sentences: But I will not make a fault by excusing. Accept it as it is; it is my first child, but not the heyre of all the fathers wit. There is some laid vp to inrich a second brother, to keepe it from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed dishonesty, when I shall put it to shift into the world: yet if this proue a griefe to the parent, I will instantly be diuorc't from <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and make my selfe happy in the progeny from a better stocke: Farewell.</p>
