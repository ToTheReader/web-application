                 <title>A Catholike confutation of M. Iohn Riders clayme of antiquitie : and a caulming comfort against his caueat. In which is demonstrated, by assurances, euen of protestants, that al antiquitie, for al pointes of religion in controuersie, is repugnant to protestancie. Secondly that protestancie is repugnant particularlie to al articles of beleefe. Thirdly, that puritan plots are pernitious to religion, and state. And lastly, a replye to M.

   <head>AN ADVERTISMENT TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Disputation was occasioned the 29. of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 1600. by means of <hi>M. VVilliam Nugent</hi> (an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, and learned Esquyer) at the table of <hi>M. Ihon Rider</hi> (tearmed Deane of <hi>S. Patricks</hi>): The sayd <hi>M. Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi> maintayning, no diuersitie of beleefe, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to be betwixt the Catholicks of these tymes, and the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Catholicks of the tymes of the Apostles. Contrarie to which assertion, the forsayd <hi>M. Rider</hi> affirmed, that the difference was as great, as betwixt Protestancye, and Papistrie; because the first Catholicks, by his saying, had bene Protestants. Vpon these two seueral affirmations, they both agreed to abyde a lawfull resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the learned: whiche yf it should iustifie <hi>M. Nugents</hi> perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, then <hi>M. Rider</hi> would recant. Yf it could not; then <hi>M. Nugent</hi> would become a Protestant.</p>
   <p n="2">2. To haue the forsayd resolution, a counterfet letter, as from doubtfull Catholicks toward six articles therin specifyed, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed to all Priests, Iesuits, &amp; Seminarists, bearing date the 21. of October 1600. by way of prouocation, requyring them to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer therto, <hi>as they tēdred the credit of their Religon, the conuincing of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, and the satisfying of poore consciences:</hi> which aunswer was to be exhibited, <hi>within three monethes next insuing.</hi> To be briefe; It was partly referred, and partly imposed, that I should decide this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie; as well as one (in prison, sequestred from all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of my brethren, and diuers otherwayes disabled, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred) of my slender capacitie; in so short a tyme, might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishe.</p>
   <p n="3">3. I hauing accordingly dispatched briefe collections of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, Fathers, and euidences of most principal Protestants, as well of England, as of other Contryes, and obserued such ordre as from tyme to tyme I layd open befor all behoulders, their eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonstrations, that the cause of <hi>M. Nugent</hi> was iust, and the contrary altogether vntrue: I sent them the 2. day of Ianuarie, in the name of Catholick preists of Irlād, by my cosen <hi>M. Michael
<pb facs="15"/>
Taylor</hi> Gentleman; who deliuered them presently to <hi>M. Rider.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="4">4. Great contentment was dissembled at the sight of our aunswer, great thanks, great promises to replye with lyke expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. The 6. of Ian. he repayred to me, in the Castle, applauding to the forsayd aunswer, that it was beyond his expectation. Yet that he would reioyne therto, yf it might be approued by my name, and subscription. I mistrusting badd measure by such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, remayned slack to condiscend therto. Manifowld prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations were made, as also in his letter to that effect, of great goodwill to pleasure and benifit, and no intention to indomage therby. Vpon which flattring, but especialy to honour my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uioure Iesus Christ, and his inuincible Church, I gratifyed him with my approbation, and subscription, not fearing death or danger for my Profession.</p>
   <p n="5">5. Notwithstanding his former promise of expedition, in three monethes almost thrise trypled, appeared noe replye to suche our aunswer. Also contrary to his promise, he published his replye the 28. of September 1602. Befor euer he had acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me therwith; that I might not haue had in redines my aunsuer to confront it. When at last euery extended hand, yea many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding hands were filled with his replye vnder the name of <hi>Caueat,</hi> then in that liberal dole, I also was presented with one copie. Wherat considering the tenoure therof, I stoode amazed (as <hi>Polidor virgil</hi> sayth of him selfe, when he beheld the historie of <hi>Hector Boethius</hi>) lyke one that had seene a beare whelping. In fyne, I aduertised him selfe, within 48. howers that yf he would aduenture to purchase me libertie of books, a cleark to ingrosse my wrytings, and communication with my brethren, I would ioyne issue with him, euen before the right honorable Deputie and Counceil; yea also before his owne pew-fellowes of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege: that yf I did not conuince suche his Caueat to be frawghted and intirely replenished, with falsifications, deprauations, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, gnorance, and impietie; I would abyde any their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie appointed penaltie, and punishment whatsoeuer.</p>
   <p n="6">6. This sharpe admonition vrged him, (as I desired and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceaued) to propounde the sute to the State. They of their bountie accorded, that at his discretion, books, accesse, and printe should be allowed me. Books I confesse to haue had curteously, from the College. A clarck also; and that only, I obtayned. Other communication, but especialy the print, was debarred me, not withstanding al possible intreatie.</p>

   <p n="9">9. Neuerthelesse, he blushed not to pretend all slacknes, and tergiuersation, to be in me. How could he make it to any, euen of them selues to seeme so? Considering I had obliged my selfe to the state, and College, to obyde their appointment, who might at will compell me to an incountre; considering I was among, and in the power, of his frends, &amp; of aduersaries in the highest degree to my profession, and person; from whom I could not start, they hauing no intention to spare me; (in so much, as they neuer vsed such restraints, and wardings, towards any criminal malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, as toward me). And lastly considering that I had vsed the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer impulsions to come to a conference, yet sayth he, the fault was in you, because you tendred me not a legible view of your wrytings, which you intended to print, according to your promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se. But who behouldeth not, that a skillfull scholer should blushe, to craue the knowledge of what was to be obiected against him, yea, who behouldeth not, that <hi>M. Rider</hi> might blushe to make this the pretext of his relenting, when he him selfe confesseth to haue receiued, both what he sayth was promised, and it also to be legible? These are the words of such his confession. <hi>The highest in the lande had a view of your scrowle, and the Reuerendest and learnedest diligently perused the same.</hi> Now I craue, how could such, <hi>view, peruse, and</hi> (as after he affirmeth) <hi>censure,</hi> such tearmed scrowle, yf it vvere not tendred, or legible? <hi>The highest in the lande, are the</hi> state, vvho com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are not of the cleerest sight. Who yf they censured vvhat vvas vnlegible; <hi>M. Rider,</hi> tearmeth them all, in playne English, but fooles. These are his vvordes to such effect: <hi>Such as will censure before they see, are lyke such wyse men, as will shoote their bowlt, as soone at a bushe, as at a bird.</hi> By vvyse men, ironicaly, he taxeth them for foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. So that, yf it were legible, <hi>M. Riders</hi> long pretense is vtterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited and disproued. Yf it vvere not; yet censured as aforsayd, <hi>M. Rider</hi> avvardeth the highest, reuerendst, and learnedst in the lande, to be fooles. Yf they take it not in ill parte, I couet no other benifit therby, then to haue my scrowle (as it pleaseth him to call it) to be knowen to haue bene legible.</p>
