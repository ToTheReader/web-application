   <head>The Argument of this booke, according to the Authors meaning.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I promised in my epistle to the Readers, to put no interdations or distributions of my owne ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, betweene the authors words and meanings, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to enlarge or diminish their speeches, yet because there are no partition walles set vp and laid, betweene one speech and another, through out their whole discourse, I haue thought good, hoping it may be done without offence, with ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of mine owne rough hewing, to deuide the floores of the roomes within this worke, for the further benefit, if it might be, of the well disposed readers. If I come short or mistake any thing herein, for lack of knowledge, being not made priuie to the deuisers conceits, I desire as at the beginning, it may be pardoned of the wise and indifferent reader, the rather, because I haue not taken vpon me to ride aloft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the authors meanings, but altogether go about, humbly to resound vnto the world, the eccho which was beaten back vpon me from out the wood or Parke wherein these matters were talked of. Againe, though thorow the whole booke there are few words that go for nought, yet dare I not venture to expound them accordingly, as I might barely imagine them to be spoken, least I should make my selfe thereby a coactor or gatherer vp of other mens meanings, as if I were able to beat out the braines of their sufficiences, whose expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and knowledge, I must of necessitie giue place vnto. That which I am able to performe, I offer my selfe willingly vnto, which is, to lay open such doubts as may arise to such as are not readily dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of themselues, to labour or regard the true intent and meaning of the dialogers; who in my conceit, were altogether desirous to benefit if they could, such Gentlemen as dayly seeke to murther themselues by all maner degrees of violent follies. Vnlesse in time they better respect themselues, neither this supplying plaister, nor Maister Kellie his great Elixer will be able to restore or recouer them from out their <pb facs="43"/> daungerous consumptions, who by disorderly gouernment, make this incurable disease also hereditable to their children, so that the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne medicine it self can giue the no remedie, vnlesse in time they slie the priuie snares, which all sorts of enimies both sleeping and waking intend against them. As the spider with poisoned twist vnseene, begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the silly flies, so with the deadly sting of these venimous deceiuers, thorow too much outragious follie, do Gentlemen fuffer their bloud, and their childrens bloud, to be sucked vp. The first speaker within this dialogue, is called an ancient retired Gentleman, because of his lowlie and milde kinde of liuing, not at all disposed to striue with the world, in a proud busie restlesse sort: the other is termed a midling or franckling. The world acknowledgeth no such degree, as they of that sort desire to be holden in, which is to be accounted more then a yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and lesse then a Gentleman: such ones are said to harrow hell, to make their sonnes Gentlemen. Wherevpon commeth this by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, Maister how call you him, the sonne of goodman what shall I call him. These kinde of men are instant wonderers at lewdriches, which when the canckered and malicious minded wretches enioy in any plenty, then straight they thinke, the troth and grace of all things, consists in themselues, presuming that their children and themselues put on new natures, by attiring them beyond their birth and degree. This sort of men
<hi>Palingenius</hi> tooke great displeasure at, saying; If riches and worldly drosse should make Gentlemen, then the Butcher, the franckling, the Barbar, the Fishmonger, the Sheapheard, the Tanner, the Bawde, the theefe, the Vsurer, and all of euery filthie sort, whom the vnequall hand of Fortune hath exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, might cloute out their gentilitie. But God and nature forbids such as proceed from those base conditions, addicting their mindes wholy vnto that which can deserue no worthy laude nor praise, to attaine the gift and force deuine of gentility, which is onely atchieued thorough vertuousnesse. Good enterprises and vertuous deeds, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto this degree, and not the body set out with gorgeous shews: so that the minde alone procureth gentilitie, which is an ornament to none, but to him that doth appropriate himselfe to vertue. Many of meane degree haue bodies and outward shapes bred in them tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the force of nature, which for all that, still retaine in minde a base conceit of vertues. Neither God nor nature giues this value <pb facs="43"/> vnto all; but deales onely bountifull herein with such, as respectively incline themselues to better their conditions. If gentilitie consisted in triumphing names and brags of riches, what lack might not be then a Gentleman? To she stouthfulnesse, to haunt righteousnesse, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the distressed, to prouide for the weake, to defend the iniured, by these meanes was gentilitie at the first attained. All men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in equalitie, till vertue made the difference. Then were not men admitted to principall and greatest offices, that could gaine or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse most. Then was not authoritie fenced in with wickednesse. It must needs be a miserable common-wealth, where the best officer shall become the worst author and maintainer of naughtinesse. It is a wofull authoritie that defendeth wickednesse. Offices were not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for such as could most politicklie enrich themselues, but rather for those which were likeliest to performe vnto their Prince and common-wealth best seruices. If nothing should be law, but the decree and pleasure of them that sit in the commaunding place, vvhat hope should any haue long to enioy it, in that certaintie and orderly frame, that gratious and wise Princes haue commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them? Princes lawes therefore, are not to be executed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the pleasure and commaundement of their officers, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the office and dutie, in conscience and honesty from their prince they are charged by. Gracious Princes thinke it not sufficient for themselues, to be conuersant and exercised in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, vnlesse also they hold their principall offices in the strict obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of their iust and expedient lawes. If it be fit for the Prince himselfe to be dect with iudiciall effects, outward pompe and osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious showes will not alone suffice to discharge inferiours duties in their offices. Such as from an high place offend in their office, no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count or correction can be so straightly taken, as the qualitie of their offence meriteth, faulting against the taske imposed vpon them by their Prince, for the whole common-wealths good. Such in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, were by their principall leader or chiefe worthie, clearlie disfranchised from the societie or conuersation of men. The strict exercises of iustice in the magistracie, caused the Romaine Empire so long, and so not ably to flourish. But when they fell at their owne lust, to dispence with lawes, shaking off moderation and absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, then ceased their happinesse, and after them followed a more <pb facs="44"/> vnthrifty seed, which made an viter end of all prosperous yeares, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vertue in the end vtterly adue, making the noble birth of their auncestours, through the staine of their villanies, a reproach vnto them, shaming them also to whome they should haue passed their bloud by testament of vertues. As the body engendreth a body where nature is complete, so doth the minde beget a perfect minde, according to such perfections of vertues, as were entire in the state of vertues in the antecedent &amp; noble worthy. By ignorant times in this place, is ment the sort &amp; state men liued in, ere they were takÄ with the desire of knowledge, before there was any search made into naturall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and the generall vse of creatures. Because there should no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention arise who that principall worthy was, that mended thus the condition of men, he nameth him not. At no hand he will allow him, that hath an eye to himselfe, without respecting the good of others, how riche or great so euer he be in the world, to be a constant man, firme in vertues, but only a proud puffin of the world, or a Pippin of S. Ioanes wood. By hypocrites, in this place are ment, such as hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselues beyond cause towards some, on purpose to lift them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vp beyond reason, against other some. Such are said to imitate the outward habite and shape of vertues, but neuer to put on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward abilitie of well doing. Such hipocrites, in their slattering pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises resemble the deuil who offered our sauiour Christ all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the world, to the intent to take from him (if he would haue bene tempted by him) the incomparable riches he was already posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of. The seditious Iesuites, are here called poisoned Serpents, and hooded Friars, because they haue put on the hoods of Rome and Spaine, which are murther and rebellion, sent hither by the Pope and the King of Spaine, who are called greater Serperts then themselues. Friars haue alwaies bin cariers and recariers of the trash of Rome, so as these lesuits are now. By calling his dames house a chappell of ease, is meant, his sextrie or vestry, wherin he was wont to bestow his holy relicks, called by the frankling the Friars demisaries and by the Apothecaries
<hi>Testiculum canis.</hi> By fortunes wanton, is meant such a one, whose lust goeth ouer all things without being satisfied: such a one as is euer sick of the surfet of plentie. Fortitude is called a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant vertue, because the couragious hart thrusteth out the bloud from the shroud of the fearfull breast, to succour and strengthen the <pb facs="44"/> vaines and outward parts of the body, which are in a more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to execute valorous things. By the hockie dame, is meant <hi>Vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> the goddesse of haruest, to whom husbandmÄ giue thanks, &amp; pray for rest and quietnesse after their great and sore labours. Digestion, is called, a constant and a substantiall-humor, medled in the body by opposite cÅmixtions, the better part wherof in the end by outward &amp; inward heat is aduanced to bloud in the body, wherby life is fed and maintained. Ingratitude, especially towards parents, the enemie to all graces. Voluptuous pleasures, gnaw in sunder the sinowes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. By the <hi>equinoxium</hi> is here ment a similitude, betweene a restlesse woman and the Asse, which is said in that season especially to bray twelue times in the day, and twelue times in the night. By the Phisition his foure times comming, is meant thus much: First he comes to heare his patients confession, how he disordered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe at the diseases entrance, whereby to finde the nature therof, and state of the sick mans body: the second time, to minister Phisicke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diseased his griefe: the third time, to launch into his disease by austerenesse of phisick, to open the windowes betweene life and death: the fourth time if he chaunce to come, it is to pronounce sentence of death. By the diuers constructions of his disease, amongst his men, there is meant to be showed, the properties of the ignorant, for they euer take vpon them still diuerslie, and for the most part, euery one contrary to another in opinion. Because he hated to do well, he was therfore said to be in a frenzie, and to refuse the light Drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and voluptuous persons are also said to be in a lethargie, or deadly sicknesse, and so to stand in need of the aire, and the light thereof. He was said to haue a deadpalsey all ouer his body, because it is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease of the sinewes, weakning the strength and most effectuall parts of operation in a mans body wholy and at once, surprising life and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so that death cannot be resisted in such a one. <hi>Caonia</hi> is a part of
<hi>Epirus,</hi> a region in Greece, wherein is a wood called Dodoni, haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a multitude of Stockdoues, wherevpon this prouer became, <hi>Caoniae columbae,</hi> craftie Pigeons of <hi>Caonia,</hi> because the yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great preparation of ships which the Greekes made, these birdes fore seeing the downfall of the wood, fled into another country. This craftie Franck ling likewise, dwelling by a harmlesse Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, from whom, without doing any desart, he was sure to receiue <pb facs="45"/> benefit, was content to giue him check mate. But when one was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to possesse the foresaid Gentlemans seate, which was like more straightly to looke into this churle his vnworthinesse, him he calleth a Hawke, whose comming he may not abide to here tell off. Of all birdes this Doue is said to be most priuie to the nature of a hawke, and to liue in most contempt of hawkes. Couetous men, in this place, are called the diuels Faulkners, because it is the propertie of them, when they are seazed of their pray, and gotten into their tallents more then they can well gripe, or need to gorge themselues vpon, yet in that while, if there come any other pray by, which is like to be within their maisterie and command, they force thÄselues at that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, which sheweth their cormorant desire to be snatching. Besides, from the height of their stand, they are able to make many slights, and such as by their swift and fast flying, are neither seene nor heard, till they be seized of that they pursue. The Pheasant here, his bloud is praised, because it is medicinable and effectuall to many good purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. By the Stockdoues breasting, to driue the Pheasant from her stand or pearke, I take it is meant lack Straw, Wat Tiler, and the rest of his fellow rebels in Richard the seconds dayes, who by their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick and rude billing at the Pheasant, would haue put back the best blouded birde within this wood, from his high pearch, had they not bene preuented by the vertuous endeuour of such an excellent wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, as for his vertuous act at that time shewed, hath enriched many others since, to a degree of worthinesse, and that for his vertues sake. <hi>Dione</hi> is the mother of <hi>Venus,</hi> to whom chits and bawds are said to pray vnto, to ripen their young plants, and to make them slack, pliant, and ready for their haruest: and that their young heiffors may grow to vse for the yoake and the paile, sooner if it were possible, then nature requireth. The other starre here meant, is called
<hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferum, Venus</hi> her owne starre, to whom bawdes are wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, when they were deceiued or robbed of any of their sequestred weanlings: desiring by her light, that they may be restored to the knowledge vvhere they are: beseeching also hir aide to be reuenged of those wrongs, in as much as she hath takÄ them into her protection, to whom they are sworne by othe neuer to forsake that profession. By an Eunuke here, is meant an officer to keepe good rule in Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens chambers, or else such a one altogether, which the bawde hath <pb facs="45"/> in charge, to keepe <hi>Cupids</hi> tender sacrifices inuiolated. The Bawds house is called a Hiue, in respect that as in a Hiue all Bees are so like one another, that they cannot be discerned: so within this hiue of good fellowship, there is to be found such a swarme of perfect ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that you cannot discerne who is the worst. The riotor or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiat body, here is called a <hi>Didopper,</hi> because the kinde of this birde delights in many changes of puddles and vncleane vvaters. The bitternesse of these dialoguers displeasures, is especiallie exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against those, that by excessiue riote and wantonnesse, pull downe the renowne of their ancestours, decaying thereby themselues and their children, greatly shaming besides, to see water-bearers, and such as haue done most meane and despised seruices vnto them, to become better worth, and more able to liue then these vngratious kinde of consumers.
<hi>Eneas</hi> was not called a godly and an happy man, because he carried away vvith him from the destruction of Troy sixteene dissents of Grandfathers, that neuer foiled the reputations of their first ancestors, but rather chieflie, in that through his labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and painfull vertues, he was able to restore his decaied house to former happinesse, being so blest of God, that before he died he saw a large propagation of his owne progenie and naturall bloud, to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish againe by his industrious labours. To the Gentlewomans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of breeding horses, I haue thought good to adde <hi>Virgils</hi> words, concerning the excelencie of their first nature. A horse saith he, from his first foaling, that is duly bred, lifteth vp himselfe with such steps, gate and pace, as willeuer after prooue proper vnto him. And at the first he is of boldnesse to venture and to passe ouer hard and vnknowne things, fierce then also to go against dangers, as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, hedges, ditches, and such like. Besides, to be so instant and hoate in courage, that he feares no sudden or tumultuous noise, as armour, shot, or outcries of men. Shewing further by his breath, eares, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts about him, such animositie, that somtime with his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious high neighing, he seemes to fill the places round about him, and to deuide the aire neere vnto him. Afterwards, with such bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse you shall see him insult vpon an enemie in the field, vnder his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that you would imagine through the force of his generositie, he had a desire to pull the Launce or Curtelax from out the enemies <pb facs="46"/> hand. If there be such worthy things peculiar and proper to beasts in their first natures, let no man doubt, but there is a more deuine and effectuall force by the secret and misticall prouision of nature, properly to discend from one worthy man to another. Where he saith, happie vvere the children of such destroying fathers, if they might be borne againe, I take it, he meanes their happinesse, which by new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be adopted, to make good their first birth-right, whereof they were fraudulently deceiued. By that he vvould have their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers new christened againe, it is not meant by vvater of a new foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, but rather as I take it, by the mercie of God to be redeemed from that curse, vvhich some children are said to haue giuen them in their cradles. Where he saith, there wanted vnitie betweene their parents, at their conception, it is not meant that they were not gotten without concirtation, or the lifting vp of both their consents: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they were begotten against the grace of God, as those are that proceed from forced mariages, where wanted agreement of hearts, which is called a false and an vnchristian coniunction of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Where the father is said to carrie his sonnes cloak-bag, is meant such a man, as hauing gotten a reputation amongst his neighbours, to be holden and reputed honest, with the credit thereof is contented to colour and excuse to his power, his sonnes lewdnesses. It is good for the world in time, to see to the fraudulent entents of such, which carrie their sonnes cloake bagges: and also warely to looke to such prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks, as put their fathers in their pockets at their pleasures. When such yong maisters begin to gentle it, strifes, discentions, and lawe sutes, are made rife and combersome in the world. Then haue Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and the well disposed of all sorts, great cause to looke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and to hold these Boarepigs and Beare whelpes at the staues end, who for all their slickt coates and smooth tongues, vnderstand not what courteous behauiour and gentle deeds meane. They that thinke to carrie candels before these young deuils, are in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be stifled with their stinking snuffes. The moderate Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that haue to do with these hoydens, shalbe sure to reape in chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse, what they sowe in curtesie. By the <hi>Panacea</hi> or suppling plaister in this place, is meant forewarning rules for them, who know not how to guide themselues, and haue made themselues weake tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough <pb facs="46"/> babish pucillanimitie, that they might yet with an after-wit, strengthen themselues with that which remaines, if they haue not already made a bloudy defect, and slaughtered themselues with that weapon that was left them by their worthy auncestors, to defend themselues. To those that haue not set themselues besides the eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, let this teach them not to admit strange maisters and commers into their fathers houses and heritages: and that because Kites can be no goodkeepers of Chickens. Likewise, for those that haue med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led too farre already, vnlesse there be but one way with them, and that they be past remedie to be redeemed: let I say, this caueat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them, that it is surer standing vpon flesh legges, then vpon woodden stiltes, and that it is surer holding with both the hands then with one. Let them further beware, that their liuings prouided by their friends, prooue not <hi>Tantalus</hi> his orchards, by which is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, that there are good things comming towards men, if for want of grace they do not preuent it themselues. The whole intent of these two carefull fathers speeches, within this dialogue, hath bene to teach all sorts of men, especially Gentlemen, to beware of selfe-vvill and selfe loue, prescribing remedies withall, how to keepe men from aspiring, and coueting greater things, then their likelyhoods can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme: shewing also in especiall, how inward vertues are the meanes to aduaunce and set men vp in approoued degrees of worthinesse, and not base riches, iestures, apparell, nor hypocriticall policie, vvhich of all the rest staines them most, vvho in place of iustice, with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse practise nothing else. By loue-tales and other ordinarie matters within this booke, is ment no more but this, to shew into how manifold dangerous precipitations (by playing rex with thÄselues) Gentlemen in this age are fallen into. As by too gaudie and too gorgeous apparell; then vvith voluptous and excesse diet; then besides, with too outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and vvanton luxurie, vvhereby they vnnaturally destroy, first their bodies, then vngratiouslie loose their soules, and last of all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileslie, and too too vnkindly, deface the name and fame of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, their ancestors, and whole posteritie. Now to conclude, I craue pardon at this time, in that I haue not taken the paines to deuide or distribute into seuerall parts, this diuerse discourse, neither so much as vvith marginall notes, lead the authors meaning in some words. <pb facs="47"/> The principall cause vvhy I haue omitted so to do, is because I had no purpose from the beginning, to vvrong the speakers meanings. Therefore, looke vvhat errors I haue added of my selfe, I haue thought good to let them take their owne places by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, hoping, such as come gentlie minded to the reading hereof, vvill allow me some liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and pardon for a vvhile, till vvith better leisure, I may be able more fitly to satisfie them.</p>
