      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Sir, I haue been sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by sundry well affected ones, not to suffer this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon (being a forewarning of this famous Citie especially, and whole kingdome also) to die in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion. As, many elaborate Sermons, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after sore labour &amp; trauaile they are brought into the world, they are reuiued (perhaps) with your accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and applause; but their life and being in mens memories, doth scarce equalize the life of that beast, whereof both <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> doe write, called <hi>Ephemeron,</hi> the length of whose
<pb facs="3"/>life was but for the space of one day, as the name signifieth.</p>
   <p>Amongst many titles, which the Lord in holy Scripture hath vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vs his Ministers, hee hath called vs <hi>Watchmen.</hi> Wherefore I being called to this great place, and appointed to be set (this were) in the <hi>Watch-tower:</hi> during my allotted time of watching, I haue carefully indeauored to warne the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to forewarne them of those euils, which their sinnes are ready to hale vpon them.</p>
   <p>Howsoeuer the subiect of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doth concerne this whole most honourable Corporation, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the supreme Officers, who in their seuerall places should (as <hi>Moses</hi>) stand in the gap, &amp; with the Pruning-hooke of Iustice, cut downe bundles of vices, that so the incursion of Gods wrath may be stopped. Yet I haue presumed (right worthy Sir) to single out your selfe, and to affixe onely your Name to
<pb facs="3"/>the Dedication; both for the good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which I haue receiued concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your pious zeale in the discharge of that great Place and Office, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lately you were imployed; and (I hope) that others in eminent places and offices will imitate your vertues; As also to testifie my thankefulnesse, for some expressions of your Loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. Accept (I beseech you) of this my good intendment, who shall bee euer ready to demonstrate my selfe</p>

      <signed>Yours most humbly deuoted to be commanded in the Lord, <hi>WILLIAM PROCTER.</hi>
