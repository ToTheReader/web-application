      </gap> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ay it please your <hi>Grace</hi> to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most twenty years now
<pb facs="4"/> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, I presumed to present you, with this <hi>locke of goates haire</hi> (as then I tearmed it) offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the use of the Lords tabernacle;<note place="margin">Exo. 35.23</note> glad thereby to testifie mine unfained ioy; for your Lordships happy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement unto that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent place, which now for so many years since, your <hi>Grace</hi> hath (through Gods mercy) with honour held; for the singular good of this our Church and state.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>The motives invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and emboldening me thereunto were; first, in your Lordship the singular love you had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shewed to the pains of preaching, having beene your selfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in forward, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary in the several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both of <hi>Ʋniversitie</hi> &amp; <hi>City,</hi> through which you had passed labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; secondly, more concerning my selfe, that duty of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wherein I stood obliged for the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="5"/> respect which it had pleased you, even from the time of my first comming unto the Vniversitie to vouchsafe unto mee. Besides a third incitement was a respect unto my kindred and country men, over whom your Lordship having beene first (for a while) Bishop, I was willing the rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your acceptable name and gracious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, in a more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto them this
<pb facs="5"/> (as I conceived, for the times and age) usefull treatise.</p>
   <p>And now being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine set forward, to revise, and revive these labours which (chiefly through mine owne backwardnesse) have beene so long buried in the dust of silence; and (not by any addition of materialls, or change of methode, but by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition (as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired) of the whole into chapters with contents prefixed) to give some
<pb facs="6"/> small light thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereby unto the Reader.</p>
   <p>I reioyce once more humbly to present and offer the same unto your <hi>Grace,</hi> with an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of a yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther debt of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for your well wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing and (I may say truely) furthering of me unto that place and preferment in the Church, which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his late Royall and renowned <hi>Maiestie</hi> at
<pb facs="6"/> the alone mediation of his dearest consort, my most gracious &amp; much honoured Lady and Mistresse, <hi>Queen Anne</hi> of ever glorious and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py memory, fourteene yeares full now passed, graciously to conferre upon me.</p>
   <p>VVhich, being in the place where for divers yeares from my first lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Vniversity, I had laboured, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some hopefull fruit (through Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing) and good accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb facs="7"/> I rest therewith, heartily thanking God, well content, without travaile to look higher; desiring (as hee who knoweth the heart, can witnesse) ability rather,<note place="margin">Mat. 20, 11.</note> to doe more worke, then any way envying those, who entring on the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ke later have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a more plentiful reward.</p>
   <p>But God I trust will accept the willing <hi>mind,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.12</note> and that measure of strength which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe bestoweth. And if
<pb facs="7"/> your <hi>Grace</hi> shall bee pleased againe in these your elder yeares, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this same which was presented you in the times of fresher strength; your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship shall obliege mee the more, as to praise God, for (which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hath beene beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) your prosperous continuance so long in that so high and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable watch-tower, in which himselfe hath set you; so to redouble my vowes and suites
<pb facs="8"/> unto the same gracious Lord, that yet, (through his bounteous good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) yeares many, and happy may be added to your dayes, that like to that old &amp; honourable <hi>Iehoiada,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Ch. 24.16</note> you may stil do good in <hi>Israel</hi> both <hi>towards God</hi> and <hi>towards his house:</hi>
