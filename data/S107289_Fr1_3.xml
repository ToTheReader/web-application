   <head>¶ To all faithfull Readers.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Reading ouer of these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Sermons, will sufficiently declare what commoditie and profite they may bring with them: As in very deede the Author of them right welsheweth through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his woorkes, in what sorte the Lorde GOD hath heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beene serued, and also how ordinarily hee is serued by him. And therefore for a full recommendation aswell of the Author, as also of the woorke it selfe, I intende through GOD his assistaunce too sette foorth none other thing, then the same fruite and profite, which they haue already gotten, that haue read them, and that fruite which they may make reporte of, that shall hereafter reade them. For this may very well be thought that nothing in the whole worlde maketh a man more blessed, then the liuely and continuall meditation of the holy lawe and good will of our heauenly father. Nowe then this is the Psalme, which is framed, and wholly serueth too this ende and purpose, dayly to exercise our selues heere in, and although that hee so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes repeateth these woordes, Lawe, Ordinaunces, Statutes, Edict, Commaundements, Decrees, and other such like: yet are they no vaine repetitions: but vsed to this intent and purpose, too let vs throughly vnderstand, howe meruelous peruerse and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde our nature is causing these so necessary thinges, too too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily to melte (like waxe against the Sunne, as wee say) cleane away from vs, and also to make vs too bee touched at the quicke, that we might feele howe feruently we ought too sigh and grone, after the lawe and ordinaunce of God, how zealously too desire to put the same in execution, and also how greatly too be greeued
<pb facs="4"/>with beholding the moste proude and villanous contempt of the vngodly treading the same vnder their feete.</p>
   <p>And because there are some who rather desire too haue such Bookes as they may easily carry aboute with them, I haue the rather to please all parties beene very willing too sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them herein, alwayes reseruing this good affection, that GOD might bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and glorified, by this my small trauel, and the building vp of his Church aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
