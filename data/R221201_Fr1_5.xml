      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriftian dutie inciteth every man to extol Gods great mercies towards mankind, and namely, (which is the scope of this ensuing Treatise) for his blessing concerning the gift of healing, and for the originall or first finders out of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. In the arguing whereof, many ancient and modern Writers have taken great pains in searching out and describing (for memories sake) unto posteritie, who were the first discoverers of that noble Science or Mystery of the healing mans body; but not without severall and different opinions, and strong contradict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ons: Yet, giving venerable and due respect unto all, I will crave leave for my self to think and believe that the originall foundation of Medicine proceeded from God alone; being more then sufficiently explained so to be by <hi>Moses</hi> that divine Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiographer, in his sacred History of the first creation of heaven and earth: For he witnesseth that before man was created, all herbs and plants sprang out of the bowels of the earth, with their infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of flowers and seeds, with different odours, sapours, colours and forms, endued (no doubt) with many and great vertues, <hi>Solu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praescientia Dei,</hi> onely of the fore-knowledge of God. Wherefore to attribute so great excellencies, so many wayes in use for the health and wel-being of mankind, to any other than to the divine bounty of God alone, would seem (in my apprehension) not much lesse than blasphemy; for it could never be, that humane reason could have found out the knowledge and vertues of these things, unlesse God himself by his secret prescience had shewed them to man.</p>
   <p>For God, the Architector of the world, when in the beginning he created <hi>Adam,</hi> and inspired him with the spirit of life, made him not onely a living creature, but also indued him with such understanding, that he knew the natures, the forces, the proper faculties, virtues, and dangerous effects of al things which the said universal world then con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained or produced: so that the glory of the invention of the mystery of healing of mans body, came from God himself, and may not be so much undervalued as to be ascribed to humane ingenuitie. Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse (under favonr) we may so far venture to conceive, that the<note place="margin">The gift of healing is no lesse then one of the gifts of the H. Ghost.</note> same gift of God, namely the gift of healing, might by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be, and was transcendent successively on those whom he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained, and chosen unto the medicinall function, to the end that
<pb facs="10"/>
they might be the better enabled to search out and apply wholsome medicines in due season, according as they were inspired or taught; for all excellent knowledge commeth from above: and this opinion is also assented unto by holy Scriptures in sundry places.</p>
   <p>But withall, complying with our Ancestors as much as may be, touching the first generall professors of this art of Medicine; The most Writers affirm the <hi>Grecians</hi> were the first that tooke upon them to professe the art of Medicine, and they likewise utter speeches to the same effect, affirming <hi>Apollo</hi> to be the first Inventor of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; and by <hi>Apollo,</hi> it is suggested, that they either understood the Sunne, which through the penetrating heat thereof, produceth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth, tempereth and cherisheth all creatures as well animall, and vegetable, as minerall: Or they meant, under that name of <hi>Apollo,</hi> some Noble man, who was instigated thereunto through an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and divine power (no doubt by Gods fore-knowledge) and also endued with learning and diligence in that noble art of Medicine, who performed some excellent cures: alluding whereunto, <hi>Ovid</hi> speaketh thus of <hi>Apollo,</hi>
      <q>
         <l>Inventum medicinae meum est, opifexque per orbem,</l>
         <l>Dicta est herbarum subiecta potentia nobis.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <lg>
      <l>Medicines Inventor and Artist I</l>
      <l>Through the massie orbe am stil'd to be:</l>
      <l>Fame this attributes to my Deity,</l>
      <l>That force of Plants are subject unto me.</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And after <hi>Apollo</hi> the succeeding Inventor is said to be <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> which ome Writers stile to be his sonne, brought up in learning by him, who did somewhat more set forth and polish this Art, being as then rude and rustick, and therefore he was reputed as one of the gods. Not long after those times (as Writers report) did flourish <hi>Chyron,</hi> termed the <hi>Centaure,</hi> who also excelled in the knowledge of the medicinall plants.</p>
   <p>This <hi>Aesculapius</hi> (as other ancient Histories witnesse) had two sonnes, <hi>viz. Podalyrius</hi> and <hi>Machaon,</hi> who followed their Fathers steps, and professed the art of Medicine, and cured the wounded souldiers in the Trojan Wars; and these chiefly practised that part of healing which is now called Surgery. After them the knowledge of the art of Medicine grealy increased, though for a time it was in a hereditary way left by them to their posteritie; and through their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and diligence was that part called Physick which cureth inward diseases, also by a more prudent and diligent search found out.</p>
   <p>And further, authors witnesse, that out of this most learned <hi>Aescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius</hi> his Stock, did spring <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> begot by <hi>Heraclida</hi> in the Ile of <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>os,</hi> Prince of all the Physicians that ever were before him, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the art or mystery of Medicine or healing, and digested it into a method in the Greek tongue. And after him six hundred yeares followed <hi>Galen,</hi> a man not only exquisite in the knowledge of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
<pb facs="10"/>
but also in many other sciences. And what was left in the writings of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obscure and intricate, <hi>Galen</hi> faithfully interpred and illustrated it, and put it into many Volumes, and established universal precepts, and methodical rules, and reduced the Science into a more perfect Art.</p>
   <p>And further, we read in Histories, in the infancie of this art, that it was a custome amongst the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Assyrians,</hi> who then were very ignorant in the art of healing, to appoint the sick languishing people to be carried and laid in Porches and Galleries, or to carry them into the Market places and crosse Streets, that passengers might counsell and exhort them to those things, by which they might es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chue the like diseases, or had known some to be recovered: and it was not lawfull for any one to passe by the sick with silence, but he must utter some words of comfort at the least.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Strabo</hi> also (a Greek Writer) witnesseth, that it was of old a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome amongst the <hi>Grecians</hi> for the sick to betake themselves unto the <hi>Epida<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>rian</hi> Temple of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> that sleeping there, they might be admonished by the gods in a dream what was good for their healths: and being freed from their diseases, they caused those reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, by which they were recovered, to be written in Tables, and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the posts of the Temple. Such was the zeal and superstitious blindness of the heathen people in former ages, and the ceremonies which they performed in a grateful remembrance for future times.</p>
   <p>Also <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is reported to have copied out all those things, and so from them first to have amended the medicinall art. And it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by the ancients reported, that brute creatures have bin much conducible to the first finding out of some particulars in this art: so that man not only from man, but also from brute beasts and birds, hath learned many good things, which by them have been demonstrated, as namely, the vertues of divers herbs, by which they did preserve themselves from diseases, through the mere instinct of nature, (as the blindness of the young Swallowes is said to be removed by the herb <hi>Celedona,</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
   <p>Seeing therefore so great and so many good helps have concurred together to the perfection of this excellent art of Medicine, for the health and wel-being of mankind, who then needs to doubt thereof, or may say that it did not proceed, as from the beginning, <hi>de praesci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia Dei?</hi> seeing that man, the most noble of all the creatures of God, and for whose sake all other earthly creatures were created, receiveth such unspeakable comforts thereby: which caused <hi>Herophilus</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to term the medicinall Science to be the hand of God: for (saith he) as we having got a fall, do with our stretched-out hand endevour to free our selves out of that dirt or pit we were fallen into; even so we, being at the point of death by the assaults of sicknesse, do succour our selves by the salutiferous remedies of good Medicines, and do thereby, as it were, draw our selves out of the jaws of death; so as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> the Prince of the Greek Poets, doth affirm in his verses, that one good man that can heal well, is more worth then divers other men
<pb facs="11"/>
ignorant in that art: for what person is, or can be more necessary, or more usefull in any Common-wealth or place, then the expert Artist, skilfull in the divine science of healing? which Science bringeth a man in favour with men of all degrees, yea, to be acceptable to Princes Kings and Emperors, being both profitable and commodious every where to Prince and people for the preserving of health, and repelling of diseases from them and their subjects, which also gaineth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self honour and riches: for, as Histories record, unto <hi>Hippocrates</hi> by King <hi>Abderas</hi> (for healing of <hi>Democritus</hi> his madnesse) was given an extraordinary great reward; and moreover the heathen nation, men, women and children, gathered themselves together, and in a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant manner proclaimed him (with aloud voice) to be the saving god, and honoured him with the name of <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> the father of their Countrey. And the <hi>Athenians,</hi> because he had freed <hi>Athens</hi> from the pestilence, celebrated playes with triumphant pomp to his honour, placing on his head a crown of gold weighing a thousand crownes, and honoured him with the great magnificence of a King; and likewise built him a statue for a perpetuall eternizing of his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and learning.</p>
   <p>It is also reported by ancient Writers, that one <hi>Erasistratus, Aristotles</hi> nephew, received by a voluntary contriburion from King <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> an hundred talents of gold, as a reward, for that he reftored his sonne to health from a desperate disease: and likewise, that <hi>Augustus</hi> the Emperor appointed rich statues to be set up to the honour of <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Musa:</hi> and that one <hi>Quintus Stertinius</hi> received yearly for about 50. years together, out of the Emperors treasury at <hi>Rome,</hi> twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand crowns for his great skill in the mystery of healing: and that if any sick person of sort did call him out of the Citie for his advice, he did pay him 50. crownes a day for his skill. Moreover, it is said, that for curing Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the third, he every moneth received foure hundred crownes out of the Treasurie of <hi>Rome.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Ancient Histories make mention, that in former times the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and honourable personages (yea, Kings and Princes) were greatly delighted in the study thereof, esteeming themselves much graced and dignified thereby; and thereupon, being greedy of getting renown, have given plants denominations from their own names, as <hi>Gentian</hi> from <hi>Gentins</hi> King of the <hi>Assyrians; Lysimachia,</hi> an English water-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, from <hi>Lysimachus</hi> King of the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> the composition of <hi>Mithridate</hi> from <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Bythinia;</hi> the herb <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chillea</hi> from <hi>Achilles; Centauri</hi> from <hi>Chyron</hi> the <hi>Centaure; Arthemasia</hi> from <hi>Caria</hi> Queen pf <hi>Arthemasia.</hi> And further, Writers do affirm, <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus</hi> King of <hi>Pergamus, Solomon</hi> King of the <hi>Jewes, Evax</hi> King of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Iuba</hi> King of the <hi>Moores,</hi> with infinite more (too long to recite) did as it were burn with a desire of learning the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinall art, some in the herball part, others in the searching the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of drugs, others of minerals, and did also write and compose whole volumes in that Mysterie, for the benefit of posteritie yet extant; wherein are contained infinite salutiferous Antidotes, by the
<pb facs="11"/>
mixture of many simples into one medicine.</p>
   <p>And whereas there hath been a question amongst some of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, by what name they may most properly call the Artist; the more learned sort are justly stiled by the title of Physicians, and the more experienced sort are called Chirurgions, or Surgeons; by means whereof, sometimes there hath grown difference and offence, which I doe advise each discreet Surgeon to avoid, and that they give the Physician his due honour and precedence, comparisons being odious and unmannerly amongst good men. Also the Artist of old, before the art was distinguished, was called amongst the <hi>Grecians Iatros,</hi> and amongst the <hi>Latines, Medicus,</hi> and in our countries ancient language, by report, he was termed a <hi>Leech:</hi> and all those denominations signifie no other thing but one and the same, <hi>viz. A curer of diseases, sicknesses, wounds, apostmues, ulcers, &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And whereas all men may judge such infirmities cannnt be cured without fit instruments, which are first and chiefly by the hand of man, (who doth make ready fit medicaments and applications) to be administred to the foresaid diseases in due order and time: The first instrumental part of Medicine was, and is, that which both the ancient and later writers term <hi>Chirurgia,</hi> or the Handy part of healing.</p>
   <p>The second is <hi>Dieta:</hi> a special instrument to cure, without which neither wounds, apostumes, ulcerations, nor tumors against nature (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> do affirm) can well be cured; for that diet must be prescribed according to the temperature of the body, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the wounded part: and <hi>Galen</hi> also prescribeth a diet for those that have ulcerations, whether cancrous or otherwise proceeding. Wherefore I conceive him to be no just and charitable Judge, that denieth this instrument, namely diet, to belong to a Chirurgion as well as to a Physician: for that reason and experience both do allow and approve thereof, as an unlimitable instrument, <hi>fine quibus esse ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit.</hi> And whereas <hi>Galen</hi> saith, <hi>in lib.</hi> 3. <hi>De methodo medendi,</hi> all arts are grounded upon experience and reason: if any one can declare, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by experience or reason, a way how to cure ulcers, tumors, wounds, fistulaes and other like diseases incident to mans body, as the French Pox, the Plague &amp;c. the cures of which diseases by statute Lawes are appointed to Surgeons, and to do it without the use of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and other both inward and outward helps, which these learned men (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen)</hi> used, and have with no small labour found out by reason and experience, then I will easily yield, and be glad to learn, and will not onely learn, but highly extol it: but if on the contrary, no man can shew me any other way to heal the former recited diseases; then I see no just hinderance, but that each true Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, being legally a Surgeon expert, may and ought freely to make use of diet to perform his cures.</p>
   <p>The third general instrument used in the curing of diseases, is <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macum,</hi> in Latine, <hi>Medicamentum,</hi> or Medicine, granted to be of several sorts. Each man will conceive that medicine is a principal part of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and curing of sores, diseases and sicknesses: for who is he that
<pb facs="12"/>
can cure a wound, a tumor, an ulcer, yea, but an ague with his hand onely, without fitting medicines? Surely no man: Then it must necessarily follow, that <hi>Chyrurgia, Dieta, &amp; Pharmacum, viz.</hi> Surgery Diet and Medicines (I mean both outward and inward) are unsepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable companions, and therefore all to be used in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> art of curing mans body; and that in the person of one man, and why not in the Surgeon that practiseth in military occasions, as in ships and camps more especially? where neither his Majestie nor the Merchant allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Physicians nor Apothecaries any place, and there the whole scope of healing the bodies of the bravest and most valiant warriours and hardie Sea-men, are upon all occasions wholly referred to the skill of the Surgeon. Wherefore it were a very ungodly thing, and in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son most unjust, to forbid a Surgeon to learn all, or any thing that concerneth his calling: and all those that are of opinion to hinder a Surgeon from using outward and inward medicines, have quite mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construed <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Gale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>,</hi> shewing themselv's enemies to art, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and true experience, for that it is manifest, each of these aforesaid three branches of healing, do mightily further the other, to make the Surgeons cures perfect; for by these three together, and not by any one of them simp ly of it self and alone, we may boldly conclude to have healed well and honestly, and as we should do.</p>
   <p>I have, I confess, too long insisted upon this argument, but the cause is, there be some at this day that do indeavor to sever the instruments of healing asunder, against the publick good, for their own private lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, and would have inward medicine practised onely by themselves, and confine the Surgeon onely to outward medicine, and outward healing, as one <hi>Tragus</hi> an ancient Writer maketh mention, affirming, that there were certain sorts of men in his dayes which did use the art of curing severally; namely, some by inward medicines onely, and some by outward, and some by diet onely, every one according to his education and profession of curing: all these three contending, and each one affirming his way the best; in conclusion, their errours were confuted by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who gave to each of them (as learned Writers affirm) a patient to cure, whom all of them endeavouring to recover, failed in their performance: notwithstanding, afterward by the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and skill of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> they all were reconciled and united; for he, having well weighed and considered each of their weaknesses and errours, willed them apart to set down how long time he, or they would take, to cure his or their appointed diseased patients; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he and the rest agreed on a set time; which being expired, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> found that although each Artist had shewed his utmost skill, yet their patients were not accordingly cured. Hereupon he with much mildnesse and kind perswasions (as is recorded) so appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and instructed them, that each of them by the very same means and medicines they formerly took, being all used together to each party, quickly and perfectly cured their severall patients. Whereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it is manifest, that it is not just nor safe for the Common-wealth, neither can it be approved, that the best of the antient Fathers in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
<pb facs="12"/>
and Surgery did, or indeed could divide or separate these three parts of healing.</p>
   <p>But it may be that some will object that <hi>Valeriolus, Tagaultius,</hi> and some oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rs say, that a Surgeon ought not to give inward medicines, without the counsell of a Physician. To clear this, I answer, first it is expedient and just▪ where learned counfell may be had, to make use of it, for that by much counsell there is safetie: neverthelesse, know, that it is uncharitable to forbid an expert Surgeon at any time, or in any place, the use of the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>truments and medicines which are necessary to this art, for the curing of his patients: for certainly <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

But as concerning worthy Artists, <hi>viz.</hi> Surgeons apprpoed by the Lawes of the Realme, they ought to be free to exercise their art▪ and the same Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with Mr. <hi>Gales</hi> comparison (who was a late good Writer in Surgery) which upon the like difference he then made of a Shipwright and a Carpenter, who were both of necessitie to use one and the same instruments to perform their severall works withall: even so must every honest Artist, legally bred in the art of medicine, be tolerated to practise, by what title soever you please to call him. Then, if so, he must by consequence have the free use of all such instruments and means as may best and with most ease perfect what he intends, to wit, the cure of mans body: for although the Carpenter may say unto the Shipwright, Thou art not to use the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e, the adds, the saw, the hammer, nor the plain, &amp;c. For that all these tools appertain, and are proper to me for my art, and I cannot build without them; even so might the other make a like fair answer, and say, They are also as proper for my Art, and without them I cannot build.

For who is so fit, or to whom doth the whole use of all good medicines so justly appertain unto, as to the Surgeon that is expert, who by his Majestie is prest, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by commanded, as well as by Christian dutie tied, upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to heal wounded and other diseased p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>s</hi> by performing the art of healing in a practick way, namely, by the hand; and therefore is rightly termed <hi>Medicus Chirurgus,</hi> and thereby is capable to use all medicines for healing. And if so, of necessitie he must not be fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>idden lawfull practice, otherwise how shall he well perform his scope of healing, when he is either in Ship, in Camp, or but any where in the Countrey, where Physicians either are not at hand, or will not come, as when and where contagious diseases hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, namely, the small and great pox, or the pestilence, &amp;c. Now here in all conscience the Surgeon is to be admitted to shew his utmost skill for healing mens infirmities, without danger of any Law, if he be a man lawfully called as aforesaid, to the exercise thereof: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it were very unreasonable that the Surgeon alone should be pressed out of the healing of his Majesties subjects, where no Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian nor Apothecary is admitted to advise, assist or direct him, and yet to practise should be held unlawfull for him, when he performeth his best in any action or part of healing for his patients good. But God be thanked, there are both ancient and modern good Laws, Orders and Ordinances, which do manifestly enable a Surgeon to exercise his sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to breed up servants to be expert therein, for the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the art, and for the future encrease of good and able Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, for the service of his Majestie, and the Common-wealth. And to manifest the same, his Highness not onely alloweth the use of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and physical drugs and medicines to the Surgeons for his own service, but is further gratiously pleased (out of his own Coffers) to pay for them, as elsewhere in this Treatise more at large will appear.</p>
   <p>Thus much in generall by way of Preface. Now the Author in this following Treatise desires to excuse himself, by way of Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, to the Chirurgicall Reader, for his over▪forwardnesse in the unfolding to the vulgar what he hath hereafter done by his explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Surgeons Chest; which he never intended, untill <hi>(nolens v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

Which credit and weightie charge, so neerly concerning the lives of their
<pb facs="13"/>
servants reposed in him, instigated him to imploy all his endeavours to answer their so great trust imposed on him: For the effecting whereof, hee had no way better to recompence them, then by redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their Surgeons Chests, with all the particulars thereof, into an order and method, which was never undertaken before by any, although very requisite: but being once done▪ it would not onely benefit them, but also be a perpetual good for the service of his Majestie, and the Common-wealth: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>or by want hereof the said East India Companie, and many of their servants, as also many other publike actions abroad of great consequence, have suffered much; and namel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ries undergone both by the hardie Sea-man, and valiant Souldier▪) For remedie whereof, and in want of some more learned and expert then himselfe, he undertook the work; the said honourable Company being ever most willing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation or grudging, to beare the rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> not therein fulfilled; for he was (if he would fabricate a new invented Surgeons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>t) also tied in Conscience to instruct all and every Surgeon (that was to make use thereof in their services) in the knowledge and us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> of all such m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>dicines and new inventions as were of his production and induction. And although it well might be conceived divers of them in knowledge otherwise exceeded him, yet nevertheless in the true use of new medicine, how good soever, which he had intruded upon them, not being within their owne former breeding and practice, he was obliged also to instruct them in the uses and dangers incident by mistakes, (fit to be foreseene) and that by writing. As also he was further tied (for his owne reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sake) to performe the same in some methodicall and plaine way.</p>
   <p>And because untill that time no Writer (that he could possibly finde out) had ever handled or written any thing worthie of note of that subject, namely, of the methodicall composure of a militarie Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons Chest; he was put upon the toyle and studie of new inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for the fit composure of medicines and instruments, and that without the helpe of Authours, yea, and without the help of the Surgeons themselves, that were to use the said Chests, who (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the more ignorant sort of them) for their own private ends, and in part to cover their imperfections and absurdities, forcibly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood him. Yet notwithstanding all such discouragements, after he perceived in himself any hope or abilitie of effecting the worke, he
<pb facs="14"/>
proceeded on with courage, being confident of the goodnesse and usefulnesse thereof, for the preserving of mens lives and limbes; and would also in time to come prove profitable both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>or the service of his Maiestie, and the whole Common-wealth, as at this day is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.</p>
   <p>For this Work hath already turned the whole composure of the Surgeons Chest into its own forme and method, both plain and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, being free from all exceptions of absurd fraud or collusion, and also free from the former obscure, imperfect and ridiculous errours, and impertinent intrusions, whereby every unworthy ignorant impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor (as under a vizzard of hidden skill▪ made use of the art of Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and thereby put up whatsoever they pleased into their Chests, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tence of extraordinarie skill, great secrets, unvaluable, unsear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable, and not to be prized treasures, (which long time they had concealed) but being searched into, appeared for the most part faulty, fraudulent, and full of poore blinde ignorance: whereby, as is said, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers unskilful persons intruded themselves, not onely to be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Merchants best ships, but also into his Majesties service, yea, and that into his best ships, as great Surgeons, without either judgement, sound medicines, or once viewing of any their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and without examining any their abilities in their callings; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their abbettors believe that those which sought to view their Surgeons Chests, came but to learn some of their (no) skill, or for some of their (lesse) money at the fairest.</p>
   <p>Finally, though the worst might seem never so commodious, yet not onely to such as before are rehearsed, but even to Sea-Surgeons in generall, it seemed harsh and unreason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ble; and namely (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in part they were to be excused) for that their exceptions had a good shew of reason, in that they held it not fit that one Surgeon should make ready a Chest for another Surgeon, and the absent Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon not versed in the practice of the things made and appointed for his use: and this was held not onely unjust, but ridiculous; and that justly, had not instructions, namely, the Surgeons Mate been written. And it hath since been observed (the instructions being put forth) that the same absent Surgeons, after better informing themselves (by the Authors direction set forth in Print) of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie and innocent way thereof, with the fairnesse of the Worke also, and the utilitie of the said Treatise, have commended it, and approved thereof: so that by a few yeares practice of the younger sort of Surgeons, it is now brought into common use and generall good liking; so that it hath gotten credit, and it is with all Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons common in use, yea, even in his Majesties service, being first made use of in the <hi>Rochell</hi> Expedition, and the Author then having the charge of pressing, furnishing, and ordering of his Highnesse whole Navic and Land services, with Surgeons, and Surgeons Mates, with all their provisions.</p>
   <p>This present Work, being now the third Edition, as it were of the
<pb facs="14"/>
method of the Surgeons Chest, the Authour entreats (as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hath had) may receive a charitable Construction upon the egresse thereof▪ and albeit the benevolent Reader no doubt) may see and apprehend divers e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rours and meane passages therein, (discovering thereby the Authours many weaknesses) yet that he of his clemency would either amend them, or in love cover them, considering that <hi>Facilius est inventis addere, quam nova invenire.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And further, if any Reader of his own calling, condemne or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne him, for so farre explaining the hidden mysteries of the art to the Vulgar, saying, By your rules every young youth may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, not onely to furnish, but also to make some use of a Surgeons Chest, though he never truely served for it; The which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour will confesse to be an errour and weaknesse in him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore craveth pardon; but withall (for his defence) alledgeth, That he had an earnest desire by such an errour to doe a publike good, not onely for the benefit of every worthy young Surgeon but chiefly, and indeed for the Common-weal, and safetie of the lives and limbs of many of his Maiesties loving subiects:
<q>
         <l>Quia non nobis solum nati sumus:</l>
         <l>Nascitur indignè per quem non nascitur alter.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Now, unless the Surgeons Chest had been reduced into a method, could one Surgeon at sea well have succeeded another in the use of a practice unknown unto him? For by death all mens thoughts perish, and so doth every mans private inventions and practises; and by consequence, his death might have produced much dammage upon (otherwise) a hopefull designe, the want whereof many a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and valiant sea-man, by lamentable experien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e hath felt, before the Surgeons Chest was thus digested; because then every unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Surgeon (how weak, as is said, or deficient soever) had power, if he pleased, to practise, to the dishonour of God, the scandall of that most laudable Mysterie of healing, and the great danger of mens lives, procured by their ignorance and errour: for things known may be indged of, but unknown things stand by hazzard and chance:
<q>Cognita judicio constant, incognita casu.</q>
   </p>
   <p>Likewise the explaining thereof hath not onely much enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Profession of the Apothecaries, by undertaking the making, selling at their Shoppes, and transporting beyond the Seas, of many Chirurgeons Chests, for persons (unknown to them) inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting in forreigne parts; but also enabled them at their pleasures to have for sale, and for his Maiesties services, complete, (or in part) Chirurgeons Chests ever readi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>: unto all which
<pb facs="15"/>
faithfull Apothecaries, the Authour wisheth prosperitie and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
   <p>And lastly, it hath divers wayes brought advantage and good to the whole Societie of Surgeons; in so much that his Majestie, by the Lords of his Highnesse most Honourable Privie Councell, hath taken notice thereof, and, observing the utilitie that it produceth to the Common-wealth for the saving of the lives and limbes of his Highnesse subjects in time of Warre, hath been graciously pleased to allow a free benevolence, out of his Coffers, towards the same, for all ships imployed in his service: which allowance was never granted before by any of his Highnesse noble Progenitours, the Kings or Queens of England: the particulars and order of which allowances, more at large appear in the Preface of the Authours <hi>Viaticum</hi> herewith imprinted, unto which for brevitie, he referreth the Reader; hoping these his indeavours will be well accepted of the judicious and better disposed sort of Readers. As for the rest he regardeth not: and the rather, for that he is hasting to the grave, where envie hath no power: And on the other side, hee is not ignorant, that a large broode of pregnant wits, fraughted with Jeeres, (and good ones as they terme them, such as these times afford) will snarle, though themselves either cannot, or (be it spoken in the best sense) will not spare time from their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures or profits to advantage others; yet are they so sharpe of wit, and can so well dispute, and so wisely reason, that they will easily make

Their words seeming as Oracles to their own applauders, in whose Opinion they onely have the keyes of Art at their girdles. But to any such, I say as one of the learned lately did to the like;
<q>
         <l>Cum tua non edas, carpis mea carmina Leli:</l>
         <l>Carpere vel noli nostra, vel ede tua.</l>
      </q>
      <q>
         <l>Sloth sits and censures what the industrious teach:</l>
         <l>Foxes dispraise the grapes they cannot reach.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Some have already accused the Authour to have lost time in writing of the Cures of divers diseases, farre better written of by others. Which although he cannot deny, but that the accusation is Just, yet answereth, That if each Surgeons Mate had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with a Librarie, and iudgement to use it, his labours were then in vain and idle: and to such as have these helps, or that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the Authour intends not these his labours; and to that partie in particular, he answereth, That if one wise man in former ages hath commended and well approved of another in writing
<pb facs="15"/>
both of one and the same subject, he conceiveth it is as easie for one foole in this age to wink at anothers faults and weaknesses, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in such fooles as have neither wit nor will to write better. As for wise men they will judge like themselves: but who can satisfie a fool? And so he concludes, with these following verses, taken out of a German Writer, as a loving answer to all such as shall hereafter find fault with his Book:</p>
   <lg>
      <l>Wems g'libt, gefelt, vnd nutz sein wird,</l>

   </lg>
   <p>In English thus.</p>
   <lg>
      <l>Who likes, approves, and usefull deems</l>
      <l>This work, for him 'tis wrought:</l>
      <l>But he that light thereof esteems</l>
      <l>May leave the book unbought.</l>
