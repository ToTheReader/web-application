      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I haue invited thee: so let me now aduise, or rather intreat thee that having read mee, thou wilt not rashly censure me; my intent throughout was to giue content, not to some but all, which in one respect or other (I hope) answers my d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap> lyes all my doubt, least offence might be taken heere and there at my seeming Osten ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but leave that to GOD, whilest my heart (I am sure) condemnes me not; perhaps there may be Cause, and then to boast, is wisdome both in the Opinion and practise of the wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>st; what I haue done, hath beene with as much respect to thy good as my owne, in removing my Candle frō vnder a Bushell, to set it fairly on a Candlestick, to the end that with the light there of I may see, and be seene of all, for of all things I abhorre <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

we yeeld vnto men (as all things else) but chiefly for their proper, and most essentiall or intellectuall parts) euen Wisdome (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) to use or refuse them.</p>
   <p>And now (Gentle Reader) for the writing of Bookes so in generall, aword or two (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Correction) in some defence thereof I hope will not f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ll amisse; prouided that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church nor State be dishonoured, or any particular person thereby iustly offended. True it is, (and none but the vnwise can den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>it) that S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>ollers for their rare guists of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> are most sit to write for publike vse (hauing a thousand times wisht my selfe a Scholler for the singular benefits that haue their conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a man by <hi>Academicall</hi> &amp; well managed Arts;) yet that all others should be excluded, or not any (that will) of vnderstanding and honest life (vpon good occasion, the Premisses considered) should be allowed of, I know not yet one reason of many (me thinkes) to the contrary, to ratisie that opinion; for if wee consider the many benefits for one inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, thereupon ensuing that stand up to plead for a generall tolleration, not one of a hundred (I suppose) even of Schollers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues but will ioyne with them in theyr ready approbation.</p>
   <p>For first of all is not that Noble Science of PRINTING made the more to flourish? Doe not the Masters and Artificers thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come able, not onely for their private Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<pb n="67" facs="38"/>
but also Common-wealths men? When their Presses (through a generall supply of Coppies) never want worke? Are not Shops the better furnisht with Bookes, and kept o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by a frequent concourse of all sorts of Buyers, through the variety and choyce of matter there to bee had for a small piece of mony, to profit themselves by other mens labours of an incomparable value? Doth not the reading of a few harmelesse lines enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne divers from worse exercises, whom else (perhaps) better things would scarce content? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> had it not beene profitable for many to have exercised themselves in writing of some Manuscript, whilest Idlenesse and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Company have beene their utter bane and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine? And how many have improved theyr parts and vacant times unto a good sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of doing Service both in Church and Common-weale, wherein (to the honor and profit of both) they have lived, by applying themselves to vertuous studie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>, and writing their Observations, that never (perhap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>) eate bread in a Vniversitie? Or why doth our State at present (in a sort) allow of, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at this tolleration (under the foresayd <hi>Provisoes</hi>) but for these or the like godly and civill policies no doubt? Besides other reasons which I leave to others; but if none of these will passe for current, yet could I wish (Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader) that Travellers (in due honor to their Travailes) may have a place (though the

      </gap>ake. A man that hath travelled (sayth wise <hi>Strach</hi>) knoweth many things, and hee that hath much experience will declare Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; he that hath no experience knoweth little, but he that hath travayled is (or should be) full of Prudence; to wit, a man of Counsell and Action; of discourse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution; <hi>Eccles</hi> 34. 9. 10.

      </gap>e read large Observations of the Divine Power and Providence, to the Glory of God, and the publike good, by the right use which ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minds make of all things, and to which ends onely they ought to be written; When I travailed I saw many things, and I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

because of these things. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 34. 11. 12. To communicate experience (therefore) is as commendable as profitable, being that which in all ages hath ever been allowed of, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and practised by the wisest. <hi>Wis.</hi> 7. 13. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 39. 8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 10.

      </gap> hoarded up, what profit (or not prejudice rather) is in ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And better is he that hideth his folly, then a man that hideth his wisedome or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, be it never so little, upon least oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of doing good therewith; <hi>Eccles.</hi> 20. 30. 31.

   <p>Thus (Gentle Reader) hauing satisfied thee (I hope;) in my best wishes I commend thee (as my selfe) to the protection of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and bid thee heartily fare-well in CHRIST.</p>
