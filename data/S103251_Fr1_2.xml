   <p>Your Lordships request at <hi>Cern,</hi> was to me, as a command vpon my Canonicall obedience; so that I durst not neglect the Apostles precept <hi>(Obedite praepositis)</hi> as hauing likewise learned, that obedience is better then sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Hauing hereupon summed vp my weake Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, I haue now made bould to send you a Copie of my poore Labours in your Visitation, according to your Lordships pleasure, and my promise. Whatsoeuer it was (if any thing) in the speaking; I feare me, it will be no thing, or no thing like, in the reading; as wanting that life, which is the first, second, and third thing, as in a <hi>Rhetoricall,</hi> so in a <hi>Theologicall</hi> Orator: Onely this is my comfort, that your Lordship will be pleased to giue it both life, and grace, by your reading it, together with a kind of Episcopall confirmation, by imposing your sacred
<pb facs="3"/>hands vpon it. Whatsoeuer it is, it is wholy yours, preached by your appointment, and in your Lordships Visitation, transcribed according to your pleasure, and now with all humilitie it comes to kisse your Lordships hands, in hope of a gracious, and fauourable acceptance. Princes and people did bring to King <hi>Dauid,</hi> Brasse, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, Gold, and pretious Stones in great aboundance, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the building of a Temple, a materiall House, for the Lord of Hostes. Siluer I haue none, and Gold I haue none, nor any precious and curious stuffe fit for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; but such as I haue, giue I vnto you towards the building of Gods spirituall House: And where there is a willing and a readie minde, God accepteth according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. <hi>Tolle, &amp; Lege.</hi> And the Lord giue a blessing to it, and vouchsafe to blesse your Lordship for deigning thus to blesse and to grace it: And so I cease to trouble you, but neuer to honour you, resting</p>
