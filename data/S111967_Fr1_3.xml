   <head>THE
BOOKE-SELLER
to the learned and
godly Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
you know
better then I,
that the Church
hath beene pestered with
writings falsly fathered
upon men of renowne.
There is scarce an Age in
which many instances are
not given. Not onely <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
and <hi>Councels,</hi> but
<hi>Historians,</hi> have beene
stuffed from other mens
Pennes with adulterine
conceits. The <hi>Divell</hi>
knowes that as <hi>Labans</hi>
sheepe have conceived by
the eye; so men have been
apt peremptorily to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from the opinions of
their great Masters: And
men have so cleaved to the
<hi>persons</hi> of men, that they
have catched up all shreds
that have fallen from them
with admiration and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to follow them. This
hath been very offensive: it
<pb facs="3"/>
hath stayned the dead, and
corrupted the living. It is
not therefore alwayes safe
to trust <hi>posthume</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and to say, <hi>This
such a man held, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we finde it in the
Books published under
his name when hee is
dead.</hi> Yet is there an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
use of such Workes
of good men, as may truely
be affirmed to be theirs,
though time have brought
them forth, when their ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
have inhabited their
eternity.</p>
   <p>Now Bookes are of
<pb facs="4"/>
excellent worth <hi>(not to
satisfie some greedy
Tradesmen, who know
how to value them for
themselves, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they care not
two pence for the Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thor,
when their own
turne is served,)</hi> but to
take up, and gaine, the eyes,
hearts, and times of many,
who would reade none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they can reade new
ones.</p>
   <p>This here presented is
certainly the Authors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:
though not for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
word (for I cannot
<pb facs="4"/>
promise that, from a Copy
which hath passed through
many hands) yet for the
fu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>
      <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>stance, and sense:
and it is as certaine that it
is new, and so, apt to invite
unto it as a new fashion.
It is wondred that it is so
new, when many of the
same Authors are so old.
It surely might have beene
set in the front both for
age, and worth. It was
preached before many of
the rest, and savours of the
Authours learning, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
piety, and affection to
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and his
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Church</hi> with us. But
though it hath beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
neglected, yet now it
is tendered in the Authors
owne words and hearty
affections, so neare as I
could. You may see in it a
glimpse of the full glory of
Christ, and of that use
which we make of him, as
we must receive him to
salvation. If it may doe
any service in the Church,
I, into whose hands it hath
fallen, am glad. If not, yet
I beseech you, accept of my
good meaning, and be to
me, as I am to you, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<pb facs="5"/>
ayming more at
the glory of Christ, and
peace of the Church,
then at my owne
profit.</p>
