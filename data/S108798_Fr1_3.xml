   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, Two things should be the principall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of thy study; Christ and thine owne heart. The latter; to know thine owne
misery; the former, to know Gods rich mercy, and how thou mayst be made
partaker of it. So deceitfull is the heart of man naturally, that he
<hi>thinkes himselfe rich, and increased in goods,</hi> and knowes not that
he <hi>is poore, and blind miserable, wretched, and naked.</hi> And untill
this deceit and unsoundnesse be discovered, men will never seeke out
for Christ, which is that <hi>Gold tried in the fire,</hi> which indeed makes
poore man rich; and that <hi>white rayment, Iohn</hi> speakes of, which
indeed makes naked man comely, and covers all his deformity, from the
all-seeing eye of him, which is perfect purity. The true knowledge of thine
owne heart, this little tract will helpe thee to, by the blessing of God;
if thou serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruse it, and humbly seeke to him, who is the
searcher and discoverer of all hearts, to go <pb facs="5"/>along with
thee, in the reading of it. Which when once thou hast gotten, thou wilt be
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the saving knowledge of Christ, and restlesse till thou
hast obtained it. And this when acquired, will resolve thy doubting,
comfort thy mourning, and stablish thy stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering soule: 'twill give
thee peace and joy unspeakablo here, and bring thee to glory and joy
incomprehensible hereafter. To which, the Lord bring thee, and me.</p>
