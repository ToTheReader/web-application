   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE good acceptance, the Sermons of this worthy man have found amongst well disposed Christians, hath made us the willinger to give way to the publishing of these, as comming from the same Author. The good they may thus doe, prevailes more for the sending of them forth, than some imperfections (that usually accompany the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of other mens speeches) may doe to suppresse them. Something may well be yeelded to publike good in things not altogether so as we wish. They are inforced upon none that shall except against them, they may either reade or refuse them at their pleasure. The argument of them is such as may draw the more regard, being of matters of nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie and perpetuall use.</p>
   <p>For Humiliation <note n="a" place="margin">
         <hi>Treatise.</hi>
      </note> wee never so deeply see into the grounds of it, (sinfulnesse of nature, and life)
<pb facs="4"/>
or so farre as we see, looke upon it with that eye of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation we should, and therefore a holy heart desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth still further light to be brought in, to discover whatsoever may hinder communion with God, and is glad when sin is made loathsome unto it, as being its greatest enemy that doth more hurt than all the world besides, and the only thing that divides betweene our chiefest good, and us. As this humiliation increaseth, so in the like proportion all other graces increase: for the more we are emptied of our selves, the more wee are filled with the fulnesse of God. The defects of this appeare, in the whole frame of a Christian life, which is so far unsound as wee retaine any thing of corrupted selfe, unhumbled for.</p>
   <p>The foundation of Christianitie is layd verie low; and therefore the treatise of Humiliation is well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised before that of the <note n="b" place="margin">
         <hi>2 Treatise.</hi>
      </note> New Creature. God will build upon nothing in us. We must be nothing in our selves before we be raised up for a fit Temple for God to dwell in, whose course is to pull downe before hee build. Old things must be out of request, before all become new, and without this newnesse of the whole man from Vnion with Christ, no interest in the new heavens can be hoped for, whereinto no defiled thing shall enter as altogether unsutable to that condition and place. Nothing is in request with God but this New Creature, all things else are adjudged to the fire, and without this it had beene better be no Creature at all. By this we may judge of the usefulnesse of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses tending this way. One thing more thou art to be advertised of (Courteous Reader) and that is, of the injurious dealing of such as for private gaine have
<pb facs="4"/>
published what they can get, howsoever taken, without any acquainting either of those friends of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that resided in <hi>Cambridge</hi> (to whose care hee left the publishing of those things that were delivered there) or of us, to whom he committed the publishing of what should be thought fit for publike view, of that which was preached in <hi>London.</hi> Hereby not onely wrong is done to others but to the deceased likewise, by mangling and misshaping the birth of his braine, and therefore once againe we desire men to forbeare publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of any thing, untill those that were intrusted have the review. And so we commit the treatise, and thee to Gods blessing.</p>
