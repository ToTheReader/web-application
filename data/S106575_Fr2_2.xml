      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Would not haue thee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant (gentle Reader) of the affection wherewith I sette foorth this small Treatise. It is not with any carping minde, I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assure thee, against any person or state, or with desire to publish a new toy, thereby to seeme to bee some bodie. But considering the benefits which might arise of the truth of this matter, which seemeth to me most true, I was willing easily to yeeld vnto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests of certaine, vvho thought it good I should make it common with thee: which so much the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly I doe, in that I hope this my enterprise shal be a meanes to prouoke others to deale with the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more plentifully, and kindle in

vs a greater diligence to inquire after the medicines of our owne Countrie yeeld, &amp; more care to put thē in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. The case is neither mine nor thine onely, but the Common-wealths, the benefit whereof all are bound who are members thereof, according to their place &amp; calling, most diligently to seek. And this I desire of thee: if thou art of another mind then I am in this matter, thou wouldest keepe moderation of thy affections towards my person: &amp; in the searching out of truth ioyn with me: and as I giue thee leaue to thinke in this point what listeth thee, so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine not him who easily giueth his eare to reason, and hath dedicated his daies to serue thy commodity; which if he misseth of, his good will yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth with thee, which hee also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to bee yeelded on thy part to him againe. Farewell.</p>
