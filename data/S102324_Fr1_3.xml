   <head>TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTIE PRINCE, <hi>CHARLES,</hi> by the grace of God King of great Britaine, France, and Ireland, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor of the Faith, &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was a Law</hi> (Dread Soueraigne) <hi>among the Romans,
<note place="margin">
            <hi>Gueuara</hi> in his Epistles.</note> That vpon paine of death, none should presume to approach the Tent where the Emperour did eate &amp; sleepe, except such as did serue him by day, and guard him by night. The Emperour</hi> Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius <hi>being in the warres in Asia against</hi> Cenobia, <hi>in the night a certaine Greeke Souldier entred the Emperours Tent, who being taken to be executed for the same, the Emperour from his bed cried out with a loude voyce,</hi> If his man did come to sue for any thing for himselfe, let him die; but if for another, let him liue. <hi>The matter being examined, it was found that the poore man came to sue for his three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions that were taken sleeping in the watch,</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>were</hi> then <hi>all saued:</hi> whereby that good Prince got to himselfe an immortall name of clemencie. Novv seeing I also (a common Souldier) come not to sue for my selfe, but my <hi>Sauiour,</hi> nor in my ovvne Name and vvords, but in his <hi>Confession</hi> and <hi>Complaint;</hi> and aboute those, who if not in your Maiesties ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, yet in Christs Camp, haue been <hi>taken asleep</hi> being <hi>of the watch,</hi> no man will (I hope) be so rash, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite that your Maiestie a Christian King should not ouercome a Pagan Prince, in that much honoured vertue; much lesse so far to forget the duty of a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, as to infer from this example, that we vnder the
<pb facs="6"/>Gospell of our Lord and Sauiour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to a time, vvhen it should be accounted a crime in any Christian, <hi>to confesse</hi> and defend <hi>the faith of Christ crucified.</hi>

         </gap>rol. 5. inter Epist.</note> Youre <hi>Maiestie</hi> by youre Roiall title is <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the faith;</hi> and consequently of all those youre <hi>Maiesties</hi> subiects that professe and maintaine the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. <hi>Then,</hi> saith <hi>Gueuara, is the Prince naturall of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom when he doth obserue and defend the Gospell of Christ.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I confesse, right high and mightie <hi>Monarch,</hi> youre <hi>Maiesties</hi> affaires are many &amp; important; that amonge many things offered to youre Princely cōsideration, some may be of greater consequence in the conceite of the preferrers, then in true substance, and may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be therefore answered with <hi>parturiunt montes, nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetur rediculus mus,</hi> or with that, <hi>Non vacat exiguis rebus adesse Ioui.</hi> But this <hi>Confession,</hi> amonge other things, manifesteth that the successe and safety of temporall Kingdoms, depende on the due receiuing and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Christs, and extirpation of all the open &amp; secret enemies thereof. Knowing then, that in this <hi>Island, Christ</hi> hath had a Kingdom theese seauenty yeares or vpwards; that there is noe true Christian, nor good subiect, but would be loth to see it eaten out by <hi>Iesuiticall</hi> or <hi>Pelagian</hi> practises; what honourable or loial Seruant is there in youre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>Maiesties Court,</hi> that if a man,
<note place="margin">Ieh. 9.1.30.</note> as weake, as he that was <hi>blinde from his birth,</hi> should, by Gods assistance, pleade Christs cause to the <hi>Rulers</hi> with good proofes, would not take that of our Sauiour into consideration,
<note place="margin">chap. 12.48.</note>
      <hi>He that reiecteth me and receiueth not my words, bath one that iudgeth him, the Word that I haue spoken, the same shall iudge him in the last day?</hi>

   <p>The first part vvhich conuinceth the <hi>Iewes,</hi> may seeme at first sight, to make nothing for, or against, any here, nor much to cōcerne; Christs cause in this; <hi>Island;</hi> but as it like a greate wheele moueth all the lesser, and like a <hi>Roote</hi> yealdeth sap and life to all the branches: the worke it selfe is but litle, and that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect fills not a fifth part of it; vouchsafe therefore, greate <hi>Kinge,</hi> youre Roiall and Princely patience, and youre <hi>Maiestie</hi> shall soone see how reuiued heresies doe eate at the roote both of Church and State, and that vvith noe ordinarie danger. Yet doe I not strike at the <hi>Arminians,</hi> but through the sides of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians,</hi> nor soe much at theire tenets, as at theire practises: nor at them, but as they are against the Kingdom of God, the honour of youre <hi>Maiestie,</hi> &amp; the peace, safety, and strength of youre Kingdoms: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that donne by me, but by Christs owne <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> and <hi>Complaint,</hi> and such consequences as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follow frō the same: the examples out of holy writ, and other Histories, here gathered, beeing only Instances of the neuerfailing truth of that, which Christ in his Confession denied or affirmed: Now therefore, the greate God of heauen and earth, in whose <hi>hands</hi> are the <hi>hearts</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> giue youre <hi>Maiestie</hi> to see, embrace and establish the things that <hi>belonge to the peace</hi> of youre Kingdoms,
