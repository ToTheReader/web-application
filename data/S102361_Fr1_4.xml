   <head>THE
PREFACE
OF LVCIVS
FLORVS.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE People of
<hi>Rome,</hi> from
King <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
to <hi>Caesar
Augustus,</hi> for the space of
seuen hundred yeeres, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
so many noble deeds
both in peace, and warre,
that if a man compare the
magnitude of their empire
with the number of the
yeeres, hee will thinke it
<pb facs="12"/>
greater, then for the time.
They displayed their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ensignes so farre, and
wide vpon the globe of the
earth, that such as reade
their performances, may
learne in them, not the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of one people, but of all
mankind: For they were
tossed with so many labors,
and perils, that to establish
their empire, Vertue and
Fortune seeme to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
Which thing, though
it be also principally worth
the knowing; neuerthelesse,
for so much as the very
greatnesse it selfe is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
to it selfe, and the
varietie of matter makes
the mind abruptly flit from
one thing to another;<note place="margin">Aciem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionis abrumpit.</note> I will
<pb facs="12"/>
imitate them who draw the
maps of countreyes, and
comprehend the whole
image <hi>of that great Body,</hi>
within as it were a narrow
table: And in so doing,
my hopes are, that I shall
offer vp somewhat towards
the admirable honours of
the whole worlds soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
people, when toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and <hi>yet distinctly</hi> in
it selfe, I shall aduance into
view their empires vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
greatnesse. Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
therefore the <hi>whole</hi>
people of <hi>Rome</hi> were but
as one single person; and
<hi>then</hi> running ouer all their
time, thinke how they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
and how they grew
strong; then, how they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb facs="13"/>
to a certaine flower
as it were of youth, and
how in a sort they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
waxed old, wee shall
therein find foure degrees,
or <hi>maine</hi> progressions.</p>
   <p>The first reuolution was
vnder kings, for almost two
hundred and fiftie yeeres;
in which space they wrestled
and stroue about their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-citie
with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
This may be the
time of their infancie. The
following period, from the
Consulship of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and
<hi>Collatinus,</hi> to the Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi>
and<note n="*" place="margin">Marcus.</note>
      <hi>Quintus Fuluius,</hi>
comprehends those two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
and fiftie yeeres, in
which they subdued <hi>Italy.</hi>
      <pb facs="13"/>
This was a time most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for manhood, and
deeds of Cheualrie. It may
well be therefore tearmed
their youthfull age. From
hence, to <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi>
are <hi>those other</hi> two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
and fiftie yeeres, in
which he settled peace tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
all the world. And this
compasse of time is the very
Mans estate, and as it were
the strength and ripenesse of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. From
<hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> to our
dayes, there haue not passed
many fewer then two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
yeeres; in which,
through the vnworthinesse
of Emperours, the force <hi>of
the Roman people</hi> waxt
old, as it were, and wasted
<pb facs="14"/>
it selfe: sauing, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the gouernment of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian,</hi>
their sinewes requicken,
and beyond all expectation,
the old age of the empire,
as if the youth thereof
were restored, growes
greene againe,
and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth.</p>
