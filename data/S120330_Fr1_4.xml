   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had finished my poore labours in answering, and compared Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Perkins</hi> Treatise, the Papists accusation, and my defence toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I could see no better course for thy vnderstanding of al three, then to set downe all three, euery one in the Authers owne words. Now I came at the last to view them all three together, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the booke driueth me into some feare least that which I intended for thy good in reading of it, should proue an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of thy forbearing to read it. Only my hope is, that knowledge of the truth being the end of thy reading, thou wilt not thinke much of a little more paines or cost, which necessity hath laid vpon them, who desire to benefit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by vnderstanding the difference betwixt the Gospell and Popery. That neither my tediousnesse nor darkenesse might offend or stay thee, I haue laboured for as much plainenes as I could well attaine to, with so much breuitie. The skoffing, reuiling, and slaundering of the Aduersarie, I haue chosen rather to referre to God the reuenger of all such Antichristian dealing, and to thy discreete and Christian consideration, then to answere in the like measure and kind of sinning. But if it please thee in reading of the booke to
<pb facs="6"/>
compare the testimony he giueth of M. <hi>Perkins</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Reader, with his carriage toward him in the whole course of his answering, thou shalt easily discerne, that either the one or the other, or both, must needs be without iudgement or conscience. For my course of answering I shall need to say nothing, because I spake sufficiently of it in my answere to the twelue Articles. In this present booke thou mayest know where M. <hi>Perkins,</hi> the Aduersarie, and my defence beginneth and endeth, as well by the difference of the print, as by the great or capitall letters set in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; <hi>W. P.</hi> for <hi>William Perkins, D. B. P.</hi> for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie vnknowen, hiding himselfe vnder those three let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>A. W.</hi> for <hi>Antony Wotton.</hi> And this course is obserued throughout the whole booke, saue a few places, where the marginall notes would afford no roome to those letters. I haue further added some short answers in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin here and there, which thou maiest perceiue by the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and letter. It remaineth that I humbly and earnestlie intreat thee to examine what we haue written without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice and partiality, and to acknowledge the truth with liking, where it shall please God to make it euident vnto thee: which he will certainly doe according to his promise, if thou call vpon him in humility and faith, for the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his holy Spirit; To whose gratious direction I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thee now and euer. </p>
