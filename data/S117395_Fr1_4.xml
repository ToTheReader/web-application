                 <title>A full, ample and punctuall discouery of the barbarous, bloudy, and inhumane practises of the Spanish Inquisition, against Protestants : with the originall thereof. Manifested in their proceedings against sundry particular persons, aswell English as others, upon whom they have executed their diabolicall tyrannie. A worke fit for these times, serving to withdraw the affections of all good Christians from that religion, which cannot be maintayned without those props of Hell. First written in Latin by Reginaldus Gonsaluius Montanus, and after translated into English</title>

   <head>The translatour to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no good nature (gentle Reader) that beholding on a stage an old Tragedie, wherein be represented the miseries of any one man, or the ruine and desolation of a whole countrie, will not accompany the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions of the players, with some inward affection, yea, sometimes with teares and vehement compassion. Which if we doe in a play, whereof the matter is many times but inuented, and howsoeuer it be true, yet happened in Countries farre off and long agoe, the parties neither touching vs in kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, nor the matter in example: surely the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous practices and most horrible executions of the <hi>Spanish Inquisition,</hi> declared in this booke, which now is brought with fire and sword into the low Countries, the sodaine imprisonment of honest men without processe of law, the pitifull wandring in exile and pouertie of personages somtime rich and wealthy, the wiues hanging on their husbands
<pb facs="6"/>
shoulders, and the poore banished infants on the mothers brests, the monstrous racking of men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order of law, the villanous and shamelesse tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of naked women beyond all humanitie, their miserable death without pitty or mercy, the most reprochfull triumphing of the popish Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue ouer Christians, as over Painimes and Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, the conquering of subiects as though they were enemies, the vnsatiable spoyling of mens goods, to fill the side paunches of ambitious idle shauelings, the slender quarrels picked against king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and nations, and all this onely to hoise vp a pild polling priest aboue all power and authoritie that is on earth: these things ought surely much more to moue vs to compassion: Being no stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play, but a matter fit for any Poet to make a Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of hereafter, either for that it will bee an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment most lamentable, or most incredible to them which shall not haue seene it; The persons which suffer being our neighbours by their habitation and dwelling place, our acquaintance by entercourse, our friends by long acquaintance, of the same houshold of faith, and our very brethren in Christ. And if we weepe when we see cruelties set forth in playes, because the like either hath happened to vs heretofore, or hereafter may betide vs, then have we not ouely good cause in these calamities of our poore brethren to bewaile that which happened to them, but also to feare what will follow vpon vs. For if we, that not many yeares since felt but a taste of this Iron whippe, and since haue enioyed quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="6"/>
and leisure to serue God, thinke our selues sure and the storme passed, and that wee be but hearers and seers, and haue no parts in this Tragedie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that we are vncharitable in so lightly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the griefes of others, we doe also foolishly and dangerously abuse our selues. For who is so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the holy Complot and Conspiracie agreed on by the Pope and his Champions for the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the generall esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of this <hi>Inquisition?</hi> Behold the attempts in Scotland, the proceedings in France, the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Flaunders, and if we Englishmen haue one of the last parts, let vs bee sure, as in Tragedies the last parts and Actes be most dolefull, so wee neuer knew yet what persecution meant in comparison, to that is meant and threatned vs now. If the Diuels holinesse, and his lieutenant generall, the Popes maiestie, were a little moued then, they bee now (doubt ye not) enraged, and transubstantiate into furour and horne woodnesse, to see their reuenues decay, their Monasteries and Synagogues defaced, their villanies detected, their noble champions slain. And therefore you must set before your eyes the <hi>Diuell</hi> in person, and the <hi>Pope his chaplaine and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour,</hi> gotten vp into the top of some high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and from thence shewing the kingdomes of the earth to such Princes as will themselues fall downe and worship, and thereto driue the world. Which is so farre off from any figuratiue speech, as it is knowne to be the very Platforme and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all these broyles and troubles. Be not deceiued
<pb facs="7"/>
(good Reader) vnderstand the world, these men seeke no religion. For how can they seeke Religion, that thinke there is no God? They seeke the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and wealth of the world. If the Gospell would allow ambition, pleasure, profite, the <hi>Pope</hi> would haue long since beene a protestant. If <hi>Popery</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed preaching of the truth, reformation of life, pouertie: <hi>Popery</hi> had beene esteemed (as it is) <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi> and so persecuted. But the Pope would bee thought most holy, and be indeed most mightie; the world is falne from him: he hath spent all: nought comes in to supply; he hath a great sort to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, a great sort to reward, a great pompe and state to maintaine. Trow yee these things will bee raised of the spoile of poore Protestants? Nay, be thou sure of it, <hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Protestant,</hi> if thou be rich, and hast any fleece, it will be all one. Thy land will vndoe thee: thy goods will condemne thee. Euen as the good Citizen of Rome, <hi>Q. Aurelius</hi> in <hi>Scyllas</hi> time, that was neither of the one side nor the other, but lamented the spoile and misery of his countrie, when as he came into the market place, and heard hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> name read among them that were proscribed to death, cryed out, <hi>O vnhappy man that I am: my house at Alba is the cause of my death,</hi> and by and by was openly slaine. If euer there were time like to <hi>Scyllas,</hi> it is now in our dayes, in which hungry need, and vnsatiable couetousnesse armed with crueltie will spare nothing. The seruant will betray his master: the friend his friend and acquaintance: the brother shall murther his brother. As in the same time
<pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>L. Catilina,</hi> he that after would haue set fire on the Citie, slew his owne brother, and after prayed <hi>Scylla</hi> that hee might bee proscribed. The which being granted him, he recompenced with killing another, <hi>M. Marius</hi> one of the contrary faction, and bringing his head, the blood running along his armes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it in the market place to <hi>Scylla,</hi> and ranne to the holy water-pot of <hi>Apollos</hi> temple which was hard by, to wash his hands, a very fit vse of such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water. The which storie I the rather recite, spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an infinite sort of our times, because yee may vnderstand by the way, that <hi>Idols and holy water</hi> bee ancient things, such as were before Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and will be continued by his enemies till he come againe, and that knowing the Papists religion to be no better then those heathenish peoples was, their couetousnesse greater, their need more, their cruelty farre passing not onely all present example, but also all written history, you may daily looke for worse then <hi>Scillas</hi> time if they ouercome: hauing on the other side no fierce or cruell <hi>Marius</hi> to withstand them, nor to quarell with them for the gouernment; but a poore flock of silly sheepe behinde their shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard affraid of the wolues, halfe yeelding, halfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their liues: and on their sides thousands of desperate <hi>Catilines,</hi> that to repaire their decayed states, will not spare neither to kill their owne bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, nor to fire their countrie: and hauing at all times, but specially now such a <hi>Scilla,</hi> vnder whose banner they fight, as the old <hi>Scilla</hi> may in respect of this, be both forgiuen and forgetten. Take heed, we
<pb facs="8"/>
haue now to our holy Father a Frier, no secular priest, but a regular H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lhound, who though he think it no robbery to be equall in pompe with his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, and in malice with the diuell his father: yet hath he vouchsafed to take vpon him the shape of a man, and goeth (they say) on foot, and maketh his tenants the stewes keepe-in like good huswiues, which is no small reformation, and doth good deeds at home, and worketh wonders (forsooth) whiles he vndoeth all abroad, and openeth such a gap for the great Seigneur the <hi>Turke,</hi> as neuer was yet made. But what will not these fellowes do to reuenge their fall? and what ought not we rather to endure, then to admit these spirituall tyrants? who would not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be conquered of a mightie Prince and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable (in comparison) then of a villaine bankrupt priest? who hath for these eight or nine hundred yeares occupied the whole world of credite; and now he should come to accompt, killeth his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours. A miserable choice, but yet a ready choice. For the <hi>Turke</hi> contenteth himselfe with honour and tribute, permitting religion. The <hi>Pope,</hi> no honour will satisfie him, no riches suffice him, no blood as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage him: neither the death of the liuing, nor the soules of the dead, will content him. Whose very name should not be spoken of without <hi>Surreuerence</hi> and great contempt, for the basenesse and vilenesse of his counterfeit state, were hee not so iustly to be hated and abhorred as the great abuser and very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Antichrist of the world, and sworne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of God and man. The cruell and tyrannicall
<pb facs="8"/>
outrages of whose Inquisitours founded and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by the Diuell and this Antichrist, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with the milde proceedings and discipline of Commissioners appointed by God and his Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we shall thereby see euidently by the heauenly iudgement and sentence of wise <hi>Salomon,</hi> to which mother the liue childe appertaineth: To the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish whore, who (in despite that she cannot possesse the poore infants that belong not to her, to smother them sleeping with the huge and filthy body of her traditions and ceremonies) seeketh by all meanes possible to diuide and mangle them: or to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and pitifull mother the true Church of the faithfull, whose fathers and ministers (knowing of whose spirit they are) seeke with all gentlenesse to call home the lost ones, and watchfully to nourish them. Whose prince imitating the peaceable raigne of <hi>Salomon,</hi> hath not so much as executed the false Prophets, not killed the wolues, not destroyed the foxes. Onely they are tyed vp short, which though it bee no such suretie for the little ones as worldly wisdome doth require, and necessitie long since hath cried out for, yet is it to them no small griefe to see the Lambes feed before their eyes, and the poorest shepheards least whelpe baying at them: whilest they in the middest of their gluttony and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, houle for hunger of their brethrens flesh, and thirstinesse of their blood, and pine for very enuie of the proceeding of Gods word. If the poore igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people will but compare the imprisonmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s of the persecuted Protestants, with the restraints of the
<pb facs="9"/>
bridled Papists, their famine with these mens fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, their tongues fettered with Iron torments, with the libertie of railing, that our men haue and vse, seditiously against their Prince, &amp; blasphemous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against God, their most miserable and strange kindes of deathes, with our mens liuing and liking, they shall easily know the tree &amp; the persons by the fruit. Wherefore (good Reader) hauing so euident markes of their woluish and rauening natures, and so good notice of their bloody conspiracie, &amp; so way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very true cause of all these troubles and wars that be in Christendome, and thereto conferring the present executions &amp; slaughters, euen in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours house, the fire whereof may soone imbrace our owne, let vs be stirred vp to pray for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, and that it would please God, to turne from vs the same iustly deserued plague for our vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse. Let vs be strong in faith, and couragious in deed, to repell these common enemies from our countrie whensoeuer they shall offer that they haue so long determined. And if in this translation, there shall happen to be some faults, pardon them till the next impression; for the meaning of the translatour was onely to make thee speedily vnderstand of so great and so imminent a perill: besides, that thou mightest vse this booke as a taste in the meane space, whiles the booke of Martyres be reprinted, wherein there is a most plentifull and notable History of the like matter and argument.</p>
