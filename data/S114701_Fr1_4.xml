      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not ignorant (good Reader) how vngratefull a thing it is, to deale by way of Censure or reformation, in those things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in others haue gone before; and many times for the smart that followeth, do men beshrow their owne fingers. Yet the warrant of a good calling will breed peace in his conscience, that herein shall endeuour the obseruance of these rules of Loue, to wit, <note n="a" place="margin">
         <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>13.5. Loue thinketh not euill.</hi>

      <hi>referre his owne paines to the glorie of God in the good of others:</hi> Hereto I aime in this second edition of this booke. For my calling to this worke, when mine accusers stand forth, the executors of the dead shall answer for my discharge. And for mine indeuour to doe good; the small gaine of this reuised worke, was truly returned to the right owners thereof: If thou therefore returne glorie to God, for good receiued to thy soule, in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe I haue my desire. Here onely rests the doubt, how this second edition should not be preiudiciall to his good estimation that published the former: I answer, well inough: For I hope he intended <note n="c" place="margin">
         <hi>See his preface towards the end.</hi>
      </note> the glorie of God in the good of his Church, and the credit of the reuerend Author of this worke: Now if any addition be brought hereunto, his intent is furthered, and wherein then can he be greeued? If one man should helpe poore Orphanes to some lands or liuing, he would not thinke himselfe wronged by another, that should enlarge their iust claimes, or settle their posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in a better tenure: so I trust it fareth in this worke; where thou shalt find vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thy diligent view, in some doubtfull<note n="d" place="margin">

      </note> things the Authors meaning truly clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, his method rectified, many repetitions omitted, and the matter (specially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end) somewhat enlarged. If any thing be dissonant to the Authors iudgement in his liue-works (which I hope thou shalt not perceiue) rather charge the fault on me through ignorance, or misunderstanding, than entertaine in thy heart the least conceit of wauering leuitie in so godly, learned, and iudicious a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, who hath so well deserued of thy loue, if thou loue the truth. Thus crauing thy fauourable acceptance of my helping hand, to do thee good, I end with him, <hi>That is the beginning, and the end: Let him that hath an eare heare what the spirit saith vnto the Churches.</hi>
