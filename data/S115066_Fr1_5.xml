   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the light of Natures lamp hath so
shined in the obscure closet of a
Pagans breast, that therby hee
brought forth this no lesse true
then worthy sentence, <hi>Non nobis solùm nati su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
sed ortus nostri partem amici, partem parentes,
part emquè patria vendicat,</hi> VVee are not borne
for our selfes alone, but of our birth our kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk
must haue parte, our freinds likewise
must haue their due, our Countrie also chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
therin her right; how much more
ought the shining Sun of Grace and Fayth
illuminate the Christian heart, wherby to
bring forth a like or better Sentence? as
did hee whoe sayd, <hi>Optabamego ipse Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
esse â Christo pro fratribus meis, qui sunt cognati
mei secundum carnem, qui sunt Israelitae,</hi> I desired
to be <hi>Anathema</hi> my self from <hi>Christ</hi> for my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrē,
<pb facs="7"/>
which be my kinsfolke according to the
fleash, whoe be <hi>Israelites.</hi> And if Nature could
bind vs with so strong a band to our Freinds,
Parents, and Country, how much more should
the link of Grace, and chayne of Charitie tie
vs therunto? Seing then such is my Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that the reuolution of some yeares
calleth vpon mee for performance therof, I
was glad now to haue fownd out a meanes,
wherby at once to discharge three duties,
and by one payment to cancell a threefold
obligation; by presenting this <hi>Rule of Perfection</hi>
to such a house and companie, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of my deer freinds, neerest kinsfolke,
and natiue Countrie. Not, for that I think the
weaknesse of so small a matter can haue
strength enough to dissolue so strong a band,
or so small a present can satisfie so great a
debt; but that I hope yow will take it as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and messanger of a mind more willing
then hable to performe her obligation; which
Rule I hauing squared out according to mine
owne interiour practice since my calling to
Religion (though truly, with great negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence)
and hauing participated the same, and
therwith informed others of my calling
though not of my Countrie; I thought good
now to communicate it vnto others of my
Countrie, though not of my calling; and for
that purpose haue translated it into English,
though with more difficultie then I writ it in
<pb facs="8"/>
the language wherin I made it. For eloquent
words and flowing discourse (I know) yow
expect none, aswell because that our calling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoideth
curiositie and professeth plaine sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie,
and that my so long discontinuance
of the tongue can afford no smooth discourse;
as also (especially) for that in spirituall Rules,
and documēts touching interiour exercise, it
fareth not as in other books which chiefly (or
at least, partly) tend to delight the eare by
pleasant wordes, or moue affection by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
tearmes, but by plainesse of Documents,
and cleernesse of Doctrine to lay open the
way to Perfection, and an easie and familiar
meanes to practice the same. Thus heartily
wishing your dayly progresse in all vertue, I
commend yow to Gods holie protection, and
my self (poor sinner) by your prayers to his
sweet mercie.</p>
