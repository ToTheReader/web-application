      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His discourse, touching the assemblie of the States of <hi>Paris,</hi> and touching the virtue and strength of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon of <hi>Spayne,</hi> was made and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Italian tongue, by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Florence,</hi> which was at <hi>Paris,</hi> whilest the Estates were held and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled there, of purpose (as is to bee supposed) to carrie the same to his Master the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> that so he might represent vnto him the wonderfull estate of the affayres of <hi>France.</hi> But it fell out, that as he did returne into his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and passed by <hi>Amiens</hi> to goe into <hi>Flanders,</hi> his horse keeper being a Briton borne, and vnwilling to hazard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in so long a voyage, and hauing perceiued that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster was no good Catholike (&amp; yet he gathered it by nothing but this, that he called that

      <hi>Biarnois</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi>) he gently parted from him, without telling him any thing that grieued him, or that troubled him in his quiet estate: and to comfort himselfe for the keeping and feeding of two horses, he carried away the better of them, together with the cloake bagge or maile, in which was the originall of the sayd dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. But God would haue him taken by certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious persons of <hi>Chasteauuerd,</hi> and brought before the Maior of <hi>Beau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

In so much that he freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that he had forsaken his Master, after he knew him to be an heretike by this, that he called the <hi>Biarnois,</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi> Now amongst the instruments or stuffe found in the maile,
<note place="margin">Robbers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend right.</note> (whereof there was a solemne Inuentoire taken and made, in the presence of the Maior, and of Doctor <hi>Lucain,</hi> the superintendent or ouerseer of the prizals and pillages) there was found the original or first copie of this Italian dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which the Maior did not vnderstand, and therefore praied the aforesaid Doctor <hi>Lucain,</hi> to translate it into good French. Of which the sayd Doctor excused himselfe, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that though he had skill well to speake the language of <hi>Rome,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Better a bad one then none at all.</note> yet he was not able, or knew not to appropriate it to the French finenes or naturalnes of their owne tongue. So that indeede they were inforced to giue it to a certaine little Monke or Frier called <hi>Romipete,</hi> who the next day after did disrobe and vnapparell himselfe from his vsuall garments, euen for very haste that he had to be at <hi>Paris,</hi> at the solemne blessing &amp; generall procession,
<note place="margin">Deuotiō good enough for so bad an action.</note> which the Legate should make for that same holy and Catholike enterprise, that <hi>Peter Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> was to doe, &amp; had vndertaken and sworne it vnto him, namely, to assault &amp; murther his Maiestie at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lun</hi> Howbeit, it so fell out, that the sayd poore Monk was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by certaine Gentlemen, and found charged with the said discourse, which seemed so pleasant vnto thē, that presently one of thē turned it into French, &amp; so from hand to hand the translatiō of it came euen vnto me, which I haue caused to be printed, as well to relieue from paine such as are curious to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all newes or nouelties, as to prouoke thē that yet lāguish vnder the yoke of that tyrānie: for they must needs be rotten &amp; infected lepers indeed if they feele not this pricking goade, &amp; doe not at the leastwise send forth some groanes for their libertie, that is readie to yeeld vp or dye. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
