      <hi>for that which satisfieth not.</hi> But now, he that shall with iudgement reade these ensuing labours, will finde somewhat more than a naked Title to commend them. And albeit diuers of them seeme to be the fruits of his younger yeeres, and come not forth in that lustre and beauty as the Author, had he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to haue made them publicke, could, and would haue sent them, (being transcribed from his Originall Manuscripts, as they fell to hand, without choice) yet such they are, as I perswade my selfe, will passe the eyes of the Learned (who are fittest &amp; ablest to iudge) not without deserued approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is in them as well matter for the vnderstanding to worke vpon, whereby the Reader may be made <hi>Eruditior,</hi> the better Scholar, as to moue the affections, wherby he may
<pb facs="4"/>
become <hi>Melior,</hi> the better Christian. Milke and strong meate both for men and babes; the wise may thence be made more wise, and the weake more strong. Concerning the man himselfe, whose memory in many respects is blessed, how much might be spoken of him, how many singular gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious parts he had, deseruing commendation on his behalfe, imitation on ours, it cannot in a few words be expressed. But for my part, I purpose not here to vndertake a story of his life, I was not so exactly learned therein, neither haue I beene sufficiently instructed for so great a worke; my intentions onely driue at this, namely, to let them know that knew him not, what he was in the generall of his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, confining my discourse within the compasse of a few particulars, lest otherwise the Preface exceeding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the subsequent worke, that witty scoffe might be applyed to me, that somtime by the biting <hi>Cynicke,</hi> was cast vpon the Citizens of <hi>Myndus:</hi>

Loue, Ioy, Peace, Longsuffering, Gentlenesse, Goodnesse, Faith, Meekenesse, Temperance.</hi> In all which graces he had so large a part, that should I runne ouer, and examine them particularly with Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call relation, and application to him, I suppose that a few lines, nay leaues, would not containe the Commentary, that might be written of him.

He alwayes shewed himselfe most ready to minister to the necessity of the indigent and

needy, hauing a tender touch euen naturally that way. Yeerely pensions he allowed whilest he liued, as his great charge would giue him leaue, to be distributed to the poore, as of the place where he was Bishop, so in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where he had meanes, besides the daily reliefe they of the Citie found at his gates. Exhibition of maintenance he continued to diuers poore Scholars in the Vniuersitie of Oxford, whose Parents were not able to sustaine that charge, and was euer forward in succouring and relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing poore Strangers and Trauellers that came vnto him.

So then as true gold is discerned from counterfet mettals, by touching or rubbing of it vpon the stone, as Saint <hi>Basil</hi> some-where notes; and as the Elect child of God is distinguished from the bastard cast-away by his vnfained loue to the brethren as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes,<note place="margin">Basil.</note> and the true Disciples from the false,<note place="margin">

      </note> to wit, Charity, (the Queene of Vertues, as one calls it, the life of Vertues, as another,) that he was no other then a liuely fruitfull plant in Gods Vineyard, a true Disciple, one that had rightly learned Christ, whom God had made a great example of vertue in this declining age, to be admired easier then imitated. But his Piety it must not be forgotten; His care of Gods true worship and zeale vnto his house, which he euer loued, it is and will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred with much honour to his Name. It was his ioy to see a company of well-deuoted people to meete together to praise God; and to that end did not onely continue a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, (begunne in his Predecessors time,) to be read in the Cathedrall weekely on the Tuesday, by the grauest Orthodox and conformable Preachers within his Dioeces, from the time of his entrance into that See, till he died, being full twelue yeeres and vpwards: but did vsually present himselfe in the Assembly at Diuine prayers and Sermons, both on the Sabbath and Lecture dayes, if vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of occasions hindred not. And herein as his Piety and Zeale is set forth vnto vs, so likewise his Wisedome too;

Priuate deuotions are good, commended in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yea, and commanded too, but publike are preferred. <hi>Dauid</hi> professed that he would call vpon God, Euening, Morning, and at Noone-day, and praise him alwayes,<note place="margin">

      </note> and would be there, and thus he gained by it: from men a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend esteeme; He was honoured and beloued of all sorts. And God, I doubt not, in Christ, (after whom he longed, euen to his last gaspe,) hath giuen him to finde the fruit of his holinesse in the fruition of that blessed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
<pb facs="6"/>
where is nothing but fulnesse of ioy for euer-more.</p>
   <p>Touching the things of the world, he carried himselfe as though he looked not after them, nor cared for them; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer seeking for (as I haue credibly heard) any preferment that he had, before it was by Gods Prouidence cast vpon him. But this I can truly report and from his owne mouth too (who was not wont to speake otherwise then became the seruant of God) that the Bishopricke of Gloucester was conferred vpon him vnsought for, and vnlookt for, at the suit of the most Reuerend Father, the Lord Archbishop of Canterburie his Grace that now is.<note place="margin">

Ofhis exactnesse in those languages, this may be a sufficient testimony; that he was thought worthy by his Maiesty of blessed memory, to be called vnto the Great worke of the last Translation of our English Bible: wherin he was not <gap reason="foreign">

      </note> being the same that now is extant in our Church Bible, the Originall whereof I haue seene vnder his owne hand. And here I haue occasion offered me to say something of his modesty and great humility, who though he were so vsefull an instrument, so strong a helper in the former worke, as also the sole Author of this latter, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, (a comely gate to so rich and glorious a Citie,) yet could I neuer heare that he did at any time speake of either with any attribution to himselfe more than to the rest. So that as the Sunne the neerer it commeth to the <hi>Zenith,</hi> or point of the firmament ouer our heads, the lesse shadow it casteth, so certainely the higher he mounted into the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Diuine and humane knowledge, the lower and lesse he seemed to be in his owne eyes, <hi>High in worth,</hi>

   <p>And now concerning the course of his studies (wherein I would propose him as a patterne to be imitated by young Students in our Vniuersities,) Hee constantly applied himselfe from his youth, (as they that were then acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him knew,) to the reading of Antient Classicall Authors of the best note in their owne languages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as also with Neoterickes, he was plentifully stored, and lusted after no worldly thing so much as bookes, <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius rei praeterquam librorum auarus,</hi> was sometime his owne speech merrily, but (as I perswade my selfe,) truly. For there was scarcely a booke (in so great a number) to be found in his Library, especially of the Antients, that he had not read ouer <hi>à capite ad calcem,</hi> as hath beene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by those who haue had the perusall of them since his death. He ran through the Greeke and Latin Fathers, and iudiciously noted them in the margent as he went, being fitted for that purpose, by the dexterous vse of his pen, wherein he came not short, euen of Professors themselues in that faculty. The Rabbins also, so many as he had with their Glosses and Commentaries he read and vsed in their owne Idiome of speech, and so conuersant he was and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in the Chaldie, Syriacke and Arabicke, that he made them as familiar to him almost as his owne natiue tongue.

But for the Hebrew this I can affirme from credible rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that being vpon a time sent vnto, and requested (whilest he was a Residentiary in the Cathedrall Church of Hereford,) by the then Deane of the same Church, (vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some speciall occasion,) to reade the first Lesson at Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prayer there; He yeelded thereunto; and hauing with him a little Hebrew Bible, (the same I suppose that he afterwards vsed to his death, and I haue oftentimes seene) of <hi>Plantins</hi> Impression, <hi>sine punctis</hi>; He deliuered the Chapter thence in the English Tongue plainely, and fully to that learned and iudicious Auditory; (farre be from all the least suspition of ostentation in him for that act, that neuer knew to boast of himselfe, or any thing that he had, or any thing that he did.) Stories of all times he knew, and for his rich and accomplished furniture in that study, had this <hi>Eulogium</hi> giuen him by a graue and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Bishop of this Kingdom,<note place="margin">Bis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
