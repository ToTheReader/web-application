   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ithout Raine the Plant withereth, and without encouragement Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fainteth: a benefit bestowed deserues thankfulnesse: and your Honors fauour enforceth my acknowledgement of the great comfort receiued by you in my godly studies. Wherefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but sort your Vertues with the Honourable, and your Praise with the Worthies. And although the Sea hath no neede of the small Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, yet doe they runne into it;
<pb facs="4"/>nor the Moone of the Stars, yet doe they rise with it: so the fulnesse of your Honors wisedome needes no view of my meane and simple stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; nor the light of your knowledge the pervsing of my slender and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Labors, yet am I bold to present them vnto your Honour, who in aboundance of meekenesse did neuer repel the industrious, nor disdaine the simple, (as I by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence haue formerly found by your good acceptance, and doe still hope of your Honorable continuance.) At this time therefore I doe Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate vnto your Honor, <hi>the Afflicted mans Vow,</hi> made in his perplexity &amp; penitencie, (he lately beholding <hi>Adams</hi> Tragedy,) wherin he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Adams</hi> sin as a heauy stone fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon him, and all Man-kinde, ready to bruise and to grinde him
<pb facs="4"/>to pouder, had not Christ in mercy put vnder his hand for his great and most happy preseruation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Honor shall finde this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted man now meditating, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and praising God, wishing ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly (if it were possible) while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in this world, that the thoughts of his hart might be alwaies cleane, the words of his mouth euer holy, the workes of his hands euer iust, &amp; the wayes of his feete euer plaine: that in the end he might with God rest in peace, and be glorified with him in heauen. To the which place and glory, I beseech the Almightie to bring you and your noble Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to your euerlasting and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ioyes without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>
