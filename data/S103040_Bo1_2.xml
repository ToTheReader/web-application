   <p>BRother, if you meet with your <hi>Iethro's</hi> counsell
returned from beyond the seas, and as much
beyond your expectation preserued aliue, as his
sonne in law was against <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Iniunction, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
as much as you will, but bee no more offended
then you haue cause. <hi>Ioab</hi> sinned wider on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand in destroying <hi>Dauids Absolom,</hi> contrary
to his serious charge, yet <hi>Ioab</hi> was pardoned, and
yet no brother. I haue noted you hitherto inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for your owne publishing of any thing of your
owne; whether out of iudgement, modesty, curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
or melancholy, I iudge not: but when others
haue aduentured them with fruit and acceptance,
into the light, I haue seene you rest content with
the publique good The like leaue I haue taken,
expecting like successe, assuring you and my selfe
of the generall welcomnesse and vsefulnesse heerof
<pb n="72" facs="40"/>
to all whom it concernes, which are the greatest
number of the land, euen so many as haue any refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to Sessions and Assises, if not all sorts of
Christians. Onely I feare that the corruption of
our times is growne so grosse and <hi>Eglon</hi>-like, that
it doth not <hi>Ebud</hi>-like enough sharpen the poynts,
and send them home to the heft, that they may
reach to the quicke. I had my selfe added thereto a
proiect and perswasion for the redresse of many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses
crept into offices and officers, hauing spent
so much time in the study of the law, and execution
of some offices, as made me weary of the errours I
saw, and heartily wish the reformation of them:
but fearing I haue learned too much bluntnesse &amp;
plumpnesse of speech among the Lutherans, which
is here as prime a quality, as smoothnes with you,
as also loth to meddle out of mine orb, in my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
thoughts I suppressed it. And so wishing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this, many diligent, conscionable and ingenuous
Readers and Appliers, and to them Gods blessing
and the fruit intended, I take my leaue. From <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing</hi>
in <hi>Prusia.</hi>
