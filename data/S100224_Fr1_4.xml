   <head>THE PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
   <p>CONSIDERING with my selfe (Gentle Reader) all men to be wandring Pilgrims in this world, and their liues to be nothing else but a weary, and tedious Pilgrimage heare on Earth, their home being Heauen from whence they are banished by reason of their Pride and Disobedience; I throughly persuaded my selfe, that it would be very gratefull and pleasing vnto many, if vnder the title of a Pylgrimage to Paradise, I should write the life of this Blessed Saint: by the which, I shall not only shew my selfe gratefull for the manifold benefits I haue receiued from her bounteous Liberality, whereby I am obliged to imploy the best of my endeauours to her honour and prayse: but also (as I hope) stir vp the hartes of some to follow her happy steppes, to their greater profit, her more glory, and no small comfort vnto my selfe.</p>
   <p>For what wandring Pylgrime would not be glad of so safe a Guide? VVhat sinner would not reioyce
<pb n="10" facs="9"/> at so happy a Light? what VVretch would not fly to so sweet a Patronesse? or what true Christian would not be moued with so rare example? <hi>Cuius enim vel saxeum pectus illae huius peccatricis lacrymae ad exemplum poenitendi non emolliant</hi> (saith <hi>S. Gregory?</hi>) For whose brest euen of stone, would not the teares of this sinnefull woman moue, and soften to the like example of repentance?</p>
   <p>I haue therfore deuided her life into diuers dayes Iourneys, according as the grace of the Holy Ghost gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Blessed Penitent, that we may the better see the rare handy-worke of the diuine Spirit, and more cleerly discerne the admirable Vertues of this happy Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime, and be the more forcibly moued to the imitation therof; and so learne how to ascend from this vale of teares and misery, vnto the toppe of all comfort and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, which from my hart I wish to all who shall reade this happy Pilgrimage. Read therfore without curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, carpe not at the meanesse of the style, but seeke to imitate the Vertues of the Saint.</p>
