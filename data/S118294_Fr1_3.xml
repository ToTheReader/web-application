      <l>A Pamphlet (Reader,) from the presse is hurld,</l>
      <l>That hath not many fellowes in the world:</l>
      <l>The maner's cōmon, though the matter's shallow,</l>
      <l>And 'tis all true, which makes it want a fellow.</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And because I would not haue you either guld of your mony, or deceiued in expectation, I pray you take notice of my plaine dealing; for I haue not giuen my booke aswelling bumbasted title, of a promising inside of newes; therefore if you looke for any such matter from hence, take this warning, hold fast your mony, and lay the booke downe: yet if you do buy it (I dare presume) you shall find somewhat in it worth part of your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; the troth is that I did chiefely write it, because I am of much acquaintance, and cannot passe the streets, but I am continually stayed by one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to know what newes, so that sometimes I am foure houres before I can go the length of too paire of butts, where such non-sence or sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb facs="3"/>
questions are propounded to me, that calles many seeming wise mens wisedoms in question, drawing aside the curtaines of their vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iug, and laying their ignorance wide open. First <hi>Iohn Easie</hi> takes me, and holds mee fast by the fist halfe an houre, and will needes torture some newes out of me from <hi>Spinola,</hi> whom I was neuer neere by 500 miles; for hee is in the <hi>Pallatinate</hi> country, and I was in <hi>Bohemia.</hi> I am no sooner eased of him, but <hi>Gregory Gandergoose,</hi> an Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Gotham</hi> catches me by the goll, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if <hi>Bohemia</hi> bee a great towne, and whether there be any meare in it, and whether the last fleet of shipps be ariued there: his mouth being stop'd, a third examines mee boldly, what newes from <hi>Vienna,</hi> where the Emperours army is, what the Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> doth, what is become of Count <hi>Buquoy,</hi> how fares all the Englishmen; Where lies the King of <hi>Bohemiaes</hi> forces, what <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> doth, what tydings of <hi>Dampeier,</hi> and such a tempest of inquisition, that it almost shakes my patience in pieces. To ease my selfe of all which, I was inforced to set pen to paper, &amp; let this poore pamphlet (my harrald or nuntius) trauell &amp; talke,
<pb facs="3"/>
whilst I take my ease with silence. Thus much I dare affirme, that whosoeuer hee or they bee, that do scatter any scandalous speeches against the plenty in <hi>Bohemia</hi> of all manner of needfull things for the sustenance of man and beasts, (of the which there is more aboundance then euer I saw in any place else) or whatsoeuer they bee that report any ill successe on the Kings party, this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle booke, and I the Author doth proclaime and proue them false lyers, and they are to be suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for coyning such falshoods, as no well-willers to the <hi>Bohemian</hi> prosperity. One thing I must entreate the Readers patience in reading one hundred lines; wherein, I haue kept a filthy stirre about a beastly fellow, who was (at my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>England,</hi> a piece of a <hi>Graues-end</hi> Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) at which time hee did mee such wrong, as might haue drawne my life in question; for hee falsly sayd that I would haue fired their Towne. I did promise him a ierke or two of my penne at my returne; which now I haue performed, (not out of any mallice, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would bee as good as my word with him.) Thus crauing you to reade if you
<pb facs="4"/>
like, and like as you list. I leaue you a booke much like a pratling Gossip, full of many words to small purpose.</p>
