   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oure famous wayes there be spoken of to those fruitfull and wealthie Ilandes, we doe vsually call <hi>Moluccaes,</hi> continually haunted for gayne, and dayly traueyled for ryches therein growyng. These Ilandes although they stand East from our Meridian, distant almost halfe the length of the world, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame heate, vnder the Equinoctial lyne, possessed of Infidelles and Barbares: yet by our neyghbours great aboundaunce of wealth there is paynefully sought, in respect of the voyage deere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought, and from thence daungerously brought home vnto vs. Our neyghbours I call the Portugalles in comparison of the <hi>Molucchians</hi> for neerenesse vnto vs, for lyke situation west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde as we haue, for theyr vsuall trade with vs, for that the farre South asterlynges doe know this parte of Europe by no other name then Portugall, not greatly acquaynted as yet with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations thereof. Theyr voyage is well vnderstoode of all men,<note place="margin">1. By the south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east.</note> and the Southeasterne way rounde about Affrike by the cape of Good hope, more spoken of, better knowen &amp; traueyled than that it may seeme needefull to discourse thereof any further.</p>
   <p>The seconde way lyeth Southwest, betwyxt the West In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die or South America,<note place="margin">2. By the south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west.</note> and the South continent, through that narrow streicte where <hi>Magellanus</hi> first of all men that euer wee doe reade of, passed these later yeeres, leauyng therevnto therfore his name. This way no doubt the Spanyardes would commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sly take, for that it lyeth neare vnto their dominions there, could the Easterne currant and leuant wyndes as easily suffer them to returne, as speedily therewith they may be carryed thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the which difficultie or rather impossibilitie of striuing agaynst the force both of wynde and streame, this passage is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothyng vsed, although it be very well knowen.</p>
   <p>The thyrd way by the Northeast, beyonde all Europe and <hi>Asie,</hi>
      <note place="margin">3. By the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east.</note> that woorthie and renowmed knight sir <hi>Hugh Willoughby</hi>
      <pb n="231" facs="241"/>
sought to his perill, enforced there to ende his lyfe for colde, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed and frosen to death. And truely this way consisteth rather in the imagination of Geographers, than allowable either in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or approued by experience, as wel it may appeare by the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous trending of the Scythish Cape set by <hi>Ortelius</hi> vnder the eight degree North,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ortel. tab. Asiae.</hi> 3.</note> by the vnlykely saylyng in that Northerne sea alwayes cladde with Yse and Snow, or at the least continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pestred therewith, if happely it be at any tyme dissolued: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydes bayes &amp; shelfes, the water waxyng more shallow towardes the East, that we say nothyng of the foule mystes and darke fogs in the colde clime, of the litle power of the Sunne to cleare the ayre, of the vncomfortable nyghtes, so neare the Pole, fyue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes long.</p>
   <p>A fourth way to goe vnto these aforesayde happy Ilandes <hi>Moluccae,</hi> Syr <hi>Humfrey Gilberte,</hi> a learned and valiant Knyght,<note place="margin">4. By the Northwest.</note> discourseth of at large in his new passage to <hi>Cathayo,</hi> and was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the last yeere by your Ho. seruaunt. M Cap. <hi>Furbisher,</hi> presently takyng vpon him with his company fully to discouer the same, and is now, if I be not deceyued, ready for his voyage. The enterpryse of it selfe beyng vertuous, the facte must doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse deserue hygh prayse, and whansoeuer it shall be finished, the fruites thereof can not be small: where vertue is guyde, there is fame a folower, and fortune a Companion. But the way is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, the passage doubtfull, the voyage not throughly knowen, and therfore gaynesayde by many, after this maner.</p>
   <p>Fyrst,<note place="margin">Ob. 1.</note> who can assure vs of any passage rather by the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west, than by the Northeast? doe not both wayes lye in equall distance from the North pole? stande not the North capes of eyther continent vnder lyke eleuation? Is not the Ocean sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde America farther distant from our Meridian by .30. or .40. degrees West, than the extreame pointes of <hi>Cathayo</hi> Eastward, if <hi>Ortelius</hi> generall Carde of the world be true?<note place="margin">In Theatro.</note> In the Northeast that noble Knyght sir <hi>Hugh Willoughby</hi> perished for colde: and can you than promyse a passenger any better hap by the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west? who hath gone for triall sake, at any tyme, this way out of <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Cathayo?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If you seeke the aduyse heerein of such as make profession in Cosmographie, Ptolome, the father of Geographie,<note place="margin">Ob. 2.</note> and his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
<pb facs="242"/>
children, will answere by theyr Mappes with a negatiue, concludyng moste of the sea within the land, and makyng an end of the world northward, neare the .36. degree. The same opinion, whan learnyng chiefly florished, was receiued in the Romanes tyme, as by their Poetes wrytynges it may appeare: <hi>Et te colet vltima Thule,</hi> sayd <hi>Virgile,</hi> being of opinion, that Iseland was the extreme parte of the world habitable towarde the North. <hi>Ioseph Moletius</hi> an Italian, and <hi>Mercator</hi> a Germane, for knowledge men able to be compared with the best Geographers of our time, the one in his halfe Spheares of the whole worlde, the other in some of his great Globes, haue continued the West Indishe lande, euen to the North Pole, and consequently, cut of all pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage by sea that way.</p>
   <p>The same Doctors, <hi>Mercator</hi> in other of his Globes and Mappes, <hi>Moletius</hi> in his sea carde, neuerthelesse doubting of so great continuance of the former continent, haue opened a goulph betwixt the West Indies and the extreme northerne lande: but suche a one, that ether is not to be traueyled for the causes in the first Obiection alleaged, or cleane shut vp from vs in <hi>Europe</hi> by <hi>Groenland:</hi> the South ende whereof <hi>Moletius</hi> maketh firme lande with America, the north parte continent with Lapponlande and Norway.</p>
   <p>Thyrdly, the greatest fauourers of this voyage, can not deny but that if any such passage be,<note place="margin">Ob. 3.</note> it lyeth subiect vnto Yse and snow for the most parte of the yeere, whereas it standeth in the edge of the frostie zone. Before the Sunne hath warmed the ayre, and dissolued the Yse, eche one well knoweth that there can bee no saylyng: the Yse once broken through the continuall abode, the Sunne maketh a certayne season in those partes: how shall it be possible for so weake a vessell as a shyppe is, to holde out amyd whole Ilandes, as it were, of Yse continually beatyng on eche syde, and at the mouth of that goulphe, issuyng downe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously from the North, safely to passe, whan whole mountaynes of Yse and Snow shalbe tombled downe vpon her.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Ob. 4.</note>Wel, graunt the west Indies not to continue continent vnto the Pole, graunt there be a passage betwyxt these two landes, let the goulph lye neare vs than commonly in cardes we fynde it set, namely, betwyxt the .61. &amp; .64. degrees north, as <hi>Gemma Frisius</hi> in
<pb n="232" facs="242"/>
his Mappes and Globes imagineth it, and so left by our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triman <hi>Sebastian Cabote,</hi> in his table, the which my good Lorde your father hath at Cheynies, and so tryed this last yeere by your Honours seruaunt as hee reported, and his carde and compasse doe witnesse. Let the way bee voyde of all difficulties, yet doeth it not folowe that we haue free passage to <hi>Cathayo.</hi> For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples sake. You may trende all <hi>Norway, Finmarke,</hi> and <hi>Lappon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,</hi> and than bow Southwarde to sainct <hi>Nicolas</hi> in <hi>Mosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia:</hi> you may lykewyse in the Mediterranean sea fetche <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and the mouth of <hi>Tanais:</hi> yet is there no passage by sea through <hi>Moscouia,</hi> into <hi>Pont Euxine,</hi> now called <hi>Mare Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giore.</hi> Agayne, in the aforesayde Mediterranean sea, we sayle to Alexandria in Egypt, the Barbares bryng theyr pearle and spices from the <hi>Moluccaes</hi> vp the read sea and Arabian goulph to <hi>Sues,</hi> scarsely three dayes iourney from the aforesayde ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: yet haue we no way by sea, from Alexandria to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luccaes,</hi> for that <hi>Isthmos</hi> or litle streicte of lande betwyxt the two seas. In lyke maner, although the northerne passage bee free at .61. degrees latitude, and the West Ocean beyonde America, vsually called <hi>Mar del zur,</hi> knowen to be open at .40. degrees eleuation, for the Ilande <hi>Giapan,</hi> yea .300. leagues nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly aboue <hi>Giapan:</hi> yet may there bee lande to hynder the through passage that way by sea, as in the examples afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayde it falleth out, <hi>Asia</hi> and America there beyng ioyned togeather in one continent. Ne can this opinion seeme alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather friuolous vnto any one that diligently peruseth our Cosmographers doynges. <hi>Iosephus Moletius</hi> is of that mynde, not onely in his playne hemispheres of the worlde, but also in his sea carde. The French Geographers in lyke maner, bee of the same opinion, as by their Mappe cut out in fourme of a harte you may perceyue: as though the West Indyes were parte of <hi>Asie.</hi> Whiche sentence well agreeth with that olde conclusion in the scholes. <hi>Quidquid praeter Africam et Europam est, Asia est.</hi> Whatsoeuer land doeth neyther appertayne vnto Afrike nor to Europe, is parte of <hi>Asie.</hi>

      <pb facs="243"/>
      <note place="margin">5. Ob.</note>Furthermore it were to small purpose to make so long, so paynefull, so doubtfull a voyage by such a new founde way, if in <hi>Cathayo</hi> you should neyther be suffred to lande for silkes and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, nor able to fetche the <hi>Molucca</hi> spices and pearle for piracye in those seas. Of a lawe denying all Aliens to enter into <hi>China,</hi> and forbiddyng all the inhabiters vnder a great penaltie to let in any stranger into that countreys, shall you reade in the report of <hi>Galeotto Perera</hi> there imprisoned with other Portugalles: as also in the Giaponyshe letters, howe for that cause the woorthie traueyler <hi>Xauierus</hi> bargayned with a Barbarian Marchaunt for a great sum of Pepper to be brought into <hi>Cantan,</hi> a porte in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thayo.</hi> The great and daungerous piracie vsed in that seas, no man can be ignorant of, that listeth to reade the Giaponishe and East Indian historie.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Ob. 6.</note>Finally, all this great labour would bee lost, all these charges spent in vayne, if in the ende our traueylers myght not be able to returne agayne, and bryng safely home into theyr owne natyue countrey, that wealth and ryches, they in forreyne regions with aduenture of goodes, and daunger of theyr lyues, haue sought for. By the Northeast there is no way, the Southeast passage the Portugalles doe hold, as Lordes of that seas. At the Southwest <hi>Magellanus</hi> experience hath partly taught vs, and partly we are persuaded by reason, howe the Easterne currant stryketh so furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously on that streicte, and falleth with such force into that narrow goulphe, that hardely any shyppe can returne that way, into our West Ocean, out of <hi>Mar del zur.</hi> The which, if it be true, as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is, than may we say, that the aforesayde Easterne currant or leuant course of waters continually folowyng after the heauenly motions, looseth not altogeather his force, but is doubled rather by an other currant from out the Northeast, in the passage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twyxt America and the North lande, whyther it is of necessitie carryed: hauyng none other way to maintaine it selfe in circular motion, and consequently the force and fury thereof to be no lesse in the streict of <hi>Ania<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Neuerthelesse to approue that there lyeth a way to <hi>Cathayo</hi> at the Northwest, from out of Europe, we haue experyence, namely of three brethren that went that iourney, as <hi>Gemma Frisius</hi> recordeth, and left a name vnto that streicte, whereby nowe it is called <hi>Fretum trium Fratrum.</hi> We do reade againe of a Portugal that passed this streicte, of whom. M. Furbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher speaketh, that was imprisoned therefore many yeeres in <hi>Lesbona,</hi> to veryfie the olde Spanyshe prouerbe, I suffer for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng wel. Likewise <hi>An. Vrdaneta</hi> a fryer of <hi>Mexico</hi> came out of <hi>Mar del zur</hi> this way into Germanie: his Carde, for he was a great discouerer, made by his owne experience and trauayle in that voyage, hath been seene by gentelmen of good credite.</p>
   <p>Now yf the obseruation and remembrance of thyngs breedeth experience, and of experience proceedeth art, and the certeine knowledge we haue in al faculties, as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> best Philosophers that euer were do affyrme:<note place="margin">

      </note> truly the voyage of these aforesayd trauail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that haue gone out of Europe into <hi>Mar del zur,</hi> and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thence at the Northwest, doo moste euidently conclude that way to be nauigable, and that passage free. So much the more we are so to thynke, for that the fyrste principle and chiefe grounde in all Geographie, as great <hi>Ptolome</hi> sayth, is the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of trauel, that is,<note place="margin">

   <p>The fyrste obiection is of no force, that generall table of the worlde set foorth by <hi>Ortelius</hi> or <hi>Mercator,</hi> for it greatly skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not, being vnskylfully drawen for that poynt:<note place="margin">

you may reade in his carde drawen with his owne hande, the mouth of the northwesterne streict lieth neare the .318.

The reason alleaged for proofe of the contrary, may be disproued after this maner.

The naturall course of all waters is downewarde, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of congruence they fall that way where they fynde the earth most lowe and deepe: in respecte whereof, it was erst sayde, the seas to strike from the Northren landes Southerly.

      </note> encreased and diminished by the course of the Moone, hoysed vp and downe through the sundrye operations of the Sonne and the Starres: finally some be of opinion, that the seas be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in part violently about y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world after the daily motion of the highest mouable heauen, in lyke maner as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> elementes of ayre and fyre, with the rest of the heauenly spheres are, from the east vnto the west. And this they do call theyr easterne currant, or leuant streame.<note place="margin">
         <hi>VVhat the easterne cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is.</hi>
      </note> Some suche currant may not be denied to be of great force in the hote Zone, for the nearenes thereof vnto the centre of the Sonne and blustryng easterne wyndes violently dryuing the seas westwarde: howbeit in the temperate climes, the Sonne beyng farther of, and the wyndes more diuerse, blowyng as muche from the north, the west, and south, as from the east, this rule doth not effectually withholde vs from trauey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng eastwarde, ne be we kepte euer backe by the aforesayde Leuante wyndes and streame. But in <hi>Magellane</hi> streict we are violently driuen backe westwarde: Ergo through the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>westerne streicte or <hi>Anian</hi> fret shall we not be able to returne eastwarde? it foloweth not. The fyrst, for that the northwesterne streict hath more sea rome at the least by one hundred Englyshe myles, then <hi>Magellane</hi> fret hath, the onely want wherof causeth all narrowe passages generally to be most violent. So woulde I say in <hi>Anian</hi> gulfe, if it were so narrowe as <hi>Don Diego</hi> and <hi>Zalterius</hi> haue paynted it out, any returne that way to be ful of difficulties, in respect of such streictnes therof, not for the neare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Sonne, or easterne wyndes, violently forceing that way any leuant streame. But in that place there is more sea rome by many degrees, if the cardes of <hi>Cabota,</hi> and <hi>Gemma Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> and that whiche <hi>Tramezine</hi> imprinted, be true. And hytherto reason see I none at all, but that I may as well geue credyt vnto theyr doynges, as to any of the rest.
