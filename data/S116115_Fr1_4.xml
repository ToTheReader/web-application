   <p>If then thou louest not plainnesse, lay this booke by, for such as loue it; for though such diet be not for thy tooth, yet there are thousands of good soules, who like better with such pulse, than with daintier fare, growing faster in knowledge, and stronger in the Faith, with such plaine Instructions, than by more learned Treatises. But if thou be such a one as desirest rather to haue thy conscience, than thy curiositie satisfied; thy heart seasoned, and soule profited, than thy eares tickled with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singnesse of words; thou art hee for whom this was penned: And thou art welcome.
