                 <title>A discovery of subterraneall treasure : viz. of all manner of mines and mineralls, from the gold to the coale; with plaine directions and rules for the finding of them in all kingdoms and countries. And also the art of melting, refining, and assaying of them is plainly declared, so that every ordinary man, that is indifferently capacious, may with small change presently try the value of such oares as shall be found either by rule or by accident. Whereunto is added a reall experiment whereby every ignorant man may presently try whether any peece of gold that shal come to his hands be true or connterfeit [sic] ... Also a perfect way to try what colour any berry, leafe, flower, stalke, root, fruit, seed, barke, or wood will give: with a perfect way to make colours that they shall not stayne nor fade like ordinary colours</title>

   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas divers reasons have joyned together to move mee to take
in hand this Taske: I will declare some few of those that may give the
best satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Reader, in this manner following. First, when
I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the great number of Treasure and riches which lyeth hidden in
the belly of the Earth, and doth no good at all: and also the great benefit
which might accrew to divers Kingdomes and Countries, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting people on
worke; not onely in the discovering of them, but also in the severall
opperations about the digging, melting, and refining of them: also when J
considered that the most part of the Mines hitherto discovered have come
by meere accident: I thought that J could not be better employed, than to give
Rules and Directions for the same: for though it is not unpossible, that
if two men be sent to seeke a thing that is lost, and one of them bee
hudwinked, and the other have the use and benefit of his eyes, yet the
person hudwinked may casually stumble upon it; neverthelesse it is
twenty to one
<pb facs="5"/>that the other should have found it before him: so
in this case, I dare hazard a Wager of twenty to one, that there will bee
more good Mines discovered within seven yeares after the divulging of
these Rules and directions, than hath beene in twenty-seven yeares before:
Also when I considered that many Mineralls found out by accident, have come
to no good by reason of the distance of place from Refiners, and men of
judgement and experience: for that the finders thereof were loath to come so
farre, and spend so much money upon an uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the triall thereof
would require: I thought I could not doe a better deede, than to shew the
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of such trials in such plaine manner that every man may try the
same in his Ship, or Chimney Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with little cost and labour.</p>
   <p>And the truth of this I can witnesse by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for when
I was a youth, and had no skill in these affaires; I happened upon a Minerall
faire to see to, and could find no man neerer than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles which
could enforme me of the true value thereof: whereupon, rather then to be at
such char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as the triall required, I suffered the same to bee
neglected.</p>
   <p>And though that the rules and directions given in this Booke bee
exquisite, and give strong signes of Mettalls and Mineralls; yet I would
bee loath that any man should be thereby animated no take in hand great
Voyages, and consume his Estate in the pursuite of this designe;
deeming them to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible ever to faile: but rather to make this a
<pb facs="6"/>part of his businesse, when hee shall come to
such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as yeeld strong probabilities.</p>
   <p>And so farre I am from envying the former wayes in finding them
by accident, that I have part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken this paines; that those which shall
hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bee found by accident may not bee neglected as I conjecture, that
many have beene by my owne formerly mentioned.</p>
   <p>For I could wish that many men had the like for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that one
had, who in the climbing up of the great Mountaine called <hi>Potersee,</hi>
in the Kingdome of <hi>Perue</hi> in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> tooke hold of
a young Tree to stay himselfe withall; and thereby plucked it up by the
rootes, whereunto there did adheare good Silver Oare; which being tried and
found rich, hath ever since beene wrought upon: and innumerable treasure
and riches have therehence beene digged, to the valew of many hundred Millions
of pounds Sterling.</p>
   <p>And to the end I may no longer stay the Reader with Preambles, I
will divide my booke into <hi>12.</hi> Chapters, like as I did my Booke Printed
<hi>Anno. Dom. 1638.</hi> Entituled, <hi>A discovery of hidden
Treasure:</hi> wishing all those that desire to be skilfull in these
affaires; to take a little paines to read that Booke, which differeth from this
no otherwayes, but as the Art of Surgery differeth from the Art of Physicke:
for as Surgeons deale chiefly with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall parts of mans body, yet
stand in need of the knowledge of all the parts; and as Physitians chiefly
deale with the internall parts, yet cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="6"/>the knowledge of the exterttall parts: So though that
Booke treate wholly upon the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Treasures hidden in the
superficies and exurball parts of the Terrestriall Globe, yet the knowledge
of many things therein contained are very conducible to make a skilfull
Mineralist, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you further to understand, that if any good will bee
done at all, it will bee done with a small Charge: and with somewhat
lesse than before this Booke was published; if you observe the Contents
thereof advisedly: So I take my leave and rest,</p>
