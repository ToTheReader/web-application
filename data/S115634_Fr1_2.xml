      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S you were a great loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser by the death of that servant of God, master <hi>Randall,</hi> who was to you (whilst he lived) a faithful and able coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller, both spiritually and bodily, and from whom you received great satisfaction, direction, and comfort
<pb facs="3"/> in all distresses, whensoever you resorted to him, as you haue oft confessed, to the glory of God. And as your loue was great to him, manifested many wayes, whilst he liued, and in his sicknesse, and since his death, by your much lamenting, and weeping for the death of him, that a man may say of you, and your loue to this man departed, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> did of our Saviour, concerning his loue to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he wept over him, <hi>Behold, how he loued him,</hi> Ioh. 11.36. So I know your <hi>Ladiship</hi> will be readie to receiue, and yeeld your best countenance to whatsoever was his; wherevpon I haue made bolde, in testimony of my thankfulnesse to your <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diship,</hi> for your readinesse (lately) to doe me good, here to Dedicate vnto you a Sermon of his, Preached and penned by his owne hand, as it commeth to your view: I need not perswade your <hi>Ladiship</hi> to accept it, I know the child shall be welcome, both for it owne and Fathers sake, especially, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that it will (in some sort) supply, the losse and absence of a profitable and deare friend, whom though you cannot heare, nor see any more speaking vnto you, and
<pb facs="3"/> counselling <hi>viva voce,</hi> yet you may heare and see counselling you by this and other of his writings; for friends absent, whether liuing or dead, speake by writing, when they cannot be personally present, and <hi>viva voce</hi> speake. Consider then (good <hi>Madam</hi>) when you reade this, and other of this mans writings, you heare him speaking vnto you, and counselling you, and this will be motiue enough, to perswade your <hi>Ladiship</hi> to entertayne what is here presented vnto you. The Lord Iesus, that Counseller of his Church and People, by his Spirit counsell, direct, and comfort you, and so supply the lacke of this, and other friends: he being in stead of all; To him I doe and will commend your <hi>Ladiship</hi> for euery good blessing by Prayer:</p>
