It is thought good by the Kings Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie and his honourable Counsaile, that the most substantiall poynts of the sayd depositions, should be faithfully taken out of the originals, vvhich vvere deposed and confessed by the said M. <hi>George,</hi> and <hi>Dauid Grahame</hi> of <hi>Fentrie,</hi> before the honourable persons deputed by the Kinges Maiestie and his highnesse Counsell to that effect, and subscribed vvith their ovvn hands, &amp; for the greater ease of the memory of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, should be summarily gathered into this forme follovving, vvhich otherwise vvere scattered here &amp; there in their depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, according to the occasion of the diuerse demaundes at diuerse times: for the readier taking vp vvhereof, the times of the depositions and persons deposed, seuerally and coniunct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

All vvhich things are so faithfully done in this volum folovving, that no man how impudent soeuer he be, can iustly challenge it vvith any falsifying, forging, or chaunging one thing for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the vvresting of the original depositions in any the least substantiall parts thereof, as by conferring this extract vvith the first records, vvhich are in the Clerkes hands, most euidēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shal appeare, if any list to looke vpon them. Thou art therfore (good Reader) greatly to consider the goodnes of our God in this case, so vvatchfull ouer his church, for the good and safety ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by discouering such deep &amp; dangerous practises of the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemy, euen thē, vvhē as we thinking nothing lesse, are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to be surprised by their close courses so cunningly &amp; crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conueied, as vve may vvel say vvith the Prophet, our soule is escaped, euen as a bird out of the snare of the Fowlers, &amp;c. As also, thou art to be vvakened vp, to the earnest consideration of the diligence, force and crueltie of our enemies (vvhich yet is nothing abated, but more eager presently then euer heretofore, to atchieue their diuellish intent) &amp; no vvaies to trust them or be secure, as though they vvere sleeping, &amp; minding no danger to vs, vvhile in the meane time, so deeply and deadly they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire vvithin &amp; without, vvith so great force &amp; craft against our religion, landes and liues, that they dare be bolde in their
