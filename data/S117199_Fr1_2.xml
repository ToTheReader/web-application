   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing finished the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this most singuler and profitable worke (the commendation whereof I thinke altogither imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and needelesse for me in this place to handle, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, seeing the preface of the Author, and the iudgement of that most learned and profounde Deuine, M. doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> prefixed and set before it, doe throughly and sufficiently performe the same.) Entring into some consideration with my selfe, vnto whome I might worthily dedicate and offer vp this my simple labour, such as it is, (simple I call it, not in regarde of the matter and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the worke, the which in this respect may verie well beseeme the fauourable &amp; gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acceptation of the best, but in regarde of
<pb facs="3"/> mine owne simplicitie and plainnesse in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation) I called to my remembrance (right worshipfull) the great and vndeserued curtesie verie lately receiued at both your handes, the which being such, as is not only priuately kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen vnto my selfe, but also publikely recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the memorie of manie other welwillers and wishers vnto you both, albeit that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your owne verie worshipfull and frindly natures, I doubted not but that you woulde right curteously accept of priuat thanks, where there wanteth abilitie of making deserued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence: yet could I not persuade my selfe to goe cleare from suspition of vnthankfulnes among others, if I should not leaue some pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like testimonie of my thankfulnesse for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, which is publikely knowen to haue bin receiued. And albeit this way I stande chiefely beholding vnto the right worshipfull your lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and welbeloued sonne in lawe, yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering your worshipful approbation and good liking of his most frindly curtesie extended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes mee in the same, and also your owne friendly trauaile and labour to that effect: as I worthely acknowledge my selfe much bounde vnto you both, so I trust it shall not bee misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in common thankfulnesse to haue ioyned two such gentlemen togither, as besides the neere band of consanguinitie and affinitie, do for many other respectes the one so well like &amp; loue the other. Accept therefore, I most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb facs="3"/> beseech you, this small token of mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained and dutifull good will, proceeding from such a one, who, though in worldly respectes he be not comparable vnto many, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them selues many wayes bound and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding vnto you, yet in all gratefull remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of such surpassing kindnesse founde at your worships handes would be loth to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede of any, of whome at any time you haue best deserued. The Lorde blesse and preserue both your good w. and all yours, and graunt you with them and others vnto whose handes this my simple labour shall hereafter come, to reape such frute thereby, as I by taking vpon me to finish and publish the same, haue vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly wished, and heartily hope for: to wit, that God may bee glorified, you edified, his Church and people instructed and profited in further knowledge and increase of his trueth, and in expressing the frutes of the same in a godly and holie conuersation through Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
