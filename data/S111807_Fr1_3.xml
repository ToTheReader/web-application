   <p>How much you shal make me, and the rest of your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate frends beholding vnto you, I list not to discourse: and therfore grounding vpod these alledged reasons, that the suppressing of this Tragedie, so worthy for y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> presse, were no other thing then wilfully to defraud your selfe of an vniuersall thank, your frends of their expectations, and sweete G. of a famous eternitie.
