   <head>TO THE MODEST READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He wisest of Kings, and men, saies, that <hi>of writing Bookes there is no end.</hi> True, saies a late, but witty comment, <hi>there is no end of writing Bookes which are written to no end.</hi> The exposition seemes good, and agreeable to the meaning of
<pb facs="47"/>
      <hi>Salomon,</hi> (who in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I write, not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) in all probability mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth such Bookes when he saies, that <hi>much reading is awearinesse to the flesh:</hi> for certainely there are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, of which a man can neuer reade so much but he will still desire more, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of <hi>Lipsius</hi> vpon <hi>Epictetus, Pluris facio cum relego, semper vt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum, &amp; cum repetiui repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendum.</hi> Amongst those Bookes which neuer can be read inough (next to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred) the morall take place, which are written to an end as noble as are their effects
<pb facs="47"/>
admirable. These are they which make vs men indeed, without which (as saith sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <hi>Seneca</hi>) men would be but <hi>maiusculi pueri.</hi> O my Reader! let vs neuer abādon morality, vnlesse we meane to banish all ciuility, and giue our selues ouer to sensuality. Neither let vs scorne these things, because the Heathen writ them; for set the three supernaturall workes aside, taught vs in our Creede, <hi>Creation, Redemption,</hi> and <hi>Sanctification;</hi> and tell me, good Reader, in what we excell them. In what goe we beyond them? nay, in what come we not short of them?
<pb facs="48"/>
Are we not cōtent with their knowledge? doe we not see the whole life of a moderne schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar spent onely to expound one of them? God grant that we (who haue receiued from them all their naturall helps, and in a higher degree haue beene diuinely taught from aboue by Truth, and Life it selfe all truth, and goodnesse) be not found vnthankfull for those humane gifts. If we proudly (vnder the pretence of learning diuinity) despise the studies of humanity, we shall do like him that greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plucking a fruite, throwes away the leaues that both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, and defended it. Let
<pb facs="48"/>
vs then admire, Reader, let vs then reuerence the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, from whose Ocean of knowledge haue flowed these Riuerets of ours. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all let vs not bestow more wonder vpon any, then vpon the <hi>Heauenly Dogge</hi> this Booke treates of; whom, if I cannot stile the most learned, certainely I may call the happiest of the Heathen. His carriage was so strange and austere, and his life so voide of perturbation, that I wonder the superstitious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his time did not adore him as a God, or (at least) as a <hi>Semo.</hi> A Tubbe confined his body, but his minde the
<pb facs="49"/>
bounds of the World could not limit. I know not thy degree of admiration, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but I vow, that if <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> were now at <hi>Corinth</hi> with ioy to <hi>Corinth</hi> I would hie me, and kisse his feete. I had rather go thither to see him that hath the minde, then a furlong to see him that hath onely the fortune of a King. If this treatise giue not a perfect modell of his worth, I craue no pardon, Reader; since I thinke any bastard, languishing language vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to expresse his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. As for his Oration to <hi>Alexander,</hi> I thinke thou wilt thinke it not his owne.
<pb facs="49"/>
They had many enteruiews, and therfore, no doubt, much conference; at all which hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guessed, some part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I may haue bit. I confesse, <hi>Diogenes</hi> made it not, yet many things in it are his owne, and Possibility saies they might haue beene spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to <hi>Alexander.</hi> Suppose the Oration were mine own, I should in this imitate no worse a man then diuine <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> who in most of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings makes <hi>Socrates</hi> speake for him; or <hi>Epictetus,</hi> who speakes more then a little in the person of this olde <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke.</hi> Some things I haue borrowed of other <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
      <pb facs="50"/>
which if thou happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest to discouer, carpe not at it, but thank my iudgement, that for thee did select them. Thinke not the Spider (which produceth a cobwebbe out of her owne body) better then the Bee which gathereth her hony abroade. Yet I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my selfe to be of his minde, who held that a man should haue somthing <hi>à se,</hi> as well as <hi>in se,</hi> and therefore haue not so much tyred my wit with translation, as I haue refreshed it with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. Whatsoeuer is borrowed, or mine owne, I here make thine; for which my hope expectes thankes.
<pb facs="50"/>
Though thou deny to stroke, I trust thou wilt not strike my Dogge, which neuer yet bit honest man. Thou canst not deale so vngently with him; for I know that either his head, his body, or his taile will please thee, if modest thou art, and not preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. I know there are Coltes who will venture to row in waters wherein (to vse the seafaring phrase) they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not liue, that is; they will censure things they cannot see into; not vnlike to that German clowne, who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to be very ready in the ten commandements, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked by the Minister
<pb facs="51"/>
which was the first cōmande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, answered; <hi>Thou shalt not eate.</hi> These I would wish to read Ballads, &amp; books Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladicall, works not befitting a wit that dwels with the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphins</hi> and <hi>Cherubins.</hi> Notwithstanding their sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster opinions, I affirme that he, who cannot pick somthing out of this booke worthy the reading, is vnworthy to read it. To thee, modest Reader, I present my book, offer my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and promise the fruites of my future studies.</p>
   <closer>Farewell.</closer>
