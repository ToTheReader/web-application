   <head>Obseruation vpon the Tale of <hi>Narcissus.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>As not the least of the Fables of the Auncients but had their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
<pb n="106" facs="59"/>
and most of them diuerse mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings also, so no lesse hath this of <hi>Narcissus,</hi> which <hi>Ouid</hi> hath smoothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sung, and I paraphrastically Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glisht after my owne way, and for my owne pleasure. Wherein I am not vnwilling to render (withall) what, as I am taught a little by my owne <hi>Genius,</hi> and more by better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings then my own, the Fable was by the first deuizers therof made to meane. And first, for the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphick parte; the Sence thereof is <note place="margin">the Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick sence.</note> (I conceiue) obuious enough: The Tale tells vs, the god <hi>Cephissus,</hi> a great Riuer in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> that running through the <hi>ager Atticus</hi> or <hi>Attick</hi> field (as the place was aunciently called meetes, and mingles his streames with the Water-nymphe <hi>Liriope,</hi> a narrow brooke so named; and hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them compassed a flat low ground almost Iland-wise, before
<pb n="107" facs="59"/>
their falling together into the <hi>Phale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> gulphe, they were fitly called the Parents of this <hi>Narcissus</hi> or <hi>Daffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dill,</hi> beeing a floure which, (besides the specificall nature it hath to grow, and thriue best in waterish places,) the medowy groundes those waters encompassed, did chiefely yeeld and abound in. This <hi>Narcissus</hi> is fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to eschew and flye the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <note place="margin">the Physick sence.</note> of all women, no lesse then of the Nymphe <hi>Ecco</hi> that is enamour'd and doates vpon him; denoting by this auuersion of his, the nature of the floure that beares his name; for the <hi>daffadill</hi> or <hi>water-lilly,</hi> the seedes thereof especially (as the applyers of them in medcine haue obserued) do powerfully extinguish the ability and desire of carnall copulation, by ouercooling of the Animall seed; no lesse then does Porcelane, Lettuce, <hi>Agnus castus,</hi> Calamint, White vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letts,
<pb n="108" facs="60"/>
and the like of that kinde. From this his before mencioned quality, and the ill effect it workes in mans body, his name <hi>Narcissus</hi> (which is <hi>torpedo, languor, segnities-</hi>slothe, stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, lazinesse) was by the Anncients not vnfitly giuen to this vegitable. And they out of this consideration likewise faigned that <hi>Preserpine,</hi> when <hi>Pluto</hi> rauished her away as she was gathering floures, had her lap full of <hi>Narcissusses;</hi> because lazy &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busied women are most subject vnto such inconueniences. And because slothfull, vnactiue, and vnindustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mindes are for the most parte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of producing any permanent, substantiall or reall effects or frute in any kinde, this fraile flowre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (the symbole of such like imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and dificient inclinations,) was among the number of lost, dead, and soone-to-be-forgotten things, by
<pb n="109" facs="60"/>
those Auncient inuestigators of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures trueths, particularly dedicated to their Infernall gods. The Morall expounders of this Fable will haue <note place="margin">the Morall sence.</note> it meane thus,-<hi>Ecco,</hi> or Fame, (a faire voice) loues and wooes <hi>Narcissus,</hi> or <hi>Philautia;</hi> but the selfe-louing man, enamor'd (like this <hi>Narcissus)</hi> only on himselfe, and blinde to all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures but those of the Sence, despises and slightes the more to be imbraced happinesse of a lasting renowne, and memory; and therefore dying, his fame, and all of him dyes with him, and he becomes only-<hi>charus dis inferis.</hi> A much higher and nobler meaning <note place="margin">the Diuine sence.</note> then any of these before deliuered, is by excellent Authors giuen to this Fable: wherein we must know, that as all the first wise Auncients in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, vnder characters, figures, and simboles of things, layd downe the precepts of their wisdome to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="110" facs="61"/>
so in particular did <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who (as the most autentick <hi>Iamblicus</hi> the <hi>Caldaean</hi> tells vs) deliuered also the most parte of his doctrines in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue, tipick, and symbolick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: among which, one of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments is this-<hi>While the winds breathe, adore Ecco.</hi> This <hi>Winde</hi> is (as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mencioned <hi>Iamblicus,</hi> by consent of his other fellow-<hi>Cabalists</hi> sayes) the Symbole of the Breath of God; and <hi>Ecco,</hi> the Reflection of this diuine breath, or Spirit vpon vs; or (as they interpret it) <hi>-the daughter of the diuine voice;</hi> which through the beatifying splendor it shedds &amp; diffuses through the Soule, is justly worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced and adored by vs. This <hi>Ecco</hi> descending vpon a <hi>Narcissus,</hi> or such a Soule as (impurely and vitiously affected) slights, and stops his eares to the Diuine voice, or shutts his harte frō diuine Inspirations, through
<pb n="111" facs="61"/>
his being enamour'd of not himselfe, but his owne shadow meerely, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>d (buried in the ordures of the Sence) followes corporall shadowes, and flyes the light and purity of Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall Beauty, he becoms thence (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dispoyled, (as the great <hi>Iamblicus</hi> speakes) of his propper, natiue, and celestiall vertue, and ability,) an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, weake, worthlesse thing, and fit sacrifize for only eternall obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the <hi>dij inferi;</hi> to whom the Auncients (as is before noted) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed and dedicated this their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy, stupid, and for-euer-famelesse <hi>Narcissus.</hi>
