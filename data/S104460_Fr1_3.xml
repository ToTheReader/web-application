      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E is counted a worthie Magistrate, who is seen a long time prudently &amp; happelie to gouerne his charge; and he is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for an excellent cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that manie times returneth out of the field with victorie. But yet that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate &amp; Captaine shall far shine aboue the other in glorie, &amp; vniuersal applause of al sorts, that beside performing of their own parts excellentlie, doo also by true and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actlie digested precepts teach manie to be like them. So must I needes saie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, concerning you, (my good frend:) that albeit it might bee said by manie of vs of this profession, that there is much loue and fauour due vnto vs of our Countrie, for wel acquitting our callings in healing and releeuing manie pained &amp; miserable persons, yet much more vnto such as you,
<pb n="2" facs="5"/>
and aboue all the rest: seeing that ouer &amp; besides the well accomplishing of your owne particular charge, you haue also by publique writings, (and heerein without all comparison excelling the rest of your countrimen) striuen to fill this flourishing Land with most cunning Chirurgions. It were a manifest malignitie not to impute it to your louing minde, and sincere affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your Countrey: and so were it as detestable an ingratitude, not to render you like loue againe for it. For mine own part therefore, as I do vnfeinedlie &amp; from my heart acknowledge all this that I haue said of you, and therefore haue reached vnto you the right hand of loue &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to continue whilest we liue; so I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie wish and desire, that such as are not so minded towards you, maie either verie happelie change their mindes, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them: or els most vnhappelie faile of their seeking, as they are woorthie. What their malice hath been able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieue against you hethertoo, you haue good experience; it is not to be hoped of them, that time to come will bring more

Arrogancie also feareth, lest euerie praise that another deserueth, diminisheth somewhat of theirs, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scureth their glorie: those therefore, that are sicke of this disease, will detract from you what they can; but this arrogancie commonlie springeth of ignorance, for as
