   <p>THis true <hi>Confession of our fayth,</hi> in our
iudgment wholly agreable to the sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
we here exhibit vnto al to be discussed: and
vnto you (reverend Sirs) we dedicate it for two
causes. First, for that we know you are able
in respect of your singular knowledg in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and hope you are willing in respect of
your syncere piety, to convince our errours by
the light of Gods word, if any where we erre
out of the way. Secondly, that this testimony of
Christian faith, if you also fynd it to agree with
the word of truth, may by you be approved, eyther
in silence or by writing, as you shal think best.</p>
   <p>It may be, we shal be thought very bold, that
being despised of all, yet doubted not to sollicite
you so many and so great learned men. But
this we did, partly at the request of others to
whom we would not deny it; partly with desire

to have the truth through your help more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
&amp; furder spread abroad; partly constrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by our exile &amp; other calamities almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite;
partly also moved with love of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

of restoring religion &amp; the Church decayed,
which he hath happily begun in these latter
tymes, by our Gracious Soveraigne and the other
