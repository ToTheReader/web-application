      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are many things which I thinke needfull to impart vnto thee, both concerning the knowledge of plants in generall, as also for the better explaining of some things pertinent to this present Historie, which I haue here set forth much amended and enlarged. For the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall differences, affections, &amp;c. of Plants, I hold it not now so fitting nor necessaric for me to insist vpon them; neither doc I intend in any large discourse to set forth their many and great vses and vertues: giue me leaue onely to tell you, That God of his infinit goodnesse and bountie hath by the <hi>medium</hi> of Plants, bestowed almost all food, clothing, and medicine vpon man. And to this off-spring we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so owe (for the most part) our houses, shipping, and infinite other things, though some of them <hi>Proteus</hi> like haue run through diuers shapes, as this paper wereon I write, that first from seed became Flax; then after much vexation thred, then cloath, where it was cut and mangled to serue the Fashions of the time: but afterwards rejected and cast aside, yet vnwilling so to forsake the seruice of man for which God had created it, againe it comes (as I may terme it) to the Hammer, from whence it takes a morenoble forme and apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to be imployed to Sacred, Ciuill, Forreine and Domesticke vses.. I will not speake of the many and various obiects of delight that these present to the senses, nor of sundry other things, which I could plentifully in this kinde deliuer: but rather acquaint you from what Fountaines this Knowledge may be drawne, by shewing what Authours haue deliuered to vs the Historie of Plants, and after what manner they haue done it; and this will be a meanes that many controuersies may be the more easily vnderstood by the lesse learned and judicious Reader.</p>
   <p>He whose name we first finde vpon record (though doubtlesse some had treated therof

<note place="margin">Solomon.</note>

 before) that largely writ of Plants, was the wisest of men, euen King <hi>Solomon,</hi> who certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would not haue medled with this subiect, if he in his wisedome had not knowne it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy himselfe, and exceeding fitting: First for the honour of his Creator, whose gifts and blessings these are: Secondly for the good of his Subiects, whereof without doubt, he in this worke had a speciall regard in the curing of their diseases and infirmities. But this kingly worke being lost, I will not insist vpon it, but come to such as are yet extant, of which (following the course of antiquitie) that of <hi>Theophrastus</hi> first takes place.</p>

 about the 114 Olymp. which was some 322 yeares before Christ. He among many other things writ a Historie of Plants in ten bookes, and of the causes of them, eight bookes; of the former ten there are nine come to our times reasonable perfect; but there now remain but six of the eight of the causes of Plants. Some looking vpon the Catalogue of the bookes of <hi>Theophrastus</hi> his writing, set forth in his life, written by <hi>Diogenes Laertius,</hi> may wonder that they finde no mention of these bookes of Plants, amongst these he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

      <hi>all Plants, as the mouth and belly is to other liuing creatures,</hi> &amp;c. Now by this manner of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you may learne the generall differences and affections of Plants, but cannot come to the particular knowledge of any without much labour: for you must goe to many places to gather vp the description of one Plant: neither doth hee (nor is it necessarie for any writing in this manner) make mention of any great number, and of many it may bee but once. His workes being in Greeke were translated into Latine by <hi>Theodore Gaza,</hi> who did them but <hi>

 but two, and these according to the coniecture of <hi>Iulius Scaliger</hi> (who hath made a large and curious examination of them) haue either perished, or come to vs not as they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally written by <hi>Arislotle,</hi> but as they haue been by some later man put into Greeke. Amongst other things <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath these concerning those two bookes: <hi>Reor è textrina Theophrasti detracta sila <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

Thus much for <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whom as you see I haue placed after his Scholler, because there is such doubt of these bookes carried about in his name, and for that <hi>Scaliger</hi> as you see thinks them rather taken out of <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> than written by his Master.</p>
   <p>The next that orderly followes is <hi>Pedacius Dioscorides Anazarbeus,</hi> who liued (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

 by some places in <hi>Galen</hi> you may see they were different men: for our Anazarbean <hi>Diosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi> was of the Empericke sect, but the other was a follower of <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> and of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall sect. He writ not only of Plants, but <hi>de tota materia medica;</hi> to which studie hee was addicted euen from his childe-hood, which made him trauell much ground, and leade a militarie life, the better to accomplish his ends: and in this he attained to that perfection, that few or none since his time haue attained to, of the excellencie of his worke, which is as it were the foundation and ground-worke of all that hath been since deliuered in this

 nature. Heare what <hi>Galen</hi> one of the excellentest of Physitions, and one who spent no smal time in this study, asfirmes: But, saith he, the Anazarbean <hi>Dioscorides</hi> in fiue bookes hath written of the necessarie matter of medicine, not onely making mention of herbes, but also of trees, fruits, ``liquours and iuices, as also of all mineralls, and of the parts of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

 creatures: and in mine opinion he hath with the greatest perfection persormed this worke of the matter of Medicine: for although many before him haue written well vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this subiect, yet none haue writ so well of all. Now <hi>Dioscorides</hi> followes not the method of <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> but treats of each kinde of herbe in particular, first giuing the names, then the description, and then the place where they vsually grow, and lastly their vertues. Yet of some, which then were as frequently knowne with them, as Sage, Rosemary, an Ash or Oke tree are with vs, he hath omitted the descriptions, as not necessarie, as indeed at that time when they were so vulgarly knowne, they might seeme so to be: but now wee know the least of these, and haue no certaintie, but some probable coniectures do direct vs to the knowledge of them. He was not curious about his words nor method, but plainely and truly deliuered that whereof he had certaine and experimentall knowledge, concerning the description and nature of Plants. But the generall method he obserued you may finde set sorth by <hi>

 of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and was suffocated by the sulphureous vapours that came from mount Vesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius, falling at that time on fire; he through ouermuch curiositie to see and finde out the cause thereof approching too nigh, and this was <hi>Anno <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

         </gap>,</hi> and in other places those of <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> though he neuer make mention of the later of them: he also mentions, and no question followed many other Authors, whose writings haue long since perished. Sometimes he is pretty large, and otherwhiles so briefe, that scarce any thing can thence be gathered. From the seuenteenth vnto the twentie seuenth he variously han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles them, what method you may quickly see by his <hi>Elenchus,</hi> contained in his first book, but in the twenty seuenth hee handles those whereof hee had made no, or not sufficient mention, after an Alphabeticall order, beginning with <hi>Aethyopis, Ageratum, Aloe,</hi> &amp;c. so going on to the rest.</p>

 feined titles, and their names haue much more antiquitie than the works themselues: the first goes vnder the title of <hi>Aemilius Macer</hi> a famous Poet, of whom <hi>Ouid</hi> makes mention in these verses:</p>

 of <hi>Apuleius Madaurensis,</hi> and some haue been so absurdly bold of late, as to put it vnto the workes of <hi>Apuleius;</hi> yet the vncurious stile and method of the whole booke will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them of errour, if there were no other argument. I haue seene some foure manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts of this Authour, and heard of a fifth, and all of them seeme to bee of good Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie: the figures of them all for the most part haue some resemblance each of other: the first of these I saw some nine yeares agoe with that worthy louer and storer of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, Sir <hi>Robert Cotton:</hi> it was in a faire Saxon hand, and as I remember in the Saxon tongue; but what title it carried, I at that time was not curious to obserue. I saw also another after that, which seemed not to be of any small standing, but carelesly obserued not the title. But since I being informed by my friend Master <hi>Goodyer</hi> (as you may finde in the Chapter of Saxifrage of the Antients) that his Manuscript which was very anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, acknowledged no such Author as <hi>Apuleius,</hi> I begunne a little to examine some other Manuscripts, so I procured a very faire one of my much honored friend S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Theod. Mayern:</hi> in the verie beginning of this is writ, <hi>In hoc continentur libri <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

A little after <pb facs="11"/> in the same page at the beginning of a table which is of the vertues, are these words, <hi>In primo libro sunt herbae descriptae, quas. Apoliensis Plato descripsit, &amp;c.</hi> and thus also he is named in the title of the Epistle or Proeme; but at the end of the worke is <hi>explicit liber Platonis de herbis masculinis,</hi> &amp;c. With this in all things agrees that of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Goodyer,</hi> as he hath affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to me. Besides these, I found one with M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Iohn Tradescant,</hi> which was written in a more ignorant and barbarous time, as one may coniecture by the title, which is thus at the very beginning. <hi>In nomine domini incipit Herboralium Apulei Platonis quod accepit a Scolapio, &amp; Chirone <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

This worke was first printed at Basill, 1528. amongst some other workes of Physicke, and one <hi>Albanus Torinus</hi> set it forth by the helpe of many Manuscripts, of whose imperfections he much complaines, and I thinke not without cause: after this, <hi>Gabriel Humelbergius</hi> of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenspurge in Germany set it forth with a Comment vpon it, who also complaines o the imperfections of his copies, and thinkes the worke not perfect: indeed both the editions are faultie in many places: and by the help of these Manuscripts I haue seen they might be mended (if any thought it worth their labour) in some things, as I obserued in cursori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looking ouer them. One thing I much maruell at, which is, that I finde not this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor mentioned in any Writer of the middle times, as <hi>Platearius, Bartholomaeus Anglus,</hi> &amp;c. Now I coniecture this worke was originally written in Greeke, for these reasons: first, because it hath the Greeke names in such plenty, and many of them proper, signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and in the first place: Secondly some are onely named in Greeke, as <hi>Hierobulbon, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temisia Leptophyllos,</hi> and <hi>Artemisia tagantes, Batrachion, Gryas</hi> (which I iudge rather Greeke than Latine) &amp;c. Besides in both the written bookes in very many places amongst the names I finde this word <hi>Omòeos,</hi> but diuersly written; for I coniecture the Greeke names were written in the Greeke character, and <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: amongst them; and then also when the rest of the worke was translated, which afterwards made the transcribers who vnderstood it not to write it variously, for in the one booke it is alwaies written <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

If it be certaine which <hi>Philip Ferrarius</hi> affirmes in his <hi>Lexicon Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicum,</hi> that the citie Apoley is Constantinople, then haue I found <hi>Apoliensis vrbis,</hi> of which I can finde no mention in any antient or moderne Geographer besides; and then it is more than probable that this was written in Greeke, and it may be thought differently translated, which occasions such diuersitie in the copies, as you shall finde in some places. Now I coniecture this worke was written about some 600. yeares agoe.</p>
   <p>From these Antients haue sprung all, or the greatest part of the knowledge, that the middle or later times haue had of Plants; and all the controuersies that of late haue so stuffed the bookes of such as haue writ of this subiect, had their beginning by reason that the carelesnesse of the middle times were such, that they knew little but what they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed out of these Antients, neuer endeuouring to acquire any perfect knowledge of the things themselues: so that when as learning (after a long Winter) began to spring vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, men began to be somwhat more curious, and by the notes and descriptions in these antient Authors they haue laboured to restore this lost knowledge; making inquirie, first whether it were knowne by <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

 and <hi>Serapio;</hi> most of these writ but briefely of this subiect; neither haue we their works in the Arabicke wherein they were written, but barbarously translated into Latine, and most part of these workes were by them taken out of the Greekes, especially <hi>Dioscorides</hi> and <hi>Galen;</hi> yet so as they added somewhat of their own, and otherwhiles confounded other things with those mentioned by the Greekes, because they did not well know the things whereof they writ. <hi>Auicen, Auerrhoes,</hi> and <hi>Rhasis</hi> alphabetically and briefly (following the method of <hi>Galen</hi>) giue the names, temperature, and vertues, of the chiefest simple medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.

 But <hi>Serapio</hi> after a particular tract of the temperature and qualities of simple medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines in generall, comes to treat of them in particular, and therein followes chiefely <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oscorides, Galen,</hi> and <hi>Paulus,</hi> and diuers Arabians that went before him. This is the chiefe worke in this kinde of the Arabians, which haue come to vs; he himselfe tells vs his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod <pb facs="12"/> in his preface, which is (when he comes to particulars) first of medicines temperate, then of those that are hot and drie in the first degree; then those cold and drie in the same degree: after that, those hot and dry in the second degree, &amp;c. and in each of these tracts he followes the order of the Arabicke Alphabet.</p>
   <p>In or after the times of the Arabians vntill about the yeare 1400. There were diuers obscure and barbarous writers, who by sight knew little whereof they writ, but tooke out of the Greekes, Arabians, and one another, all that they writ, giuing commonly rude fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, seldome setting downe any descriptions: I will only name the chiefe of them that I haue seene, and as neare as I can guesse in that order that one of them succeeded ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

 One of the first that tooke paines in this kinde was <hi>Hermolaus Barbarus</hi> Patriarch of Aquileia, who not onely translated <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> but writ a Commentarie vpon him in fiue bookes, which he calls his <hi>Corollarium;</hi> in this worke hee hath shewed himselfe both iudicious and learned.</p>

 and indgement than the former, set forth <hi>Dioscorides</hi> in Greeke and Latine with a Comment vpon him.</p>

 1480, translated <hi>Dioscorides</hi> into Latine, whose translation hath been the most follwed of all the rest. Moreouer he set forth a large worke, <hi>De natura Stirpium,</hi> diuided into three bookes, wherein he hath accurately gathered all things out of sundry writers, especially the Greekes and Latines; for first hauing (after the manner of <hi>Theophrastus</hi>) deliuered some common precepts and Aduertisements pertaining to the forme, life, generation, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, and other such accidents of plants; he then comes to the particular handling of each <hi>species.</hi>

   <p>Much about this time, the Germanes began to beautifie this so necessary part of

 Physicke; and amongst them <hi>Otho Brunfelsius,</hi> a Physition of good account, writ of plants, and was the first that gaue the liuely figures of them; but he treated not in all of aboue 288 Plants. He commonly obserues this method in his particular chapters: First the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure (yet he giues not the figures of all he writes of) then the Greeke, Latine, and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane names; after that, the description and historie out of most former Authors; then the temperature and vertues, and lastly, the Authours names that had treated of them. His worke is in three parts or tomes, the first was printed in 1530. the second in 1531, and the third in 1536.</p>
   <p>Next after him was <hi>Hieronymus Tragus</hi> a learned, ingenious, and honest writer, who set

 forth his workes in the German tongue, which were shortly after translated into Latine by <hi>Dauid Kiber.</hi> He treats of most of the Plants commonly growing in Germany, &amp; I can obserue no generall method he keepes, but his particular one is commonly this: hee first giues the figure with the Latine and high Dutch name; then commonly a good descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; after that the names, then the temperature, and lastly the vertues, first inwardly, then outwardly vsed. He hath figured some 567, and described some 800. his figures are good, (and so are most of the rest that follow.) His workes were set forth in Latine, <hi>An.</hi> 1552.</p>
   <p>In his time liued <hi>Leonhartus Fuchsius,</hi> a German Physition, being also a learned and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent

 writer, but he hath taken many of his descriptions as also vertues word forword out of the Antients, and to them hath put figures; his generall method is after the Greek Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet, and his particular one thus: First the names in Greeke and Latine, together oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <pb facs="12"/> with their Etymologies, as also the German and French names, then the kinds after that the forme, the place, time, temperature, then the vertues: first out of the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, as <hi>Dioscorides, Galen, Pliny, &amp;c.</hi> and sometimes from the late Writers, whom he doth not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize, but expresses in generall <hi>ex recentioribus.</hi> His worke was set forth at Basil, 1542, in <hi>Fol.</hi> containing, 516 figures; also they were set forth in <hi>Octavo,</hi> the historie first, with all the figures by themselues together at the end with the Latine and high Dutch names.</p>

      <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>. And this was translated out of French into English by Master <hi>Henry Lite,</hi> and set forth with figures, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1578. and diuers times since printed, but without Figures. In the yeare 1552, <hi>Dodonaeus</hi> set forth in Latine his <hi>

            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> Historia.</hi> Afterwards hee put them all together, his former, and those his later Workes, and diuided them into thirtie Bookes, and set them forth with 1305 figures, in <hi>fol. An.</hi> 1583. This edition was also translated into English, which became the foundation <pb facs="13"/> of this present Worke, as I shall shew hereafter. It hath since beene printed in Latine, with the addition of some few new figures: and of late in Dutch, <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the same figures; and most of these in the <hi>Exoticks</hi> of <hi>Clusius,</hi> and great store of other additions. His generall method is this: first he diuides his Works into six Pemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tades or fiues: the fifth Pemptas or fiue bookes of these containe Plants in an Alphabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall order, yet so as that other Plants that haue affinitie with them are comprehended with them, though they fall not into the order of the Alphabet. The second Pempt. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines <hi>Flores Coronarij, Plantae odoratae &amp; vmbelliferae.</hi> The third is <hi>De Radicibus, Purg antibus Herbis, convolvulis, deleterijs ac perniciosis Plantis, Filicibus, Muscis &amp; Fungis.</hi> The fourth is <hi>De Frumentis, Leguminibus, palustribus &amp; aquatilibus.</hi> The fifth, <hi>De Oleribus &amp; Carduis.</hi> The sixth, <hi>de Fruticibus &amp; Arboribus.</hi> The particular method is the same vsed by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
   <p>In the yeare 1570, <hi>Peter Pena</hi> and <hi>Matthias Lobel</hi> did here at London set forth a Worke,

 entituled <hi>Stirpium Aduersaria noua;</hi> the chiefe end and intention whereofbeing to find out the <hi>Materia medica</hi> of the Antients. The generall method is the same with that of our Author, which is, putting things together as they haue most resemblance one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in externall forme, beginning with Grasses, Cornes, &amp;c. They giue few figures, but sometimes refer you to <hi>Fuchsius, Dodonaeus,</hi> and <hi>Matthiolus:</hi> but where the figure was not giuen by former Authors, then they commonly giue it; yet most part of these figures are very small and vnperfect, by reason (as I coniecture) they were taken from dried plants. In this Worke they insist little vpon the vertues of Plants, but succinctly handle contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies, and giue their opinions of Plants, together with their descriptions and names, which sometimes are in all these languages, Greeke, Latine, French, high and low Dutch, and English: otherwhiles in but one or two of them. Some Writers for this Work call them <hi>Doctissimi Angli;</hi> yet neither of them were borne here, for <hi>Pena</hi> (as I take it) was a French man, and <hi>Lobel</hi> was borne at Ryssele in Flanders, yet liued most part of his later time in this Kingdome, and here also ended his dayes. In the yeare 1576 he set sorth his Obseruations, and ioyned them with the <hi>Aduersaria,</hi> by them two to make one entire Worke: for in his Obseruations he giues most part of the figures and vertues belonging to those herbes formerly described onely in the <hi>Aduersaria;</hi> and to these also adds some new ones not mentioned in the former Worke. After which he set forth an Herball in Dutch, wherein he comprehended all those Plants that were in the two former Workes, and added diuers other to them, the Worke containing some 2116 figures; which were printed afterwards in a longish forme, with the Latine names, and references to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and Dutch bookes. After all these, at London, <hi>Anno</hi> 1605, he againe set forth the <hi>Aduersaria,</hi> together with the second part thereof, wherein is contained some fourty fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, being most of them of Grasses and Floures; but the descriptions were of some 100 plants, varieties and all. To this he added a Treatise of Balsam (which also was set forth alone in Quarto, <hi>Anno</hi> 1598.) and the <hi>Pharmacopaea</hi> of <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> with Annotations vpon it. He intended another great Worke, whose title should haue beene <hi>Stirpium Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strationes,</hi> but was preuented by death.</p>
   <p>Some six yeares after the Edition of the <hi>Aduersaria, Anno</hi> 1576, that learned, diligent,

<note place="margin">Carol. Clusius.</note>

 and laborious Herbarist <hi>Carol. Clusius</hi> set forth his Spanish Obseruations, hauing to this purpose trauelled ouer a great part of Spaine; and being afterwards called to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Court by <hi>Maximilian</hi> the second, he viewed Austria and the adiacent prouinces, and set forth his there Obseruation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1583. He also translated out of Spanish the Works of <hi>Garcias ab Orta</hi> and <hi>Christopher Acosta,</hi> treating of the simple medicines of the East In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and <hi>Nicolas Monardus,</hi> who writ of those of the West Indies. After this he put into one body both his Spanish and Pannonicke Obseruations, with some other, and those he comprehends in six bookes, entituled <hi>Rariorum Plantarum Historia:</hi> whereto he also addes an Appendix, a treatise of Mushroms, six Epistles treating of Plants, from <hi>Honorius Bellus</hi>
      <note place="margin">Honor. Bellus.</note>

 an Italian Physition liuing at Cydonia in Candy; as also the description of mount Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, being a Catalogue with the description and figures of some rare and not before writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of Plants there growing, written by <hi>Iohn Pona</hi> an Apothecarie of Verona (This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription

This first Volume of <hi>Clusius</hi> was printed in Antwerp, <hi>Anno</hi> 1601, in Folio: and in the yeare 1605 he also in Folio set forth in another volume six bookes of <hi>Exoticks</hi> containing various matter, as plants, or some particles of them, as Fruits, Woods, Barks, &amp;c. as also the forenamed translations of <hi>Garcias, Acosta,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardus:</hi> Three Tracts besides of the same <hi>Monardus;</hi> the first, <hi>De lapide Bezaar, &amp; Herba Scorsonera.</hi> The second, <hi>De Ferro &amp; eius facultatibus:</hi> The third, <hi>De Niue &amp; eius commodis.</hi>
      <pb facs="13"/> To these he also added <hi>Bellonius</hi> his Obseruations or Singularities, and a tract of the same Author, <hi>Deneglecta Scirpium cultura,</hi> both formerly translated out of French into Latine by him. He was borne at <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

He commonly in his owne words diligently for the most part describes each Plant, and then makes enquirie whether they were knowne by the Antients. He seldome sets downe their faculties, vnlesse of some, to which former Writers haue put downe none.

The whole number of the figures in this Worke are 2686. This History is diuided into eighteene bookes, and the Plants in each booke are put together either by the places of their growings, as in Woods, copses, mountaines, waterie places, &amp;c. or by their externall shape, as vmbelliferous, bulbous, &amp;c. or by their qualities, as purging, poysonous, &amp;c.

   <p>
      <hi>Caspar Bauhine,</hi> a Physition and Professor of Basil, besides his Anatomicall Works, set

 forth diuers of Plants. <hi>Anno</hi> 1596 he set forth his <hi>Phytopinax,</hi> or Index of Plants, wherein he followes the best method that any yet found: for according to <hi>Lobels</hi> method (which our Author followed) he begins with Grasses, Rushes, &amp;c. but then he briefely giues the Etymologie of the name in Greeke and Latine, if any such be, and tells you who of the Antients writ thereof, and in what part of their Works: and lastly (which I chiefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him for) he giues the <hi>Synonima's</hi> or seuerall names of each plant giuen by each late Writer, and quoteth the pages. Now there is nothing more troubles such as newly enter into this study, than the diuersitie of names, which sometimes for the same plant are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in each Author; some of them not knowing that the plant they mention was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly written of, name it as a new thing; others knowing it writ of, yet not approuing of the name. In this Worke he went but through some halfe of the historie of Plants. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, <hi>Anno</hi> 1598, he set forth <hi>Matthiolus</hi> his Commentaries vpon <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> adding to them 330 Figures, and the descriptions of fifty new ones not formerly described by any; together with the <hi>Synonima's</hi> of all such as were described in the Worke. He also <hi>Anno</hi> 1613 set forth <hi>Tabernamontanus</hi> in Dutch, with some addition of historie and figures. In <hi>Anno</hi> 1620 he set forth the <hi>Prodromus,</hi> or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

After this, <hi>Anno</hi> 1623, he set forth his <hi>Pinax Theatri Botanici,</hi> whose method is the same with his <hi>Phytopinax,</hi> but the quotations of the pages in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Authors are omitted. This is indeed the Index and summe of his great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Worke, which should containe about six thousand plants, and was a Worke of forty yeares: but he is dead some nine yeares agone, and yet this his great worke is not in the Presse, that I can heare of.</p>

      </gap>, and printed vpon the largest paper: he onely giues the <hi>Synonima's</hi> and descriptions, and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the worke first into foure parts, according to the foure seasons of the yeare; and then againe he subdiuides them, each into three, so that they agree with the moneths, putting in each Classis the plants that flourish at that time.</p>
   <p>These are the chiefe and greatest part of those that either in Greeke <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> Latine (whose Works haue come to our hands) haue deliuered to vs the history of Plants; yet there are some who haue vsed great diligence to helpe forward this knowledge, whose names I wil not passe ouer in silence. The first and antientest of these was <hi>Aloysius Anguillara</hi> a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition

<note place="margin">Aloys. Anguill.</note>

 of Padua, and President of the publique Garden there: his opinions of some plants were set forth in Italian at Venice, 1561.</p>

 into twenty eight bookes, printed at Naples <hi>Anno</hi> 1599. In this there is something of Plants: but I haue not yet seene the opinions of <hi>Anguillara,</hi> nor this Naturall Historie: yet you shall find frequent mention of both these in most of the forementioned Authors that writ in their time, or since, wherefore I could not omit them.</p>
   <p>Let me now at last looke home, and see who we haue had that haue taken pains in this kinde. The first that I finde worthy of mention is D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>William Turner,</hi> the first of whose

<note place="margin">Will. Turner.</note>

 works that I haue seene, was a little booke of the names of herbes, in Greeke, Latine, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, Dutch, and French, &amp;c. printed at London <hi>Anno</hi> 1548. In the yeare 1551 he set forth his Herbal or Historie of Plants, where he giues the figures of <hi>Fuchsius,</hi> for the most part: he giues the Names in Latine, Greeke, Dutch, and French: he did not treat of many Plants; his method was according to the Latine alphabet. He was a man of good iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and learning, and wel performed what he tooke in hand.</p>
   <p>After this, <hi>Dodonaeus</hi> was translated into English by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Lyte,</hi> as I formerly mentioned.

 And some yeares after, our Author set forth this Worke, whereof I will presently treat, hauing first made mention of a Worke set forth betweene that former Edition, and this I now present you withall.</p>

 good) in the yeare 1629 set forth a Worke by the name of <hi>Parad sus terrestris,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he giues the figures of all such plants as are preserued in gardens, for the beauty of their floures, for vse in meats or sauces; and also an Orchard of all trees bearing fruit, and such shrubs as for their raritie or beauty are kept in Orchards and gardens, with the ordering, <pb facs="14"/> planting and preseruing of all these. In this Worke he hath not supersicially handled these things, but accurately descended to the very varieties in each species: wherefore I haue now and then referred my Reader addicted to these delights, to this worke especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in floures and fruits, wherein I was loth to spend too much time, especially seeing I could adde nothing to what he had done vpon that subiect before. He also there promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed another worke, the which I thinke by this time is fit for the Presse.</p>
   <p>Now am I at length come to this present Worke, whereof I know you will expect I should say somewhat; and I will not frustrate your expectation, but labour to satisfie you in all I may, beginning with the Author, then his worke, what it was, and lastly what it now is.</p>
   <p>For the Author M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Iohn Gerard</hi> I can say little, but what you also may gather out of

 this worke; which is, he was borne in the yeare 1545. in Cheshire, at Namptwich, from whence hee came to this city, and betooke himselfe to Surgerie, wherein his endeauours were such, as he therein attained to be a Master of that worthy profession: he liued some ten yeares after the publishing of this worke, and died about the yeare 1607. His chiefe commendation is, that he out of a propense good will to the publique aduancement of this knowledge, endeauoured to performe therein more than he could well accomplish; which was partly through want of sufficient learning, as (besides that which he himselfe saith of himselfe in the chapter of Water Docke) may be gathered by the translating of

But let none blame him for these defects, seeing he was neither wanting in pains nor good will, to performe what he intended; and there are none so simple but know, that heauy burthens are with most paines vndergone by the weakest men: and although there were many faults in the worke, yet iudge well of the Author; for as a late writer well saith, <hi>Falli &amp; hallucinari humanum est; solitudinem quaerat oportet, qui vult cum perfectis</hi>

   <p>Now let me acquaint you how this Worke was made vp. <hi>Dodonaeus</hi> his Pemptades comming forth <hi>Anno</hi> 1583, were shortly after translated into English by D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Priest</hi> a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of London, who died either immediately before or after the finishing of this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation. This I had first by the relation of one who knew D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Priest</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>. <hi>Gerard:</hi> and it is apparant by the worke it selfe, which you shall finde to containe the Pemptades of <hi>Dodonaeus</hi> translated, so that diuers chapters haue scarce a word more or lesse than what is in him. But I cannot commend my Author for endeauouring to hide this thing from vs, cauilling (though commonly vniustly) with <hi>Dodonaeus,</hi> wheresoeuer he names him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a thing of heare-say, * that D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Priest</hi> translated <hi>Dodonaeus:</hi> when in the Epistle of

 his friend M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Bredwell,</hi> prefixed before this worke, are these words: [The first gatherers out of the Antients, and augmenters by their owne paines, haue already spred the odour of their good names through all the lands of learned habitations: D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Priest</hi> for transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so much as <hi>Dodonaeus,</hi> hath hereby left a tombe for his honorable sepulture. M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> comming last, but not the least, hath many waies accommodated the whole worke vnto our English Nation, &amp;c.] But that which may serue to cleare all doubts, if any can be in a thing so manifest, is a place in <hi>Lobels</hi> Annotations vpon <hi>Rondeletius</hi> his <hi>Pharmaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia,</hi> where <hi>pag.</hi> 59. he findes fault with <hi>Dodonaeus,</hi> for vsing barbarously the word <hi>Seta</hi> for <hi>Sericum:</hi> and with D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Priest,</hi> who (saith he) at the charges of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Norton</hi> translated <hi>Dodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> and deceiued by this word <hi>Seta,</hi> committed an absurd errour in translating it a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, when as it should haue been silke. This place so translated is to be seen in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Skarlet Oke, at the letter F. And <hi>Lobel</hi> well knew that it was D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Priest</hi> that committed this error, and therefore blames not M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Gerard,</hi> to whom hee made shew of friendship, and who was yet liuing: but yet he couertly gaue vs to vnderstand, that the worke wherein that error was committed, was a translation of <hi>Dodonaeus,</hi> and that made by <pb facs="15"/> D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Priest,</hi> and set forth by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Norton.</hi> Now this translation became the ground-worke whereupon M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Gerard</hi> built vp this Worke: but that it might not appeare a translation, he changes the generall method of <hi>Dodonaeus,</hi> into that of <hi>Lobel,</hi> and therein almost all ouer followes his <hi>Icones</hi> both in method and names, as you may plainly see in the Grasses and <hi>Orchides.</hi> To this translation he also added some plants out of <hi>Clusius,</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some out of the <hi>Aduersaria,</hi> and some fourteene of his owne not before mentioned. Now to this historie figures were wanting, which also M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Norton</hi> procured from Frankfort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same wherewith the Works of <hi>Tabernamontanus</hi> were printed in Dutch: but this fell crosse for my Author, who (as it seemes) hauing no great iudgement in them, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently put one for another: and besides, there were many plants in those Authors which he followed, which were not in <hi>Tabernamontanus,</hi> and diuers in him which they wanted, yet he put them all together, and one for another; and oft times by this meanes so confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all, that none could possibly haue set them right, vnlesse they knew this <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> of these errors. By this meanes, and after this manner was the Worke of my Author made vp, which was printed at the charges of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Norton, An.</hi> 1597.</p>
   <p>Now it remaines I acquaint you with what I haue performed in this Edition, which is either by mending what was amisse, or by adding such as formerly were wanting: some places I helped by putting out, as the Kindes in the Chapter of Stonecrop, where there was but one mentioned. I haue also put out the Kindes in diuers places else where they were not very necessarie, by this meanes to get more roome for things more necessarie: as also diuers figures and descriptions which were put in two or three places, I haue put them out in all but one, yet so, as that I alwaies giue you notice where they were, and of what. Some words or passages are also put out here and there, which I thinke needlesse to mention. Sometimes I mended what was amisse or defectiue, by altering or adding one or more words, as you may frequently obserue if you compare the former edition with this, in some few chapters almost in any place. But I thinke I shall best satisfie you if I briefely specifie what is done in each particular, hauing first acquainted you with what my generall intention was: I determined, as wel as the shortnesse of my time would giue me leaue, to retaine and set forth whatsoeuer was formerly in the booke described, or figured without descriptions (some varieties that were not necessarie excepted) and to these I intended to adde whatsoeuer was figured by <hi>Lobel, Dodonaeus,</hi> or <hi>Clusius,</hi> whose fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures we made vse of; as also such plants as grow either wilde, or vsually in the gardens of this kingdome, which were not mentioned by any of the forenamed Authors; for I neither thought it fit nor requisite for me, ambitiously to aime at all that <hi>Bauhine</hi> in his <hi>Pinax</hi> reckons vp, or the Exotickes of <hi>Prosper Alpinus</hi> containe, not mentioned in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. This was my generall intention. Now come I to particulars, and first of figures: I haue, as I said, made vse of those wherewith the Workes of <hi>Dodonaeus, Lobel,</hi> and <hi>Clusius</hi> were formerly printed, which, though some of them be not so sightly, yet are they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as truly exprest, and sometimes more. When figures not agreeable to the descriptions were formerly in any place, I giue you notice thereof with a marke of alteration before the title, as also in the end of the Chapter; and if they were not formerly in the booke, then I giue you them with a marke of addition. Such as were formerly figured in the booke, though put for other things; and so hauing no description therein, I haue caused to be new cut and put into their fit places, with descriptions to them, and only a marke of alteration. The next are the descriptions, which I haue in some places lightly amended, without giuing any notice thereof; but when it is much altered, then giue I you this marke † at the beginning thereof; but if it were such as that I could not helpe it but by writing a new one, then shall you finde it with this marke ‡ at the beginning and end thereof, as also whatsoeuer is added in the whole booke, either in description or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. The next is the Place, which I haue seldome altered, yet in some places supplied, and in others I haue put doubts, &amp; do suspect othersome to be false, which because I had not yet viewed, I left as I found. The Time was a thing of no such moment, for any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worth mentioning to be performed vpon, wherefore I will not insist vpon it. Names are of great importance, and in them I should haue been a little more curious if I had had more time, as you may see I at the first haue beene; but finding it a troublesome worke, I haue onely afterwards where I iudged it most needfull insisted vpon it: <hi>Bauhinus</hi> his <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax</hi> may supply what you in this kinde finde wanting. In many places of this worke you shall finde large discourses and sometimes controuersies handled by our Authour in the names; these are for the most part out of <hi>Dodonaeus,</hi> &amp; some of them were so abbreuiated, and by that meanes confounded, that I thought it not worth my paines to mend them, so I haue put them out in some few places, and referred you to the places in <hi>Dodonaeus</hi> out of <pb facs="15"/> which they were taken, as in the chapter of Alehoofe: it may be they are not so perfect as they should be in some very few other places; (for I could not compare all) but if you suspect any such thing, haue recourse to that Author, and you shall finde full satisfaction.</p>
   <p>Now come I to the Temper and Vertues. These commonly were taken forth of the fore-mentioned Author, and here and there out of <hi>Lobels</hi> Obseruations, and <hi>Camerarius</hi> his <hi>Hortus medicus.</hi> To these he also added some few Receipts of his owne: these I haue not altered, but here and there shewed to which they did most properly belong; as also if I found them otherwise than they ought, I noted it; or if in vnfit places, I haue trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred them to the right place, and in diuers things whereof our Author hath bin silent, I haue supplied that defect.</p>
   <p>For my additions I will here say nothing, but refer you to the immediate ensuing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, which will enforme you what is added onely in figure, or description, or in both, by which, and these two formerly mentioned marks, you may see what is much altered or added in the Work; for this marke † put either to figure, or before any clause, shews it to haue bin otherwise put before; or that clause whether it be in description, Place, Time, Names, or Vertues to be much altered. This other marke ‡ put to a figure shewes it not to haue been formerly in the worke, but now added; and put in any other place it shewes all is added vntill you come to another of the same marks. But because it is somtimes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, I will therefore giue notice in the <hi>Errata</hi> where it should be put, in those places where I obserue either the former or later of them to be wanting.</p>
   <p>Further, I must acquaint you how there were the descriptions of a few plants here and there put in vnfitting places, which made me describe them as new added, as <hi>Saxifragama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior Matthioli, Persicaria siliquosa,</hi> of which in the chapter of <hi>Persicaria</hi> there was an ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, but a reasonable good one in the chapter of <hi>Astrantia nigra. Papauer spinosum,</hi> was figured and described amongst the <hi>Cardui;</hi> now all these (as I said) I added as new in the most fitting places: yet found them afterwards described, but put them out all, except the last, whose historie I still retaining, with a reference to the preceding figure and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie. Note also, wheresoeuer my Author formerly mentioned <hi>Clusius,</hi> according to his Spanish or Pannonicke Obseruations, I haue made it, according to his Historie, which containes them both with additions.</p>
   <p>Also I must certifie you, (because I know it is a thing that some will thinke strange, that the number of the pages in this booke do no more exceed that of the former, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering there is such a large accession of matter and figures) the cause hereof is, each page containes diuers lines more than the former, the lines themselues also being longer; and by the omission of descriptions and figures put twice or thrice ouer, and the Kindes, vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily put in some places, I gained as much as conueniently I could, beeing desirous that it might be bound together in one volume.</p>
   <p>Thus haue I shewed what I haue performed in this Worke, entreating you to take this my Labor in good part; and if there be any defect therein (as needs there must in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane works) ascribe it in part to my haste and many businesses, and in some places to the want of sufficient information, especially in Exoticke things; and in other some, to the little conuersation I formerly had with this Author, before such time as (ouercome by the importunitie of some friends, and the generall want of such a Worke) I tooke this taske vpon me. Furthermore I desire, that none would rashly censure me for that which I haue here done; but they that know in what time I did it, and who themselues are able to do as much as I haue here performed; for to such alone I shall giue free libertie, and will be as ready to yeeld further satisfaction if they desire it, concerning any thing I haue here asserted, as I shall be apt to neglect and scorne the censure of the Ignorant and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, who I know are still forward to verifie our English prouerbe

   </p>
   <p>I must not in silence passe ouer those from whom I haue receiued any fauour or incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, whereby I might be the better enabled to performe this Taske. In the first place let me remember the onely Assistant I had in this Worke, which was M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Iohn Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer</hi> of Maple-Durham in Hampshire, from whom I receiued many accurate descriptions, and some other obseruations concerning plants; the which (desirous to giue euery man his due) I haue caused to be so printed, as they may be distinguished from the rest: and thus you shall know them; in the beginning is the name of the plant in Latine in a line by it selfe, and at the end his name is inserted; so that the Reader may easily finde those things that I had from him, and I hope together with me will be thankfull to him, that he would so readily impart them for the further increase of this knowledge.</p>
   <p>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>George Bowles</hi> of Chisselhurst in Kent must not here be forgot, for by his trauells and industry I haue had knowledge of diuers plants, which were not thought nor formerly <pb facs="16"/> knowne to grow wilde in this kingdome, as you shall finde by diuers places in this book.
