   <head>TO THE HONORA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Sir IAMES FVL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LERTON, Knight, one of his Highnesse Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Reuenues, &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know (Sir) that I shall be censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red very rash, in attempting; more vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised, in publishing; and most improuident, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your selfe the Patron of so weak a Pamphlet; for the <hi>first,</hi> I may excuse me,


<pb facs="3"/>
in that I haue bin long vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly idle, and loath to lose the benefit of the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced intermission of mine accustomed former imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I could conceiue no fitter or better passe-time, then in this interim, to seek some inward consolation, in my outward discomforts: for the <hi>Second,</hi> I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that imparting these weake <hi>Meditations,</hi> vnto some seeming wel affected to the <hi>best things,</hi> I was incouraged to lay them down to the pleasure of the Printer; who, not without


<pb facs="3"/>
examination &amp; allowance hath brought the same to publike view. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the <hi>Third</hi> and last, in making choyce of your name among so many of that <hi>Honourable Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> whom I most humbly and sincerely honour and reuerence; I cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the reason, to be no other then that I haue bene longest knowen vnto your selfe; And you best know, how I haue past ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares in Seruice and attendance, commanded by that <hi>Honorable Table.</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
These, no fained excuses may, in honourable fauour, free me from the censure of rashnesse in attempting it, of presumption in publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and of neglect, or respect of persons in patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing it: So shall I think mine idle time not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lost, though gaining little outward profit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther happy or vnhappy, in gaining the one, or loosing by the other. I am so much the more doubtful to iudg, by how much I obserue, that men are heere censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red happy &amp; vnhappy (not


<pb facs="4"/>
in respect of inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward qualities, bee they good or bad) but according to their present prosperitie or aduersity, glory or base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, riches or pouertie, which as a sea often ebbes and flowes; As variable winds blow, and waues tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, are lifted vp, and come low: wherein some sayling with a full gale of glory, thinke themselues in high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est felicity, who yet forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or neglecting to steere aright the huge bulke of their conceiued happinesse, rush many times vpon the


<pb facs="5"/>
rocke of <hi>Disgrace,</hi> more grieuous then their former fortunes were glorious. He that seeketh and thinketh to finde true felicitie in the inconstant things of this life, is as happy a man as hee that dreameth that hee hath sound great store of golde, and seemeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce beyond measure in his good fortune; and when hee awakes, hee findes it a dreame: So may men dreame of happinesse here; but it is onely reserued for such as make least account of this worlds glory, who


<pb facs="5"/>
haue their conuersations in Heauen while they liue in the earth, where yet no man can iudge of a truely happy man.</p>
