   <p>THou hast here deliuered to thee good Reader, a
litle tretise first writtē in the Italian tonge &amp;
printed at Venise, after that translated into the
French langage and printed at Lyons, and now
translated &amp; printed for thee to reade in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
tounge. Enquire not of the Author, he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen,
and to know him would do thee but litle
good. Reade the booke deuowtly, regard the mater
of it attentyuely, it may do the much good in theis
euill dayes. This may be counted among the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>test
euils with which this age is infected, that thei
which are called christians are miserably diuided
about Christ. And yet in truth as the apostle saith
vnto vs,<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> Cor. 8.</note> ther is but one God, which is the father of
whom are all things, and we in him, and our lord
Iesus Christ by whō are al things, &amp; we by him.
To discourse on this diuision and the cause thereof
would be to some pleasing, to some it would be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing.
For what one truth can please myndes so
diuersly diuided? wold God it could please all to
become one in that one Christ whose name we al do
carie. In this litle booke is that benefite which cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mith
by Christ crucified to the Christians, truly &amp;
comfortably handeled: which benefite if all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
did truly vnderstand and faithfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
this diuision would vanish away, and in
Christ the christiās shold become one. To this end
reade this booke and much good in Christ may it
do to all them which do reade it. Amen.</p>
