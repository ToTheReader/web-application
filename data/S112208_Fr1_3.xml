that in the deliuery of
these Sermons (because it was
fit I should proportion my speech
as neere as I could, to the houre)
I was forced to cut off here and there part of
what I had penned: which yet now, together
with that which was spoken, I here present to
thy view, distinguished from the rest with this
note (,,) against the lines. Thus much I thought
needfull to aduertise thee (because I see men
are captious more then enough,) lest I should
bee blamed of vnfaithfulnesse, in either adding
any thing vnto, or altring any thing of, that
which I deliuered: which I haue auoided, as
neere as the imperfection both of my Copies,


<pb facs="5"/>
and memory would permit. Reade without
gall, or preiudice: Let not truth fare the
worse for the Plainenesse: Catch not aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
at Syllables and Phrases: Study, and
seeke the Churches Peace: Iudge not anothers
seruant. Let vs all rather pray one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and by our charitable support, helpe to
beare the burdens one of another: and so fulfill
the Law of Christ. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
