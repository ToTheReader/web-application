Yet because vnthankfulnesse stops the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Gods blessings, and makes vs dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate from that we should be, I resolved with my selfe to gratifie your loue (at least in some sort) by acknowledging that entire

duty I owe you, and consecrating vnto your worthy selfe, some thing that might seeme worthy of such a patronage. May it please you therefore to take surview of this worke which by long Travaile I haue brought to this perfection: it is the fraight of my poore bark purchased by this years saile; it seemes more then an Elephants birth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiseth satisfaction to the iudicious reader. Let it bee shadowed vnder the wings of your protection, who best deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it, because you nourished both me and it, when there was scarse any being to mee or it: to particularise your divers &amp; sundry affections to which and for which I rest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver devoted, would craue a tract of it selfe, which makes me omit them, only I wish my effects, were answerable to my affects, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish that which I would. But so fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse bee wishes that their harvest seemes scarse worthy the gleaning. This poore te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of my loue may not only demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate what I owe vnto you: but what I owe the Church in the faith I haue professed, which I will ever keepe inviolable, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

travaile as too many doe to the wrack &amp; ruine of my Religion, but the confirmer of those vnsetled intentions which were but halfe grounded in me; experience hath reduced my wavering thoughts to an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of quiet repose; these be the fruits I reaped, which as my first fruits are to you tendred, to manifest my loue and dutie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, the sinceritie of my conscience to the Church, and my charitable desire to profit all: much I should wish you in content, but more I cannot then already you enioy, and therefore rest</p>
