      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONG THE inestimable benefits, wherwith almightie God, hath woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blessed this your Maiesties most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous gouernement: it is not to be numbred among the least, that vnder your most gratious and Christian protection, the people of your Highnes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, haue enioyed the most necessarie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable reading of the holy Scriptures in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tongue and natiue language. Which exercise although it hath of long time, by the aduersaries of Him, that willeth the Scriptures to be searched (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially

      </gap>knesse and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods most sacred word, and wil therin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, wherby their blind deuotiō the daughter of ignorance, as they them selues professe, was wont to make them rulers of the world: they also at the last are become Translators of the Newe Testament into English. In which, that I speak nothing of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincere purpose, in leauing the pure fountaine of the original veritie, to folow the croked streame of their barbarous vulgar Latin translatiō, which (beside al other manifeste corruptions) is founde defectiue in more than an hundred places, as your Maiestie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the excellet knowledge in both the tongs wherwith God hath blessed you, is verie well able to iudge: And to omit euen the same Booke of their translation, pestred with so many annotations, both false and vnduetifull, by which, vnder colour of the authoritie of holie Scriptures, they seeke to infecte the mindes of the credulous readers, with haeretical and superstitious opinions, and to alienate their harts from yelding due obedience to your Maiestie, and your most Christian lawes concerning true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion established: And that I may passe ouer the verie Text of their translation, obscured without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb facs="3"/>
necessarie or iust cause, with suche a multitude of so strange and vnusuall termes, as to the ignorant are no lesse difficult to vnderstande, than the Latine or Greeke it self: Yet is it not meete to be concealed, that they which neither truely, nor praecisely, haue translated their owne vulgare Latin, and only Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall text, haue neuerthelesse bene bolde, to set forth a seuerall Treatise, in which most slanderously and vniustly, they accuse all our English translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Bible, not of small imperfections and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sightes committed through ignorance or negligence, but of no lesse than most foule dealing, in partiall &amp; false translations, wilfull and haereticall corruptions.</p>
   <p>Against which most leude and vntrue accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though easie to be iudged of, by such as be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the tongues, yet daungerous to disquiet the conscience of them that be ignorant in the same: I haue written a short and necessarie Defense. Which although not labored in words, yet in matter I hope sufficient to auoide all the aduersaries cauilles: I am most humbly to craue pardon, that I may be bolde to dedicate vnto your most excellent Maiestie, that vnder whose high &amp; Christian authoritie, your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple haue so many yeares enioyd the reading of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bookes of GOD in their natiue language, to the euerlasting benefit of many thousand soules: Vnder the same your most gratious &amp; roial protection, they may reade also the Defense of the syncere and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full translation of those Bookes, to the quieting of
<pb facs="4"/>
their consciences, and the confusion of the aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Gods truth and holie religion. By which they may be stirred vp more and more, in all duetifull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, not only to be thankeful vnto your Maiestie as it becommeth them, but also to continewe their most earnest and hartie prayers to almightie God, for this your moste godlie and happie regiment ouer them, for many yeares forwarde to be prolonged.</p>
   <p>The God of glorie, which hitherto hath aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced your Maiesties throne, aboue all Princes of this age, in true honour and glorie, vouchsafe to preserue the same with his dailie blessing, to the perfection of that glorious reparation of his Church, which you haue most happily taken in hande, to the euerlasting praise of his mercie, and the endelesse felicity of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie.</p>
