   <head>¶ A preface to the
booke here folowing.</head>
   <p>THere came to my hands of late a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
litle boke, bearing the title: An
instruction hovv to be bold vpon gods
promise, &amp;c. VVhich boke being trās<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
aboue xxx. yeeres since, for a deere father of
mine, one Richard Melton (to recompence hym
with some fruite of my studyes, for the charge
which he more like a naturall, then a stepfather
bestovved vpon me in setting mee to schoole) and
being broughte to mee by the Printer, I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to take a litle paines in perusing the same.
VVhereunto, to satisfie the request both of hym,
and certaine others, which semed desierous of the
booke, I vvas contented to graunt. And so much
the more, both for the authors sake, being a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vvriter of Luthers yeeres and standing, and
especially for the argument of the booke, whiche
in these our dayes I see greatly expedient &amp; much
needefull, for comfort of the simple ignorant.
For vvhat doctrine can be more excellent, then
of saluation? vvhat more sure, then the promise
of God? vvhat more certaine then the veritie
thereof? vvhat more comfortable, then to stand
firme and ascerteined of the same? or vvhat more
needefull, then the same doctrine to be taughte a
broad? And that so much more nedefull, by how
much vvee see the aduersaries of this doctrine in
these our dayes to growe, both strong and many,
but none more strong, then mans owne naturall
sence and iudgemente, vvhich f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lowing nothing
<pb facs="4"/>
but his ovvne originall capacitie. vvithout the
vvorde of the gospell, can comprehend litle or no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing,
of thys mysterie.</p>
   <p>From the vvhich our naturally ingrafted blindnes
little differeth the scholediuinitie of the papistes,
who albeit they do seeme outvvardly to hold the
nam of christ: yet the promises made to vs in christ,
they hold not: the freedome of his grace they see
not, but make doubts vvher none is, teaching also
that no man ought to be sure of his saluation, but
to stand in feare and doubt. And no great maruel
if they so teach,<note place="margin">Difference between the Papist and the Protestant.</note> for if iustification as they say doe
stand by workes vvith faith, and not by faith with
out vvorkes: by merites: and not by promise fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by our selues partly, and not by Christe onely,
how can any certainty c be holden vvithout feare
or doubting? And yet neither is feare altogether
excluded from this certainty, vvhych we hold, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vvorkes also from fayth. The feare of God
I meane,<note place="margin">How feare &amp; confidēce stand togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a true christian.</note> vvhich is and ought to be in euery good
childe of God. And yet not vvithstanding his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce
standeth fast and sure. As a sonne and
heyre feareth and reuerenceth his father, and yet
doubteth not of his heritage: So God is alwayes
to be feared, but his couenant neuer to be mistru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.
Neither doe they rightly consider the causes
of our saluation, whiche teache this docttrine of
feare and doubting.</p>
   <p>Touching the explication vvhereof, thre cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are especially to be noted.<note place="margin">Three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō declared</note> VVhereof the one
resteth in the promise of God, the other in the
bloud of Christ. The third in the fayth of man. All
vvhiche three, bee causes together concurrent for
our saluation. For both gods promise saueth, and
<pb facs="4"/>
Christes passion saueth: Also faith saueth, but in
sundry and diuers respectes, by promise and grace
vve ar saued, as being the cause purposing, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.
By Christ, as cause material &amp; meritorious.
By faith as cause instrumental or conditional. Of
these three, the promise, (the thinges promised I
meane) is to come. The death of Christ, vvherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the promise standeth, is past. Faith which loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to the person of him that dyed,<note place="margin">Assurance of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hovv it resteth.</note> endureth.
And hereupon resteth the true assurance of salua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
in the hearts of all the faithful, for as it is true
that the suffering of Christ is past: So no lesse true
it is, the thinges promised vpon his suffering, are
to come.</p>
   <p>And for so much,<note place="margin">Hovve faith bringeth in hope.</note> as all these promises of God
are in Christ, and made to them that beleeue in
him: therefore fayth in Christ, to vvhich fayth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
the promise is made, may boldlye call hope
vnto her, and so most certainly assure himselfe of
vndoubted saluation. And here riseth vp the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peracion
of fayth, and of hope, with difference
betvveene them both. VVhich tvvo albeit moste
ioyntly knitte together, yet they differ<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene faith and hope discussed.</note> some what
in the obiecte. For as hope<note place="margin">The obiecte of faith and of hope con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sidered.</note> properly respecteth the
promise of God, and respecteth things to come:
euen so faythe properly looketh to the person of
the sonne of God, and in him taketh present iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.
Thus then the obiecte of hope is the
vvorde of promise. The obiecte of fayth is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
the person of the Sauior. And though it
may be sayde truely, speaking in righte terms,
that wee beleeue the promise of god to bee true:
yet it is not so truly said, that vve beleue in the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mise,
but hope in the promise of almighty god.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>Faith then,<note place="margin">The opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith and hope.</note> touching his obiect, runneth to the
person of the sonne, in whom the promise is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Hope holdeth fast in the promise giuen in
Christ, vvhereby hope assureth, faith f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>aueth.<note place="margin">Faith saueth hope com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth The cause of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euer to faith onely and not to hope.</note> And
as true faith in Christ can not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e without hope:
So hope againe vvithout faith in Christe is to no
purpose. Neither is euery man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>t hopeth, or be
cause he hopeth vvell, therfore saued, but because
he beleeueth vvell, (that is in the sonne of God)
therefore is he saued. VVho so is freely saued by
bloude, as boldlye may hope of saluation by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and nothing doubte. Albeit notvvithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this hope is not alvvayes alike strōg in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular beleuing man, for although the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
be generall, and indifferently extended to
all beleeuers, and ought to be hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>st of all men:
yet euery particular person, though hee beleeue in
Christ right well, can not so vvel at al tymes, as we
se, apply these promises to himselfe, as he should,
but many times creepeth in some distrust or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt
of himselfe, partlye thorovve vvekenes of
spirite, partly through conscience of sin, or gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
impressions of the enemie. As many times
by experience vve see happen to the good s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>intes
of God, vvho holding the same professiō of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
fayth,<note place="margin">Faith to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification may be som<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times where hop fainteth but hope to comfort can neuer be without faith.</note> as other good christians doe, yet in
applying these generall promises to themselues,
can not vvithout some feare and diffidence, be so
comforted, as others be, and as they wold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Against vvhom, nothing in this booke is
ment, or spoken, but onely againste suche as vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
mayntain the contrary doctrine: Not agaīst
such as of infirmity being deiected through feare
woulde fayne hope better, and can not: but a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="5"/>
those, which of purpose contrary to the
promise of grace, doe holde that no man oughte
to be certaine or assured in this life of his saluatiō
and fauour of God, but euer to stande in doubte
and feare thereof. Of the which two sorts of men
the one is to be comforted, and well hoped of, for
though hope and faith many times in good men
do shrinke and qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e through infirmitie and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
yet by grace and goodnes of the Lorde it
riseth again. The other vtterlye as hereticall and
contrary to grace, are to be detested and by sound
doctrine impugned, by such godlye bookes as in
this ye may read. The lord Iesus of his grace
&amp; goodnes, comfort the weake sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
raise vp them that be falne,
reduce the ignorāt, &amp; set vp
his glorious kingdome
with speede, to whō
be glory for
euer.</p>
