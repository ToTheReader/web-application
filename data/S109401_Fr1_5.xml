   <head>The Argument of the Booke.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Catholique Apologie hath endeuoured to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
the <hi>Huguenots</hi> of heresie by two Reasons.
The first is, for that the Religion pretended to be
Reformed, is not hereticall of it selfe, for that
the substance of the <hi>Catholique</hi> Faith is receiued by the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> and that the Ceremonies which they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected,
were vnknowne to the ancient Church, of which
two points, viz. Doctrine and Ceremonies, all Religion is
composed. The second is, that their Religion hath not beene
as yet condemned by any lawfull Iudgement: because that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Councell of Trent, it was not condemned in any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councell, and that the Councell of Trent is neither
lawfull of itselfe, nor as yet approued of in <hi>France.</hi> Vpon
which consideration, albeit that the <hi>Huguenots</hi> had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
from the true faith, yet ought we not to proceed against
them, as against Heretiques, vntill they haue receiued an
arrest of condemnation from a generall Councell: no more
th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n we can in iustice put a Malefactor to death, although he
be notoriously capable, vntill he be cast by the Iury, and hath
had his triall.</p>
   <p>The Author now of the Answer to this Apologie, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of his booke, from the fifth Chapter to the fifteenth,
trauailes hard to refute the foresaid Reasons: in the fifth
Chapter, he only propounds his Method; in the sixth, hee
would shew, that the Religion of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> is quite
another from that of the <hi>Catholiques;</hi> in the seuenth, that
the Ceremonies of the moderne Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
in the Primitiue Church; in the eight, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
pretended to be Reformed, stands condemned by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb facs="9"/>
Councels: in the 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. he defends
the Councell of Trent; whereof the 11, 12, and 13. are to
proue, that that Councell is absolutely lawfull, and the 9,
10, and 14. that it is receiued in <hi>France:</hi> after which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
I will also diuide my defence into these six Chapters.</p>
   <p>1. In my first, I will proue against the reasons of his sixt
Chapter, that the <hi>Catholiques</hi> and <hi>Huguenots</hi> thus farre
agree in Doctrine, that they are both of one and the same
Faith and Religion.</p>
   <p>2. In my second, against his seuenth Chapter, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> nor the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> doe accord with
the Primitiue Church in the matter of Ceremonies: and that
for this reason the <hi>Huguenots</hi> are not to be condemned.</p>
   <p>3. In my third, against his eighth, that before the times
of the Councell of Trent, they stood not publikely and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
condemned.</p>
   <p>4. In my fourth, against his 11, 12, and 13. Chapters,
that the Councell of Trent is not lawfull.</p>
   <p>5. In my fifth, against his 9, 10, and 14. Chapter, that it
is not receiued in <hi>France.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>6. In my sixth and last I will conclude, that the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi>
may be good right be still reputed for members of the
Catholique, Apostolique, and Roman Church.</p>
