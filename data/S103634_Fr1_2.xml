   <head>TO
THE PRINCE
his Highness, my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Lord and
Master.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat hath heeretofore been
presented to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
eare, I heere make
bolde (with some little
change) to present afresh
to your eye: that you may beholde
at one view the entire body of those
discourses which were delivered dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iointly
and by peece-meale; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that you may revise that at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
(if ought therein shall be thought
worth revising) which was sometimes
<pb facs="3"/>
of necessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>y shuffled up in haste, though
I must confesse to mine owne comfort
and your honor, never heard but with
singular attention; and lastly, that I
may serve your Highness in somwhat,
as well absent as present▪ specially now
that your frequent presence with his
Majesty enforceth your often absence
from your Familie.</p>
   <p>I adventure then, most noble Prince,
to unfolde and lay before your view
<hi>the Vow of</hi> DAVID (as seasonable I
hope to the times, as suitable to the
person) for the reformation and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of himselfe, his housholde
and State; whether made before his
comming to the Crowne, or newly
upon it, it is not certaine to define, nor
very materiall to know: once wee are
sure, it was DAVIDS <hi>Vow:</hi> which one
Motive me thinks were of weight suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to stirre-up all Christian Princes
(specially such as professe the <hi>defence of
the Christian faith</hi>) to a serious medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereon, even in that it was DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIDS
<hi>Vow;</hi> who so lived and so died,
<pb facs="3"/>
as never Prince (I thinke, before him
nor perhaps since him) so joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
Valour and Vertue, Courage
and Humility, Policy and Piety, Thrift
and Bounty, Solemnity and Devotion,
Greatness and Goodness.</p>
   <p>Without flattering the present times,
I might safely and justly say unto you,
<q>Et Pater Aeneas, &amp; avun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ulus excitet
Hector.</q>
   </p>
   <p>The former of which (as the world
well knoweth) hath added to his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
singular precepts of this kinde;
by which hee as much surpasseth other
Kings, as Kings doe ordinary men, or
men the brute creatures. Yet I thought
it not amisse to adde therunto the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and precepts of that King who
received such a testimony from the
mouth of God as never did any; and
farre surpassed that, in reall acts, which
<hi>Xenophon</hi> of <hi>Cyrus</hi> conceived onely in
imagination.</p>
   <p>This King then if you please to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to your selfe as a paterne, and his
<pb facs="4"/>
Vow as a rule, we may by Gods helpe
one day promise to our selves another
<hi>Charlemaine,</hi> or rather the perfections
of all the <hi>Edwards</hi> &amp; <hi>Henries,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iameses</hi>
your renowned progenitors united in
one <hi>Charles:</hi> and, your proceeding
and ending answering your gracious
beginnings and vertuous disposition
(which wee all hope and pray for) wee
may rest assured thereof.</p>
   <p>For the effecting of which, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe better than performe in <hi>deed</hi>
what you have chosen for your <hi>word,
Si vis omnia subijcere, teipsum subijce rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oni;</hi>
which is <hi>truely</hi> to be a King. For,
in so doing you will valew Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignetie,
not by impunity of doing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
but power of doing good; and in
attayning it▪ onely be enabled for the
doing of that good which before you
desired.</p>
   <p>And if this poore Worke of mine,
or any my endeavours, either have
or shall any way conduce to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance
of that publike and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb facs="4"/>
worke, I shall therein reape a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
reward both of my service and
travailes; accounting it my greatest
happinesse on earth to have been coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
worthy to be</p>
