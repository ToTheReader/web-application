      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S your vndeserued fauour to me wards, challengeth my seruice
as a debt: so tho vnmerited mercies of God to vs all, requires our hearts as
a due. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of the latter moued me to pen this Treatise: and the
consideration of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, animated me to Dedicate it to your <pb facs="3"/>Honours; not that there is any thing in it which you knew not before,
as hauing long since learned how to consecrate your hearts vnto the Lord:
but to put you in minde of your knowledge, that you doe not forget to
practise it. All that the Lord requires of you, for whatsoeuer hee hath
bestowed on you, is in effect but this, that you studie to know him, to
loue him, to feare him, to trust in him; that you sing vnto him, pray vnto
him, heare his Word, and receiue his Sacraments with your hearts and soules,
as you shall finde briefely proued in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise: which if you doe (as
all that obserue your religious liues and conuersations) are perswaded
you doe,) you may rest secure of Gods loue and fauour towards you in
Iesus Christ, euen to the full assurance of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, which he
hath prepared for those that giue him their hearts in his seruice. And so
crauing pardon for my boldnesse, if in this Dedication I be delinquent, I
rest:</p>
