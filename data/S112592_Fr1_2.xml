                 <title>Daphnis and Chloe : excellently describing the vveight of affection, the simplicitie of loue, the purport of honest meaning, the resolution of men, and disposition of fate, finished in a pastorall, and interlaced with the praises of a most peerlesse preincesse, wonderfull in maiestie, and rare in perfection, celebrated within the same pastorall, and therefore termed by the name of the shepheards holidaie. by Angell Daye.

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O enforce Sir vnto your worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes herein, by many circustaunces how much led on with the BOVN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIE, VALOR, COVRTESIE, SKIL, and many other complements of VIRTVE, resiant in your wel noted and known disposition, I haue da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to aduenture vnto your fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptaunce, this simple and plaine dedication (simple I meane in respect of the handling) might seem in the deliuerie, to equall an other volume.</p>
   <p>Omitting therefore all those particularities to them that know you, and to mine owne priuate meditation, that especially do honour you, I will onely say for this, that the greatest forwardnes craueth a shrowd, and the meanest matter cannot be without defence.</p>
   <p>TO VIRGIL there was an AVGVSTVS, to HORACE a MECAENAS, to CICERO a CAESAR, to APPELLES an ALEXANDER. If to these? how much more then to me needeth there, to couer the deformitie of my stile, a most exquisite PATRON.</p>
   <p>In a matter simple, it is yet a grace, but to insinuate
<pb facs="3"/>
the name of such as do merite well, the verie respect of whome, in the generallitie of the most, beareth alwaies we see, a more than common reputation,</p>
   <p>Herein if I presume on your VIRTVES, I vrge the necessity, if to craue your patronage, then custome may free me.</p>
   <p>Nowe, if the course of the weeke-daies pastimes of these SHEPEHEARDS seeme happelie to mislike you, turn then I pray to their HOLIDAIE, where (how rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie so euer handled) yet the Maiesty of her, who is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comparison, being there in most especially honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, shunneth not the fauour of anie sweete conceipte to haue the same recommended.</p>
   <p>Fruitles were it on a short request, to erect large mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For which my sute shalbe, that with the selfe BOVN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIE, wherewith your present yeares are so largely beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, your VIRTVE will vouchsafe fauourablie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute both of me and my trauel, which hauing obteined the shrowd thereof as AIAX shield, shall become vnto me henceforth of a sufficient gard from all kinde of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting serpents whatsoeuer.</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your worships in all to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded.
