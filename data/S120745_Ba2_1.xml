   <head>The Author, to the curteous Readers.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen</hi> (<hi>and ryght</hi> courteous whatsoeuer) I must needes confesse, that the painfull Pylgrimage of Zelauto, hath beene so tedious vnto you in the perusing, that neither could you gaine any delight in the discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: nor such methode of matter as you looked for, but euen playne Dunstable way, he hath tolde you an olde Canterburie tale. Yet on your iudgementes I am not to define, for that they are diuers: nor to suppose you will lyke, without I were better as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, for the one may shew the rashnesse of a vainglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous head: and the other a presumption to conster any mans behauiour. Antisthenes sayth, that as of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, the Phisition receyueth part of his remedies: so the wise man of his verie enimies (contrarie to expectation) shall obtayne some profite. Diogenes beeing by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and spitefull tongue, reprehended of a fault long before committed: made aunswere. I remember the time when I was such a one as thou art now: but such an one as I am now wilt thou neuer be.</p>
   <p>Likewise Gentlemen, ambicious heads, are apt to send foorth spitefull speeches, and if they can possyble catche a hole in a mans coate: the same wyll they lay euerie day in his dishe: But such secrete Serpentes in bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their behauiour, can not hurt him whome they wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="104" facs="58"/>
would: but confound them in their craftyest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions. Aristotle sayth, that he which receyueth a false peece of coyne, dooth but sustayne a reasonable losse: but he that trusteth a fayned freend in steede of a true, may endammage him selfe to his vtter vndooing, few such fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ends God send me: and as much good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as shall please him. But now in the meane while Gentlemen, whyle such coyne may be currant, and such freendes found: I sende you Astraephos delycate discourse, to make mery with the bad banquet you haue had. And though I haue no Cumfettes and Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to bestowe vppon you: iudge my good will is neuerthelesse, if might could mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne it. Thus of a little take a little when you come thereto: and of a little leaue a little how euer you doo.</p>
