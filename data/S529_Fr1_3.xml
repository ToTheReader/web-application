   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <salute>Reade it, if you please, and like as you list: neyther to the wisest Clarke, nor yet to the starkest Foole, but vnto the ordinary sort of giddy-headed young men, I send this greeting.</salute>
   <p>IF you meane to see the Beare-bayting of womē, then trudge to this Beare-garden apace, and get in betimes, and view euery roome where thou mayest best sit, for thy owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, profite, and hearts ease, &amp; beare with my rudenes, if I chance to offend thee. But before I doe open this trunke full of torments against women, I thinke it were not amisse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble those which in old time did sacrifices to <hi>Hercules;</hi> for they vsed continually first to whip all their dogges out of their City; and I thinke it were not amisse to driue all the women out of my hearing, for doubt, lest this little sparke kindle into such a flame, and rayse so many stinging Hornets humming about my eares, that all the wit I haue will not quench the one, nor quiet the other: for I feare me that I haue set down more then they will like of, and yet a great deale lesse then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue: and for better proofe, I refer my selfe to the iudgement of men, which haue more experience then my selfe; for I esteem little of the malice of women, for men will be perswaded with reason, but women must be answered with silence; for I know women will barke more at me, then <hi>Cerberus</hi> the two-headed dog did at <hi>Hercules,</hi> when he came into Hell to fetch out the fayre <hi>Proserpina:</hi> and yet I charge them now but with a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rush, in respect of a second booke, which is almost ready: I doe now but fret them with false fire, but my next charge shal be with weapons, and my larum with powder and shot: for then wee will goe vpon these venemous Adders, Serpents and
<pb facs="7"/>
Snakes, and tread and trample them vnder our feet; for I haue known many stung with some of these Scorpions, and therefore I warne all men to beware the Scorpton. I knowe women will bite the lip at mee and censure hardly of mee, but I feare not the curst Cowe, for she commonly hath short horns; let them censure of me what they wil, for I meane not to make them my Iudges, and if they shoot their spite at me, they may hit themselues, and so I will smile at them, as at the foolish Fly which burneth her selfe in the candle. And so friend Reader, if thou hast any discretion at all, thou mayest take a happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample by these most lasciuious and crafty, whorish, theeuish, &amp; knauish women, which were the cause of this my idle time spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and yet I haue no warrant to make thee beleeue this which I write to be true, but yet the simple Bee gathereth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney where the venemous Spider doth her poyson. And so I will hinder thee no longer from that which insueth. But here I wil conclude, lest thou hast cause to say, that my Epistles are lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then my booke, a Booke I hope I may call it without any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: for the Collyer cals his Horse a Horse, &amp; the Kings great Steed is but a Horse.</p>
   <p>If thou read but the beginning of a booke, thou canst giue no iudgement of that which insueth: therefore I say is the Frier, who in the midst of his Sermon said ofte, that the best was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: And so, if thou reade it all ouer, thou shalt not be delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for the best is behind. I thinke I haue shot so neere the white that some wil account me for a good Archer: And so pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to looke to thy footing, that thou run not ouer thy shooes, and so be past recouery before my second booke come.</p>
