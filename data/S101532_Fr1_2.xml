                 <title>A quench-coale. Or A briefe disquisition and inquirie, in vvhat place of the church or chancell the Lords-table ought to be situated, especially vvhen the Sacrament is administered? : VVherein is evidently proved, that the Lords-table ought to be placed in the midst of the church, chancell, or quire north and south, not altar-wise, with one side against the wall: that it neither is nor ought to be stiled an altar; that Christians have no other altar but Christ alone, who hath abolished all other altars, which are either heathenish, Jewish, or popish, and not tollerable among Christians. All the pretences, authorities, arguments of Mr. Richard Shelford, Edmond Reeve, Dr. John Pocklington, and a late Coale from the altar, to the contrary in defence of altars, calling the Lords-table an altar, or placing it altarwise, are here likewise fully answered and proved to be vaine or forged.

of the long established Doctrine and

yeares, not only secretly undermined by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Priests and Jesuites, but openly oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
affronted, by some English Priestes and
Prelates in divers Visitation-Articles, Sermons and printed
Bookes licenced for the Presse, to the intollerable contempt
of your Majesties late pious<note n="a" place="margin">Before the 39. Articles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the causes of the dissolving of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. An. 1628.</note>
      <hi>Declarations;</hi> Hath made me
so presumptuous, as not only to compile, but likewise to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
this unpolished <hi>Quench-Coale</hi> to your Royall Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage:
Wherein like a plain-dealing English-man, I have
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
according to my poore ability, not only defended the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England,
in the particulars now oppugned, against those treacherous
rebellious Sonnes of hers who have professedly both in their
Sermons, practises and printed Bookes oppugned them, out
of her owne Records and Writers (which I have princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
made use of) but likewise discovered and layd open,
without flattery or partiallity, their desperate practises,
aymes, plots and intentions, to suppresse and roote out our
syncere Religion, and usher in Popery by degrees; Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the method, and progresse they have made and
prosecuted in this their pernicious designe.</p>
   <p>The reasons inducing me to dedicate this rude incompt
Discourse (which I had neither time nor opportunity to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish)
to your Sacred Majesty were these.</p>
   <p>1. First, to acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>int your Highnes, with the severall
dangers wherewith the Religion, Doctrine and Discipline,
by Law establishest in the Church of England, are now sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded,
and those open affronts and oppositions made of
late yeares against it; Of which I presume, your Majesty
(who commonly see with other mens eyes, and heare with
other mens eares, as most Princes are forced to doe) have
not beene yet so fully acquainted, as your faithfull Subjects
could desire, especially by your Prelates.</p>
   <p>2. Secondly, to informe your Majesty, how grosly some
of your Prelates and Chaplaines have abused your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and your Subjects eares and eyes, both in the Pulpit, the
<note n="b" place="margin">See A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coale from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, p. 64. the Order, of the Counsell-Table con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning S. Gregories Church: And Ibid. p. 15. 16. 17. 19. 53. to 58.</note>
      <hi>Counsell-Chamber,</hi> and in printed Bookes, in the point of
<hi>Altars,</hi> and their <hi>situation of Communion-Tables Altarwise
against the East wall of the Quire;</hi> Which Altars &amp; <hi>Situs</hi> of
Lords-Tables, they have peremptorily affirmed, <hi>to be conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the practise of approred Antiquity; Yea to the Statutes,
Doctrine, Canons and Discipline of the Church of England;</hi>
      <pb n="5" facs="3"/>
When as it is most apparant: That the primitive Church
laand Christians had no Altars, but Tables only, for aboue 260
teyeares after Christ; And that then and ever since, till now of
late, <hi>both their Tables and Altars were alwayes placed in the</hi>
MIDST <hi>of their Quires or Churches;</hi> As J have here plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifully
manifested; And that they neither bowed to nor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Altars, as these new Doctours falsely dogmatize.</p>
   <p>3. Thirdly; To present unto your Majesty, the many
dangerous Innovations and backslidings to Popery that
have crept into our Church of late, and now are publikely
justifyed in print, yea enjoyned by some of your potent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
and enforced on your poore Subjects (especially godly
Ministers) under paine of suspension, excommunication, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,
yea fining, imprisonment and utter ruine in your
High Commissions, (at<note n="*" place="margin">See 1. Eliz. c. 1. 8. Eliz. c. 1.</note>
      <hi>first erected to suppresse all Poperie, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations,
Errours and Episcopall enchroachments upon your
Eeclesiasticall Prerogative,</hi> but now used as the chiefe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
to countenance and set them up,) in professed
opposition and rebellion against your Majesties Lawes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
and two late pious<note n="c" place="margin">Before the 39 Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; and of the causes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Majesty to dissolve the last Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, p. 20. 21. 22. 42.</note>
      <hi>Declarations to all your lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Subjects:</hi> VVherein <hi>your Majesty</hi> (to the unspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
joy of all your true-hearted people) <hi>calling God to record
before whom you stand,</hi> hath made this solemne Protestation.</p>
   <p>
      <q>That you will never give way to the authorizing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, whereby ANY INNOVATION may steale
or creep into the Church, but preserve that unity of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
&amp; Discipline established in the Time of Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,
whereby the Church of England hath stood &amp; flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
ever since. That you doe professe to maintaine the
true Religiō &amp; Doctrine established in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
without ADMITTING OR CONNIVING AT
ANY BACKSLIDING TO POPERY OR SCHISME.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That you will not INDVRE ANY VARYING OR
DEPARTING JN THE LEAST DEGREE, from

         </gap>d Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land

now established. And that you will esteeme those
subordinate Officers and Ministers that shalbe but negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in seeing this your Declaration executed (much more
then those who apparantly oppugne it,) as culpable both
to God and your Majesty; And will expect that hereafter
they give you a better account;</q> Yet notwithstanding both
these your royall <hi>Declarations;</hi> Some of your Prelates (who
were both privies and parties to them) with others of your
Clergie, have since their publication, not only suffered
<q>many Jnnovations to creep and steale into our Church,
admitted and connived at many backslidings to Poperie
and Romish Schisme, and permitted nay<note n="d" place="margin">See Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, Chow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Browne, Pockling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, A Coal frrom the Altar, the Female Glory, with other late licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Books, Bishop Wrens, Bishop Mountagues and Bishop Peirce their Visitation Articles.</note> licensed in

      <hi>Whore of Rome</hi> and her abominations.</p>
   <p>Yea such hath been the monstruous unparalled presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these undutifull, persidious Innovatours, since these
<hi>Declarations</hi> published by your Majesty, that they have
dared to purge, corrupt, sophisticate and Innovate the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike

privity; To such an hight of insolency are they
growen.</p>
   <p>I shall instance only in 3. particulars, worthy your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties,
yea the whole Kingdomes consideration, and the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
Censures that your Royall Justice can inflict.</p>
   <p>First, they have purged &amp; corrupted the <hi>Booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer</hi>
in two severall places, the first whereof so
neerely concernes your Majesty, your Royall Confort and
Princely Issue, that J should be no lesse then an Arch-Traytor
to you all, should I not discover but conceale it.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>In the ancient Common-prayer-Bookes there was this</hi>
Collect <hi>prescribed</hi> for the Queen, Prince and Royall Issue
O God, who art the Father of thine Elect and of their seed, we
humblie beseeth thee to blesse our most gracious Queen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>These busy Innovatours, to testify their loyalty and duty
to your Majesty, your Queen and Royall Issue, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to expung you all out of the Catalogue of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and to ranke you all in the number of Reprobates and
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>
Castawayes, with one dash; Blotting this clause <hi>(who art the
Farher of thine Elect and of their seed)</hi> quite out of this <hi>Collect,</hi>
in all the late Common-prayer-Bookes; VVhereby they
have done as much as in them lies, not only to deprive your
Majesty and your Princely Jssue, of that temporall Crowne
of Soveraignty over these your Realmes, to which you are
Elected by God, but also to rob both your Majesty, your Noble
Queen, your Royall Issue, your most Illustrious Sister, and
her Princely Progenie, of that eternall Crowne of glory like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
to which both<note n="l" place="margin">Col. 3. 12 1. Thos. 1. 4. 1. Pet. 4. 1. 2. 2. Iohn. 1. 2. Thes. 2. 13.</note>
      <hi>Charity</hi> and Loyalty enjoyne us, <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you are Elected through Gods</hi>
      <note n="m" place="margin">Ephes. 1 4, 5. 6. 7. 11, 12. Rom. 11. 5, 6.</note>
      <hi>free grace and everlasting
decree;</hi> Elect, in the Collect, being taken in both these
sences.</p>
   <p>VVhether these pragmaticall Refiners of this prayer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
not a<note n="*" place="margin">Bishop Latimer his 2, and 5. Sermon before King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the 6.</note>
      <hi>Tiburne-Tippet,</hi> at the least, for this bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
I humbly submit to your Royall Majesty.</p>
   <p>2. The second alteration they have made in the <hi>Booke of
Common-prayer</hi> is, in <hi>the Epistle for Palme-Sunday;</hi> small
in appearance, but great in consequence.</p>
   <p>All the Common Prayer-Bookes before the yeare of our
Lord 1629. (as likewise, <hi>Tyndals, Couerdales, Thomas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewes
and the Bishops Bibles,</hi> used in our Churches till Anno
1612.) read that text of <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10. according to the original,
the Fathers, all Latine Writers and Translations, but two of
late (to witt the <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Castalio,</hi> who render it <hi>Ad nomen,</hi>
not IN <hi>nomine,</hi> as all others doe) in this maner. <hi>That IN
the name of Iesus every knee should bow,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
   <p>But these Innovatours, to Jdolize the name <hi>Iesus,</hi> and usher
in the Ceremony of Capping and bowing to it (thereby to
make way for bowing to Images, Altars, Adoration of the
Eucharist and other Romish Innovations) in the yeare of
our Lord 1629. (the very next yeare after your Majesties
<hi>Declarations)</hi> turned this IN into AT <hi>the Name</hi> (as one Pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>late
did the like before in the New Translation of the Bible
for the same purpose) contrary to the originall, the sence and
<pb n="9" facs="5"/>
scope of the place, the Fathers, all former Common-prayer-Bookes,
&amp; the very rules of our English Dialect; There being
no such phrase in the whole Bible, nor in any English Author,
that ever I yet read, as, <hi>AT the name,</hi> except only in this
mistranslated &amp; corrupted text; But only, IN <hi>the name.</hi>
AT the name being pure nonsence; As appeares by turning
IN into AT, in all the texts of Scripture where this phrase
IN the name is used: As <hi>Math. 28. 19. Baptizing them in
the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Iohn
16. 23. Whatsoever yee shall aske the Father IN my
name, he will give it you: Acts 3. 6. IN the name of Iesus
Christ of Nazareth stand up and walke. Acts 9. 27. 2. 9. He
preached <hi>boldly at Damascus IN the name of Iesus:</hi> And
<hi>Acts 16. 8. 1. Cor. 5. 4. Ephes. 5. 2. 2. Thes. 5. 20. 2. Thes.
3. 6.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In all which if we convert IN into AT, and read them AT
<hi>the name,</hi> it makes both the English and text Nonsence, and
so it doth in this very text, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10. As some<note n="n" place="margin">Lame Giles his Haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and certaine Quaeries propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Bowers at the name of Iesus, Qu. 1. 2. 3, 4.</note>
      <hi>have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
at large in particular Treatises of this Subject,</hi> and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of bowing at the name of Iesus, when it is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<note n="o" place="margin">Ibidem, And the Appendix concerning bowing at the name of Jesus.</note>
      <q>brought in by Popes with indulgences, for idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
ends, and not knowne, not used in the Primitive
Church for above 1200 yeares after Christ;</q> What ever
some have written or preached to the contrary, to abuse your
Majesty and Subjects with their Fables.</p>
   <p>Who they were that originally caused these two altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Corruptions of the Common-prayer-Booke (to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the changing of <hi>Minister</hi> into <hi>Priest,</hi> in some places) I
cannot certainly informe your Majesty; But if common same
and circumstances may be credited<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> they were some of your
greatest Prelates this day living.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="10" facs="6"/>
One of the chiefe instruments imployed in this good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
(who can discover the parties that sett him about this
worke; Then a Chaplaine to a great Bishop, now to your
Majesty) was <hi>Dr. Iohn Cosens,</hi> as I was long since informed
by your Majesties Printer <hi>Mr. Norton,</hi> upon the first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
and inquirie after this abuse.</p>
   <p>A fit instrument for such a purpose; Who but the yeare
before was accused in Parliament for dangerous words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
your Majesty and the Reformers of our Religion;
<q>To witt.<note n="p" place="margin">See a briefe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall Narratiō of some notorious Acts and Speeches of Mr. Iohn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens at the end of Mr. Peter Smarts Sermon: Printed at Edinburg
An. 1628</note> That your Majesty was no more Supreame
Head of the Church of England next and immediately
under Christ, then the Boy that rubbed his horse heeles.
That the Reformers of our Church when they tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Masse, tooke away all Religion and the whole ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God: They called it a Reformation, but it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

   </p>
   <p>All which particulars were substantially proved against
him, both in the Parliament-house and at the Assises at
<hi>Durham,</hi> where he was found guilty upon an <hi>Indictment.</hi>
Yet in stead of punishments, answerable to these his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
(some whereof would have been capitall in other men)
he hath been so bolstred up by some great Prelates, neare
your Majesty; As that he hath received two or three great

imitated him, who taking away his Communion-Table, erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an Altar in the East-end of the Chancle of his Parish-Church;
within the Bishopricke of Durham; Which Altar
(made of a Gravestone) he layd upon a wall of stone, not a
frame, adorning it with guilded hangings; Which done, he
read Second Service at it, (though above halfe his Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
could neither heare nor see him;) and fell devoutly to
adore it, till at last his foot hanging in his gowne, he unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
fell downe against the Altar-steps, brake all his nose and
face, so as he sacrificed his owne blood both upon the steps &amp;
Altar itselfe in stead of Christs, and was not able to walke

      <pb n="13" facs="7"/>
This prayer (which some have observed, not to have been
read, but purposely omitted in your Majesties Chapple the
two fift of Novembers last past, be like by their direction
who have since perverted it,) in the last Edition 1635. is
thus treacherously Metamorphosed: <q>Roote out that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilonish
and Antichristian Sect (<note n="*" place="margin">added.</note> OF THEM) which say
of Ierusalem, &amp;c, And to that end strengthen the hands
of our Gracious King, &amp;c. to cut off THOSE (for
THESE) workers of Iniquity, VVHO TURNE RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGION
INTO REBELLION and FAITH INTO
FACTION.</q>
   </p>
   <p>In which strange alteration there are these notorious
treacheries, yea villanies, included not to be stighted
over.</p>
   <p>1. First, there is a diverting of the maine edge and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this Prayer from the Iesuites, Priests, Papists, and
Antichristian Babilonish Sect of Rome, particularly designed
in the first Prayer-Bookes, upon those Loyall Subjects and
Religious Christians, whom the<note n="s" place="margin">D. Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds de Idolatria Rom. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Epist. ad Angl. Seminaria Sect. 5. p. 21. 22.</note>

and their Confederates would have fathered this damnable
plot at first, had it taken effect,</hi> (as blessed be God it never
did) <hi>to make them more odious to the World; (Which themselves
confessed upon their examinations and our Historians record:)</hi> So
they have now turned the whole scope of this prayer (and
by cousequence the very practise and treason itselfe) upon
these poore Innocents; The only men aymed at in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration;
And the chiefe men declaimed against both at
Court, Westminster, <q>Paules and our Universities in
the Sermons there preached of late yeares on the fift of
November,</q> wherein most have paralleld them with, And
many affirmed them, <hi>to be farre worse then any Priests or Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites.</hi>

So much wee poore <hi>Puritans</hi> (never yet guilty of the least
treason or Rebellion against their Princes in this Iland, nor
of any such forgeries, Jnnovations, or Romish practises, as I
have here discovered,) beholding to the Iesuites, Priests and
some English Prelates, who have been guilty of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
treasons, Conspiracies and Rebellions against your

   </p>
   <p>And here by the way, your Majesty, (in despite of envy
and calumny may take Notice) First, that those who are now
slaundered under the name of <hi>Puritans,</hi> are your best and
loyallest Subjects, because most hated and slaundered by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,
Priests and Traytors, who would Father all villanies
and treasons on them; And hate them most of any people,
because truest to their Soveraignes.</p>
   <p>2. Secondly, that no kinde of people in the World are
<note n="x" place="bottom">See Dr. Raynolds de Idol. Eccles. Rom. Epist. Ad Angl. Seminaria Sect. 5.</note>
      <hi>So much slaundered and traduced as they,</hi> though the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centest

      <hi>slaunders
raysed of Puritans by Poeticall braines, and yet vented out in the
Pulpit as sacred Oracles,</hi> which the Divell himselfe would
blush to relate, and the Auditours know to be meere sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
And all to make <hi>Puritans</hi> odious to your Majesty,
being the only men that keep both your Crowne and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
safe.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="15" facs="8"/>
J shall therefore humblie beseech your Majesty, when ever
you heare any Legends or Declamations against <hi>Puritans</hi>
hereafter, to consider from what kinde of Persons they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and to put them that utter them to make proofe of
what they say, or else to brand them with an hot-iron in the
cheekes or forehead with an S for slaunderers; And then you
will never heare any more fables of <hi>Puritans,</hi> with which
your Royall eares are now so oft abused by the Iesuite
<hi>Contzens</hi> Disciples; <q>VVho gives this as one chiefe rule
how to usher Popery into any Christian State,<note n="a" place="margin">Polit. l. 2 c. 17. 18. 19</note> to slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and disgrace the Puritans and zelots, to make them
odious both to Prince and people, and then Popery will
breake in without any opposition or noyse at all.</q>
   </p>
   <p>2. Secondly; By this perverting of this Prayer, the chiefe
<hi>Odium</hi> against Iesuites, Priests and Papists (the<note n="b" place="margin">Speeds History. p. 1249. Sect. 33.</note>

that so they may take roote among us againe, to the ruine
both of Church, State, and (without Gods speciall protection)
of your Sacred Majesty, to whom they will ever be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous,
<q>as they have<note n="c" place="margin">Dr. White his Defence of the way, c. 6. 10. The Homily for Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunday. D. Barnes his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to King

Vassals to yeild universall obedience to them in what
ever they should commaund.</q>
   </p>
   <p>3. Thirdly; By this Metamorphosis of, <hi>whose Religion is
Rebellion, whose Faith is Faction, &amp;c.</hi> into. <hi>Those workers
of iniquity, who turne Religion into Rebellion, and Faith into
Faction:</hi> The Romish Religion is acquitted and purged
from that damnable, treasonable, Rebellious, factious Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
<hi>of the lawfulness of deposing and murthering Christian
Kings and Princes, excommunicated or deprived by the Pope or

I shall humblie desire your Majesty and all that love either
your safety or Religion seriously to read over at their best
leisure, and then let them love Popery, Priestes and Iesuites
if they can or dare,) <hi>prove them deeply guilty both in point<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
of Theory and Practise;</hi> And if all these fayle, yet their
obstinate refusall of the <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> (which only<note n="f" place="margin">3. Iacobi c. 4. Deus &amp; Rex.</note>
      <hi>enjoynes them to renounce this Doctrine of King-killing</hi>) proves
them deeply guilty of it; (and can your Majesty trust such
neare about you, who will by no meanes sweare, they will
not murther nor deprive you?)</p>
   <p>Now for any thus farre to gratify Traytours and Rebels,
as to acquit them from that very Doctrine which makes
them such, even then when they are quilty of it, must
needs be a danegrous, if not a Trayterous Act, perillous to
your Majesty and the whole Realme.</p>
   <p>4. Fourthly; This Alteration extenuates the greatnes and
execrable odiousnes of that horrid Treason, both in respect
of the Actors, and that desperate Doctrine which moved
them to committ it; And to mince or extenuate such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld
treason as this, so execrable to all the world; Is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but to turne Traytour, and become guilty of the
same treason, or of another as bad as it.</p>
   <p>Yea it is to be feared, that those who wilbe so perfidious,
as after thus many Yeares, to goe about to extenuate and les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
such a Treason, have a minde to turne Traytours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
atleast wise, to favour Treason and Traytours, and
have treasonable hearts within them.</p>
   <p>5. Fiftly; This corruption is a large step to the abolishing
of the memory of this never to be forgotten Treason, and
of that solemne Holy-day on the 5. of November, instituted
<pb n="17" facs="9"/>
      <q>by<note n="g" place="margin">3. Iacobi c. 1.</note> Act of Parliament, for this very end, that our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained
thankfulnes for our happy deliverance from this
Hellish designe might <hi>NEVER BE FORGOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEN,</hi>
but be had in <hi>A PERPETUALL RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEMBRANCE,</hi>
that <hi>ALL AGES TO
COME</hi> may yeeld prayses to the Divine Majesty,
and have in memory <hi>THIS IOYFULL DAY
OF DELIVERANCE:</hi> (they are the words of
the Act.)</q> For when such a treason begins once to be blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
slighted, and the solemne gratulatory Prayers institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for its remembrance thus miserablie to be corrupted.
the next step can be no other, but the abrogating both of the
Booke itselfe, and the solemnity kept in remembrance of the
treason; And then when this is effected, the next newes we
shall heare of from Rome, will be the deniall of the Fact,
that there was ever any such treason plotted, though sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie

addition) <hi>it is not Lawfull for the Church to ordaine any thing

   <p>Which whole first clause to <hi>yet:</hi> Is no part of the Article,
but a meere forgery and imposture of the Bishops; Whose,
glosse is as pernicious as the text, or woise: For, by <hi>Church</hi>
they understand nothing else but <hi>Bishops;</hi> Making the sence
of this forgery to be this: <q>The Church, that is, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

   <p>If the Bishops here reply, that they found it added in
<hi>Rogers his Exposition on the Articles,</hi> printed some yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
   <p>J answer, that Coppy was not the Authorized Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
Originall by which they should be directed but a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard
Coppy, with which your Majesty would not have your
poore Subjects cheated or deluded.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Your Majesty therefore,</hi> prohibiting any the least difference
from the Articles allowed and authorized heretofore in Queen
Elizabeths dayes, by Parliament; <hi>Prohibited them to insert
this forged addition.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If they reply, that they were ignorant of the Originall
true Coppyes, and knew not this to be a forgery.</p>
   <p>I answer, that this is very improbable, that so many great
Bishops should be altogether ignorant, which were the true
genuine Articles of our Church, who had read, subscribed
and given them in charge to others so often.</p>
   <p>But admit it true, yet ignorance in this case is no plea at
all for any man, much lesse for Bishops; And if they are so
ignorant of the very Articles of our Church, J hope your
Majesty and others will thinke them very unmeet to be
Bishops in our Church, and trust lesse to their pretended
knowledge, judgement and learning in future times, giving
little credit to any thing they doe or say, without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of it, since they are so really or affectedly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the very<note n="*" place="margin">Which they might doe well to study a while, and give over their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Affaires, which make thē so blinde and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in divine things.</note> Articles of our Church, in the which they
pretend most skill. But if they knew the very Originall Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes
&amp; Articles (as no doubt they did,) and that this clause
was not in them, but a meere late forgery, most fraudelently
and corruptly added to them; Then they were accessaries &amp;
<pb n="21" facs="11"/>
wilfull consenters to this forgery, to delude both your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and the whole Church of England with it; Yea pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessed
rebels against your Majesties <hi>Declaration</hi> before these
two impressions, <hi>(made by their owne advice)</hi> prohibiting <hi>the
least difference from the sayd true Articles and Originals:</hi> And so
are they guilty of forgery, treachery and contumacy against
your Majesty in the highest degree.</p>

   <p>Having thus represented to your Majesties Royall view
these 3 grand forgeries and corruptions, give me leave (I
humblie beseech your Highnes) to adde to these, two other
late Jmpostures obtruded on the Church of England.</p>
   <p>1. The first by <hi>Dr.</hi> (then Mr.) <hi>Iohn Cosens</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates; Who Anno 1628. (the same yeare your Majesties
<hi>Declarations</hi> were published,) sett forth a Booke, intiteled:
<hi>A collection of private Devotions, or, the Howers of Prayer;</hi>
Wherein was much Popish Trash and Doctrine comprized,
and at least 20 several points of Popery maintained, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
all which, in the Title and Epistle of this Booke, he
<q>writes; That these Devotions of his, were after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
published by Queen Elizabeth, and were heretofore
<pb n="23" facs="12"/>
published among us by her High and Sacred Authority,
to witt, in the Preces of Horary, sett forth by her Royall
Authority Anno 1573.</q>
   </p>
   <p>VVhen as there is no Analogie at all either in matter, forme
or method, between these Devotions of his and those devout
Prayers of her Majesty, nor any of his points of Popery in
them, as hath been proved by<note n="s" place="margin">Cosens his Cose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. A tryall of Private Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>
      <hi>two particular Answers to his
Devotions in print:</hi> Yet these Devotions of his were never
yet suppressed, but publikely sold among us, approved by a
Bishops license, and now reprinted, to abuse your Majesties
poore Subjects, encourage Papists, and scandalize that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blessed
pious Queen, as the Authour and Patronesse of his
grosse Popery. An abuse not tollerable in a Christian
State.</p>
   <p>2. The second is as bad or worse. Anno 1631. One <hi>Iohn
Ailward</hi> (not long before a Popish Priest) published a Booke
<q>intiteled: An Historicall Narration of the judgement
of some most learned Bishops concerning Gods Election;
Affirming the Errours of the Arminians, to be the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Doctrine of the Church of England, and of the
Martyrs and Reformers of it, both in King Edwards and
Queen Elizabeths dayes.</q>
   </p>
   <p>This Booke (though written in professed opposition to
your <hi>Majesties Declaration before the 39. Articles,</hi> to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
Arminianisme (yet now made the only iustrument to
advance it and suppresse the truth) was licensed by <hi>Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn,</hi>
then Chaplaine to the Bishop of London, now Arch-Bishop
of Canterbury.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>The whole Booke except some 3. or 4. leaves containing
nothing else but a</hi> Coppy ef an Answer to a Letter, wherein the
Answerer purged himselfe and others from Pelagian Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This Master-peece, forsooth, is pretended to be sett out by
the Bishops and Reformers of our Church in the inception
of Queen Elizabeths raigne by publike Authority, and the
<pb n="24" facs="13"/>
Doctrine then taught and professed. When this new Booke
was printed, no Coppies must come abrode (as the Stationer
then affirmed) before the<note n="*" place="margin">Now Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> Bishop of London had presented
it to your Majesty, and gained your Royall approbation
thereof.</p>
   <p>Not long after this it flies abrode ouer all the Realme,
to the great amazement and disturbance of many of your
Subjects: One of them comming to that learned Knights
hands, <hi>Sir Humphry Lynde,</hi> (better read in Fathers and
Popish Authours then English Antiquities,) he was so much
stumbled and greiued at it, that he presently repaired with
it, to a Gentlemans study of his acquaintance; Telling him,
there was a new Booke, freshly published, which proued the
Martyrs and Reformers of our Church to be professed
Arminians, and that this was the Doctrine publikely taught
and printed by Authority in the beginning of Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths-raigne;
Saying withall, it would doe infinite harme,
and desiring him to take some paines to answer it.</p>
   <p>The Gentleman no sooner turned ever two or three leaves
of the Booke, but he presently discovered the grand Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture;
Informing the Knight, that this <hi>Coppy of a Letter, &amp;c.</hi>
was written by one <hi>Champenies,</hi> whom <hi>Iohn Venon</hi> (Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

      <hi>expresly affirmed, to be then a ranke Papist and a Pelagian,</hi>
and that in answer to this <hi>Verons Lectu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> es of Predestination,</hi>
then publikely preached at Paules, (<hi>dedicated to Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,
and printed by Authority in the second yeare of her
Highnes raigne.</hi>)</p>
   <p>He likewise acquainted him, that this <hi>Coppy of his Letter</hi>
was printed about the third yeare of her Dominion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Authours or Printers name thereto, or place where,
or yeare when it was printed, or any intimation at all that it
was ever licensed; All which were plaine evidences, that
it was printed in a corner, without any license at
all.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="25" facs="13"/>
And whereas (sayd he) you desire a speedy Answer to it, if
you will give me but a paire of gloves, I will show you two
Answers to it, already in print above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>0 yeares since, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Authority, and one of the first printed Coppies of this
Letter to boote.</p>
   <p>To which the Knight replied, J am sure you doe but jest
with me.</p>
   <p>No, sayd the other, I am in good earnest, wil you give me,
or wager a paire of gloves hereupon?</p>
   <p>That (answered he) I will doe with all my heart.
Then, sayd the Gentleman, reach me hither those three
Bookes he pointed to.</p>
   <p>He did so. The first was a Coppy of the Letter, without
name of Authour, Printer, date of time or place; Which
compared with that in this new Booke, proved the same <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now, sayd the Gentleman, you have seen the Originall, I
will shew you the Authour of it, (which he did in <hi>Verons
Apology, f. 37.)</hi> and likewise two severall Answers in print:
The first by <hi>Iohn Veron</hi> himselfe fore-named, intitled:
<q>An Apologie in Defence of the Doctrine of Predestination
Dedicated to Queen Elizabeth, and imprinted at London
by Iohn Tisdale in the fourth yeare of her Raigne; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this whole Letter is fully answered: The second, by that
famous Learned Man and exile for Religion in Queen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
dayes, <hi>Robert Crowly;</hi> In his Apologie of those English
Preachers and Writers, which Cerberus the three-headed
Dogg of Hell chargeth with false Doctrine, under the
name of Predestination; Seen and allowed according to
Her Majesties Injunctions, and printed at London by Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Denham, Anno 1566.</q> Wherein this whole Letter is at
large recited in severall Sections, and then answered <hi>Verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim;</hi>
This Booke being nothing else but a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Answer to it by publike Authority; As directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

to the truth and Doctrine of the Church of England
then taught and established.</p>

   <p>VVhich done; Now said the Gentleman, I have shewed
you many full old Answers to your, New Booke, and proved
it to be a meere lie and forgery from the beginning to the

   <p>VVhereupon, these Bookes, after they were halfe sold and
dispersed over the Kingdome, were only called in, but not
burned, nor any publike Act made against them, to discover
the practise and Imposture: Only the Gentleman was at the
cost, to send some of these old Bookes in answer of this new
Pamphlet, to the University Library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
acquainting some of his Friends there, with this

the fatt Bishopricke of Chichester for his notorious Schismes
and Innovations) whose Booke intituled, <hi>Apello Caesarem,</hi>
      <q>published in the yeare 1625. (as the words of your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
determine) did open the way to those Schismes and
Divisions which have since ensued in our Church. For
remedie and redresse whereof, and for Satisfaction of the
consciences of your good people, your Majesty did not
only by publike Proclamation call in that Booke of his
which ministred matter of offence, but to prevent the like
danger for hereafter, reprinted the Articles of Religion,
established in the time of Queen Elizabeth of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</q>
(a plaine resolution, that your Majesty intended to
establish only the originall Coppy of the Articles confirmed
in Parliament by <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> in which there is no such

   </p>
   <p>Yet notwithstanding this your Rayall care, this Booke of

to be a governour in our Church, before any publike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation
of his Errours) is bought and sold; And he not

hath presumed to plead, not only for a <hi>Limbus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum,

but likewise for <hi>Altars, Priests, and unbloody Sacrifices offred
upon Altars toe,</hi> in professed defiance to this your <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi>
For which some of your Majesties Courtiers who

that they wondred how the Arch-Bishops could sit by and heare
such a Sermon, and not commaund him out of the Pulpit.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>So insolent is this first grand Agent growen, because not

in some mens voyce to be recommended to a Bishopricke,
(if your Majesty reserve not the disposition of Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes
to your selfe, but suffer others to have a finger in
their disposall:) and all for the good Seruice he hath done
the Church of Rome, the affronts he hath offred to the
Church of England, and using such reproachfull words
against your Majesties Supremacy, for which another happily

was licēsed by his Chaplaine William Harwood, (yea
justified publikely by the Arch-Bishop in the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
in the Censure of Dr. Bastwicke.)</q>
   </p>
   <q>Quid facient Domini, audent cum talia Servi?</q>
   <p>When the Chaplains dare license such Doctrines, Bookes,
and Novelties by their Lords Authority, it is much to be
feared, that their Lords themselves dare doe as much or
more then this amounts to.</p>
   <p>If your Majesty will but inquire of these new Authours
and Licensers, who are the men that cherish and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
them; By whose Privity and Authority they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to attempt the writing and Licensing of such Bookes,
you may easily by these Rivulets trace out the Fountaines
from whence all these Enormities, Corruptions, Forgeries
and Innovations flow; And if you shall vouchsafe with all,
to cast your Royall eye upon the <hi>Remonstrance, touching the
encrease of Popery, Arminianisme, and the decay of Religion,

it is a thousand to one, but you will soone, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="34" facs="18"/>
the very parties, not only by guesse but by

   <p>Besides, if your Majestie will once more cast your prying
eye upon the late Visitation Articles of <hi>Bishop Wren, Bishop
Peirce, Bishop Monntague,</hi> and other your Prelates and Arch-Deacons,
visiting in their owne names and by their owne
Authority; Or cause a diligent inquiry to be made in all
places where Altars, Images, Crucifixes, bowing to Altars,
Tapers, rayling Communion-Tables Altar-wise, reading
Second-Service at the Altar, Consecrations of Altars, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Chappels are introduced, urged and many godly
conformable Ministers excommunicated, silenced, suspended
&amp; persecuted for not submitting to these with other such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations
and New-Doctrines; By whose Authority and
commaund these things are done and inforced; Or by what
Authority some Schollers, Ministers and Lecturers have
been refused to be admitted to holy Orders, Benefices and
Lectures, for not subscribing to certaine New-Doctrines &amp;
Ceremonies underhand propounded to them; (And with all

   <p>More particular light then this, is neither yet safe for me

   <p>If any thinke I have gone to farre in this; Let him know;
That it is only the zeale of doing your Majesty, my Country
<pb n="35" facs="18"/>
and Mother Church of England, faithfull service without
feare or flattery, (it being now no time to mince things, or
dissemble longer,) which hath thus farre transported me; In
whose just important cause and quarrell (how faint hearted
soever others shew themselves,) I shalbe ever ready, through
Gods assistance, not only to spend my Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>

And if J did it not when I had meanes and oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
I should neither deeme my selfe, a faithfull Servant to

   <p>And now since I have lanched thus farre out into this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous
Ocean. (perchance with hazard of drowning, or
Pyrats, unlesse your Majesty rescue me by a Patent of safe
conduct, and calme these boysterous Seas when they arise
to overflow me,) give me leave to wade but one step fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to acquaint your Highnes with the evill dangerous
fruites of these lewd practises, Bookes Innovations, and
then I shall cast anker in the secure Harbour of your Royall
Grace and Protection.</p>
   <p>1. First, they have produced aboundance of Schismes,
Factions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>arres, discontents, quarrels, heart-burnings, if not
mutuall malice, hatred and reproaches, among your people
in all places of your Realmes, and quite rent asunder that
ancient unity, peace, love and mutuall charity which flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
among them, before these Innovations crept into the
Church.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="36" facs="19"/>
2. Secondly, they have not only <hi>grieved, &amp; vexed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
soules,</hi> but even quite dejected the spirits, and broken
the hearts of many thousand <hi>godly L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ts</hi> and most faithfull
Subjects to your Majesty, who even pine away and languish
under them, for griefe and sorrow of heart.</p>
   <p>3. Thirdly, they have bred a generall feare in the hearts, &amp;
an over-great jealousie in the heades of your Loyall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of an approaching alteration of Religion, and totall
Apostasie unto the Sea of Rome; They having little left
to secure or arme them against this feare and jealousie, but
the syncerity of your Majesties owne Royal heart to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
your comfortable, pious <hi>Declaracions</hi> (now trampled
by these Novellers under feet in open scorne) and the zeale
of divers of your Nobility, to whom Gods truth and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
are dearer then their soules: Which no doubt they
will now declare by their actions in this time of need; To
your Majesties great joy and ease, and the daunting of these
strange audacious Innovatours, though hitherto many of
them have been over-silent.</p>
   <p>4. Fourthly, they have caused many to turne Atheists,
Skeptickes or Newters in Religion, seeing our Church so
wavering and unconstant; Many to fall off to Popery, and
hundred thousands of Papists from conversion, by encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and hardning them in their Antichristian Errours and
Superstitions, to which they see us running, if not flying so
fast of late, that they say they need not come towards us, since
wee are posting so fast to them.</p>
   <p>5. Fiftly, they have caused thousands of godly Christians
(the<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 18. 24. to 33. Acts 27. 23. 24 Ier. 5. 1. Ezech. 22. 30. 31. Psal. 106. 23. Exod. 32. 10, &amp;c.</note>

flie out to forraigne Countries and Plantations; Hundreds
to seperate from our Church, as now quite Romish and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian;
And made thousands ready for to seperate, it
<pb n="37" facs="19"/>
being now a common received opinion among many;<note n="*" place="margin">See a Booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titeled, The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Seperation from the Church of
England.</note>
      <hi>That
our Churches (especially our Cathedrals) are now so farre Popish in
all respects,</hi> (Latine Service only excepted, which they say is
countervayled by their merry all-sung never-wept Service,
which the people understand no more then Latine,) <hi>that we
have now the same, or at least as just cause to seperate from them,
as our godly Martyrs and Church had to seperate from Rome in
the beginning of Reformation.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And though the same reasons hold not alike of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
for the present, yet that they hold as firme in regard of
the future, since now wee and all our Churches are taught
and commaunded, <hi>to</hi>

      <hi>imitate our Prelates and Cathedrals in
all their Romish Rites and Ceremonies as their Mother Churches
and true patternes of Imitation.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>So that unlesse a speedy Reformation follow of these late
Corruptions and Innovations, halfe the Kingdome, for
ought I can conjecture, are like, either to turne professed Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratists,
or else to leave the Realme; To such a passe have
your busy Prelates lately brought things by their new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises,
Bookes, Articles, Ceremonies, Superstitions, and their
Suppressing of Lectures, Preaching, and godly comformable
Ministers, Sermons of Lords-dayes after-noones, Repetition
of Sermons, and the like.</p>
   <p>6. Sixtly, they give a great occasion to Iesuites, Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie-Priests

   <p>7. Seventhly, they open the mouthes of this Babilonish
Crew, and of forraigne and domesticke Papists, to slaunder
both our Church and Arch-Prelates, as if shee and they, with

      <hi>returning with the dogge to his vomit, and the

   <p>That this is the common Newes in most forraigne parts,
not only the reports of Travellers witnes, but <hi>Sr. Iohn Cooke</hi>
your Majesties principall Secretary of State, some few yeares
since (in the very infancy of these Innovations and backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings)
affirmed openly in Star-chamber (in the now <hi>Arch-Bishop
of Canterburies case</hi>) that <hi>this newes was spread as farre
as the very Wals of Rome itself, upon his certaine intelligence
thence; And therefore it was high time for your Majesty, your
Prelates and the State to looke more strictly to our Religion,
and to take away all occasions of such Rumours;</hi> Since which
there have been more occasions of them given then in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
yeares before.</p>
   <p>So as this Rumour is generally believed abroad as a most
certaine truth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and crept into some of their late printed
Bookes.</p>
   <p>This likewise is the common confident discourse and
persuasion of most Priests and Papists at home, both among
themselves and in the Company of Protestants, over whom
they now seeme to triumph, and sticke not openly to affirme
and justify, that both our Arch-Bishops (to omit others) are
theirs.</p>
   <p>To make this good, I shall give your Majesty two late
<pb n="40" facs="21"/>
instances, of which I have certaine intelligence, (and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
too if need be,) worthy your Royall considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
   <p>A Barkeshire Gentleman, of some worth, a Popish Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
was since Easter last 1636. at a publike meeting, where
were divers prime Gentlemen of the Shire, and 3 or 4 Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Peace, if not more; VVhere entring into Discourse
concerning some Controversies of Religion between the
Papists and us, with some of the Company, he used these
words in the hearing of them all; <q>Well Gentlemen,
you may talke and discourse of your Religion as long as
you please, but we have the Queens Majesty and the
Arch Bishop of Canterbury firme on our side; And so long
wee shall make our partie good enough with you.</q>
   </p>
   <p>Some of the Company questioning him for these words;
He answered, <hi>He would justify and make good what he sayd;</hi>
But was<note n="*" place="margin">Had a Puritan, as they stile them spoken but halfe so much<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

         </gap> he should have been fined, imprisoned, pilloried, <hi>&amp;</hi> lost his eares ere this.</note> never yet (for ought I heare) required to doe it,
though intimation hath been given of these speeches to some
whom they much concerne.</p>
   <p>When <hi>Dr. Cosens</hi> the last Summer 1636. removed from
the Bishopricke of <hi>Durham,</hi> to his Colledge at <hi>Cambridge;</hi>
He gave his Friends of New-Castle a farewell Sermon in the
Towne, at which Sermon (preached in the after-noone) most
of the Papists in that Towne were present: Two of them
the next morning meeting with two Marchants of the
Towne, who were Protestants, they went all into a Taverne
to drinke their mornings draughts: The Papists demaunded
of the Protestants, whether they heard Dr. Cosens his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon?
One replied, that he only heard of it, but heard it
not, by reason of some busines that hindred him: The other
<pb n="40" facs="21"/>
made Answer, that he heard it: The Papists demaund of
him how he liked it? He replied; That it was but a plaine
ordinary Sermon, and that he heard nothing extraordinary
in it: Yea, but said the Papists, did you marke his garbe,
his cringes to the Altar, and how he bowed himselfe when
Iesus was named? He hath the right garbe and duckes of
our Priests.</p>
   <p>The other answered, he did not much observe his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures.</p>
   <p>Well, said the Papists, Dr. Cosens is a learned honest
Gentleman, and to tell you truely, <hi>He and the<note n="*" place="margin">Some reported it of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> Arch-Bishop
of Yorke are both ours.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>The other bade them, take heed what they said.</hi>
Wee know well enough <hi>(said they)</hi> what we say, we tell you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
they are both ours.</p>
   <p>Whereupon one of the Protestants merrily replied: If
you will needs have both of them to be yours, <q>pray take
them to yourselves, we can spare them well enough.</q>
   </p>
   <p>Many words past to this purpose. The Protestants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of these speeches as scandalous to the Arch-Bishop,
and acquainted him there-with.</p>
   <p>Whereupon the Papists were Articled against in the High
Commission-Court at Durham, and cited to appeare there;
Appearance they made, but they have not yet made any full
answer, the busines being hushed up in a maner, and layd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe.</p>
   <p>Dr. Cosens in the meane time takes his journy towards
Cambridge; Most of the Gentlemen Papists in the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ricke,
to prove him theirs, brought him a dayes-journy on his
way, and some of them as farre as Yorke.</p>
   <p>Like speeches have been used by other Papists, yet more
privately &amp; modestly. The like report they in<note n="t" place="margin">In a <hi>Dr.</hi> new Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet stolen out of Studley his rayling Booke, for the most part, and of the same Subject.</note> print of

      <hi>Dr.</hi> Theodor Price, <hi>Subdeane of West-minster,</hi> that however

Papist.</p>
   <p>This, J confesse, is not only a report, but a truth; He being
a reported Papist long before his death; Which made many

<pb n="47" facs="24"/>
      <hi>Issachar,</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>Issachar is a stronge Asse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Is not this (may it please your Majesty) a fine peece of
Catholike Divinity, to account and call the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Church a fould of Asses; All Catholike Kings, Asses
with bels, all other Lay persons, Asses without bels; None
but Bishops to be Men and Muliters, and the Pope the chiefe
Muliter and driver of all the Asses?</p>
   <p>
      <q>So shall the Man be honoured, whom the Pope will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>The more zealous and devout one is in obeying him
and imbracing his Doctrine, the greater Asse they account
and call him.</q>
   </p>
   <p>Seeing therefore this is the high account, that the
Pope, his Bishops and Cleargie make of Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
I presume your Majesty will never suffer the Pope the
chiefe Muliter, nor any of his, nor your owne Bishops, the
under-Muliters, to yoake, bridle, sadle, or put halters about
your Royall necke, or the neckes of any of your Loyall
Subjects, much lesse then to ride, jade, loade, or drive either
yourselfe or them, (all which they now attempt and aspire to
doe;) Since if your Highnes should honour them in all this,
yet shall you receive from them no other applause or
thankes, no other Honour or Title for your labour, then here
<hi>Scioppius,</hi> and they all by him, gives unto <hi>Charles the Great,</hi>
to be: <hi>Tantus Asinus, &amp; verus Issachar Asinus fortis.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>A Title J am certaine your Highnes will not so highly
esteeme of, as to deeme it,<note n="q" place="margin">Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Dissolution. p. 21.</note>
      <hi>the most glorious in all your
Crowne,</hi> as you deservedly doe that other, <hi>Defender of the
Faith,</hi> which you have better right to farre then this, which
all Christians cannot but detest, though these Popish He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds
would bestow it on them.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="48" facs="25"/>
Wherefore to draw toward a conclusion, J shall now most
humbly beseech your Majesty, upon the bended knees of my
soule, to receive the premises and this poore <hi>Quench-Coale</hi>
into your most Royall and pious consideration; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
to take the Raines of Ecclesiasticall government and
affaires, from those who have thus abused them, (to your
Highnes, your Subjects and the whole Church of Englands
prejudice.) into your owne immediate hands; That so these
Abuses, Novelties and Corruptions here discovered; may be
thoroughly reformed, and the Kingdome of Jesus Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
perfectly and incorrupt among us.</p>
   <p>Jt was an excellent Counsell, that the late famous Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> gave to <hi>Maximilian</hi> his <hi>Sonne and Successour</hi>
when he lay upon his death-bed:<note n="r" place="margin">Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stons Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story in the life of Ferdinād, p. 684.</note>
      <q>Banish from thee such
as seeke new meanes to oppresse and grieve thy Subjects.
O how well it becomes a Prince, to heare the afflictions
and grievances of his People, and to redresse them! Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
not those who unburthen themselves all they can of
matters of Justice or Government, for it is thy chiefe
Office.</q>
   </p>
   <p>Unlesse your most Sacred Majesty follow this
his Royall advice, things are likelyer to grow worse then
better, if you remit all to your Prelates, and expect a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
to proceed from them; VVho need most reformation,
and are the chiefe delinquents.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> (one of the wisest and learnedst men of
his age) in his Booke<note n="s" place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 1. 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana. p. 56. 57.</note>
      <hi>De Regno Christi,</hi> dedicated to
<hi>King Edward the 6.</hi> Discoursing by what way and meanes
the Kingdome of Christ might and ought to be restored by
pious Kings, and what Counsellers they should use in this
Reformation, is bold to acquaint that godly King (who had
then at least as many godly Bishops as your Majesty hath
now, if not more,) that if he would have any restitution of
<q>the Kingdome of Christ here in England, he must not
<pb n="49" facs="25"/>
looke that it should proceed from the Bishops, neither
must he much depend on, or trust to their advice therein;
But must be the principall actor himselfe, and advise most
with men of an inferiour ranke.</q>
   </p>
   <p>His words (worthie your Majesties speciall observation
and fit for our present purpose) are these.<q>Primum, haud
