      <salute>Right worthy Sir,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Reade, that in ancient times among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, those were ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the dignity of Knighthood, which had with valorous mindes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised themselues in the warres, men of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and of life honest. These so qualified, were much honoured, and had many priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges granted them by the <note n="*" place="margin">Vt fusè docet Claud. Coteraeus. de Priuilegijs, &amp; iure Militum.</note> Ciuill Lawe; their deserts meriting such an esteeme and their worth reward due for the same. Now,
<pb facs="3"/> in a Christian Knight what can be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, then by a vertuous life to worship the true God, and out of a valorous Spirit to expose himselfe vnto imminent dangers for his Countries honour and safety?</p>
   <p>Your dignity you haue obtained in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of your Soueraigne, to the perill of your person, and to your large expences, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning your choice company of Followers, in their distresses. For this your bounty haue I heard them praise you worthily, and pray for you heartily. Sure I am, you went out with a resolute band, and more then so, with a Companie, by meanes of good instruction, well ordering themselues. Your glorie stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in the issue of the designement, being so warrantable, and honorable; howbeit it lay not in your power to make it prosperous: but in your noble resolution, wherein you may receiue comfort, <note n="*" place="margin">Nam <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientia rectae voluntatis max ima consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio est rerum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodarum. Cic. Fam. 6. ep. 4.</hi>
      </note> and so much the more, hauing such impediments, as might seeme able to countermand you otherwise to resolue: as the gray haires of that wise Lady, your aged Grandmother, laying it to heart; your loue of that worthie Lady, your second
<pb facs="3"/> selfe, so tenderly affectionated towards you; your so high esteeme and reuerence to your naturall and deare Father, so well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of his Countrey deseruedly: whose very life, I may say, (as <hi>Iudah</hi> spake to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> of his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> concerning <hi>Beniamins</hi> returne;) was bound vp in your life, being his only Sonne, the hopefull Heire of so great an estate.</p>
   <p>This threefold cord so strongly tying you, besides the infolded louing twists of Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Sisters, could not possibly haue bin vnloosed, if Generosity of Spirit had not bin predominate, and your obliged faithfulnesse to that euerlastingly-renowned name of an afflicted Princesse, bin of that commanding power to haue pressed you forward.</p>
   <p>As at your departure, for your so praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy resolution, I did my best seruice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my calling: and as at your returne, I could not neglect my dutie: so now hauing so good an occasion againe to expresse my truly honoring of you, I desire you to accept this, as a <hi>Memoriall</hi> thereof for the time to come. For, though I know my selfe by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb facs="4"/> to be a Preacher of Peace, yet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as I euer haue, so still I cannot but mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a valiant mind, and a Martially Spirited Gentleman, especially, if the same be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with true piety, the Crown of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Of which so qualified, the Lord, the God of hoasts, increase the number, in these dayes of warlicke imployments. And thus, in all dutifull respect, I for this present humbly take leaue.</p>
