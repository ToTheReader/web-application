FROM GOD AND HIS MOTHER THE Blessed Virgin Euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting felicitie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>VEN til this present, great is my affection towards you (Worthy Companie of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalitie of the Blessed Virgin Marie, Noble in linage, leatning, and vertue) nor is there anie thing I more desire, then very much to profit you; seing I haue receaued very much from you; that al in fine may returne to the self-same fountaines from whence it first sprang. Whatsoeuer in my youth I gained in learning or Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie I ascribe to the Sodalitie of the most Blessed Virgin, and this I
<pb facs="5"/>
freely testify to the world. To you I owe and to your Company, that IESVS Sonne of the Blessed Virgin, admitted me, altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, into his Societie. Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously I confesse, had it not been for your sodalitie. I had perished and many others with me. But hardly can a man perish amongst you, vnles he wholy withdraw his mind from you, and wil fully cast himself into perditiō. My opinion is, that no student in the Schooles profits in learning, except by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himselfe with you, he first learne this one thing; how, and with what sobrietie he ought to learne. Vertue is both the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of other things and her selfe. Most truly saith the Roman wiseman, and most fitly may it be accōmodated to those of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalitie of the Blessed Virgin Marie:
<pb facs="5"/>
There is nothing that more inuesteth our minds with honesty, and reduceth those that are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering &amp; flexible to a right course, then the conuersation of good men: for by little and little it des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth into our breasts and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth the force of a precept, by being often heard, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to our sight<note n="a" place="margin">
         <hi>Sen. Ep.</hi> 94. <hi>circa med.</hi>
      </note> Verily your onlie Companie &amp; aspect inciteth men to the loue of vertue; &amp; euen when you are silent a man may reape profit by your presēce. Most truly may I affirme of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, what the ancient Poet did Ironically speake of the City of Rome:
<q>
         <l>—<note n="a" place="margin">
               <hi>Iuue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sat.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 167.</note>
            <hi>Hic fiunt homines</hi>
         </l>
      </q>
      <q>
         <l>
            <hi>Here men are made:</hi>
         </l>
      </q>
And vnles a man amongst you learne to play the man indeed, and become modest, wise and chast,
<pb facs="6"/>
he looseth his labour in this life &amp; vnder the shape of a man, shrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth oftentimes manie kinds of brute beasts. He may take his pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and degrees in the schooles and Academies; proceed a good Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian, an eloquent Rhetorician, a subtile Philosopher, a learned Phisitian, or a notable Lawyer. But to be skilful in al these arts (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it auaileth for transitorie things) for the purchasing of Heauen it is but lost labour. To become a good Christian, a man of honest and vertuous conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, is true art, and solid wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome indeed. To obtaine this the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is but one way, <hi>Vertue,</hi> which if a man learne not amongst the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalities of the most Bles. Virgin, he wil with facilitie learne vices, without a Maister. Assuredly great varietie of vertue flourisheth in
<pb facs="6"/>
the sodalitie: <hi>Hic fiunt homines,</hi> here men are framed according to the square of vertue. They that fly these Companies are wickedly wary to their owne hurt. And such as refuse to be enroled amongst those of this discipline, or hauing giu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> their names, auoid these pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like assemblies, no where lesse seene thē amongst them, not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thē so much as by increasing their number: Such, I say, neglect to haue cōmerce with vertue, take libertie to be vitious and estrange themselues from chast &amp; modest eyes. Of so great momēt is a mans conuersation with good men; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reunto I confesse, I owe al that I haue. And to giue testimonie he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof to the world, I now of myne owne accord, most willingly offer to your consideration, (my most Worthie Maisters of the Sodalitie)
<pb facs="7"/>
this other treatise as a slender mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of my grateful mind.</p>
   <p>The title of this booke is <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phata Incontinentia, The Triumph ouer Incontinencie.</hi> Let no man here make an euil interpretation, for that it is dedicated to you, as if any of you were burnt with inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie: there is no such meaning, but to the intent it may not burne you. For as we make a medicine, that may be a remedy to some, an ease to others, and an antidote to the rest; so the vices being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, we must learne by what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to auoid thē in time to come. And for that it is very difficult to purge &amp; purifie mens soules tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an inueterate disease, it is a point of great prouidence, in him who hath once receaued a Medicine, to be no lesse careful in recouering health then preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
<pb facs="7"/>
To this end doth this booke so readily addresse it selfe to you, to preuent (for I presume there is no need to take away) the disease of Incontinency. Now why pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I not a booke of greater bulke? a guift more graceful and seemely then this is, I grant. But beare I beseech you with the slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der abilitie of the giuer, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with the vices of our Age, which if you seriously take a view of, you wil not deny there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie impurities &amp; great corruptiōs of manners now in euerie place; you wil freely acknowledged, the world growne sicke, and chiefly of incontinencie. We must not set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a sicke man great morsels, or grosse meat in large platters; but rather nurse him vp with little pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of lightest meates and smal messes of potage. The Same must
<pb facs="8"/>
we doe in this case. And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Genius of this Age, the world can hardly now be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise cured.</p>
   <p>Volumes &amp; prolixe bookes this fastidious Age hardly wil digest: wherefore wee must now in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cursorily intimate those things which are wholesome. Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious bookes &amp; briefe discourses although not so polite may with lesse difficultie correct those that are forgetful of honestie: But whatsoeuer others haue said or written, this vice of incontinencie ought to be pursued without meane or measure; for it is excessiue without bound or limit. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause incontinencie (a pleasing but pestilent venom) infecteth the most part of the world I could wish that manie might partake of this medicinal booke, which of
<pb facs="8"/>
right ought to be short, lest the malady it should cure, by lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring, be rather more and more encreased. Besides if I respect the Sodalitie of the most Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin (for whose honour, and good this little booke is written) I ought not to make tedious exhortations. There is a certaine kind of men, so docible, that they learne those things that are taught them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any long instruction, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend good things, so soone as they heare them. These so capable of vertue, &amp; wel desposed of their owne accord, are ordinarie in the familie of the Most Blessed Virgin.</p>
   <p>Wherefore I beseech you, (my most intirely beloued Associates) vouchsafe this little booke of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, the entertainment of a new guest: it requires not any exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site entreatie; but such as you are
<pb facs="9"/>
wont not to deny bookes of pietie. And for that I make no question, but you are feruently in loue with chastity, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, I am confident you wil with fauourable eyes, and eares accept this president of <hi>Nicetas</hi> triumphing ouer incontinencie. So I most humbly recommend my selfe to al your chast prayers. From <hi>Monachium</hi> the day of the purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the most Blessed Virgin the yeare of Christ 1624.</p>
