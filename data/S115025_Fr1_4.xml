   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are, who will expect from mee some reasons, why I, <hi>inter minores mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> should adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the laboures of my shallow and slender judgement, upon a Subject so Princely and <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount;</hi> Let such accept some few for many.</p>
   <p>In that degree of profession, and imployment in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lawes of this kingdome
<pb facs="12"/>
which I now injoy, &amp; have done these twenty five yeares. I had ever a desire to improve my knowledge not, only by traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and ordinarie rules of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but by a more exact inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <hi>Petere fontes potius quàm ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulos,</hi> to looke into the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and originall grounds of those lawes wherewith I was to deale.</p>
   <p>My first incouragement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I received by versing in a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned worke compiled and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed <hi>Anno,</hi> 1609. by Master Iohn <hi>Skeny</hi> a great <hi>Senator</hi> and privy Counsellor in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to our late blessed Soveraigne of famous memory KING <hi>Iames,</hi> intituled <hi>Regiam Majestatem,</hi> &amp;c. with his marginall annotations touching the Concordance of the divine law, the lawes of this
<pb facs="12"/>
land, and the latter Parliamentary lawes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred an occasion unto me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow some stolne houres (amidst many distracting businesses) in the studie of our <hi>Brittish, Saxon,</hi> and English histories, wherein I observe, notwithstanding the many and often permutations of State and government in the time of the heptarchie, as also before, and after, a constant observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fundamentall rules of our Nationall lawes in <hi>Tanto,</hi> though not in <hi>Toto,</hi> and I tooke no meane felicity therein, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wishing, that they were not so much neglected and underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, as they are by many, who are more conversant in <hi>Turkish</hi> and other forraigne histories, than in our owne, <hi>in sua re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica hospites, in aliena Gives</hi>
      <pb facs="13"/>
      <hi>Aliens</hi> at home and Citizens abroad.</p>
   <p>From the studie of those lawes I learned that the bodie of the common weale subsisteth by an ancient monarchicall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that the KING is <hi>Vicarius Dei</hi> and <hi>Caput reipubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae,</hi> GODS <hi>Vicegerent</hi> and the head of the Common-wealth. The members which make up the structure of our Republike are the LORDS spirituall and temporall, and the commons: the common-wealth hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in every mans actions, <hi>In praemium</hi> or <hi>paenam,</hi> either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the good or to punish the bad actions of men, crimes of omission, or commission; <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est rei-publicae ne quis re sua malè utatur,</hi> It hath such a power over the actions and estates of men,
<pb facs="13"/>
that no man must abuse or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imploy the talent of his minde, body, or meanes: And by the rules of contraries, Every man must well and rightly, order, and imploy them for the aid, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the head, and of that great body. Master <hi>Crompton</hi> in the dedication of his learned <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narcha,</hi> rendereth this motive; for the publication of that book. For that (saith hee) the body of the Common-wealth doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of divers parts, and every member ought to indevour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe according to his calling, for the maintenance thereof; I have studied how I might put my poore talent into the treasury; for the more safe conservation of that body. The same reason rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up some courage in me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise that work which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb facs="14"/>
in the precedent nuncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
   <p>I had no sooner finished and devoted that to the view and examination of an honourable person eminently learned in the lawes, but my meditations fell amaine upon the lives, lawes and memorable actions of our Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all paire of peerelesse <hi>Princes,</hi> and especially of our Brittish <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi> and afterwards perusing that most accurate and learned worke of Sir Henrie <hi>Wootton</hi> Provost of <hi>Eaton Colledge</hi> for the gratulation of his Majesties happy returne from <hi>Scotland.</hi> It bred a wonder in me, that two Subjects, the one noble, the other plebeian should at one and the same time, as neare as may be conjectured, concord for most things in their meditations, upon
<pb facs="14"/>
the noble acts and deeds of their most glorious Soveraigne.</p>
   <p>It seemes to me a strong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prevent the sinister con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and criticke opinions of those who will bee too censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous upon my publishing of this worke: and amongst them some of my owne calling, who never had their breeding in any Innes of Court or Chauncery, such I must passe by with the <hi>Poet,</hi>
   </p>
   <lg>
      <l>Carpere nostra voles? potes hinc jam lector abire</l>
      <l>Quo libet—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>I heare some already censure me, for writing some part of the life of our renowned Monarch in his life time; two presidents <hi>instar multorum</hi> shall serve to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate me therein. <hi>Asser</hi> who wrote the life of <hi>Alfred</hi> whilst he lived; And our ever honoured
<pb facs="15"/>
      <hi>Cambden</hi> who wrote part of the life of blessed Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> before her death.</p>
   <p>I shall adde a reason, that sith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence by nature wee are apt to imitate the worst things;</p>
   <lg>
      <l>—dociles imitandis</l>
      <l>Turpibus &amp; pravis omnes sumus—</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is most expedient that the lives of good and gracious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, being gods on earth, should be set forth unto their people as <hi>specula,</hi> a <hi>super</hi>-eminent watch-Tower whom their subjects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where might behold afar off, and learne to obey their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power; and as <hi>speculum,</hi> a mirrour wherin they might gaze on, and strive to imitate their Soveraigne in vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
   <p>Two points in my Parallell, I heare, are already quarrelled with.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="15"/>One concerning genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion at the saving name of IESVS; the Canonicall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of our Church ratified by regall authority injoynes it, and I will obey it; and if there were no such injunction, my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would warrant me to doe it, with freedome from Idolatry.</p>
   <p>The other, concerning recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations on the Lords day after the end of Evening prayer, for which I refer the Reader to the late translated worke of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Divine D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Prideux.</hi> In either of these I have not presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to use any arguments; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needed I, for then I should have walked <hi>ultra crepidam:</hi> and needlesse it is, to argue or dispute for that which authority hath commanded, and most insuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble insolence to speake or write
<pb facs="16"/>
against it: know, good Reader, that I have learned the fifth Commandement, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that subjection must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on superiority; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands not onely a naturall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from children to parents, but a civill obedience from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their Prince who is <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Patriae,</hi> and to all subordinate Ministers and Magistrates under him. How can any man thinke himselfe religious, who will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously violate that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, not onely in not obeying the Ordinances and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts of their Christian King, but in oppugning them, and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others from yeelding obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them. Let this suffice for matter of apologie; I shall conclude with a thankefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of some living Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
<pb facs="16"/>
to whom this Treatise of <hi>Alfred</hi> must especially ascribe a part of its being; M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Bryan Twyne</hi> sometimes Fellow of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Christi Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> for his learned and laborious work, touching the Antiquity of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi> out of which I excerpted many things conducible to my purpose; and to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Noel Sparks</hi> Fellow, and Greek Lecturer of the same house, for his faithfull and carefull collections out of <hi>Asser.</hi> These and many more I consulted with, before I brought it to that contexture and forme, wherein it now presents it selfe to publike view. And so beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Almighty to direct all our actions for his glory and the common good, and to blesse us with true piety towards him, unfeigned loyalty to our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
<pb facs="17"/>
and Christian charity one towards another, I rest,</p>
