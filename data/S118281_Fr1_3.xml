To no matter who, no great <hi>matter where, yet to be read</hi> there is matter why, although <hi>not much matter when.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>IT is no matter into whose hands or censure this my <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbiae Flagellum,</hi> or Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or Stripping of Pride fall into, if it come into the view of true Nobility or Gentry, I know it will be charitably accepted. If into the hands of degenerate yongsters, that esteeme Pride more then all the Liberall Sciences, who account the foure Cardinall vertues, inferiour to their owne Carnall vices, such a one will put me off with a scornefull tush, a pish, or a mew, and commit my Booke to the protection of Aiax. If a wiseman reade it, I know it will be discreetly censur'd; if a Foole, his Bolt is soone shot, and I am arm'd against it; if a Learned man peruse it,
<pb facs="5"/>
hee will beare with my bad Schollership; if an vnlearned, I care not for his opinion; if a man of knowledge view it, he will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my ignorance; if an ignorant Asse see it, hee will bray out his owne; if an honest Richman spy it, hee will be the poorer in spirit though not in purse; but if a proud Diues handle it, hee will esteeme it worse then his dogges; if a proud Courtier reade it, he will teare it to tatters; whilst a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Affable Gentleman, will louingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine it. If beauty chance to behold it, it will bid it welcome, if Pride stand not in the way; if a strong man that is not proud of it, grow aquainted with the contents of my meaning, I thinke it will content him; if Parents, or children, or all, or any body, that are not poysoned with pride, doe but see or heare it distinctly read, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it with iudgement, I am perswaded it will passe and repasse, with friendly vsage,
<pb facs="5"/>
but if any of the contrary faction come within the Aire of it, they wil vse it in some sort, as bad as the hangman may vse them. And so much for, To no matter <hi>who.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It is no great matter <hi>where</hi> this be read, for as a good man (being banished) is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer out of his countrey, because all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes are his, so my Booke in Church, Court, City, Countrey, Castle or Cottage, is one and the same; it may perhaps alter the place where it comes from worse to better, but the place can neuer alter the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest entents of it from better to worse. Therefore no great matter <hi>where.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To be read there is matter, <hi>why,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it strikes at the roote of a most deadly sinne, which almost as bad as an vniuersall deluge, hath ouerflowed the most part of the world; and though the Preachers on Earth, (Gods Trumpets, and ambassadors from Heauen) doe diligently and dayly
<pb facs="6"/>
strike at this abhominatiō, with the eternal sword of the euerlasting Word, yet what they cut downe in the day, like Mushromes, it growes vp againe thicke and threesold in the night, for whilst the husband-man sleepes, the enuious man sowes tares.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, I hauing a talent of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge lent me, by which I know that I must render an account one day, how I haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it, and hauing Written neere forty seuerall pamphlets in former times, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose henceforward (God willing) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the time I haue so mispent, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Pen in such exercises (which though they be no free from a rellish of mirth, yet they shall be cleare from profanation, scurrility, or obsceannesse I do know Pride is at such a height, that my Mole-hill Muse can neuer by mineing at her foote, shake her head, for where Diuinity preuailes not, Poetry in medling doth but shew the Suns
<pb facs="6"/>
brightnesse with a Candle. Yet forasmuch as I know that Pride cast Angels out of Heauen, made diuels in hell, threw man out of Paradise, was a maine causer of the drowning of the first World, is a deuow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of this world, and shall euer be accursed in the world to come, by this knowledge, I haue with a mix'd inuectiue mildnesse, shewed in this Booke the vanities of all sorts of Pride, not that I hope for amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to shew my honest intendment.</p>
   <p>I haue seene sixe or seuen fashion hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Gallants together sit scorning, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding a better man then any of themselues, onely because either his Hat was of the old Block, or that his Ruffe was not so richly lac'd, his Cloake hath beene too plaine, his Beard of the old translation, his Bootes and Spurres of the precedent second edition, and for such slight occasions a man hath beene slighted, ieerd and wonderd at, as if
<pb facs="7"/>
he had beene but a Zany to the fashion, or a man made for the purpose for them to whet their scorne vpon, and therefore to read this, there is a matter <hi>why.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It is not much matter <hi>when,</hi> for be it read on Fryday the Turks Holyday, on Saturday the Iewes Sabbath, on Sunday the Lords day, or on any day or all dayes, nights or howers, there is Diuinity with Alacrity, Poetry with honest mirth, and euery thing so interwouen, one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if it please not the generality, yet I hope in particularity it will be tolerably censurd by all that hate Pride, and loue hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. And therefore, not much matter <hi>when.</hi>
