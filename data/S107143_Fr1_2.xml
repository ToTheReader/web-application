   <head>TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTIE PRINCE, HENRIE, PRINCE OF GREAT BRIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINE, SONNE AND HEIRE APPARANT TO our Soueraigne Lord, IAMES King of <hi>Great Brittaine, &amp;c.</hi> AND TO THE MOST NOBLE AND VER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVOVS PRINCESSE, THE LADY ELIZABETHS GRACE, his Highnesse most deare Sister; all honour and happinesse, <hi>with eternall glorie through Christ</hi> IESVS.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost gracious and renowned Princes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing translated out of French into our English tongue, the booke of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of <hi>Jsaiah,</hi> interpreted and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Master <hi>John Caluin,</hi> of reuerend memorie: I humblie craue that it may be published vnder your most Princely names and protection. The reason of this my humble petition is, that the honor of so noble a worke may not be imbased by the meanes of my endeuours. This Prophet by birth was the sonne of <hi>Amos,</hi> estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by many to haue been brother to <hi>Azarias</hi> King of Iudah, and Father in law to King <hi>Manasses:</hi> which being so, this Prophet was by birth of the blood Royal, and descended of the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> which for the promise of Christ to come of him, was the most noble house of all the Kings of the earth. Being so borne, his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation could not be but Princely, and his bringing vp in all good learning, wisdome, vertue and honor. His spirituall graces, not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto by ordinarie meanes, but inspired into him immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Spirit of God, were excellent. This appeareth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the sixth Chapter of this Prophecie, declaring that an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
<pb facs="3"/> of God with a burning coale taken from the Lords Altar, and laide to the mouth of the Prophet, refined his lips and his tongue, that they became pure and precious as the finest Gold. The same is manifest in all the booke of his Prophecie; wherein both the light and the heate of that heauenly fire appeareth. For he not onely declared the will of God sincerely, according to the lawe and testimonie deliuered to <hi>Moses,</hi> but also foreshewed the future euents of the Kingdome of <hi>Judah,</hi> and of all the flourishing states and Kingdomes of his time.</p>
   <p>He Prophecieth also of the birth of Iesus Christ, as if hee had been taught by the Angell <hi>Gabriel;</hi> who brought the annunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and message of it to the blessed Virgin his mother. Of his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and death he spake, as if with the Apostle <hi>John</hi> he had stoode by when he was crucified. His resurrection he described, as if with all the Apostles he had stoode vpon Mount Oliuet, where the Lord tooke the cloude of glorie as his heauenly Chariot to ascend and goe vp to his Father. His zeale and indignation against sinne is euident euery where, in his sharpe reproofes of the offences of all estates.</p>
   <p>Finally, the booke of his Prophecie beareth written in the head of it the names of foure Kings, in whose time he prophecied; and before whom as a vessell of golde he bare the name of God with great honour. All which things being royall, it seemed to me most conuenient that his booke should still beare in the front of it the names of Princes. And as hee foreshewed that Kings should bee Fosterfathers, and Queenes Nurces of the Church of Christ, so my desire was that his booke might be published vnder the names and protection of Christian Princes.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, I was led hereunto by the example of this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whose exposition vpon <hi>Jsaias</hi> prophesie I translate; namelie, of M. <hi>John Caluin,</hi> a man in his time of excellent pietie and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and one of the great lights, whereby it hath pleased God both to chase away the errors of poperie, as the darknes of the shadow of death; and to cause his maruellous and comfortable light of the Gospell to shine vnto this present age. For hee dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his first exposition of this booke to the young Prince, King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, of famous memorie, for the princelie graces, for the zealous loue of true religion, and of al heroical vertues; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in his young yeeres he raised an admirable expectation of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="3"/> glorie, if his precious life had long continued. He was also most worthily renowned with highest glorie, for that gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in religiō, which was established by his regal authority, and which our English Church at this day with great comfort doth enioy, vnder the happie gouernment of our Soueraigne Lord the King, your most noble and renowned Father.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the same Author setting out againe this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie, amplified and enlarged, he dedicated this second editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our late most gracious Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> worthie of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall memorie in this Kingdome, for the reestablishing (after a few yeeres alteration) of the zealous reformation of her most ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous brother. Which example hath led mee in most humble manner to seeke for the same worke, the high patronage and protection of such Princes, like those to whom hee presented this his seruice.</p>
   <p>To whom I know none so like as your selues, both in regard of your high estate, and also in like most noble descent from the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted houses of Yorke and Lancaster. Besides which resemblance, your Highnesse also is of like yeeres to the yong Prince King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and in the eies of all the kingdome, of like hope of excellent vertue and zealous proceedings in the aduancement of Christian religion.</p>
   <p>In like manner your Grace resembleth the most gracious late Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> both in her royall name, and also in the constant expectation of all men, to expresse in time all the princely vertues and graces that shined in that most renowned Princesse, from this Westerne part of the world, to the furthest East, and to the rising of the Sunne.</p>
   <p>In which respects, esteeming such a dedication, most like that which my author made of his owne worke, I haue most humblie craued that this my translation of it might bee vouchsafed the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to haue your Princelie names written in the beginning of it. For notwithstanding the great difference that is betweene a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend learned writer and expounder of the holie Scriptures, and the translator of such an exposition, yet this meane seruice hath also his good vse in the Church of God; and is of long and tedious labour to such as take paines therein; which being gratiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slie accepted, may encourage others to trauell in this kind, and cause many to giue thankes to God for you both, by whose most
<pb facs="4"/> princely fauours and protection, they are made partakers of such worthie writings. And I shall alwaies pray Almightie God, with this new yeere, to multiply many more vpon you, and dailie replenish your hearts with all princely and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall graces, that may enable and adorne Princes of so hie estates, amongst this people.</p>
