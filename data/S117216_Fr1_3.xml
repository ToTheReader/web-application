   <p>SIR, I must needs discharge two Epistles vpō you the one
the Readers, that should be like haile shot▪ that scatters
and strikes a multitude, the other dedicatory, like a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
that aimes onely at your selfe: if either doe strike you,
it shal bee at your choice, whether I shall hit you in
the head, to let you vnderstand my meaning, or in the heart,
to make you conceiue my loue: yet I must confesse, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expresse my loue out of the flint, then my meaning in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part of the shot. I aime at you rather then the Reader, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
since our trauailes I haue bene pregnant with desire to
bring foorth something whereunto you may be witnesse, and
now being brought a bed if you please to bee Godfather, I
doubt not b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t this childe shal be wel maintained, seeing hee
cannot liue aboue an houre with you, and therefore shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you, when he is dead, he may be buried deepe enough in
your good opinion, and he shall deserue this Epitaph:</p>
   <p>Heere lies the Childe, who was borne in mirth,
against the strict rules of all Childe-birth:
and to be quit, I gaue him to my friend,
Who laught him to death, and that was his end.</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Yours while he is his owne: <hi>E: S</hi>
