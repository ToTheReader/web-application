   <head>The true Copie of the Letter I receiued.</head>
   <p>I Haue perused your Treatise dedicated to your dearest Cousins: which I find to be a vaine bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of words, without substance, order, learning, or trueth: and if you can procure, that two or three of the best learned of your side, will auow it vnder their hands to be the doctrine of your Church (else I knowe they will all disclaime from it, hauing seen the errors and weaknesse thereof) I will take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to shew, that in so short and friuolous a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, you could hardly compile more absurdities than there are couched. I wil proue, for example, that you mistake, and vnderstand not the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons your selfe would seeme to handle: that you most shamefully belie our Catholike writers: guilefully alleage both Fathers and Scriptures: heap testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ancient writers, without end or purpose: make obiections to your selfe, and answere thē not at all: I will proue that you alleage false Councels amongst the nūber of true, without any difference or distinctiō: that you reproue Fathers writings as counterfeit, which are most approued: count bookes of Scriptures Apocrypha, which are Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall. I will prooue, in these few lines, you write contrary to your selfe: contrary to your owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<pb facs="10"/> I will prooue that the booke is fraught with most palpable lies, errors, corruptions, &amp; falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: if you wil but procure, as I sayd before, that it may be countenanced by publike authority, with the subscriptiōs of <hi>2.</hi> or <hi>3.</hi> the most deepest schollers of your Sect. In the meane time I let it passe with this bare censure; and intreate you but to reade <hi>Bellarmine de Pont. &amp; de Concil.</hi> where you shall find most of your obiections of the errors of Popes and Councels already refuted.</p>
