   <p>IN the relaps of my danger (as I may so terme
it) when I was thought past cure, you were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to administer, and your vndertakings were
not in vaine, for the breath, I breathe, is what, you
then procured vnto me; the motiues that moued you
hereunto, (as well as Charitie, and mercifull disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
were (questionlesse) your good opinions, that I
would from thencefoorth become an honest man; I
therefore, that your expectation may not be frustrate,
and that you may not bethinke the good Act you did,
but rather glorie in what you haue done, haue made,
a reall and faithfull Recantation, of all my euill
wayes; which I here publish vnto the World, and (as
most especially bound) perticularly present you with;
take it as the inward man, vouchsafe it your kind
acceptance, gentle censure, and favourable protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but aboue all I doe desire the continuance of your
Loue, whilest I shall bee, what I here professe
