   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Penned this insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatise in the time of your great affliction, intending it onely for your priuate vse, by the diuine documents contayned therein, to lead your Honour through the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> into <hi>Elim</hi> the sweete waters of spirituall ioy and consolation, not purposing euer to make it publike; but shewing it to the most Reuerēd Lord Primate, he desired the publishing of it to the view of the Church.</p>
   <p>These poore meditations shall be
<pb facs="7"/>much honoured, if you vouchsafe as gracious an aspect to them written, as you did an honourable zealous, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend attention to them vttered by voyce; though as a picture expresseth not the life, so neyther can writing demonstrate the liuely <hi>Energie</hi> of the voyce which consists in vtterance &amp; action the two ornamēts of speech.</p>
   <p>I know you delight not to haue your goodnesse diuulged but rather be good then seeme so, and that you account vertues fairest <hi>Theater</hi> to be a good conscience those who shall receiue any instruction, refreshing, or consolation, by this poore worke, owe the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement (next vnto God) to your Honour, who haue so watered, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged my poore studies with your beneficēce, that my barren heart hath (blessed be God) both by preaching &amp; writing yeelded some fruite.</p>
   <p>I hate to be a Sycophant and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, yet frō my heart I wish that all the world vnderstood your Honours disposition both to my selfe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and the Common-wealth in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, that all other might be instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by your right noble example. First
<pb facs="7"/>for my selfe, I acknowledge to haue receiued, out of your free bountie my meanes and maintenance for which I humbly blesse the most high God, and your Honour.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Lysippus</hi> the <hi>Caruer</hi> worthily reproued <hi>Appelles</hi> that exact painter because bee had pictured <hi>Alexander</hi> with a thūderbolt in his bād as a God, the other vvith a Speare in his hand as a valiant Prince, I am perswaded they are more pleasing to your honour that only giue you your due, thē which ascribe to you that which your Hon:

   <p>How did those rogues &amp; villaines runne vp and downe the countries, robbing &amp; spoyling all, delighting and satiating their greedy &amp; vnsatiable lusts in rapine, bloud, murthers, thefts &amp; burning the Kings Maiesties most loyable Subiects, &amp; if the <hi>State</hi> by your Honours indefatigable labour, both of minde and body, had not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preuented that mischiefe, long ere this time, our blouds had runne downe the streets, our wiues, children and goods made a prey to those mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse, and greedy villaines.</p>

   <p>The way Right Honourable to be safe from the sting of these <hi>Farantu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, Syrens</hi> &amp; <hi>sycophants</hi> is, to take <hi>Dauids</hi> counsell,
