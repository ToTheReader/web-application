      <l>I Humbly craue your Worthinesse t'excuse</l>
      <l>This boldnesse of my poore vnlearned Muse,</l>
      <l>That hath presum'd so high a pitch to flye,</l>
      <l>In praise of Vertue and Nobility,</l>
      <l>I know this taske most fit for Learned men,</l>
      <l>For <hi>Homer, Ovid,</hi> or for <hi>Virgils</hi> pen:</l>
      <l>But for I with him haue both seru'd and sail'd,</l>
      <l>My gratefull duty hath so far preuail'd,</l>
      <l>Boldly to write true Honours late decease,</l>
      <l>Whiles better Muses please to hold their peace.</l>
      <l>And thus much to the world my Verse proclaimes,</l>
      <l>That neither Gaine nor Flattery are my aimes,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="4"/>But Loue and Dutie to the Noble dead,</l>
      <l>Hath caus'd me cause these Lines be published.</l>
      <l>And therefore I entreat your gen'rous Hearts,</l>
      <l>T'accept my duty, pardon my deserts,</l>
      <l>Beare with my weaknesse, winke at my defects,</l>
      <l>Good purposes doe merit good effects,</l>
      <l>Poore earthen Vessels may hold precious Wine,</l>
      <l>And I presume that in this Book of mine</l>
      <l>In many places you shall something find,</l>
      <l>To please each Noble well affected mind.</l>
      <l>And for excuse my Muse doth humbly plead,</l>
      <l>That you'le forbeare to iudge before you reade.</l>
