   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>IVERS of the learned Catholiques of our natiō <hi>(Gentle Reader)</hi> haue writtē sundrie bookes in our vulgar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to informe and instruct thy vnderstanding in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith and Religion, and I also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my little abilitie and slender Talentes, haue not beene wanting in that kinde. And diuers also haue either transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted other mens bookes, or published their owne to mooue and stirre vp thy vvill to pietie and deuotion: vvhom I desiring to imitate, haue compiled for thee these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrasticall discourses vpon the Psalme
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Miserere:</hi> In which I bring in the Royall Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> much lamenting, bewailing, and ruing his two great sinnes, the murder of <hi>Vrias,</hi> and his adulterie with his wife <hi>Bersabee:</hi> &amp; thereby I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to mooue the willes of all sinners to sorrovv &amp; repentance of their sinnes, and amendement of their liues. These dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses I intend principallie for great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, vvho also still persist in their sinfull state of life, though I exclude not other sinners, vvhose sinnes are not so great as <hi>Dauids</hi> sinnes vvere, no not any the least sinners: because though some sinnes be mortall, some veniall, some greate some lesser, yet if they be compared to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maiestie vvhich they offend, no sinnes are to be esteemed litle, be they in themselues neuer so litle: and so they also may take benefite by these my discourses. I haue liued long out of my Countrie, and so knovv not vvho are the greater, vvho the lesser sinners: yet this I knovv in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
<pb facs="3"/>
that there must needs be many, &amp; great sinners in England: because vvhere there are ill-beleeuers, there, ordinarilie, are ill liuers, and vvhere there are many beleeuers (as there are in England) there are many ill beleeuers (true faith and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe being but one) and consequentlie many ill liuers, true faith being the rule &amp; square of good life. For although some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times true and good beleeuers are not good liuers, because they liue not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of their faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and sometimes ill beleeuers doe liue vvell morallie, because guided by God his grace, vvhich is vvanting to none, they follovv naturall reason, and their ovvne vertuous inclination and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not the preceptes of their Religion: yet ordinarilie, ill beleeuers are not good liuers; &amp; at least, amongest good beleeuers you shall finde moe good liuers then amongest ill beleeuers. Wherefore these my <hi>Paraphrasticall Discourses</hi> and
<pb facs="4"/>
pitifull lamentations of King <hi>Dauid,</hi> (who was a true beleeuer, and yet some times an ill liuer, but in this psalme shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himselfe a true penitent) I entend for all sinners as well Catholiques as not Catholiques, and of what so euer Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giō, <hi>I beeing debtour to all:</hi> &amp; because I would haue them all to peruse these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</note> I abstaine from Controuersies in Religion, least I should auert any from the reading of them; onelie in paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the last two verses of this psalme, occasion beeing offered, I speake of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloodie and daylie sacrifice of the Altar, but so, that I rather touch it then handle it, mention it then treat of it, suppose it then prooue it in that manner as I might, hoping that this doctrine now, will not be distastfull; for seeing that now in Englād in very many churches, Altars, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore were throwne downe, are againe erected according to the laudable exāple and pious vse, and custome of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
<pb facs="4"/>
&amp; euē primitiue Church; to auerre a true sacrifice, will not be ill taken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to allow of Altars is to allovv of a true sacrifice, which vseth to be offered on them, an Altar, and a true &amp; proper sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice beeing correlatiues, of which th'one inferreth the other, and so the one can not be auerred vvithout the other, nor th'one denied vvithout the other. And although (as I sayd) there vvāt not bookes of pietie &amp; deuotion in Englād, to mooue the good to deuotion, pietie and good life, &amp; sinners also to repentance, the beginning (after faith) of all good life: yet I vvould not therefore be silent; rather by the exāple of other vvriters, I was encouraged to offer my myte, &amp; my small endeauours also for the cōuersion of sinners, &amp; to follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not onelie their examples, but the exāple also of my Sauiour <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> &amp; his Apostles. For he dyed for sinners, and <hi>came not to call the iuste, but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to pennance,</hi> and he <hi>left nintie
<pb facs="5"/>
nine in the desert,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Luc.</hi> 5,</note>
      <hi>to seeke out one sheepe that vvas last,</hi> and he and his <hi>Angels reioice more vpon one sinner that doth penance,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Luc.</hi> 15</note>
      <hi>then vpon nintie nine iuste that neede no penance.</hi> And his Apostles trauersed the world through many stormes of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, to gaine the soules of sinners, and to gaine them, thought it no losse, to loose their ovvne liues. And as sinne through humaine frayltie, doth so domineere in this life, that, as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith;<note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 13</note>
      <hi>All haue sinned and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed, all haue declined, &amp; there is not one that doth good, no not one,</hi> to vvitt so, as not sometime to sinne: so nothing is more necessarie in this life then penance, it being the onelie reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die against sinne, and the ground of Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and saluation. In Paradise there vvas no penance, because there vvas no sinne; that place being à place of innocēcie; In Heauen there is no penance, because,
<pb facs="5"/>
sinne being à miserie, can not haue accesse to that place of felicitie; In Hell there is no true penance because though there, be sinne, yet that place is a place of obstinacie, and sinne there, is not pardonable. But in this life and vvorld, penance is necessarie, because this life is subiect to sinne, and in this life sinne is also pardonable, vvhilest the sinner liueth. And therefore Holie scripture inculcateth nothing more then penance and repentance.<note place="margin">Ezech. <hi>18.</hi> Math. <hi>3.</hi> Luc. <hi>13.</hi> Act. <hi>2.</hi> Hieron. epist. <hi>8.</hi> ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metr. cap. <hi>6.</hi>
      </note> Penance as <hi>S. Hierom</hi> telleth vs is <hi>a second table after Shipvvracke,</hi> by which vve may escape drovvning, and svvimme out of the sea of sinne to the hauer and hauen of of grace. Penance is a salue against all the vvounds of the soule, it is a plaster against all her sores of sinne, it is a soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne receite against all her spirituall diseases. And vvhereas many vvoundes and diseases corporall, are incurable by corporall physicke, no disease of sinne in this life is incurable, but onely finall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence,
<pb facs="6"/>
because it excludeth pennance. And vvhereas no corporall physicke can of old, make vs young, or of dead, liuing againe: pennāce will make the soule after she is old and decrepite by sinne, younge againe by grace and <hi>newnes of lyfe:</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>2.</hi> Co. <hi>4</hi> Eph. <hi>4. 4.</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los. <hi>3.</hi> Epla ad Tit. c. <hi>3. 1.</hi> Pet. <hi>1. 1.</hi> Rom. <hi>6.</hi> &amp; <hi>12.</hi> Gal. <hi>6.</hi>
      </note> It maketh vs <hi>put of the old man, and put on the new, it regenerateth vs and maketh vs new creatures,</hi> and after vve are dead in soule by sinne, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storeth vs to the life of grace, yea &amp; glorie also, if vve perseuer in grace. For these causes I haue made these <hi>Paraphrasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Discourses,</hi> to allure sinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, knowing hovv miserable a thing it is to liue in sinne, hovv dangerous to deferre repentance, and hovv hopelesse to dye in sinne without it. And if by these my small labours, I shall be so happie as to conuert any sinners, yea but one sinner, I shall esteeme it no small benefite, not onely to the sinner conuerted, but also to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
<pb facs="6"/>
because <hi>S. Iames</hi> assureth me, that <hi>he that maketh a sinner to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted from the errour of his wayes,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Iacobi</hi> 5.</note>
      <hi>shall saue his soule from death and couer a multitude of sinnes,</hi> not onelie of the sinner vvhom he conuerteth, but also of his ovvne; because the conuersion of a sinners soule, is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the conuerters soule more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God, then if he had offered an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catombe, yea a world to God for his owne sinnes. For, as <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sost. ho <hi>3.</hi> in <hi>1.</hi> ad Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</note>
      <hi>nullius rei pretiū est cū anima con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferendū, ne totus quidem mundus; quare etiamsi diuitias innumeras dederis pauperibus, nihil tale effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, quale is qui conuertit animam. The price of nothing, no not of the vvhole vvorld, is to be cōpared to a soule. Wherefore although thou shalt giue innumerable riches to the poore, thou shalt not doe so great a
<pb facs="7"/>
worke, as he that conuerteth a soule.</hi> But of penance and the effectes of it, I shall not need in this Epistle to vse moe words, it being the principall subiect of my ensuing <hi>Paraphrasticall Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses;</hi> and therefore here I shall take my leaue of my Reader, and desire him vvhether he be Catholicque or not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicque, to take in good parte this my litle labour, intended and taken for th' one, as vvell as for the other: and if he take profit by it, let him thanke God th' Authour of all that is good; if, through my default, it moue him not to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendement of life, vvhich I entended, I must desire him to pardon me: I vvas not so able, as vvilling.</p>
