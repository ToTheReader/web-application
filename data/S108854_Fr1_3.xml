   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or as much (deare Christian) as many
weake ones are often terrified with ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
of troubles more then they should,
and many others lesse regarde them then
they ought: I thought good to put foorth a
fewe rude verses, of my poore Meditation
therevpon: partly to incourage the weake
and feeble in faith towards God, and partly to call the rashe
hardy, to learne better the cause thereof, if any such befall vs.
As some times God reuengeth sinnes, where men little
looke for punishment: yea and full often and many wayes God
striketh, when sildome the strocken, consider whose hand it is,
or for what cause it is. Therefore my small worke tendeth to
shew vnto such, who it is that striketh, and the cause why so
many and sundry wayes we are strocken: I trust none of right
modestie can dispise my good meaning herein. And as I
would gladly accept the like incouragement from others, so I
trust this of mine, shall be taken in good part: and somewhat
mooue some vnto meditation vpon Gods word, which is an
helpe ready to all that come with care to seeke saluation: to
which worde, I pray God giue you grace to flie vnto in all
distresse, as vnto your chiefest hould and Tower. <hi>Amen.</hi>
