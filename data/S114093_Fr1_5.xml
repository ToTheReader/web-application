      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the first age of the world from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> men had no other guide to conduct them for the carriage of their liues, then the Law of Nature, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 2. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But the motions of the heart are discerned by the Law spiritually vnderstood, and therefore men being as young schollers, which cannot frame their letters without a Copy, God gaue them a Law written as a mould wherein to cast all their thoughts a touchstone wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to try all their words, the Beame of the Sanctuary, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon all their actions should be ballanced, all their workes weighed, a written warrant without which a good man dare doe nothing, and with which what dare he not? This is the Morall Law contained in the <hi>tenne Commandements,</hi> vnto which this is the Preface, like the forefront of the Sanctuary like the sound of a trumpet before some weighty proclamation, a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of the law, as <hi>Iohn</hi> of the Gospell with letters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.</p>

      <hi>GOd spake these words:</hi> 1 In other parts of the Bible God vsed other mens mouthes, <note n="b" place="margin">Luc. 1. 70</note>
      <hi>he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets,</hi> and <note n="c" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21</note>
      <hi>holy men of God spake as they were mooued by the holy Ghost:</hi> 2 he vsed other mens pens, there were Scribes which were the pens of Gods owne finger, as there were <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> so <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <note n="d" place="margin">2 Chr. 24 11.</note> mens Scribs called Notaries, <note n="e" place="margin">Ier. 36. 10</note> Secretaries, <note n="f" place="margin">2 Reg. 18. 18.</note> Recorders, and <note n="g" place="margin">Ier. 8. 8.</note> Gods Scribes whose office was to write the words of the Lord and to expound it; but in deliuering this law, God spake himselfe. The <hi>Decalogue</hi> was the immediate word of his owne mouth, he did <note n="h" place="margin">Ex. 31. 18</note> write himselfe, he made his owne pen publike Notary of his tongue, his owne finger was the pen, so that we may say as the <hi>Inchaunters</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> in another case, <note n="i" place="margin">Ex. 8. 19.</note>
      <hi>Digitus Dei est hic, this is the finger of God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This double dignity in speaking and writing, which the law hath aboue other scripture, teacheth vs to lend a most attentiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> eare vnto it.</p>
   <p>The holy Ghost commends vnto vs some scriptures as more excellent then other, in respect of our vse or seuerall necessities, by remarkable notes, either in the beginning of the speach,
<pb n="3" facs="8"/> as <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 1. 23</note>
      <hi>behold,</hi> which marke of attention is as the ringing of a Bell before the sermon, or in the end of the speach as <note n="l" place="margin">Ps. 3. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </note>
      <hi>Selah,</hi> which is a postcript, and teacheth vs to looke backe and in this case to be like <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 19. 26.</note>
      <hi>Lots</hi> wife, who turned backe and looked behind her.</p>
   <p>Sometime the holy Ghost writeth more artificially then at other times as <note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 111. 112. 119.</note> some psalmes, and the <hi>Lamentations</hi> of <hi>Ieremy</hi> are written in an <hi>Alphabeticall</hi> order to note their dignity, and helpe the memory.</p>
   <p>Sometime the holy Ghost giueth some scripture a name aboue other names, as <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth the 120 Psalme and 14 Psalmes following, <hi>songs of Degrees,</hi> not for that the <hi>Leuites</hi> did raise the tune in singing those Psalmes, for these and other Psalmes had the like tune, nor yet because they were sung on the stayers of the temple, for <hi>Salomon</hi> built the temple after those Psalmes were stiled by that name, but because (as a learned writer of our time hath well obserued) they were excellent Psalmes of a higher degree, and more speciall vse.</p>
   <p>But neither note, nor name, nor any thing else can commend vnto vs any especiall scripture, whereby to moue attention so much as this which is <hi>superlatiue</hi> to them all, God deliuered the law with his owne mouth, God did write it with his owne fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, so that he might say for the one as <hi>Ioseph</hi> to his brethren; <note n="o" place="margin">Gē. 45. 12</note>
      <hi>Beholde, your eyes doe see that mine owne mouth speaketh to you:</hi> and for the other, as <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon,</hi>
      <note n="p" place="margin">Philem. 19</note>
      <hi>I haue written this with mine owne hand.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>2. God is a Iudge, his Law is a Charge, and when the Iudge doth giue the Charge, euery man is ready to harken to it.</p>
   <p>3. There is an interchangeable speach betwixt God and vs, we speake vnto God in prayer and thankesgiuing, he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to vs, by the audible sound of his word, or secret voice of his Spirit; we cry vnto God that he would heare vs, that our prayers may goe vp, and his mercy may come downe, that God and our prayers may meete together in heauen, <note n="q" place="margin">Ioh. 4. 7.</note> as Christ and the woman at <hi>Iacobs</hi> well, and God interchangeably crieth to vs that we would heare him: the voice that descended from heauen gaue nothing else in charge but this: <note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 17. 5.</note>
      <hi>heare him:</hi> as though other duties were comprised in hearing, and Christ
<pb n="4" facs="9"/> speake of hearing, when he told <hi>Martha,</hi>
      <note n="s" place="margin">Luc. 10. 32.</note>
      <hi>one thing was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> as though other necessities were to giue place vnto it. <note n="t" place="margin">Pro. i. 24. 28.</note>
      <hi>He that stoppeth his eares when God speaketh, shall speake himselfe and not be heard.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Therefore be not like hounds, which haue their eares hanging towards the earth, by reason whereof the sound and voice cannot so soone enter; much lesse be like the deafe adder, <note n="u" place="margin">Psal. 58. 4</note> which stoppeth her eares, but be like the little birds which peirk vp their heads when the dam doth bring them meat, and be ready to say with <hi>Samuel</hi> when God speaketh, <note n="x" place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 10.</note>
      <hi>speake Lord thy seruant heareth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Secondly <hi>God</hi> speaketh. Therefore wash away the dregs of sinne before you come to heare, as the adder slips of her skin as the Eagle casts her bill, as blind <hi>Bartimeus</hi> the legger threw<note place="margin">
         <hi>y</hi> Mar. 10. 50.</note> away his cloke before he came vnto Christ.</p>
   <p>
      <note n="z" place="margin">Es. 55. 1.</note> Come to the waters and drinke, but be like the Serpent, who when he comes to drinke, first spues vp his poison.</p>
   <p>Gods law is pure, and will aske pure and cleane vessels wherein to keepe it; it is new wine, and will not be put into old stinking bottels: <note n="a" place="margin">Ps. 119. 105.</note> Gods word is a Lanterne and light, sinne is a curtaine drawne ouer the heart, which hideth and eclipseth the light from shining vnto you, and therfore first <note n="b" place="margin">Iam. 1. 27.</note> lay apart all filthinesse and superfluity of maliciousnesse, and then receiue with meeknesse the <hi>word that is graffed in you which is able to saue your soules.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, <hi>God speaketh:</hi> therefore heare with reuerence.</p>
   <p>If a Proclamation come from the King, we vncouer our heads to harken to it: when <note n="c" place="margin">Iud. 3. 20.</note>
      <hi>Ehud</hi> told <hi>Eglon,</hi> he had a message from God, he arose from his throne: <note n="d" place="margin">Deu. 31. 26.</note> The <hi>Arke</hi> wherein the law was put <note n="e" place="margin">Ex. 25. 11 14.</note> was within and without ouerlaid with pure gold. It was carried vpon barres that the Leuites might not touch it, that so the maiesty and dignity might breed in the people reuerence: when the <hi>Arke</hi> came from the Philistims, the Bethlemites recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it with great gladnesse, but vsing it with little reuerence, <note n="f" place="margin">1 Sam. 6, 19.</note> it caused the destruction of many.</p>
   <p>It was not giuen in charge to the Elders of Israel to teach the people as it was to the Leuites, yet when the law was deliuered to the sonnes of <hi>Leui,</hi>
      <note n="g" place="margin">Deu. 31. 9</note> it was also deliuered to the Elders, and they were ioyned as assistants with them,
<pb n="5" facs="9"/> that it might be the more reuerently regarded of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
   <p>If wee heare the law as <hi>Sarah</hi> did the message of the Angell, <note n="h" place="margin">Gē. 18. 12</note> who laughed when shee heard it, or as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did the message sent vnto him from God concerning the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Israell,</hi>
      <note n="i" place="margin">Ex. 5. 2.</note> who blasphemed when he had heard it, or as <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> did the rowle which <hi>Baruch</hi> wrote at the mouth of <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
      <note n="k" place="margin">
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>er. 36. 23</note> who cut it in peeces with a penne-knife, and burnt it when hee had heard it, if wee can dispute and talke of it as though our tongues did runne vpon pattens, if we cast it behind vs <note n="l" place="margin">Ps. 50. 17.</note> as the vngodly in the fiftieth Psalme, then the excessiue reuerence of the Iewes shall condemne our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, who at this day heare and reade, keepe and vse the law of God with all reuerence, they neuer lay any other booke vpon the Bible; they wash their hands before they touch it, they will not sit vpon the bench where it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as often as they open or shut it, they vse to kisse it.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, <hi>God speaketh</hi> therefore beleeue.</p>
   <p>That men might get credit to their lawes they were repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee inspired by the Gods at Rome, at Athens and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, the Heathen gods were lying gods and dying gods, but God who gaue this law is trueth and life, and his law like himselfe, <hi>vera est, viua est, sana est, plana est,</hi> what he speaketh passeth by indenture, by couenant, by oath, before good witnesses, signed with the finger of the holy Ghost, and sealed with the bloud of the Sonne.</p>
   <p>2. If inferiour persons speake they perswade by reason, knowing they haue no authority to giue them credit: <note n="m" place="margin">Ex. 4. 1.</note>
      <hi>They will not beleeue mee</hi> (saith Moses) <hi>they will say the Lord hath not appeared vnto thee,</hi> therefore the Lord tels him, hee shall haue a testimoniall, hee shall haue euidence to shew, the miracles which he worketh shall proue his commission: but Kings and Princes of their meere authority looke to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, here God speaketh <note n="n" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 15.</note> who is King of Kings, take the word of a King for it.</p>
   <p>3. <hi>Ipse dixit,</hi> among <hi>Pythagoras</hi> schollers went current, if their master said it, it was enough, they set vp their rest, and shall not we that are schollers of Christ, giue the like credit to
<pb n="6" facs="10"/> our master in heauen? Beleeue when he saith he will visit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue when he saith he will shew mercy. Neither doth the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell vse any other argument to confirme the women in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection then this, <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 28. 7</note>
      <hi>Loe I haue told you.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Lastly, <hi>God</hi> speaketh. The law is his word, and therefore it must not goe in at one eare, and out at another, it must not be as musicke, which once ended there is no more remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it, or as vntimely fruit, which perisheth as soone as it is brought forth: if it were of no reckoning, it were no matter, if it went as it came, if it were of little moment, it were no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter though it went no further then the outward eare, then the porters lodge; but it is purer then gold, yea then much fine gold, <note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 13. 46.</note> it is a pretious pearle, and therefore must be kept vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der locke and key in the closet of the heart, <note n="q" place="margin">Col. 3. 16</note>
      <hi>it must dwell in vs,</hi> we must be like <hi>Iacob;</hi>
      <note n="r" place="margin">Gē. 37. 11</note> who noted the saying, and like <hi>Mary,</hi>
      <note n="s" place="margin">Luc. 2. 51</note> who kept all the sayings in her heart. If we can say as <hi>Iob</hi> in another case, <note n="t" place="margin">Iob 16. 2.</note>
      <hi>We haue often heard such a thing,</hi> and doe not incorporate it, and keepe it in vs, we shall receiue the same checke which the Iewes did, <note n="u" place="margin">Io. 5. 38.</note>
      <hi>His word haue yee not abiding in you.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>God spake all these words.</hi> When God would blesse the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which kept his law, and curse the disobedient, <note n="x" place="margin">Deut. 27. 12. &amp;c.</note> six Tribes should stand vpon mount <hi>Gerizhim</hi> to blesse, and six vpon mount <hi>Eball</hi> to curse, and the people should not be left out, for they should answer and say, <hi>So be it:</hi> In setting downe the <hi>Articles</hi> of our faith, it hath been held as a traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>Peter</hi> began, and afterwards euery Apostle added his <hi>Article,</hi> and therefore called the <hi>Apostles Creede,</hi> but in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the Law, God was not one of six, nor one of twelue, he had no copertner but spake all himselfe as, <note n="y" place="margin">Iams 2 11</note>
      <hi>He that said thou shalt not commit adultry, said also, thou shalt not kill,</hi> and so of the rest.</p>
   <p>If God spake all, then we must heare <hi>all,</hi> obey <hi>all.</hi> The Iewes could be content to heare <hi>Steuen,</hi> till he touched the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi>
      <note n="z" place="margin">Act 7. 54</note> but then they <hi>gnashed at him with their teeth:</hi> to heare <hi>Paul,</hi> till he deliuered words which stood not with their liking, then they said, <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 2. 22</note>
      <hi>Away with such a fellow from the earth, for it is not meet that hee should liue.</hi> The blasphemer who armes himselfe to strike the Lord with some deadly
<pb n="7" facs="10"/> wound can happily be content to heare the first, to heare the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commandement, but if God will speake further, he shall haue better leaue to hold his peace, if he will write further in the first table, he will be ready to cry <hi>manum de tabula,</hi> harpe no more on that string, vntoothsome is that truth, which trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth downe his owne likings. The Adulterer waiteth for the twilight, and commonly faulteth in the darke, and because the seuenth commandement doth light him a candle, he doth not willingly giue it the hearing: and so of the rest, if any one commandement doth crosse the paths of our speciall delights, would wrest vs in tune, would call the eye of the soule home to it selfe, and make vs see a glimpse of that we would not, we can no more away with it, then the owle can with the sunshine, or then the frantick man can with him that bindeth him: <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 11. 25.</note> Sin it selfe is sweet, but the checke of sin is bitter, and no commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gratious that is a censure of that iniquity we delight in, but God that speaketh all bids vs <note n="c" place="margin">Deu 12. 28.</note>
      <hi>heare all.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Secondly: <hi>God spake all,</hi> therefore we must obey all.</p>
   <p>The breach of one commandement is enough to stanch the bloud of the dying Lord: he that is hurt may as well die of one mortall wound as of an hundred: the least forfeit forfeiteth the whole lease, the least leaking may drowne the ship, and <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 5. 19</note>

   <p>Therefore the Pope is to blame two waies, 1. In leauing out one commandement, 2.

      <hi>like Elyes arme,</hi> but the very legs of their holy father the Pope are broken, <note n="b" place="margin">Io. 19. 32</note> like the legs of the theeues, which were crucified with Christ.

King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt broke his left leg, of Idolatrous seruice, when the temple was well purged, Images burned, when many papists shipt ouer their trinkets, and packt away their paltry; but our late Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory crushed his head, <note n="c" place="margin">Iud. 9. 53</note> like the woman who cast a peece of a milstone vpon the head of <hi>Abimel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Secondly, if God spake all, and all must be obeyed, then is the Pope to blame to dispense with the law, or any part of it, yet hee alloweth of curtizans (who pay tribute for licence to be common whores, the Auditor of his Exchequer excommunicating those, which keepe not touch in bringing it in;) neither is onely fornication finable in <hi>Rome,</hi> and a good

   <p>Neither dispenseth he with the breach of the seuenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement alone, but if hee bee displeaseed with the King, as he was with King <hi>Iohn,</hi> then against the fifth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hee assoileth Earles, Barons, Knights, and all other manner of men of their homages, seruices, and fealties that they should doe vnto him, commanding vnder paine of his great cuise, that no man should obey him, keepe him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, eate or drinke or talke with him, forbidding his owne houshold to doe him any kind of seruice, either at bed, or at boord, in Church, hall, or stable: But what need I speake of this or that particular Commandement, when the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists say, he may dispense with the lawes of God and sinnes of men, that hee may dispense against the law of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against the law of Nature, against Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, against the old, against the new, against all the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of the old and new Testament: May I not say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi>

   <p>
      <hi>I am the Lord:</hi> God hath a Lordship in heauen, where he hath good seruants; in hell where hee hath bad, in earth where hee hath both: hee is not a God of heauen alone, as the Poets feined <hi>Iupiter,</hi> not of hell alone, as they fained <hi>Pluto,</hi> nor of earth alone, as <note n="f" place="margin">1 King. 20 23.</note> the <hi>Aramites</hi> spake, as though there were gods of the mountaines, and gods of the vallies, but of all.</p>
   <pb n="12" facs="13"/>
   <p>The Pope, though he hath but some angle, not all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the earth, though he is but as a foxe in a hole, yet the Papists say as much of him, as God saith here of himselfe: his discreet Doctors say, he is <hi>potestate maximus, bonitate optimus,</hi> which Epithites in former times were proper to God, who was called, <hi>Deus Optimus Maximus.</hi> Others say, he is not wholy God, nor wholy man, and this was true in Pope <hi>Ioane,</hi> they speake righter then they are aware, for she was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: but a Canonist saith plainly, onr <hi>Lord God the Pope,</hi> and the Pope (as Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> reporteth) was content to suffer one of his parasites to say vnto him in the late Counsell of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran, Thou art another God on earth,</hi> and he weareth a triple crowne, either because he would vsurpe the Antichristian pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer the three diuisions of the world, <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Affricke;</hi> or else for that he would be a Lord of heauen, where he may Canonize Saints of hell, where he may free soules out of Purgatory, of the earth, where he may bind and loose, set vp and put downe at his pleasure, and because happily you will not beleeue their owne bare words, you shall heare how they bring scripture for it, <note n="g" place="margin">Ps. 8. 6.</note>
      <hi>he hath put all things in subiection vnder his feet, the beasts of the field</hi> .i. men liuing on the earth, <hi>the fishes in the sea</hi> .i. soules in Purgatory, the foules of the ayre .i. the soules of the blessed, <hi>risum teneatis?</hi> this would make <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi> himselfe, who alwaies wept to fall a laughing, it were present remedy against all his teares.</p>
   <p>But in earnest, if the Pope cannot doe this, why doe they attribute so much vnto him: if he can, what can God doe more? he can say no more in generall tearmes to shew his power and dominion, to shew his mercy and goodnes then this, <hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi>

      <hi>vbi est, quia vbique est,</hi> the Pharisees should not aske where he is? but where is he not? he is a circle whose centre is no where, and circumference euery where; he filleth all things, not that they containe him, but rather that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains them; he is whole in all things, and all things in him, and as he beareth vp heauen and earth, and yet is not burdened, so he filleth heauen and earth, and yet is not inclosed. Heauen is his chamber of presence, there he is by glory, the heart of his

   <p>The vse of this doctrine is manifold: First in respect of the agent, it abateth the edge of euery crosse to consider, it comes from the hand of God, the child is content to beare with his father who brings him vp, though he be rough to him, though he visit his offences with the rodde and his sinne which scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: God is our father <seg rend="sup">y</seg> and brings vs vp as children, if he nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureth

   <p>God made <hi>Iob</hi> a <hi>by-word of the people,</hi> that is so afflicted him, that all the world talked of him, and therefore he speaketh of astonishment, <note n="e" place="margin">Iob 17. 6. 8.</note>
      <hi>righteous shalbe astonied at this,</hi> as if they did imagine, God had turned his backe, and respected not his children, that hee would not thinke on worldly things, or passe how men liued, but he concludeth, <hi>the righteous will hold their way,</hi> and consider that God in his wisdome doth punish both the good and the bad, and in very deed there could bee no shew of patience, if God did still grant his seruants a patent of exemption and a priuiledge, and alwaies suspend the effects from their causes (for if they haue not open, yet at lest they haue secret sinnes) and stay the streames of waters, that they should neuer couer them: what victory can there bee where there is no fight? what grace can be giuen to ouercome, where
<pb n="23" facs="18"/> there is no temptation of the flesh? and what patience, where there neuer is crosse? besides, how could it bee knowne that God deliuers his children out of troubles, as he doth here out of bondage, if they neuer were in them? how should they know what it were to call vpon God, and to feele his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse towards them? therefore he punisheth both, though hee smiteth the wicked with his fist, the godly with the palme of his hand, though he <note n="f" place="margin">Esa. 30. 28.</note> fanneth those wtih the fanne of vanity to driue them to nothing, <note n="g" place="margin">Mat 3. 12</note> these with his wheat fanne to cleanse them, though his punishments be <note n="h" place="margin">Ex. 11. 1.</note> plagues, <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 4. 11</note> curses, and destructions vpon the one, <note n="k" place="margin">Ps. 89. 32</note> corrections, chastisements and roddes on the other.</p>
   <p>An other vse is this, let no man at any time so fixe his minde vpon his prosperous estate, as to resolute himselfe, it shall neuer change for the sunne-shined bright vpon <hi>Iacob</hi>
      <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 47.</note> when he with his family came into <hi>Egypt,</hi> when his posterity were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and were exceeding mighty, but it waxed dimme when <note n="m" place="margin">Ex. 1. 7. 8. 9.</note> a King arose that knew not <hi>Ioseph:</hi> the sea at full tide ebbed, the calme continued not long without a storme, and all the sailes hoised gaue vantage to a tempest, therefore the heathen painted fortune with feete and wings because shee comes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and goes flying. <hi>Iob</hi> said <note n="n" place="margin">Iob. 29. 18.</note>

   </p>
   <p>Lastly, because afflictions will make their way vpon vs, and campe about our tabernacle; it is a good course to make them present in conceit, before God sends them in euent: In resolued minds it taketh away the smart of euils to attend their comming, <q>Nam leuius ledit quicquid prauidimus ante.</q> foreseene mischeiefes hurt not so much, as they which come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for.</p>
   <p>One cause why troubles are so combersome and grieuous, is because they happen to vnwilling minds, and therefore not onely carry the crosse, but <note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 16. 24.</note> take it vp, that is, suffer willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and voluntarily beare what thou canst not auoide: another cause is, that they happen to vnwitting minds, therefore in a calme forest a storme, forecast the worst of all euents, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent them in thought, they will bee halfe digested before they come, speake with crosses (which thou accountest thy enemies) in the gate, meet them, as <note n="z" place="margin">Gē. 19. 6</note>

   <p>But I proceede to the second generall doctrine, which is this.</p>
   <p>
      <note n="b" place="margin">Ps. 4. 1.</note> God setteth his children at liberty when they are in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, as here hee bringeth <hi>Israell</hi> out of the house of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
   <p>As he deliuereth from euils by preuention, in euils by susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, so out of euils by giuing issue, when hauing punished, he giues a <hi>Quietus est.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The Sun shadowed with clouds within a while shineth out bright.</p>
   <pb n="25" facs="19"/>
   <p>
      <note n="c" place="margin">Ps. 107. 28.</note> The mariners which abide the stormes of the sea, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while brought to their desired hauen: <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 8, 25</note> Christ did awake when the ship was like to be couered with waues, and <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 14. 31.</note> tooke <hi>Peter</hi> by the hand when hee was almost vnder water: <note n="f" place="margin">Ex. 3. 2.</note> The Bush burned, but it was not consumed: God eclipseth the good to shew that their light was but borrowed, but their light shall returne, whereas the candle of the wicked shalbe put out: The Whale <note n="g" place="margin">Ion. 1. 17:</note> which swallowed vp <hi>Ionas</hi> in the deepe sea, <note n="h" place="margin">Ion. 2. 10</note> cast him out vpon the drie land: If a sheepe run from his fellowes, the shepheard sets his dogge after it, not to kill it, but bring it in againe, God deales with vs as a shepeheard with his sheepe, when we goe astray, pouerty, sicknesse, dearth, imprisonment, bondage, are his dogs which hee sendeth to bring vs againe to the sheepefolde, which done he cals in his dogs againe: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <note n="i" place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 10.</note> he hath deliuered, doth deliuer, and will deliuer out of dangers, speaking of the time past, present and to come to assure vs that God who did giue doth giue, and will giue an entrance, did giue, doth giue, and will giue an issue, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring an issue while the crosse prepareth vs.</p>

   <p>If any obiect and say, experience shewes the contrary, for we see many children of God can no sooner breath from one crosse, but they feele an other, &amp; as though one of their troubles hatched another, a <hi>plurality</hi> and <hi>tot quot,</hi> like waues fall one on an others necke, neither is there an end of their euils before God put an end to their liues.</p>
   <p>The answer is this: the disposition of some children is such, that they are neuer well, but when they are vnder the rodde, whereas if others of a little better nature should but see it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, they would be quite out of heart: wouldest thou haue thy father take away the rodde, and thou hast still a curst heart? wouldest thou haue the iudge cease from holding thee on the racke, and thou wilt not yet confesse thy faults? thou art full of corruption, and happely canst not bee well purged with a single clister, wilt thou blame the Phisition if continuing his medecine hee giue thee a stronger purgation? Thy fault is not
<pb n="26" facs="20"/> single, and wilt thou blame God if hee double or treble his stripes? he is not as a waspe, which hauing once stunge, stings no more, he stingeth yet more, But <note n="m" place="margin">Ps. 78. 32</note> when <hi>Israell</hi> sinneth yet more, hee stingeth yet more: besides, if God smite the hard heart againe and againe many drops of remorse may be wrong from it, <note n="n" place="margin">Nū. 20. 11</note> as the waters gushed out, when <hi>Moses</hi> smote the rocke twice, which came not forth, when he did but hold his rodde ouer it, know therefore that Gods promises of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from troubles, and so all temporall blessings are <hi>hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,</hi> if they stand with his glory &amp; our good, these two are as the hinges of a door to turn forward or backward the promise.</p>
   <p>The vse of this is in all our afflictions, to waite patiently vpon the Lord, and hope in him, to say with the sweet singer of <hi>Israell,</hi>

   <p>If we may haue a ioyfull haruest, we are content with a wet spring, content to sow in teares, so wee may reape in ioy: therefore take vp the crosse, and though God adde still to the sardle, stand vp still, bee like the palme-tree <hi>inclinata resurgit,</hi> presse it downe with weight, yet mounting vp, in time it drawes it on high, be like the Bullrush, <hi>flectitur non frangitur vndis,</hi> the waues may bow, but not breake it, in misery shew foorth the fruit of patience, as spice sends foorth it sauour when it is beaten, and Camamile it sent when it is troden on, as the Rose yeelds sweete water when it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled,

   <p>Three things Christ commended in the <hi>Samaritans;</hi> First, their readinesse to beleeue: <hi>Iohn</hi> disciples were hard of beliefe, and therefore he teacheth them both by words, <note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 11. 3</note>
      <hi>Goe tell Iohn what yee haue heard,</hi> and by works, tell him what <hi>you haue seene:</hi> but he knew the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> would beleeue him on his bare word <note n="s" place="margin">Ioh. 4. 26</note> therefore he doth but tell her what he was, and that therefore she did aske him, and many other of rhe <hi>Samaritans</hi> not abiding to haue their minds suspended in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, but hating, doubting where they should be resolute beleued in him, many vpon the report of the woman, many moe because of his owne word.</p>
   <p>The second thing commended in them is their piety &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, for wheras <note n="t" place="margin">Luc. 10. 31.</note> the priest and Leuits passing by the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man, did but gaze on him, <hi>Behold,</hi> but not consider, <note n="u" place="margin">Lam. 1. 12.</note> both which the holy Ghost aduised, the <hi>Samaritan</hi> looked vpon him, with the eye of the body, and looked into him with the eye of the minde, and as though he had as much grieued to see his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, as if himselfe had felt some part of the misery, he is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent seruant vnto him.</p>
   <p>The third thing is, the acknowledging of a benefit, for when the rest went away speeders not thankers, <note n="x" place="margin">Ln. 17. 15</note> the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
      <pb n="28" facs="21"/> when hee saw he was cleansed turned backe, and with a loud voice praised God, as there was in God the course and discent of his grace, so was there in him the recourse &amp; tide of thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, God shewed his benefit to him by donation in clensing him, the <hi>Samaritan</hi> by declaration in praising him, Gods was a reall the <hi>Samaritans</hi> a verball shewing both patent, Gods was a voluntary kindnes to him, his a necessary duty to God, &amp; therefore he will not hide his deliuerance in the earth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale a blessing in his bosome, he will not take without giuing, but his praysing God with a loud voice is a grace for grace, great thankes for a great cure, and a new song for a new salue, and this was the least recompence he did owe, &amp; the greatest he could pay, and a sacrifice that pleased God better then a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, which hath hornes and hoofes to powre riuers of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses out of his lips for a sea of Gods blessings vpon him, which clensed him from his leprofie, as well as the waters of <hi>Israell</hi> did <hi>Naaman,</hi> when he had washed in <hi>Iorden.</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="22"/> earth, and in very deede we deale with all our preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They are so many as <hi>Salomon</hi> did with the brasse of the <hi>Temple,</hi>
      <note n="t" place="margin">2 King. 7. 47.</note> it was so much, he weighed it not, but if <hi>Moses</hi> will haue the <note n="u" place="margin">Ex. 12. 42.</note> Israelites, keepe the night holy in which they were brought out of Aegipt, and bids them <note n="x" place="margin">Ex. 13. 3.</note> remember that day in which they came out of the house of bondage, then remember and keepe holy the day of this deliuerance and say. <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made we will reioyce and be glad in it:</hi> If you be silent, rowse vp one another with the fower lepers, which being deliuered from death, when they were in the middest of it, <note n="y" place="margin">2.

   <p>Come to the deliuerance of the soule from the tyranny of Satan, the thraldome of finne, and the very gulfe of hell, for the diuell is a <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the world is an <hi>Aegypt,</hi> subiection to Satan, is a bondage: but <hi>Christ</hi> is our <hi>Moses,</hi> who hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered sinne, death, and hell, hath wrought our deliuerance: <note n="z" place="margin">1. Sam. 17 34.</note> when <hi>Dauid</hi> the youngest sonne of <hi>Iesse</hi> kept sheepe, there came a <hi>Lyou</hi> and a <hi>Beare,</hi> and tooke a sheepe out of the flocke, but he went out after them, slue them both, and tooke away the sheepe though they rose against him: our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> not the youngest, but <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note> first begotten of his brethren is the true shepheard, who watcheth ouer his flocke <note n="b" place="margin">Luc 2. 8.</note> like the shepheard of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> there came a Loyn <note n="c" place="margin">1.

      </gap>e ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants vnto sinne, getting the maistry, breake the yoake of iniquitie from our necke, we breake it bandes a sunder and cast away it cordes from vs, we withdraw our mindes from the
<pb n="32" facs="23"/> yoke and bondage of those naturall perturbations, that are in vs, God hath set our feete at large, and hauing broken the bounds of our yoke made vs goe vpright, sauing, hauing been long vsed to fetters, wee halt a little after they are taken from vs: and though wee beare about in our bodies the remnants of sinne, yet sinne doth not <hi>domineire,</hi> it is not so insolent against the spirit as it was, nor keepes it vnder with so strong a hand,<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 16. 5. 6.</note> nor with the seruant <hi>Hagar</hi> any longer set it foote in the necke of her-mistresse, but is beaten out of doores, when shee begins to ouer-rule; <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 8. 9.</note> wee are Centurions ouer our affections, and in all the regenerate, that is true, <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 25. 23.</note>
      <hi>the elder shall serue the younger;</hi> for the flesh is subiect to grace though it pricketh, it is not vnto death, it doth not grow cankerous, it is not like the stinging of an Aspe, which, let Art or Nature diuise what plaisters it can to helpe it, is incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, for Christ hauing blunted the sting, it cannot enter into the inward parts of the soule to destroy it.</p>
   <p>
      <note n="i" place="margin">1 Sam. 18 6.</note> If the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when <hi>Dauid</hi> returned from the warre and the slaughter of the <hi>Philistine,</hi> came out singing and dancing in token of ioy, and thankesgiuing for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; then let all true Christians, what little reckoning soeuer they haue heretofore made of freedome from spirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, from their heart tell forth their deliuerance, and say with <hi>Paul,</hi>
      <note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 15 57.</note>
      <hi>thankes bee to God, which hath giuen vs victory, through Iesus Chist our Lord;</hi> and no sooner mention with <hi>Paul</hi> their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance from this present euill world and corrupt life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ, but presently breaking out into the praise of God, say with him: <note n="l" place="margin">Gal. 1. 4. 5</note>
      <hi>to him bee glory for euer and euer, Amen.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Lastly, one vse more that God will haue the <hi>Israelites</hi> make of their deliuerance is this, to learne thereby to serue him, and be stirred vp to the obedience of his Law: when <hi>Ioshua</hi> had distilled this and other blessings of God vpon his people, the <hi>Quintessence</hi> that he wringeth out is this; <note n="m" place="margin">Ios. 24. 14. ver. 17. 18.</note>
      <hi>Feare the Lord and serue him,</hi> and in consideration of this freedome they giue their honest words to serue the Lord, and keeping touch are men of their words all the daies of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and all the daies of the Elders that ouerliued <hi>Ioshua.</hi> The note is this.</p>
   <p>The more God doth free vs from misery, the more wee
<pb n="33" facs="23"/> should submit our selues to his will: but it fareth with vs, as with the snake, who being frozen lyeth quiet and still, but waxing warme stirreth and stingeth: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> so long as hee is vnder the crosse, will not haue <hi>Israell</hi> vnder his rodde, but promiseth their departure, but farewell paine, farewell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; deliuerance makes him forget, what punishment promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. <note n="n" place="margin">2 King. 8 8.</note>
      <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of <hi>Aram,</hi> in his sicknesse commanded <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha</hi> the Prophet to be honoured, <note n="o" place="margin">2 King. 6. 13.</note> whom in his health he would haue killed, what was the cause that <note n="p" place="margin">Ier. 48. 11</note>
      <hi>Moab</hi> was setled on the lees of their sinnes, but this; they liued at rest, and were not powred like other nations from vessell to vessell?</p>
   <p>The Moone the fuller it is, the further it is remoued from the Sun. The tree is neuer so much subiect to hurtfull winds, as when it blossometh, <hi>Segetem nimia sternit vbertas, Rami onere pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muntur:</hi> too much rancknes makes corne lye downe, boughes are broken with their owne burden. The horse too well cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed doth often cast his rider; <note n="q" place="margin">Hos. 13. 6</note> as in their pastures; so was <hi>Israell</hi> filled, and when they were filled their heart was exalted, and <note n="r" place="margin">Deut. 32. 15.</note> when he waxed fat, he spurned with his heele, when hee was fat and grosse, and laden with fatnesse, hee forsooke God that made him, and regarded not the strong God of his saluation: when <hi>Nebucaduezar</hi>
      <note n="s" place="margin">Deut. 4. 31.</note> had been bound seuen yeers prentise to the crosse, he knew from whom his Kingdome came, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him that liueth for euer: in a word, aduersity can teach vs more of God and our selues in one weeke, then we can learn of prosperity all our life long. Man cannot manage a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous estate, but if he be of great power he forgets God, if he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in pleasure, he forgets himselfe, whereas God would haue our freedome from affliction, to be a hand to lead vs, and a foot to carry vs to the remembrance of him, and obedience to his law, that we might say, now thou hast set vs at liberty, we will run the way of thy commandements, and now thou hast set our feet in a large roome, as it is in <hi>Michas,</hi>
      <note n="t" place="margin">Mic. 4. 5.</note>
      <hi>we will walke in the name of the Lord our God for euer and euer.</hi>

   <p>If <hi>Israell</hi> must, <note n="u" place="margin">Gē. 5. 22.</note> like <hi>Henoh</hi> walke with God, conforme themselues to the obedience of his law, and <note n="x" place="margin">Gē. 6. 22.</note> like <hi>Noah,</hi> doe according to all that he commandeth euen so doe, because hee deliuered them from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ondage, which was grieuous to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, then must wee entertaine obedience, determine to keepe

      </gap>s to the soule, which went ouer our heads, and was like a sore burden, too heauy for vs to beare.</p>
   <p>This, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to <hi>Titus,</hi>
