         <p>I haue vnderstood of your troubles, and doe take comfort in your constancie. Your cause is cleere: your religion that, which the sonne of God hath taught. In former time no other was in England. So much you know by the Histories and Chronicles of the country; so you haue ben told by your parents, who sawe the profession of it, with their owne eies; so your ancestors doe testifie by their wills and graues. Your Churches there, were built for the exercise of it; as you can prooue by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall forme of them, by the crosses and pictures, by the altars made for Masse. Euer since the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the country from Paganisme by Sainct Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine and his fellowes, monkes, it hath beene there, till of late: and S. Augustine brought it from
<pb facs="3"/> Rome, where it had beene common from the time of S. Peeter; and S. Peeter learned it of our Sauiour Iesus Christ.</p>
         <p>Those that are learned, if they will looke into the Ecclesiasticall History, which diuers, and of late the worthy Cardinall Caesar Baronius, haue compiled, may see there (looking vpwards to the Apostles time) this Religion descending thorough all ages, in sacred esteeme euer; the preachers, gods trumpets, proclaiming it; the generall councells ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king roome; the martyrs testifying the truth of it with their blood; the light of miracles accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it all the way; and worlds of people waiting on. The Societie of those that professe it, is the Church; and is diffused ouer the World, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique: it is that Church which in your Creede you doe beleeue. This is the spouse of the sonne of God, the woman clad with the sunne, manifest vnto all (that willfully do not shutte their eies) by her anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, cleere successiō, vniuersality: and the twelue-fold Apostolicall glorie doth crowne her heade, or beginning. Shee hath beene opposed by diuers Heresies, but still gotte the victory, bringing foorth Saincts to Iesus Christ in the labour of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
         <p>You know the counsell of the Scripture, Sonne, comming to the seruice of God, prepare thy soule to temptation, and the affirmation of the Apostle is generall, All those that will liue godly shal suffer persecut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>on. The state of the Church heere is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, and those are to be crowned that ouercome. The way to heauen is full of crosses: mockeries, stripes, and the sword, helpe vs on. This way those
<pb facs="3"/> are gone, of whom the world was not worthy: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>ed, needie, in distresse. This way our blessed Sau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>our went, who was heere contemned, scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, crucified. It is the King of Heauens high way. Our heade is gone before, all blood, and so entered into blisse: the Apostles, the Martyrs, the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>s; old Simeon too, and little Agnes, are gone after him with their crosses: and wee are bid, if will liue eternally, to take vp each of vs one, and followe.</p>
         <p>To take the spoile of your goods with ioy is to enbrace and kisse your crosse. There is no deliberation when I must leaue gold or god: no comparison betwixt a diamond in a gold ring, and the deitie in eternitie. O my deare frinds! you haue each of you a Iewell within your selues, richer then all the eie can see without, fairer then the sunne it self, and farre aboue all the disposition of the stars. The vsurers Idol, gold, waxeth pale, if you compare it, to the burning sparkles of the chrysolite. In your Iewell you may see heauen and earth, in the compasse of the vnderstanding. It hath engrauen in it the image of allmighty God; and is, for nature next an angell, by grace companion with him; as being to beare a part in the heauenly quire, and there without astonishment to sing allelluia with those thousand thousand glorious queristers, if the fault be not yours.</p>
         <p>The Soule, hauing free will, had once lost it self; you may, by the meanes taken to recouer it, know the worth. The sonne of God, came from heauen downe to looke it, and redeemed it with that which is better then the world, his life.
<pb facs="4"/> Those infinite wrongs which he suffered from men of all sorts; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>hose innumerable stripes which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued from the soldiers, whose crueltie made him all a wound, the bitter passion of the crosse, which no words are able to expresse, was all for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, for the soule. If you loose it now againe, you wrong his loue, you depriue him of his right, you moue his father (whose angry lookes are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire) to reueng. It is horrible to fall into the hands of the liuing God. The pillars of heauen do tremble and dreade at his beck. He hath mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured the water with his fiste, and pondered the heauens with a spanne. He looketh on the earth, and maketh it to trēble; toucheth the mountaines, and they smoke. If you keepe it well, he will make it a heauen, wherein he, with the father, and the holy Ghost, will dwell, foreuer. And your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies he wil invest with ornaments of glory ād im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortallity, and place each of you in a throne with himself in the court of heauen, where all are kings. You shall dwell in the celestiall Ierusalem, whose streete is all of pure gold, and walls, pretious stone; where God is the Temple, and the light.</p>
         <p>These things God hath promised vnto those who serue him, wherefore aboue all, haue a care of your religion. Your soule is your Iewel, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the Iewel of your sowle. Keepe these well, and you sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
