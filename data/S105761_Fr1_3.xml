what is there which is not abused

   <p>And albe I cal them, A second and
third blast▪ &amp;c. yet do I not so, as
though there were no moe blastes, or
dehortations frō them, or inuectiues
against them beside. For in al ages
the most excellent men for learning
haue condemned them by the force of
eloquence, and power of Gods worde
(as I am to proue vpon anie good
occasion offered). But so do I tear<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>
      <pb facs="3"/>
them in respect of the time present

yea and openlie do speake against
plaies and Theaters.</p>
   <p>The former of these two was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Latine tong by that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend
man <hi>Saluianus</hi>
      <note n="h" place="margin">Saluianus <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

by <hi>Gennadius</hi>
      <note n="i" place="margin">Gennadius de illustribus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note>; and that
1100▪ yeeres sithence. VVherebie
thou maist gather, first, that it is a
most odious, &amp; intolerable thing in
a Christian Common-weale, which
so learned a Byshop would stand to
confute; &amp; secondlie, that to dehort
from plaies is no newe thing, being
condemned so long ago.</p>
   <p>The Lord of his infinite mercie
<pb facs="4"/>
grant, that his blast maie do more
good with Englishmen, than it did
with the Romans, to which he soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the same. Otherwise I know right
wel, that must needs betide vs which
happened vnto them. For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
his saiengs, and the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of such like good men. Therfore
first came the foraine enimies, the
<hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandales</hi> who ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
them, and oppressed them with
most grieuous bondage; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
they fel into the handes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
who caried them headlong into
al impuritie of life, &amp; abomination,
vnder which curse of God they as yet
continue. So we, assuredlie, vnles
we listen vnto the dehortations of
these good men, and shun plaies, with
such like pompes of Satan, the which
once we, when it was, before God &amp;
his congregation, renounced, shal fal
into some one intolerable plague of
<pb facs="4"/>
God or other, into the handes if not
of foraine enimies, which I feare; yet
of our spiritual aduersarie, the Pope
or Diuel, which I am sure of.</p>
   <p>Touching the Autor of the latter
blast, thou maist coniecture who he
was, but I maie not name him at
this time for my promise sake: yet this
do I saie of him, that he hath bine, to
vse his verie wordes, <hi>A great affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of that vaine Art of plaie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
&amp;c.</hi> Yea, which I ad, as excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
an Autor of those vanities, as
who was best. But the Lord of his
goodnes hath called him home; so
that he did not so much delight in
plaies in times past, but he doth as
much detest them now, and is harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
sorie that euer he was such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
to set vice afloate: as more
at large in his discourse, thou maist
perceaue. VVhereby first, note with
me, the goodnes of our God toward
<pb facs="5"/>
vs, who seeing that we wil not shun
plaies for anie dehortations of his
godlie Preachers, who daie by daie
in al places of greatest resort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the vengeance of GOD to
them, be they hie or lowe, that fauor
plaies, Theaters, or plaiers, stirreth
vp the verie Autors themselues to
inueigh against them, that we maie
be ashamed any waie to allowe that,
which the verie Autors do vtterlie
condemne. Secondlie praise God, I
beseech you, for bringing this Autor,
and Maister <hi>Gosson,</hi> who made the
Schoole of abuse out of Babylon. And
thirdlie praie vnto him, that al <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of plaies maie folowe their <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: then sure I am, that both <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
rude multitude, if not for feare of
Gods displeasure, yet because they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
heare nothing but what is stale <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
leaue haunting of stinking <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
and also plaiers themselues <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="5"/>
their vnlawful, vngodlie, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
exercise, for lacke either of
Autors, or of auditors.</p>
   <p>Loth was the Autor, I must needs
confesse, to haue his worke published,
not because he would not haue plaies
openlie reproued, which from his hart
he wisheth were most straightlie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
but through a too too base
conceipt of his owne worke, thinking
that some grounded Diuine were
more fit to dehort from so prophane
an exercise, than he, whose profession
(if so I maie saie) is otherwise. But
hearing partlie by me, and partlie by
others, what a ioie to the children of
God, and griefe to the seruants of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
would be to heare, that he, who
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> so famous an Autor, was now
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> a religious dehorter from
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>; yea, thinking how the one
sort would with more Zeale auoide
them, &amp; the other with more shame
<pb facs="6"/>
appeare on stage, when they should
vnderstand that al the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that their exercise is neither
warranted by Gods worde, nor liked
of Christians, but disalowed vtterly
by Scripture, by reason, by Doctors,
by Byshops, by their verie Autors
themselues, yea and by al other good
men, as the enimie to godlines, and
the corruption of the wel disposed,
and so consequentlie a special engine
both to subuert al Religion, and to
ouerthrowe the good state of that
Common-weale where it is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
he altered his minde, and
gaue me his booke, wishing me to do
therewithal as I thought best for the
glorie of God, and thy commoditie.</p>
   <p>VVhich I haue now, together with
the inuectiue of that reuerend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Saluianus,</hi> published, that one
of them might showe the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Theaters in the time present,
<pb facs="6"/>
and the other how odious they haue
seemed to the godlie in time past,
and both allure thee vtterlie to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
them, if thou be a Magistrate of
power, and to auoide them more
than anie pestilence, be thou
whosoeuer. VVhich
God grant.</p>
