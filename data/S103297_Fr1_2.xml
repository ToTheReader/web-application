Neither herein, to some-what praise-worthie, is prayse vvanting. By William Warner</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T had (Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull) no sooner entred my thought to handle some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, at the first, chiefly for mine own exercise, but that I found my selfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto (vn-worthie though a Wrighters creadit) lesse suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for forme, then preuented of matter: for hardly discourse we that argument, whereof something before, to the like effect is not extant. As for the common text, Loue, I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed the same, especially by one man, so exquisitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notamized, that to others trauailing in the like, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft the flesh, muscles, veines, sinewes, blood, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, onely remaine the bones for their exercise: and to worke on so hard a subiect, were (thinke I) to be as vaine
<pb facs="90"/>
as the Alchimist, who in seeking to perfit wonders for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, doth little else then worke himselfe a Begger, with cunning.</p>
   <p>In suspence therefore of such my purpose, I hapned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to place, where at one time to visite a sicke Gentleman, were assembled a Deuine, a Courtier, a Physition, a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, a Ciuilian, and a Countrie-man: euery of which bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying them selues about the sicke, had left in an out-ward Chamber somthing or other of their ordynarie Attire: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non entred the seuenth man a merrie conceyted Youth, who finding in one place such variety of Apparell, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally one after an other attyring him there withall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himselfe so formally, from the Pulpit to the Plough, from <hi>Paule</hi> his Epistles, to <hi>Ouid</hi> his <hi>de arte amandi, Galen</hi> his <hi>de sanitate tuenda, Littleton</hi> his Tenures, <hi>Justinean</hi> his <hi>Pandectes,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> his <hi>Bugloges,</hi> that with no small de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to those present, he not only seemed the same in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance whom de did counterfect in action, but by those his merrimentes, did also minister to the weake gentleman such occasion of extraordinarie motion, and vio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ent laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that by the breaking of an Impostume he shortly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered.</p>
   <p>I then obseruing how these diuerse actions, thus deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by one Actor, wrought, because of varietie, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectors a cause of mirth, and to the diseased a cure of his maladie, yet both comming by chaunce, emboldned my selfe in the like manner, though differing in the like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to huddle vp (rudely I feare) my following Medlie.</p>
   <p>The Patronage wherof most humbly I offer vnto your good Worship, with the same hope, which somtimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>Rome</hi> beyond hope to the poore Cobler, whose Crowe, not for <hi>Aue Caesar</hi> which to pronounce she was purposely taught, but for <hi>opera &amp; impensa periit,</hi> which came aptly and vnlooked for, was therefore accepted of <hi>Caesar.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But if nothing herein shall happen either profitable by
<pb facs="90"/>
chance as it did to the sicke, or pleasant by chance as it did to <hi>Caesar,</hi> it will then lesse boote me to say my labour is lost with the Crow, then repent me of rashnesse as it once did an Ape, who somuch presumed of his furde iacket, that needes he would imitate the Beare to dispoyle the Bees of their honie: when, silie Ape (an adiect improper to an Ape, if not inuironed of Bees) no sooner had he touched the Hiue to haue tasted the honnie, but that the Bees were as nimble where they founde bare, as was Iacke at his bā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet: putting him, to late, in remembraunce, that behinde he lay open to sightes, and naked to stinges.</p>
   <p>Yet (which best is) by so much the lesse feare I a rough Ayer, by how much the more I saile vnder a calme Lee, and he that intermedleth not in <hi>Tiresias</hi> his doome, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther awaketh <hi>Juno</hi> to him, neither needeth hee sleepe to <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Onely, if your Worship impute not this a presumption, that I hope after a good sentence, where I should feare a graue Censure, such tolleration may adde fresh Reedes to his Pipe, and he pipe otherwise to your prayse, that with no lesse affection then dutie, wisheth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto your Worship all happinesse, not preiudiciall to true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</p>
