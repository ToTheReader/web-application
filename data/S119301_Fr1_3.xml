   <head>THE PREFACE
TO THE CHRISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Reader, containing a large and
plaine direction to all the simpler sort,
how to vse this aright; and an earnest
exhortation to all sorts to giue
themselues instantly to wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and prayer.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath bin wished (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and louing Reader)
that as I haue gone brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thorow the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
and Articles of
the faith, to set downe the true watch;
so I would take some paines in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to go thorow the Lords Prayer, to
set downe the rule and summe of prayer,
for the further perfecting and our better
<pb facs="6"/>
performing the same watch. Whereupon
notwithstanding my great inabilitie, in
respect of many of my brethren, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the Lords former mercie, who
shewes his power in weakenes; and that
by this motion of diuers, he seemes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
my poore labour in this also, I haue
attempted likewise to make triall herein:
the better to inable the simpler sort, and
to stir vp all sorts to this holy dutie of
prayer; that wee may obtaine strength
from the Lord to keepe his watch more
faithfully, with innumerable other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
procured by the same. And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
waying well into what dangerous
times we are fallen; wherein the greatest
part (as it is much to be feared) in such
a declining to Atheisme, and generally
to extreame coldnes or luke-warmenes,
do seldome or neuer pray priuately; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
perhaps they vse the Lords Prayer
without vnderstanding. And of those
who vse to pray, some although they
<pb facs="6"/>
pray much, yet they do it verie supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously,
to the prouoking of the Lord, and
hurt of their owne soules, insteed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
any true comfort therein; as all
our popish sort doe. Others haue a desire
to pray, but want abilitie or leasure; as all
our young and weak Christians. A third
sort droope in their troubles, temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and feares, &amp; are at their wits end,
as <hi>Iacobs</hi> sons, not knowing what way
to take, and so continue fretting &amp; vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselues, or attempt vnlawfull
meanes for their reliefe and comfort. A
fourth are afraid to vse the Lords Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
as a prayer, because they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the power and meaning of it in
so short a forme. A fifth haue gone forth
with our Sauiour into the garden, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
and beginning to watch &amp; pray,
which yet through our long peace, ease
and prosperitie, are fallen a sleepe. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
sort liue in monstrous sinnes, as in
oppression and vnmercifull dealing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
<pb facs="7"/>
secret vncleannesse and the like,
without repentance; and yet imagine
that they do pray, that their prayers are
accepted, and that they shall be heard in
the day when they crie, deceiuing their
owne soules. A last sort, and those one
only and scarse to befound abide therein
with our Sauiour, in watching, cries and
teares; wrastling and weeping as <hi>Iacob</hi>
for the deadly malice &amp; bloodie threats
of <hi>Esau;</hi> and holding vp their hands
with <hi>Moses</hi> against <hi>Amaleck,</hi> and
also to pacifie the Lords wrath, that it
may not be powred out vpon his people,
for all our grieuous prouocations. To
witnes my loue therefore yet further to
all these, and all other the Lords people, I
haue thought it my dutie, to offer this
weake labour also vnto the Church of
God, commending the successe vnto him
who is only wise, and worketh by what
instruments it pleaseth him, and aboue
all that we are able to conceiue: yet not
<pb facs="7"/>
before I had first communicated it vnto
some, much reuerenced of all, for their
learning and pietie. Now I onely craue
pardon to speake freely, to each of these
sorts particularly.</p>
   <p>And first to you that pray not at all,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
looke but vpon the necessitie of prayer,<note place="margin">Harken you that pray not at all.</note>
and consider well in what state you stand
vntill you both can and vse to pray; that
you are in state of damnation, hauing all
things accursed vnto you, and working
your perdition; and that you but onely
tarrie for the execution of Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and then if God open your eyes to
see your selues and your danger, I shall
not neede to call vpon you: for, I know
you will giue no rest vnto your eyes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
yee both can and do practise this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
nor that you will euer let day passe
hereafter, but reserue some part of it frō
your pleasures and profits, to bestow on
the Lord in praier, at least a morning
and an euening sacrifice.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For you that pray in an vnknowne
tongue, or without vnderstanding,<note place="margin">You that pray man vnknowne tongue.</note> bee
aduised to spend no more labor in vain,
deceiuing your owne soules: but learne
of your Lord and Sauiour to pray according
to that heauenly paterne, wherein
all true wisedome and comfort are to bee
found, and which hee hath prescribed
vnto you to vse, if you be any of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
warranting you, that if you so
aske you shall haue; and then shall you
finde him to answere to your hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and carry you into all his sauing
truth.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And you that haue a desire to pray,
but know not how to performe this dutie
aright;<note place="margin">You that desire to pray.</note> I haue chiefely intended your
good, both to direct you for the things
which are principally to be begged of vs,
cōtained in the Lords praier, the summe
whereof I haue indeuoured to set downe
plainely in these short formes, applying
them to the times; and also to helpe you
<pb facs="8"/>
for the maner of vttering your requests;
ayming at this specially, that by daily
practise and meditation herein, you may
better attaine to the true vnderstānding
of the Lords prayer, and euer haue it in
fresh memorie: which being the true
perfection and paterne of all holy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
doth in the infinite wisedome of God
comprehend whatsoeuer wee can aske.
That so you hauing first gathered by
wise obseruation in the watch, a true ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of your owne speciall sinnes and
wants, together with the maine sins and
wants of the Church and Land, may be
able of your selues both for matter and
words, to make a most holy confession of
sinnes, and powre forth your supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
according to your necessities, with
comfort and assurance. I haue set them
downe in two formes, both containing
the same matter, as they are one set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the other: the one more shortly,
because of our wearinesse in the best
<pb facs="9"/>
things, and chiefely in this dutie of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
(though of all other most necessarie)
the other somewhat more largely, for the
fuller vnderstanding of it; &amp; the heads
of both in the margent, for the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
therof, or conceiuing the like.
Not intending to tie any necessarily euer
to vse one of these, (though it were much
better to vse them or the like, then not
to pray at all, or to pray vnprofi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ablie)
nor to vse the whole euer at large; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
all the things therin comprized,
are to be begged daily for our selues, or
our brethrē; but to vse those most which
chiefely concerne our speciall necessities,
and the necessities of the Church &amp; our
Land; all which may be referred to one
of these sixe petitions; As when we would
pray for the glorie of God, or to kindle
the zeale of it in our hearts, or that hee
would shew his glorie in the preseruation
of our King and Realms, to vse the first.
For the Church of God and perfect vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="9"/>
therein, and against the proude ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
thereof; or to get more assurance
that we are true members of it, to vse the
second petition. The third for cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in doing Gods will or submission to
the same. The fourth for dependance on
God, for the things of this life, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all worldly cares. The fifth for
forgiuenes of sins. The last against dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
or feare of temptation, or any euill
whatsoeuer. I haue laboured to set downe
the heads so plainly in the margent, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
them by figures, that euerie
one that is desirous to learne, hauing but
the seuerall parts of the Lords prayer in
his mind may meditate of them happily
at his worke, or as God giues any leasure;
first marking how many things are
chiefely to bee learned in the Preface;
then in each petition; so in the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and withall labouring to feele the
need that hee hath of them, our miserie
without them, and our happinesse in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying
<pb facs="10"/>
them; stirring vp his heart to a
vehement desire of them: and then at
time of prayer, to trie how hee can pray
of himselfe according to the same order;
vsing in the meane time, the helpe of one
of the prayers set downe, to get fit words;
and withall a daily meditation of his
particular sinnes, (chiefely those follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his nature and course of life, with
his principall wants, dangers, chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and mercies receiued;) which wil
be the speediest teacher to the simplest to
pray with true feeling and power. If you
would yet wish further direction for the
generall confession of sinne, you may vse
the first and second helpes in the watch
of the miseries and hainousnes of sin, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.
2. p. 5. l.</hi> 9. If for an increase in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
the third helpe of the blessings fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
a holy conuersation, <hi>pag..</hi> 11. If
for true comfort and thankesgiuing; you
may vse the helpe of the rules for directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and comfort in our examination,
<pb facs="10"/>
      <hi>pag.</hi> 13. All which with the graces we
haue obtained in the Law, and promises
wee are assured of in the Gospell, must
needes cause the simplest to send forth
most sweete prayers and thankesgiuings
vnto the Lord. And so much for you
that are desirous to pray.</p>
   <p>Now to you that droope and faint
vnder your seuerall troubles and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
not knowing what to doe,<note place="margin">You that faint in your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> the

      <hi>Acquaint your selues</hi> with your

may lift vp your face to God, <hi>make

you:</hi>
      <note place="margin">28.</note> And his light shall shine vpon
your waies. When others are cast
downe you shall be lift vp,<note place="margin">29.</note> and God
will saue the humble person. <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

      <pb facs="11"/>
you, hee will certainly doe it: Proue

the way of righteousnes vntill hee send
you comfort; vsing all holy and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
meanes to helpe herein, to serue his
diuine and fatherly prouidence; but bee
afraid of so much as euer thinking of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
indirect course (as to do but the least
euil to obtaine neuer so great a good) and
much more of rebelling against the Lord
or his anointed, and that authoritie
which he hath set ouer you; lest aboue all
other your miseries, you bring vpon you
the terrors of an accusing conscience,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 2.</note>
and procure vnto your selues most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e and endlesse damnation. And
thus much also for you that faint in your
trials. If you desire further aduice, looke
the watch, <hi>pag.</hi> 127.</p>
   <p>You that are afraid to pray, vsing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
Lords praier as a praier,<note place="margin">You that are afraid to vse the Lords praier.</note> because you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend the meaning of it in so
few words: and for that the multitude
<pb facs="11"/>
abuse it; accept my earnest endeuour to
knit our hearts in one, both by assisting
you, that you may haue the summe of the
chiefe heads euer in fresh memorie, as
before your faces; and that those who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
it without vnderstanding may
learne a more holy vse thereof. If yet you
say, that you cannot so comprehend the
full meaning of it, and all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it, the like you may say (as I
take it) of euery seuerall petition thereof,
and so we should vse none of them in our
prayers at all.</p>
   <p>For you beloued that sometimes were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>

of such inueterate and deadly malice,
with all sorts of grieuous sins, increased
to the vttermost, to prouoke the Lord:
after so many bloodie practises, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
forewarnings giuen so oft, and
gratiously to preuent the fierce wrath of
the Lord; with such sudden and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ouer flewings; some of them in the
middest and highest part of the Land,
where the people were altogether secure,
as not hauing the least thought of any
danger by water; which together with
the former, (principally of the raging
seas) all must needs acknowledge to bee
<pb facs="12"/>
the finger of God. If our sinnes had been
so increased in the daies of popish blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
they had been nothing in respect;
but now in such a glorious light, wherin
all of vs haue been conui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ced so many
waies; and subscribed in our hearts to
the truth of God; and also doe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
still iustifie the good waies of God;
and yet for most part set our selues to
trample all vnder our feete, hating or
scorning all that so walke, how gratious,
dutifull and blamelesse soeuer they bee;
this must needs make our sins vnmeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie
sinfull, and aboue the sins of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
people.</p>
   <p>And you that imagine you pray, and
are accepted of the Lord, and yet liue in
your vnmerciful oppression, or any other
such haynous sin; may it not well be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
of you, as the Lord doth of the
people before the Captiuitie:<note place="margin">Ier. 7. 9. 10.</note> Will you
sweare, lie, dissemble, oppresse, build your
houses with blood, commit adulterie,
<pb facs="13"/>
drinke the blood of soules and all other
euil, and yet crie, the temple of the Lord,
we are the seruants of the Lord, and call
vpon his name? Will the Lord take a
wicked man by the hand? Can the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
call on God in the day of his
aduersitie? No, no, you deceiue your own
soules; vntill you haue made peace with
God by vnfained repentance, and by
<hi>Zacheus</hi> restitution peace with men.
Nay although you cōmit not halfe these
sins,<note place="margin">Ezec. 18. 11.</note> but liue in any one of them, or any
other like, hath not the Lord saide you
shall surely die for it? What good then
can your prayers doe, when the Lord
turnes away his eare (as frō that which<note place="margin">Prou. 28. 9.</note>
is abominable,)<note place="margin">Prou. 1. 24. 25. 26.</note> and will laugh at your
destruction; because you would not first
harken vnto him to turne from your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
waies, while he stretched forth his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
hands vnto you?<note place="margin">You that still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Therefore vnto you (my deere bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of all sorts and degrees) who haue
<pb facs="13"/>
continued with our Sauiour hitherto, in
watching, prayers and teares, and yet at
length begin with <hi>Moses</hi> to faint, with
long holding vp your hands, or are in
danger thereof; I vnfainedly desire of
the Lord, that I may bee as <hi>Aaron</hi> or
<hi>Hur,</hi> to helpe to confirme your weake
hands and wearie knees.<note place="margin">Deut. 20. 1. 2. 3▪</note> Let not your

so much more instant and importunate
as the sins &amp; dangers increase; vrging
him euer with his owne glorie, the pride
of his enemies, and their blasphemies, if
euer they should preuaile: together with
his gratious promises, loue and former
mercies, both to all his owne people in all
ages, and especially towards our selues,

them of crueltie towards their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
would take away that crying sin
of oppression, crying louder for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
then al the sins of the earth besides,
which brought the floud of waters, when
the earth was filled with crueltie; and
<pb facs="14"/>
brought in the fierce Babylonian, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
and spoile the great men in Iudea,
and to make those goodlie houses deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,<note place="margin">Esay 5. 8. 9.</note>
which had formerly been built by
the oppressions and spoiling of the poore:
which makes the poore to sigh being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of their liues,<note place="margin">Psal. 12. 5.</note> whose sighes the Lord

because we would haue no mercie of the

needs bring a fearefull desolation vpon
our sinfull nation, vnlesse it be speedilie

Idolatrous enemies of the Church of
God, and their braggs of their workes of
mercie and pitie; thereby mouing the
people to a discontentednes, &amp; to dislike
<pb facs="15"/>

   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that all would learne of our
Sauiour to pray as he hath commanded.<note place="margin">To learne of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiour to pray.</note>
I haue this consident hope, that the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest

learne to pray in feeling with much
comfort: &amp; those who want good hearts,
would by this practise obtaine them.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, that wee would all ioyne to
pray according to the two first petitions,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for the Church of God, our Prince and
Realmes, with true vnitie therein,<note place="margin">To pray according to the two first petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</note> and
against all the enemies of them; for then
vndoubtedly we should neither neede to
feare the practises of the Popes Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb facs="15"/>
nor diuels,<note place="margin">The fruit hereof.</note> nor yet all the enemies of
the world; but only stand still with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
and see what the Lord would still
do for vs. Happie shall they be, whom the
Lord singles out vnto this worke, to be if
it were but as one of <hi>Gedeons</hi> three
hundred, for the perpetuall preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church of God and their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
But for the rest, although they

them in peeces; for being deliuered with
Gods s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ruants from the temporal iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the eternall wrath of God doth
certainly remaine for them. Wherefore
giue me leaue to speake a little further<note place="margin">A further pressing the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to prayer.</note>
vnto your soules in this important busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
if I may awake but some of you.</p>
   <p>You that spend your liues in pleasures,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
will you not be perswaded to spend some<note place="margin">To them that liue in pleasures.</note>
houres in this heauēly work, to talke with
God for the sauing your owne soules and
the people of the Lord? Oh that you knew
the vnspeakable sweetenesse that heerein
<pb facs="16"/>
you should find; whereas in your vaine
pleasures what can you looke for, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
bitternes in the end? will not
all these increase the wrath against vs?
whereas the changing them into pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
with fasting and teares, would be as
the sacrifice of <hi>Noah,</hi> wherein the Lord
would certainly smell a sauor of rest; and
as the repentance of Niniuie, that hee
that had compassion on the poore igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
heathen, would much more cause
his face to shine still more bright, vpon
vs, whom he hath vouchsafed so long
the profession of his name. Know it for
certaine, as the Lord hath giuen any of
you mo of his outward blessings, &amp; with
them more time &amp; meanes to serue him,
so hee lookes for so much more time at
your hands to be spent in instant prayer,
then of any other of the earth, and so
must your account be. Do not the popish
sort that liue in your bosoms obserue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
your extreame irreligiousnes, how
<pb facs="16"/>
you neuer vse to pray priuately, or with
any deuotion? and are they not hereby
hardened to like far better of their owne
blind superstition; wherein they spend so
much time in praier? How will you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
your God for the blood of so many
soules as hereby perish? If you could bee
perswaded (which you will one day feele,
either in this life, or when it is vtterlie
too late) that these &amp; all other your sins,
wherein now is your felicitie, will bee as
so many swords to peirce your poore
soules, and so many diuels to torment you
eternally; and your repentance &amp; death
altogether vncertaine: you durst not let
one minute passe, but would fall into bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mourning for all your sinnes, and for
your time so ill spent, and bee warned by
our Sauiour to begin to watch and pray,
that you might escape all these miseries,
that will certainly come vpon you.</p>
   <p>You also that haue filled your houses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
with the spoiles of the poore, &amp; the earth
<pb facs="17"/>
with their cries, the crie of your sinnes is
gone vp into the heauens, that the Lord
threatneth to be auenged forthwith. Let
the counsell of <hi>Daniel</hi> to <hi>Nabuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezar</hi>
be acceptable vnto you,<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 24.</note> if you will
escape the decree that is comming forth
against you. Breake off your sins by righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,
and your iniquities by mercie
towards the poore.<note place="margin">Esay 1. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20.</note> Repent and make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
while you may▪ Cease to do euil,
learne to doe well, seeke iudgement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
the oppressed, iudge the fatherlesse
and defend the widow, as the Lord bids
you by his Prophet. Then you may pray,
and your praiers shall be heard: though
your sins were as crimson (that is, most
bloodie sins) yet they shall be made white
as snow. If yee consent and obey, yee shall
eate the good things of the Land: but if
yee refuse and be rebellious, ye shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
with the sword; for the mouth of
the Lord hath spoken it. Your oppressiōs
which haue pressed downe the poore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="17"/>
the ground, will one day crush you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the bottome of hell, and will be a loade
heauier then the whole earth vpon you:
that you would giue all the world, if you
had it, to be disburdened of them; and
at your death the iudgement threatned
vnto <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> shall surely light vpon
you,<note place="margin">Ierem. 22. 18. 19.</note> that none shall lament or mourne
for you, to say, ah Lord, ah his glorie; but
all shall reioyce that the earth is eased of
you; and your remembrance shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
most vile and loathsome to all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie,
as the memorie of other oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
doth before.</p>
   <p>And for you that would neuer spare
so much as one houre from your worldly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
businesses to priuate praier,<note place="margin">To the worldling.</note> when God
opens your eyes to discerne the true profit
hereof, aboue the other, &amp; that hitherto
you haue been meerely of the world, and
vtterly without God; howsoeuer you look
to your worldly businesse, you will looke
to this businesse of the Lord, and set your
<pb facs="18"/>
selues times of praier, which the gaining
of the world cannot make you to forget.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And in a word, so many of you as can
talke with men of any earthly matter,<note place="margin">To all that cānot pray of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, nor regard to learne.</note>
and make any request for this present
life, for whatsoeuer you need; and yet
could neuer vtter so much as one speech,
no not in secret to your Father in heauē,
nor make any one supplication for any
heauenly thing with feeling; how can
you thinke that euer you were touched
with Zeale of Gods glorie or his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?
or how can you imagine that you
can be the children of the heauenlie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or haue any interest in the Lord
and his kingdome; or be any thing but
meere worldlings, sauoring onely the
world, and it alone your portion, hauing
a world of miseries and torment remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for you for euer? Learne therefore
to praie aboue all; you will finde this a
treasure ten thousand times better then
all the wealth &amp; pleasures of the world.
<pb facs="18"/>
For what you would haue, this will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie
procure you, as far as shall be
good; and whereas all the honors, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
riches and friends in the world,
can neuer giue you any true contentmēt,
nor adde one minute vnto your life; this
only will fill your hearts in heauenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation,
with abundant ioy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and make you liue and raigne with
Christ for euer in the heauens.</p>
   <p>Now so many as acknowledge that
thus indeede you ought both to watch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
and pray,<note place="margin">To all that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the truth and necessitie hereof.</note> and yet but only giue these the
reading, without care to learne the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of them, or happily hauing some
good motions or purposes, to put them
forthwith in practise, or it may be, haue
begun well, yet through your pleasures
or worldly businesse, or at least a carnall
sloth and securitie leaue them off, and
returne to your old courses, bee warned
from the Lord; for this will certainly be
one further witnesse and conuiction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="19"/>
you, then euer formerly you recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and much better it had bin for you,
that you had neuer seene this way of life,
thus plainly and easily set before you, and
how you may either helpe to preserue the
whole, or at least escape your selues from
the euils to come; then after you haue
knowne it, and subscribed in your hearts
to the truth and necessitie of it, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilie
put your hands to the plow, to looke
backe againe. Remember <hi>Lots</hi> wife; if
you be out of Sodome hie for your liues,
vntill you be safe in Zoar; and being safe
your selues, learne to be as importunate
with the Angell of the Couenant, when
you but thinke of the sins of the Land, as
faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> was: comforting
and incouraging your selues in this, that
you are not alone but many with you,
and the Lord hath yet his ten righteous
left, in all quarters some, that mourne
and crie for all the abominations. If in
this attempt I haue failed of that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
<pb facs="19"/>
I humblie craue pardon; and also
that my good will may be accepted, in
this endeuour intended chiefely to helpe
the simple. Vouchsafe me your better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and I shall willinglie follow it.
My desire is to labour herein also to
bring this together with the watch to
more perfection, if I shall find it accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and that it may bring the least good
to Gods Church; in which I desire not
to liue one day longer, then I may bee
some way profitable. I haue so oft made
reference to the watch as to a maine
ground of prayer, and for that this is as
a second part, and an vnseparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
thereof,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 13. 14. 18.</note> (as the Apostle makes
them <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.) and also that I neede <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
not trouble you with oft repetition of the<note place="margin">To them that are not perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of such present ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of praier, but thinke me ouer feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note>

   <p>Cōcerning the present necessitie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
(that I may neither seeme ouer bold,
not yet to fearful of some grieuous iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without cause) I desire of all sorts
<pb facs="20"/>
that you would examine it betweene the
Lord and your owne consciences (to
whom I appeale, and which I know will
witnesse with me, when I shall stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the great tribunall) your conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
I say, not asleep in this deepe security,
but either throughly awaked by the law,
or as they were vpon the instant of the
discouerie of the gunpowder plot; or at
any time before any of our great deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
fullie accomplished in the midst
of our extreame dangers. Remember
but whether your hearts weare not then
as my heart is now; that if God had done
with vs as he then threatned, he had not
been most righteous, and wee iustlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
it. Did not all hearts tremble in
the acknowledgement of the truth of his
Maiesties sacred speech in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
house at that time? And who
would not haue confessed in any of these
dangers, that it had not been full time
for each to haue betaken himselfe to this
<pb facs="20"/>
armour; to haue run to God by instant
supplication, and stood vp in the breach;
and for euery one to haue learned to
watch and pray? And must not our
case since be far more desperate, wee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
receiued thus our third most terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
admonition, together with so many
mercies still heaped vpon vs? Let vs but
thinke what wee haue done since that
time, to secure vs from the finall execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his vengeance: haue we not most
fearefully increased the transgression, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still many degrees backwards, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from the Lord, and suncken deeper
in our rebellion, insteed of turning to
him according to our oft promises, and
his infinite mercy? Besides our impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in sinning; and our eating vp one
another in euery corner and degree, rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
al things to the vttermost farthing,
and all commonly to maintaine pride
and all excesse; countenancing the lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
in euery place, disgracing and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="21"/>
vpon the vpright, that he that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staines
from euil maketh himself a prey:
Let but the shamelesnes of that one sin of
quaffing, condēned by the heathē, in <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerus</hi>
Court in their greatest pomp and
excesse that euer we reade of, and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
in Gods book for that cause, be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
although we cānot imagin that euer
it was practised in halfe so odious a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as it is ordinarilie with vs euerie
where, in scorning the Lord to his face,
and sacrificing to Satan. Our cloakes of
Ciuility wil proue but <hi>Adams</hi> figleaues.
Inquire of your own hearts, whether this
be not the generall verdict of all whom
God hath touched, or who retaine any of
their ancient feeling; yea whether the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
blind may not grope it; that there was
neuer such a declining to all loosenes, opē
prophanenes &amp; euen Atheisme heard or
read of in any age, where the Gospell was
professed, nor that sinne was practised
with so high a hand. And then answere
<pb facs="21"/>
plainly, whether the Lord may not iustly
get himselfe glory of vs, in the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his iustice, and the power of his
wrath against our sins; seeing the riches
of his mercies in sparing and deliuering
vs, haue made vs so far to exceede, as to
deny the tokens of his wrath, and despise
him to the face; scorning and hating no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so much as a holy care to serue him
according to his wil. Or what followes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men (euē the most equal &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful)
after the third admonitiō at most,
but the due execution &amp; final expulsiō?
And whether we haue not iust cause to
feare and seeke to pacifie his wrath? Or
whether hee may not most righteouslie
cause his owne children to crie in feeling
the miseries which haue not cried out in
seeing the abominatiōs, &amp; seeking to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
him: and also whether hee may not
iustly pluck the world frō vs, which hath
so bewitched &amp; plucked vs frō him. And
to conclude, whether it be not much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="22"/>
that we each awake and meet him in
time with intreaty of peace, because he is
so merciful, thē to be awaked of him and
crie day and night (as his people in the
Captiuitie) when it is too late, and he will
shew no mercy vntill his work be accōpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
vpō vs. Thus hauing presumed this
second time, to testifie my heart to al, and
my earnest desire of a heauēly vnion, and
all happines to Gods Church, &amp; this our
nation, I take my leaue; with my instant
praiers that al Gods seruants may haue
their eies open, to see the necessitie of this
work aboue al other, &amp; their harts prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to set thēselues forthwith hereunto,
(which hath made me the longer in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
vnto it.) The whole successe I
leaue to his heauenly Maiestie, whose
this work is, &amp; who hath long called vs
al vnto the practise of it, looking &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
that so few haue come to help,<note place="margin">Esay 6. 3. 5.</note> and
