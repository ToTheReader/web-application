   <head>HENRIE IEAY TO THE Deuont Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing perused (good reader) this litle booke written in Italian by a father of the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Iesus: though he thought to publish it vnder a borrowed name; and translated into English by another of the same Societie: I found it likelie, to proue as fruitful, as accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, to pioussoules, that are desirous to conuerse with almightie God, in mē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal praier; and for theyr help and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort determined to put it forth, with this one aduise vnto them, which I had from one wel experienced in spiritual affayres.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>In the places from which we are here taught to draw matter of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as condicions of persons, words, and actions that occurr in any mistery.
<pb n="4" facs="3"/> They shal perhapes finde such store and varietie, as may to some seeme super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, at the least, if not troublesom. But they must consider, that this booke is not for one man onlie, nor for one sort of vnderstandings, but intendeth the common help of al that practise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfes in this spiritual exercise. It was therefore necessarie, to make such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision for al, as out of it eueryone might fit himself of matter for his own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and take that which he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth most agreable with his own man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceding. As he that cometh to a plentiful feast, eateth not of al that is sett before him, which might cloy his appetite, and hurt his helth, but rather feedeth discretly and soberly on som few dishes which his stomack lyketh, and are wholsom for him. In a good garden are a multitude of simples, yet are not al ingredients for euery mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, the Gardnier notwithstanding
<pb n="5" facs="3"/> had sufficient reason to plant them al, because there is not any one amongst them, of which som one or other may not finde som vse. I wish thee good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to choose out of these places, those that are most behoosul for thy purpose, and let not the plentie left vntoucht for other men, trouble thee. So I leaue thee to make that profit of this worke, which the author wisheth to al that read it: to the greater honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God.</hi>
