                 <title>A synopsis or compendium of the fathers, or of the most famous and ancient doctors of the Church, as also of the schoolmen : Wherein is clearely shewed how much is to be attributed to them, in what severall times they lived, with what caution they are to be read, and whic were their perfections, which their errors. A treatise most necessary, and profitable to young divines, and delightfull to all such whose studies in humanity take from them the leisure, though not the desire of reading the fathers; whose curiosity this briefe surveigh of antiquity will in part satisfie.

   <head>THE
AVTHORS
PREFACE,
VVHICH TOGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Treatise it selfe
was delivered by way of
Lecture.</head>
   <p>MY Courteous Auditors, I
have oftentimes called to
mind the saying of that
most excellent, and grave Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
<pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>Seneca, Magnam esse dementiam
intanta Temporis egestate supervacua
discere:</hi> It is great madnesse, saith
hee, in so great want of time to
learne things superfluous. For that
first Aphorisme of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the
Prince of Physicians, is most true,
<hi>Vita brevis est, Ars longa:</hi> Life is
short, Art long. Though this bee
most true, yet can I not assent unto
them, who thinke it enough for a
Student in Divinity to be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
versed in the sacred Scriptures,
and that hee need learne and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
nothing else; that the immense
Volumes of the Fathers, and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Doctors, as a vast and fadome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Sea are to be avoyded, because
they bring greater doubt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity,
than light and science to
<pb facs="6"/>
the minde; especially if a man will
dwell upon the manifold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
of the late Doctors,
whom we call Schoolemen. These
Assertions (though they may at first
sight appeare faire and goodly) yet
savour too much of Arrogancy.
Farre bee it from any Divine to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
that Nestorian Pride, who,
as the Ecclesiasticall History testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
relying on the volubility of his
owne Tongue, arrogantly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Writings of the most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Interpreters. I confesse, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures are able to render a
man abundantly wise, as saith Saint
<hi>Paul, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. and to instruct him
in all things pertaining to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by the faith which is in Iesus
Christ. I confesse also some men
<pb facs="7"/>
have not the understanding right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to judge of so many Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
of the Ancients; others have
not the leisure to read them, and
not a few want meanes to procure
them. Yet in these a Divine ought
not to bee altogether a stranger.
<hi>Nesoire quid antequam natus sis accide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
idest semper esse puerum,</hi> saith <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
in his Oratory. To be ignorant
altogether of what happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou wert borne, is alwayes
to bee a childe: and the comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration
of Antiquity, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of examples, gives not onely
delight, but authority and credit to
an Oration. It was an ancient and
laudable custome, as witnesseth
<hi>Irenaeus, lib. 3. cap.</hi> 4. that if any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
were disputed, the judgement
<pb facs="7"/>
and consent of the most ancient
Churches wherein the Apostles
were conversant, should bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
into, and fully knowne.</p>
   <p>But here certaine Cautions are
necessary, which being not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Papists, they have erred
many wayes in reading of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and have proved not so much
<hi>Theologi,</hi> as <hi>Patrologi,</hi> and <hi>Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologi:</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The first Caution is, that none
reade the Fathers except they bee
well exercised in the Scriptures,
which neglected, they shall grope
like one blinde in the darke, and
saile in a wide Sea without either
North-Starre or Compasse. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="8"/>
Caution ought to bee, that
though the authority and consent
of the Fathers in the Truth, doe
much confirme and comfort, yet
Faith is onely to bee builded upon
the Apostolicall and Propheticall
Scriptures, as a foundation most
firme. For the Scripture, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Queene and Empresse (as <hi>Luther</hi>
is used to say) ought to have the
soveraigne Command. The third
Caution is, that in reading the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wee doe not imitate those
flatterers of <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ionisius Siculu,</hi> who
licking up the Tyrants spittle, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
it to bee sweeter than Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctar.
To these I may liken such as
without any exception embrace
and magnifie indifferently all the
Writings and Sayings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb facs="8"/>
These are the points about
which at this day we combat the
Iesuites, the stoutest Champions
the Pope hath; and not (as they
labour to perswade the vulgar) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Fathers themselves, or
reverent Antiquity, as if wee did
plainely reiect them, and after the
Athenian manner were delighted
with the novelties of Newes-tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.
For first, wee recall them to
true Antiquity, which is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the ancient of dayes,
and his revelations, that so wee
may refuse and condemne as new
whatsoever Christ hath not taught
us, as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> adviseth us, <hi>lib.</hi>
1. <hi>Officior.</hi> Next wee distinguish
betweene the ages of the Church,
and betweene Father and Father,
<pb facs="9"/>
and demonstrate in one and the
same Father what is authenticall,
what erroneous, irreptitious, and
inserted by the Monkes.</p>
   <p>Moreover, when wee enquire
after the Church, we doe not seeke
the degenerate and adulterate, but
the chast and holy Spouse of Christ:
And why may not wee say the
same of the Roman Church at this
day, that <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Oration for
his house said of the Roman peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>An tu populum Romanum esse pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
qui constat ex iis qui mercede con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducuntur,
qui impelluntur ut vim ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferant
magistrastibus, optant quotidiè
praecipiti furore, caedem, incendia, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinas;
O speciem dignitatis populi Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani,
quam scilicet reges, quam natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="9"/>
ex terrae, quam gentes ultimae perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mescunt:</hi>
Dost thou thinke, saith
hee, that to be the people of Rome
which consisteth of those that are
mercenary; who are ready to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
violence to Magistrates, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
daily with a desperate fury, fire,
rapes, and slaughter: Othe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dignity of the Roman people,
whom Kings, forreigne Nations,
and the most remote inhabitants
of the earth doe feare. Wee doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
much esteeme that Roman
Church whose faith is preached
through the whole world, we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
reverence those Fathers and
Bishops which are not commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to us by the onely authority
and Canonization of Popes, but by
their owne purity of Doctrine, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
<pb facs="10"/>
of life, and constancy in
Martyrdome. But it is well the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
so distrust their owne cause,
that they dare not stand to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
of the sacred Scriptures, nor
of the Fathers themselves, except
they bee mutilated, and altered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their will, and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with many suppositious
bookes. Their Impudency this way
clearely appeareth in their <hi>Index
Expurgatorius</hi> not long since here
published; out of all which wee
may easily collect that they retaine
neither shame, faith, nor consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
nor any thing authenticke ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Scriptures, or Fathers,
but onely what is appropriated to
their superstition, and will-worship
of Images.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="10"/>
Now, most loving Auditors,
because it is much materiall to the
Students in Divinity (though all
have not the meanes and faculty of
reading the Fathers) at least to know
what is to be iudged and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of them in generall, and which
were the most famous Fathers, and
Scholasticall Authors, as also with
what iudgment &amp; choyce they are
to be read, I thinke it wil neither be
a service unacceptable, nor unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
if in the end of these dogge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
and before the Mart now at
hand, I instruct you in the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and contract the whole matter
into, as it were, a Synopsis, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement.</p>
