      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT Christian Reader, dedicating my selfe vnto thy good disposition, by this smal treatise, I giue thee to vnderstand, of the first and old inuention, as also the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, chiefly of Gallies, as also of shippes: by whiche deuice wee generally conceiue all countries to obteine participation of eache others commodities: Sea fishing with the profits and nourishment therof obteyned: as also the territories of diuers countries defended: with diuers &amp; many such others. Wherin of the other part, if I should alledge the opinion of certeine, whiche affirme, that so vnremoueable bounds declareth Gods omnipotent ordināce, that euery country so diuided ought to content themselues to liue, by the gifts of the same God &amp; countrie: and that Gods iustice consenteth not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so great mischiefes, which both first and last shippes and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies not onely by murders and slaughters haue been committed, but also by transporting excessiue vanities, aduauncing this worlds insolencie, would not growe ouerlong &amp; tedious, but also somewhat besides the matter. But to the purpose, thou hast also (gentle Reader) herein to vnderstād, the opinions of diuers Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, which in their owne persons would neuer consent vnto Nauigation, wherin as mee seemeth they haue discouered their owne weaknes, of al men to be noted, but not of all persons to be imbraced. Also the mightie &amp; famous Pirates of old time, to be meruailed how they might atteine vnto so great power &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance: &amp; in the end, vnto so miserable destruction. Also pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uileges somewhat straunge which they vse in Gallies, of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which meane to haunt the same to be noted. Also the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile disposition of the Sea, and perillous properties thereof aptly declared. As also the necessarie prouision for passengers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be vsed. Farewell.</p>
