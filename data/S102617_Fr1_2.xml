Where could DIVINE LOVE be prouided of a fitter Mansion then a heauenly Heart?

What did not he bountifully emploie in the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of God's seruants? what did not he piously spend in the riches and glorie of God's house? what did not he Catholikly, repute as nothing, that he might gaine Christ? and to descend yet further, is not the same <hi>Bountie, Pietie</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and for them, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all, brought downe as it vvere by right line, and translated together vvith his Dominions to the Honorable now <hi>LORD VICE-COVNT MOVNTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVE,</hi> who actually possesseth his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of the happinesse he long promised?
