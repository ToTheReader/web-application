   <head>THE PREFACE OF THE AVTHOR TO HIS FAVORABLE READER: AND TO ALL HIS LOVING FRIENDES IN NORFOLKE, SVFFOLKE, LONDON, NORWICH, CAMBRIDGE, OR ELSEWHERE SOEVER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>OVRTEOVS Reader, or friendes of good affection, whether you shall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to read any of this Treatise for good will vnto the Author, or for other expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter, I do most hartily desire, that laying aside all curiosity, you will read it with the same intention with which it was written, viz: to bewayle sinne; to forsake errour; to seeke pardon; and to giue thankes to Allmighty God for his grace offered or obteyned through our lord IESVS.</p>
   <p n="2">2. And to these intentes, I haue chosen first to exercise my pen in some poyntes of deuotion, before I should be challenged with any
<pb facs="6"/>
disputes of controuersy: neither coulde I finde in my opinion, for my selfe, and for all those former purposes, any fitter Theme then the seauen penitentiall Psalmes, which doo affoarde most plentifull matter whereupon to frame such meditations. For as S. Gregory saith of the Psalter,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Proleg. in</hi> 7. <hi>Psal. Poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi>
      </note> that it is a trianguler musicall instrument of ten stringes, whereupon the Harper striketh in the lower narrow End, from whence it yeildeth his melodious sounde in the vpper parte which is broader: So all Psalmes in generall, and in especiall the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiall Psalmes, doo firste cause our trianguled hartes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and stroken at the roote with sorowe and contri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>iō for sinne against the ten commandementes; and afterwarde to be dilated broader &amp; enlarged vpwarde in the sweet sound of comforte to our selues, and of prayse to Almighty God, for our pardon, &amp; for his mercy: according whervnto, euery one of these seauen Psalmes hath his beginning full of lamentation, but towardes his end it is enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with prayse of consolation.</p>
   <p n="3">3. I desired to write vpon all the 7. Penitentialls, and to publish them all at once: but hauing bene hitherto only able to finish the firste 4. of them, partly for wante of firme health, partly by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of more necessary busynes, and furthermore perceuing the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume would be greater then I supposed, and laste of all because I am now called away to another kinde of treatise: therfore I thought it good in the meane while to publish what I had finished vpon the psalme Miserere: as one desirous first to wash away the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my particuler sinne, before I would come to handle the pure mysteryes of our Catholique doctrine.</p>
   <p n="4">4. And so our worthy Countryman Cardinall Poole vsed to say, that one cause of so much heresy in these latter times was in too bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy disputing about our faith, before we tooke any care to reforme our life: wherfore he wished all them who were ready to read S. Pauls Epistles, to beginne firste to read, &amp; to practise their latter chapters, which are euer morally teaching vertues before they enter into disputes about their former Chapters, which for the most part
<pb facs="6"/>
are doctrinall about matters of knowledge: for it is vnlike they will be freed from peruerse errors, who do continue their liues in obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vices: such men may talke of opinions in religion; but seldome shall you see any fruites of their religion, more then opinion and table-talke.</p>
   <p n="5">5. Some desire to know only because they would be able to talke or discourse: &amp; this is vanity. Some delight in knowing how to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course or talke, because they desire to be knowne: and this is vayne glory. Some labour to knowe much, because knowledge hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighte, not intending therby any other fruite of their labour: and this is curiosity. Only their knowledge sauours of christian piety whose intention is therby to serue God, and to profit men, first sauing their owne soules, and next to helpe others according to their ability.</p>
   <p n="6">6. And surely, as our knowledge wanteth wisdome when we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect others to euerlasting happynes, suffering our selues to be lead vnto eternall misery, for especially in regard of our soules, <hi>ist hoc est sapere, sibi sapere,</hi> this is wisdome, to be wise for our selues; so yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was any thus wise in his knowledge, who firste did not learne humility with his wisdome: For as naturally knowledge doth puffe vp in pride, so spiritually we must endeuour to keep it vnder and in good order by humility. Or indeed it is but humane wisdome, &amp; knowledge of thinges without vs which maketh vs swell in our opinion of knowledge; wheras if we woulde by the light of diuine wisdome view the defectes and faultes of our owne inward bosome and looke vpward with reuerence to the high Majesty of God himselfe, <hi>then</hi> would our wisdome be profitable to our selues as well as to others; and <hi>then</hi> will our knowledge increase our humility.</p>
   <p n="7">7. Wherfore S. Thomas of Aquine speaking of Humility, saith,<note place="margin">2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 161.</note> it is a vertue which maketh a man willing to submitte himselfe vnto God for God, and vnto man for the same God; and that this humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is founded vpon the knowledge of God, and of our selues, viz: of our nothing, and his infinite incomprehensibility; of our basenes
<pb facs="7"/>
and his majesty; of our pouerty and his Riches; of our weakenes &amp; his omnipotency; of our ignorance and his wisdome. And therfore an humble man doth renounce himselfe acknowledging his owne faultes and imperfections, and with reuerent confidence trusteth in our Lordes Goodnes. And thus if we empty our owne vessells of windy pride and putrifyed sinne, doubtles our Lord will fill them as the widowes vessell with his oyle of grace; for if Achab was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned who was but feignedly humbled,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 27. <hi>Luc.</hi> 7.</note> how much shall we haue forgiuenes with S. Mary Magdalen, if with syncere humility we lye weeping and prostrate at our Sauiours feet?</p>
   <p n="8">8. Such must be our humility: and then will our knowledge be practicall as well as speculatiue, and benefiting our selues as much as others; wheras betwene speculation and practise there is as much difference as betwene studying the nature of gold, and possessing the substance of gold. It is true, both are good; yet shoulde they not be separated; no more then our vnderstanding from our will. For practicall knowledge doth mooue and order the <hi>will:</hi> but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation only doth informe the <hi>vnderstanding.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>S. Tho.</hi> 2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 45. <hi>art.</hi> 5.</note> And therfore was Ananias to teach S. Paul by practicall instructions euen after he had seene a great light in the waye; for still he remayned blind in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Ananias practicall experience. For speculatiue knowledge alone is but as the lighte of the moone which shyneth feebly; but this knowledge made practicall is glorious as the sunne, which hath both heate and brightnes; by heate to giue vs motion, &amp; with his brightnes to shew vs light how to walke, and to lead a good christian life: and vnto both these together, we may referre that of Dauid,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 96.</note>
      <hi>Lux orta est iusto, &amp; rectis corde laetitia,</hi> a light is arisen vnto the just, and vnto the righte in harte ioyfullnes; for speculation giueth lighte, &amp; practise causeth joyfullnes, whereof we must make one coniunction, both to be <hi>just</hi> in speculatiue brightnes of lighte, and to be <hi>righte in harte</hi> by practicall heate of ioyfullnes.<note place="margin">
         <hi>In lib. soliloq. cap.</hi> 31.</note>
   </p>
   <p n="9">9. And further more: this practicall knowledge must be exercised in our selues▪ for wante of which practise S. Augustin complayned
<pb facs="7"/>
thus: <hi>I haue wandred, O God, seeking thee without, who wert within.</hi> And so doo all men wander out of themselues, when euery one particulerly doth not consider his owne inwarde estate of soule what and who he is? by whom created? and to what end? for want of which serious considerations not marking our sinnes nor our misery, we seeke not our remedy: but as S. Gregory said, like foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish trauellers passing through a short pleasing meddowe, we doo so much fasten our eyes vpon some fayre seeming flowres, that we fall into some ditch, or take some wrong way leading to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
   <p n="10">10. For as the cause of all the prodigall childes misery came by departing out of his Fathers house (and then out of himselfe) into a farre country; so his remedy beganne, as the gospell saith, <hi>In se au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem reuersus,</hi> when he returned into himselfe, and to the knowledge of his miserable estate, and of his vile courses; wherfore meditating on the End wherto he was like to come by sinne, he said, <hi>Ego autem hic fame pereo: reuertar in domum patris mei:</hi> here I doo perish by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: I will returne into the house of my Father. And so must we all reflecte vpon our selues, learning to knowe who God is? and what we are? pondering the abhomination of our sinnes passed, the dread and feare of our conscience present, and the horrible terror of iudgement and punishment to come. O thus let vs often imitate Dauid saying, <hi>Meditatus sum nocte cum corde meo, exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, &amp; scopebam spiritum meum.</hi> I haue meditated in the night with mine owne harte, I was exercised, and I did sweepe my spirite. O thus let vs sweepe and clense our soules by meditation and practicall knowledge of our owne hartes! in examining our religiō; trying our faith; &amp; heedfull looking to our workes! then shall we see our Errors and our faultes; then will we chuse a better course for our saluation; then shall we exercise our selues in deedes of penance, in Actes of contrition; in syncere confessions; in due satisfactions; and in diuerse kinds of voluntary and deuout morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>
   <p n="11">
      <pb facs="8"/>11. O that we would consider how we are corrupted in all our partes. 1. In our fleshe and body. 2. In our Animall parte and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>fe. 3. In our spirituall parte and reason. In our corporall partes and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward senses. In our inward senses and appetites irascible, concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, imagination, and selfe will. In our reasonable vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, memory, and free will. In all these we haue rendred our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues as slaues into the Diuells bondage, whiles we suffer sinne to reigne and haue dominion in vs, so that our vnderstanding is obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, our will is depraued, and our memory is blotted with much euill: we haue our irascible power full of impatience and anger, and the concupiscible inflamed with brutish affections and carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes; our Imagination is turmoyled with worldly desires and vayne suspitions; our selfewill is crookened &amp; hardened by obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: all the partes and outward senses of our bodyes are become the members and instrumentes of sinne: and so we passe from vice to vice, and euery day we intangle our selues in new iniquityes, and in more chaynes, by which the Diuell leades vs along to his eternall prison of tormentes, whiles we yeild our selues to committe or to continue any mortall sinne, without contrition and true care of amendment.</p>
   <p n="12">12. It is true: we are not able by our selues alone to get out of the Diuells slauery, to forsake sinne, nor to alter and amend entirely the course of our liues: for hauing once yeilded and liued in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and subiection of sinne and Satan, we haue need of Allmigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Gods helpe and grace to deliuer vs; first preuenting and stirring vs vp to haue a good will,<note place="margin">
         <hi>S. Tho.</hi> 1.2. <hi>q.</hi> 109. <hi>a.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. <hi>Concil. Trid. Sess.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> and afterward allso working with our will to bringe our conuersion and repentance vnto a full worke: for euery good desire which we haue, doth proceed from Gods grace offered: and although our will <hi>be free</hi> to admit or refuse the accomplishment of those good desires, as neither compelled vnto them by outwarde violence, nor necessitated by inward qualitye, neither as a stone naturally &amp; necessarily falling downeward, nor forced vpward violently, but differing herein from senseles &amp; bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
<pb facs="8"/>
creatures; &amp; <hi>freely</hi> consenting or dissenting to all good motions; yet as allmighty God doth first inspire them, so further without his grace we are no way able to effect them; for in religious spirituall good thinges without him we can do nothing.</p>
   <p n="13">13. But on the other side we haue greater and assured comfortes: First because our Lorde doth offer grace vnto all men at one time or other by giuing thē good desires of a better life; by which he would haue all men to be saued. If they euer refuse these good moriōs, then are they iustly forsaken &amp; left in a reprobate sense. If we doo at any time admitte these good desires, &amp; so do but as much as lyes in our power, then most infallibly our Lord doth giue vs further grace &amp; meanes wherby to come to the knowledge of his truth. Of the first preuenting inspirations, Gods wisdome saith, <hi>Beholde I stande at the dore &amp; knocke:</hi> if we open not, but keepe him out it is our fault: if on our partes we yeild him entrance, then alltogeather with the Father and the Sonne they will come vnto vs by operating grace effecting our full resolution; and by further grace still cooperating they will dwell with vs in practise &amp; continuance of a vertuous holy life, till the accomplishment of our saluation, if we of our selues doo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer driue him from vs agayne, by committing some mortall sinne.</p>
   <p n="14">14. Our second comforte is, that as if we let him into vs when he knocketh by preuenting grace admonishing our hartes; so by his operating &amp; following grace, when we are resolued, if we do but knocke by prayer at his doore of mercy, he doth euer most vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly receiue vs into fauour. O most gracious God full of mercy who doth call vnto vs by grace, that we should call vnto him for mercy? can any creature wish for greater clemency then to haue forgiuenes for the asking? And is he not worthy to perish in his wickednes, who will neither admit good desires, nor be mooued vnto harty prayers? O what will mooue vs, if consideration of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall perdition cannot stirre vs? Or if we doo not pray for mercy, because we doo not consider our misery? Agayne, and agayne, I beseech you to examine your Religion, to try your faithe, and to
<pb facs="9"/>
take an vnpartiall view of your whole life, that seing your danger, you may seeke for fauour; for as in the Spanish Prouerb it is truly said of our corporall eyes, <hi>Quienbien vee, bien llora</hi>: He that sees clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, weepes easily; so in the eye sight of our soule, he that clearely beholdes his faultes, will more easily shed teares for his pardon.</p>
   <p n="15">15. Let vs examine our selues by the 10. Commandements of God, by the 5. Preceptes of his Church: by the 7. workes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy corporall, and 7. spirituall: by the 7. deadly sinnes: or by some, or by all of these, according to our abilitye, particuler obligations, or other degrees, which doo bind vs often not to omit that which is Good, and doo forbid vs neuer to commit that which is ill. Let vs consider by what meanes our Lord hath sought to bring vs to the knowledge of his truth, and to become members of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church; infusing good illuminations into our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or good desires into our will, inuiting vs to vertue or truthe, disswading vs from vice or error, eyther by good examples, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous bookes, by holy preistes, or by our friendes, yea sometime by our enemyes whom we hate, or by them whom we doo persecute; for either all, or some of these shalbe witnesses against vs, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecte their meanes, or doo willfully loose the time of fauour. Or if we doo admit these good beginninges, yet we must proceed with care and cherfullnes to imploy our time meritoriously, andto reape benefite by the exercise of our Religion, by the sacramentes of the Catholique Churche, and by all the Goodnes of God directed to his greater glory and our saluation, eyther in his giftes of grace, arte, or nature; whether it be in diuine contemplation, or in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Action; spirituall meditating of his diuine mysteryes, or vsing of his creatures orderly for his seruice, and for our necessitye. O ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable happynes of religious or discreet holy men, who doo thus order theyr liues! O lamentable wilfullnes of obstinate or proud people, who doo refuse to saue their soules! O detestable vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes of wicked or careles creatures, who doo neglecte or abuse so many helpes! The tractable, diligent, and humble seruant shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
<pb facs="9"/>
exalted vnto eternall glory, when the peruerse, carelesse, and high-minded Despiser shall be throwne downe into euerlasting torment.</p>
   <p n="16">16. And therfore to auoyde the one, and obtayne the other, let vs betake our selues to penitent Prayer; with humility on our partes, considering our vncertaine faith, and our certayn faultes; and yet in regard of our most gracious God, with comfort and confidence, respecting his great mercy and infinite kindnes; to hope &amp; trust in him as a pittifull louing Father, and yet to be humble and reuerent towardes him, as a King of high Majesty: For so our Sauiour taught vs to prepare our thoughtes to the petitions of his prayer, by saying for an introduction, <hi>Our father which art in heauen:</hi> that because he is <hi>Our father,</hi> therfore we should be assured to find fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour; and yet not to be presumptuous, or heedles, because he sittes on a high throne of justice <hi>in heauen.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="17">17. Thus let vs pray with Dauid in repeating or perusing this psalme of <hi>Miserere,</hi> not alone, because the exercise of prayer is both meritorious as a good worke, and allso impetratorious as a deuout petition: but furthermore because it is an Acte of Gods worship expressely commaunded in those wordes, <hi>Petite &amp; accipietis,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 83. <hi>ar.</hi> 2. <hi>ad</hi> 2.</note>
      <hi>quaerite &amp;c</hi>: Aske and you shall receiue: Seeke and you shall finde: knock and it shall be opened vnto you. Which wordes S. Thomas and other Doctors do affirme to haue the nature of Preceptes, binding vs to pray, and annexeth promises assuring vs to preuayle; for we shall receiue, finde, and haue it opened; if we aske in hart and thought; seeke with our mouth and wordes; and knocke with our hands and workes: eyther by all these, or at least by the first, when we cannot performe the rest.</p>
   <p n="18">18. Or if Prayer were not absolutely commaunded, yet our necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes &amp; danger do require it, as S. Gregory said, <hi>The euills which do heere oppresse vs, do compell vs to flye vnto God</hi>: as the prodigall sonne feeling famine, he desired to satisfye his hunger, <hi>Et nemo illi dabat,</hi> and no body gaue him where withall; For nothing in this worlde
<pb facs="10"/>
can affoarde vs full content. Therfore <hi>in se reuersus</hi> returning into himselfe, and into his wittes, out of which we may say he had bene wandring, vntill now he considered his misery, then <hi>He retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his father,</hi> humbly confessing his folly, and intreating pitty. And lastly he flyeh to this submission of prayer, as to his cheife refuge, <hi>Dicam Patri,</hi> I will say vnto my Father, I will make my moane vnto him: he is my Father, and therfore I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my want and supplication vnto him: <hi>Quid enim nisi vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta supersunt?</hi> For a sinfull wretch hath no better meanes left, then by prayer to beginne his conuersion, and to begge his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, according to that of Iob: <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>lli meae consumptis car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus adhaesit os meum,</hi>

            <desc>•</desc>

But whereas many differre these vnto the laste, by negligence, or presumption; so by the iust iudgement of God, many are cut off without these.

   <p n="20">20. And last of all, it is surely a wonderfull comfort herein which S. Chrysostome noteth; that there is scarse any losse or misery in all the worlde which can be repayred by prayer, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, and repentance, except the losse of God,<note place="margin">

      </note> and the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of sinne, which though they be aboue all other domages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably the greatest, yet is their redresse much the easyer: for the losse of life, or goods consumed, or of honor impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; the misery of payne, sickenes, &amp; of many other extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes,
<pb facs="11"/>
cannot be recouered by sighing or lamenting, though our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be neuer so great. But if with syncere contrition of our hart we be greiued for our sinnes, because for them we haue lost the loue of God; and if we pray humbly for their remission, with purpose to confesse them as well as we can; and do intend neuer agayne willfully to commit them; vndoubtedly this purpose and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conuersion on earth, shall obteyne most certayn and ioyfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation in heauen: for our Lord IESVS hath said vnto his Preistes (and he is most true of all his wordes) Whose sinnes on earth you remitte, in heauen they shalbe remitted; why then should we not seeke to disburden our heauy consciences vnto some Ghostly Father, that we may through his Authority (granted by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour) so receiue his heauenly Absolution, his ghostly comfort, &amp; his spirituall direction; in all these submitting our selues vnto our Confessor, not as to a Man, but as to the Deputy of our Lord IESVS, and to the Pastour of our soules: and then in all true amendment, endeauouring as we can, to performe our penance or other satisfaction. Beleeue me, o Sinners (amongst whom I haue bene a Ring-leader) by experience I say, beleeue me, it is a most comfortable and wonderfull experience; For your selues shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently feele comfort in your soules; and with continuance of time others allso will perceiue amendment in your liues.</p>
   <p n="21">21. To conclude therfore, as in generall I would perswade you to practise the examination of your consciences, and the exercise of deuout prayer, directing vs all vnto Contrition, Confession, and Satisfaction; so I do commend as helpes for these purposes, a serious accompt how we spend our liues; an indifferent obseruation why &amp; vpon what occasions these new-found sclanderous opinions did banish the Catholique religion of our Auncestors, wherin full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a hundred yeares togeather they serued God so deuoutly, and so hartily loued their neighbours; and for the same purpose I intreat a view and a detestation of our former sinnes; and auoydance of their occasions; an endeauour to practise their contrary vertues;
<pb facs="11"/>
sometime by reading of good bookes; sometime by deuout medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or prayers; sometime by almes deedes, or fasting, abstinence, or other bodily chastisement; sometime by humbling our though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes; alwayes by mortifying our passions, and vnlawfull affections; and alwayes being carefull to keep the commandements of God our Father, and of our Mother the Church. And to bringe these good purposes and cogitations into our mindes the oftener, and to mooue and imprint them the better, it is good for vs sometime to giue an edge, and to whet on ech other, by vertuous or spirituall talke and conference; not contending in disputes, but by modest teaching, or by freindly encouragements, and aboue all by frequenting the most holy sacrifice and sacrament of our deare Sauiours most precious Body and Bloud: by often calling to memory some exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his life; and more in particuler his bitter passages vnto death; both for our meditation, and for our imitation; so to giue good example one vnto another, whiles all are labouring to follow Christ our cheife Maister. And to this end it is allso good to reuiue our deuotion by reading or hearing of Sayntes liues; or by the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent beholding of their deuout Images or paynted storyes, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the passion of our sweet Sauiour IESVS; by marking his sufferinges, to be mooued for our owne sinnes: and so by viewing the memory of other Saintes, to be stirred vp to follow their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as they were followers of Christ: for we may learne, and are mooued by our eye sometime as much or more then by our eare; and in these thinges which are so good, and wherein we are so dull, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily euen common sense doth teach vs, that it is profitable and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to stirre vp our memory &amp; deuotion by any sense; and by how much the more, by so much the better.</p>
   <p n="22">22. And yet further vnto them that be sufficiently able, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the reading and meditation of Dauids Psalter, which holy Church vseth so much in all her diuine Offices; and particulerly of the seauen Penitentiall Psalmes; and according to the practise of Catholiques, especially of this psalme <hi>Miserere</hi>: as admonished
