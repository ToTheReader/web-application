      <salute>Gentle Reader,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Jntended not this Tracts comming forth thus, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle. These times of dearth and also of sicknesse inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedmo (in behalfe of the poore) to meditate and write of the seven workes of corporall mercie. Amongst them that sacred action of visiting the sicke and wounded hath its place. This was framed as an appendix to that. That and the rest in composing grew to a bigger bulke, than I either at first intended, or have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure as yet to make ready to come abroad. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perceiving this magicall and superstitious unguent every day to spread and come into more hands, in a zealous * indignation, I send this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <note place="margin">Sinatura ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, facit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignatio ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum <hi>Iuvenal. Satyr.</hi> 1.</note> Tract into the world (if possible) to decry it. If it may warne thee (good Reader) from it, or
<pb facs="8"/>
fore-arme thee with sufficient reasons against it, I have attained my wished scope. But be not too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie to judge of the worke. A sturdy oake is not cut downe with a blow or two; nor so knotty a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a line or page, or two, made facill. That may bee but marked and lightly touched at one time and place, which is paid home, and cut downe in another. Reade then all, or none, before thou settle thy judgement, and passe thy censure. With <hi>St. Augustine</hi> I must confesse; <hi>Multa quae</hi>
      <note place="margin">D. <hi>August,</hi> de Trinit. lib. 3. in procem.</note>
      <hi>nesciebam, scribendo me didicisse;</hi> that by writing on this subject, I learned many things I was ignorant of before: So peradventure maiest thou in the reading. Yet I could wish some more skilfull pen had taken this argument in hand. But I hope these my weake labours will breake the Ice, and leade on greater abilities. A torch may be lighted at a candle. This my unpolished worke may occasion some other, absolutely perfect. So be that a torch may come in place, to give more light, I can endure my candle to bee extinguished. I aime not at mine owne lustre, but the good of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian soules. So God may be glorified, his Church profited, and my brethren instructed, let mee bee counted a snuffe, a nothing (with S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Paul) Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note>
      <pb facs="8"/>
worse then nothing. In the meane time, some may think me too tart in this argument. With the Poet they will say,</p>
   <lg>
      <l>Plus aloes, quàm mellis habet—<note place="margin">Iu venal Satyr.</note>
      </l>
   </lg>
   <p>Let these know I love their persons, they are Gods creatures, the sheepe of his hands (as <hi>David</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal 95. 7.</note> speaketh, <hi>Psal. 95. 7.)</hi> but I hate, and am tart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst mine owne and other mens faults, they are the workes of the divell, the unfruitfull workes of darknesse, with which we must have no fellowship, but (as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts, <hi>Ephes. 5. 11.)</hi> rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove <note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 11.</note> them. And I dare call sin, sin, in whom soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. If <hi>Iefabell</hi> be painted, with <hi>Iehu</hi> I will not have peace with her to commend her, though a Queene. If <hi>Herod</hi> be incestuous, with the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> I'le not sooth him, though a King. If <hi>Simon Magus</hi> be a Sorcerer, I feare not his divell; with S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Peter</hi> I'le rouze him, though a witch. Shall any for my boldnesse thinke to sit upon my skirts? Let those know I esteeme my selfe <hi>infra invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam.</hi> I cannot have lesse in the Church, unlesse nothing. And if they shall indeavour to keepe me still low, let them know I looke for no good, from them that envie my endeavours to do good. If I sit panting on the ground, I will not refuse
<pb facs="9"/>
to be sed by ravens to keepe me alive with <hi>Elias;</hi> but I looke not to be lifted vp by any but Eagles, heroicke spirits, men fearing God, and hating Simoniacall covetousnesse, and magicall supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And so I rest,</p>
