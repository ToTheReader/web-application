   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, how they that are willing to apprehend and assist new bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses, are desirous to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in these points. First concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the perfect and exact knowledge of that Inuention wherein they are to deale and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate, for as the common Prouerbe saith; <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido.</hi> The second is, touching the worth and goodnesse of the businesse, and how the benefit thereof may bee raised. The third is the habillity of the Inuentioner, to effect and performe his proiect propounded. The fourth is concerning the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting or bargaining; In all which, I will endeauour to giue the best satisfaction that I may, out of the praecepts and grounds of this present Treatise of <hi>Metallica.</hi> And therefore concerning the first point. The Transcript of his Maiesties most gratious grant and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth euidently shew and informe the Reader, that amongst many other inuentions
<pb facs="3"/>granted for one and thirty yeares, my Selfe, my Executors, Deputies and Assignes, may <hi>onely</hi> make, practise, and put in vse, within any of his Maiesties Realmes and Dominions, the working, melting, and effecting of Iron, Steele, and other Mettles with Sea-coale, or Pit-coale. The principall end of which inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that the Woods and Timber of our country might be saued, maintained and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued from the great consumption and waste of our common Furnaces and Iron-Milnes, which as they are now ordinarily built and framed, can burne, spend, and consume no other fewell but Char coale. The which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise if it may bee effected accordingly (as I make no doubt but by Gods blessing I shall) will prooue to bee the best and most profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table businesse and Inuention that euer was knowne or inuented in England these many yeares.</p>
   <p>For (to speake nothing of the great benefit, and profit which may bee raised and made by twenty other Inuentions comprised and
<pb facs="3"/>comprehended vnder the Pattent) the yearly vallew of this mettle-businesse alone, will amount vnto 330. thousand pounds, <hi>per annū,</hi> after the second or third yeare, as appeareth by this calculation.</p>
   <div type="calculation">
      <head>A Calculation shewing how the <hi>Mettle Inuention</hi> or Art, which maketh all kinde of Mettles or Metalique substance, with Pit-coale or Sea-coale, will bee worth <hi>per annum. 330.</hi> thousand pounds, immediatly after the two first yeares, which are the allotted times for Tryalls and Conformities, without any charges, (except the charges of Tryalls) to the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees, Partners, Assistants, and Dealers.</head>
      <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are planted already in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Wales, eight hundred Milnes for the making of Iron, for there are foure hundred Milnes in Surry, Kent, &amp; Sussex,
<pb facs="4"/>as the townesmen of Haslemore haue testified and numbred vnto mee, there are also 200. Milnes in Wales, and 20. in Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, as the Author hath beene credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
      <p>Now wee may well suppose, that all Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland and Ireland (besides the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named shires) will make vp the number of 180. Milnes more, being in all 800. Milnes.</p>
      <p>Moreouer one Milne alone spendeth year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Charcoale 500. pound and more, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse Clarkes and workmen in Iron businesse, haue credibly testified, which in pit-coale will be done with the charges of 30. or 40. pounds, after the Inuentioners manner and inuention, or at the most with 50. pound, where carriage is farre and chargeable.</p>
      <p>So that this new Inuention in the 800. Iron milnes, will saue and gaine <hi>de claro</hi> the owners of those milnes 320. thousand pounds yearly, ouer and aboue their ordinary and annuall gaines, as it appeareth by this proportion.</p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <p> One Milne alone saueth yearely 400. li. <hi>Ergo,</hi> 800. Milnes saue yearly 320. thousand pounds.</p>
      <p>Againe the said <hi>Metalique</hi> inuention, beeing put and conuerted to Lead, Tinne, Copper, Brasse, and Glasse-mettle, in all the seuerall Mineralls of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, will questionlesse cleare yearely, by meanes of Fewell, aboue ten thousand pounds more; ouer and besides the ordinary gaines in the said businesse. So that the yearely Iron reuenues, added vnto these other <hi>Metalique</hi> reuenues, doe amount vnto 330. thousand pounds, as was said before.</p>
      <p>Now out of these <hi>Metalique</hi> gaines of 330. thousand pounds yearely, the owners of the Milnes, Hearths, and Furnaces, may haue and receiue liberall rates and proportions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and allotted vnto them, ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their ordinary gaines, onely in lieu of conforming their Furnaces, Fineries and Chafferies to this Inuention of Pitt-coale
<pb facs="5"/>and Earth-coale. And also the Kings most excellent Maiestie, the Prince his Highnesse, the Duke of Yorke, the Lord Vicount Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, and other parties interressed in the Pattent, may by their Composition and agreement with the said Owners and Iron-Maisters, yearely receiue, by way of rents and licences, the residew of that gaines which remaineth ouer and aboue that which was allotted and allowed to the Iron-Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, for applying of this Inuention to their ordinary way of making of Iron, as more fully shall bee specified, shewed, and prooued in the Apendix of this Treatise, which I am now preparing for the Printer and the Presse with all conuenient speed.</p>
      <p>This may suffice therefore, to giue the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der satisfaction, concerning the two first points, for the knowledge and the worth of the businesses, and concerning the manner how certaine yearly annuities may bee raised to the dealers and assistants.</p>
      <pb facs="5"/>
      <p> Now to perswade the third point, that the Authour is able to effect the worke vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, in as ample manner as hee propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; wee plead and alledge as followeth.</p>
      <p>First the Inuentioner by his study, indust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and practise, hath already brought to passe and published diuerse proiects and new deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, aswell Litterall as Mechannicall, very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to the common-wealth. His Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare Inuentions doe appeare and are knowne partly by his Printed Treatise of <hi>Dibere Adam,</hi> which is a Scholasticall engin <hi>Aucomaton,</hi> and partly in diuerse other Manuscripts which he hath to shew. His new Mechanicks already performed, are to bee seene in the Inuentions which hee calleth by the names of <hi>Presse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, Wood-pleits, Ballance, Engin, Baramyha,</hi> and <hi>Hubla,</hi> of all which in priuate speech hee is ready more largely to conferre, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest their truth and goodnesse at his Worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses at Islington and Highbury. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.34. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from the Beare and Lyon to Golyah the Gyant.</note> therefore he doubteth not but (by Gods blessing &amp; assistance, semblably with successe)
<pb facs="6"/>to effect his Inuention of Iron-works, as also al his other <hi>Metallique</hi> deuises and Inuentions, heere contained in the Patent, or Priuiledge of <hi>Metallica.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Secondly the consideration of thinges in the like nature with it, are good inducements to perswade vs well of this proiect, for Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, Brewing, Dying, Casting of Brasse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, &amp;c. were (not many yeares since) done altogether with the fuell of wood and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coale; in stead whereof Sea-coale is now vsed as effectually and to as good vse and purpose. Againe (that which is somewhat neerer the marke) the Blacksmith long agone forged all his Iron with Char-coale (as in some places where they are cheape they continue this course still) but these many yeares small Sea-coale hath, and doth serue the turne, as well and sufficiently. Adde heerevnto, that very lately by a wind-Furnace, greene glasse, for windowes, is made as well with Pit-coale at Winchester house in Southwarke as it is done in other places with much wast &amp; consuming
<pb facs="6"/>of infinite store of Billetts and other Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuell.</p>
      <p>Thirdly the Inuention hath already experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and made tryall of the cheife particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar meanes and Instruments of diuers cheape waies of making of Irons in reall and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall moddles to him-selfe (though in small things, according as his meanes would giue him leaue.) And this of his credit and honesty he auoucheth and protesteth: wherefore hee more confidently presumeth to worke the same effects in grander Instruments and meanes of triall, after that hee hath receiued allowance of the dealers and assistants for it.</p>
      <p>Fourthly there can bee no doubt of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the matter propounded, if the Inuentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can but make, or cause Sea-coale to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as seruiceable for <hi>Metallique</hi> purposes as wood &amp; Char-coale is: The art and skill wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of consisteth cheifly in three points: The first is to bring Earth-coale to that equallity of heat that Wood or Char-coale hath; That is to say, that it make neither hotter nor coulder
<pb facs="7"/>fier then the Wood or Char-coale doth: The second meanes, is so to order and prepare Pit-coale, that all malignant proprieties, which are aversse from the nature of Metallique sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, may bee extracted from it, or at least destroyed in it: The third meanes is, the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and infusion of those deficient proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which as they are in Char-coale, so ought they to be found in Pit-coale.</p>
      <p>Now this three-fold mistery and secret, the Author can certainly performe and atchieue, by the powerfull efficacie and meanes of his dexterous prerogatiue instruments, deuised for this purpose; as more at large is shewed, both in this Treatise, and in the Apendix, which very shortly shall come forth, and also shall be further confirmed and iustified by his dayly experiments and tryals, which hee will bee ready to shew to them whom they shall any wayes touch or concerne, or to them who are otherwise desirous to assist and deale for the experimenting and accomplishing of these so worthy good businesses. And then
<pb facs="7"/>also they shall know my purpose for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting</hi> and <hi>bargaining</hi> by word of mouth, as it is best fitting for priuate dealings and nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatings.</p>
      <p>And thus (hauing briefly touched these foure premised points) I conclude and shut vp this Preface of Metallica. Humbly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly beseeching the Lord, who by his holy spirit inspired * <hi>Bezaleel,</hi>

         </note>that that which was begun in his feare, may be prosecuted &amp; fully accomplished and built by his heauenly &amp; helpful hands, to the glory of his name, and for the good well-fare and emolument of the Kings most excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, the Church and the Politicall estate wherein wee liue. <hi>Amen.</hi>
