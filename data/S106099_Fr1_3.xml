   <head>TO THE DEVOVT READER.</head>
   <p>THIS Sacramēt of the most Blessed body and bloud of our Lord deuoute reader being the Sacramēt of loue &amp; for loue left vnto vs of our most louinge Sauiour: for auoiding of vngrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, it is verie requisite that it should be receaued and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred with loue: we hauinge in this life no other thinge to recō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pense the loue which Christ our Sauiour hath euidently shewed vnto vs by instituting for our cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moditie so most louelie a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, sauing loue, whereof god hath made vs maisters &amp; Lords, seeing that we haue Power to place it where it best pleaseth vs. Wherefore as Christ giuing him selfe vnto vs for meate, doth giue vs that which is his owne; and likewise the most pretious Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell which he hath, euen so by gi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uinge
<pb facs="4"/>our loue vnto Almightie GOD, wee giue vnto him that which is our owne &amp; that which is the cheefest tresure which we haue. From hence it commeth to passe that God worthely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth more account of this onely thinge then of all other thinges in the worlde: And this is that which he requireth of vs when he sayeth, <hi>Praebe,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Prouer. <hi>23.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>fili mi cor tuum mihi.</hi> Giue vnto me (my sonne) thy hart. that is, loue, which is thine owne. But consider here the maruailous skill and arte of our most liberall Iesus, who for to giue vnto thee, the greatest perfection which can be giuen vnto any creature, which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in the perfect vnion with his creator, giueth thee this most pretious Sacrament, &amp; requireth at thy handes noe other thinge
<pb facs="5"/>but loue, for since that it is the propertie of loue to transforme the louer into that which he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth; which is Almighty God: And being moreouer the proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of this heauenly Sacrament, as deuine meate which conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into it selfe him which ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it to vnite vs with God him selfe, it consequently followeth that this Sacramēt and our loue being after this maner conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to gither doth vnite vs with Almightie God and maketh vs one soule &amp; one hart with him. But because that mans wil is not moued to loue, if his vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doth not represēt vnto him a worthy obiect, &amp; the obligatiō which bindeth him to loue the same: for this respect I haue cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed this litle booke, which shal giue thee occasion to know
<pb facs="5"/>the greatnes of the gifte which Christ Iesus hath bestoed vpon thee in leauing vnto thee this most maruelos Sacramēt it will also declare the obligatiō wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou standest bound to loue the gift to gither with the giuer: and this is that which cheifly I desire to the greater glorie of our common Lord in this my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worke. Therefore I beseech the diuine goodnes as he hath preuented vs with so amiable a gift so to graunte vs ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to receaue it worthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly and to the saluation of our soules. Amen.</p>
