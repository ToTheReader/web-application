   <head>The life of EPIC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TETVS.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>EPICTETVS</hi> vvas a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher of the sect of the Stoikes, borne in <hi>Hiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> (now called <hi>Haleppo,</hi> si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> not farre from <hi>Laodicea):</hi> His estate was seruile; according to the testimony of <hi>AVLVS GELLIVS</hi> in his <hi>Noctes Atticae.</hi> For at <hi>Rome</hi> he was slaue vnto one <hi>EPAPHRODITVS,</hi> one of <hi>NERO's</hi> familiars. His life was spotlesse and vntaintable, his spirit wholy secluded that arrogancie of carriage which
<pb facs="5"/>
otherwise stuck as a great ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish in the liues of the most and best Philosophers. For his esteeme, it had that high place in the worlds affection, that his very lamp<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> (beeing but of Potters claye) was bought and solde for fifty pounds sterling. Of this <hi>EPICTETVS,</hi> you shall finde honorable mention made in <hi>LVCIAN,</hi> who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise was a perpetuall detractor from all the Philosophers, and in generall, a professed scorner of Gods and men. And in that place where he mentions him, hee toucheth also at this sale of his lampe, (for thus he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his Dialogue; <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="5"/>
that is, <hi>to the vnlearned en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosser of books</hi>:) Our times (saith he) hath brought forth a man, and I thinke hee is yet aliue, that gaue fifty pound for <hi>EPICTETVS</hi> his earthen Lampe, thinking (be-like) that if hee had but light to study by from thence, that then hee should haue all <hi>EPICTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVS</hi> his wisdome inspired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in dreames, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come parallell to that admired father. Thus writeth <hi>LVCIAN. EPICTETVS</hi> was wont to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the scope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of all Philosophy was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in these two vvords: <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>Beare and Forbeare.</hi> In the reigne of
<pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>DOMITIAN,</hi> either his owne dislike of his tyrannicall gouernment, or the Senates edict for the expulsion of all the Philosophers out of <hi>Rome,</hi> made him depart to <hi>Hierapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> his natiue soyle, whence afterwards hee is sayd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and so to make his aboade in <hi>Rome</hi> vntill the reigne of <hi>MARCVS ANTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIVS,</hi> about which time hee dyed.</p>
