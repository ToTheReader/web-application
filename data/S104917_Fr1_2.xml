the power of Angels is able to

shalt (frendly Reader) in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

procreated into this

the Gothes inhabited their Countries, either since their second
progenitors the <hi>Sarazens</hi> expelled and murdered the most part
of the Gothes, as it seemeth that the Spaniardes haue murdered
and put to death in the Westerne Indies by all such meanes as
barbarousnesse it selfe coulde imagine or forge vpon the anueld
of crueltie. They haue destroyed thrise so much lande as chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome
<pb facs="3"/>
doth comprehende: such torments haue they inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yea so great and excessiue haue their trecherie been, that the
posteritie shall hardly thinke that euer so barbarous or cruell a
nation haue bin in the worlde, if as you woulde say we had not
with our eyes seene it, and with our hands felt it. I confesse that
I neuer loued that nation generally, by reason of their intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pride, notwithstanding I can not but cōmend &amp; loue sundry
excellent persons that are among thē. Howbeit, God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
hatred procureth me not to write those things, as also the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of the booke is by nation a Spaniard, and besides writeth
farre more bitterly then my selfe.</p>
   <p>But two reasons haue moued me to publishe this preface,
which I do dedicate to all the prouinces of the Lowe countreys:
The one, to the end, awaking thēselus out of their sleep, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to thinke vpon Gods iudgements: and refraine from their
wickednes and vice. The other, that they may also consider with
what enemie they are to deale, and so to beholde as it were in a
picture or table, what stay they are like to bee at, when through
their rechlesnesse, quarrels, controuersies, and partialities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
haue opened the way to such an enemie: and what they
may looke for. Most mē do ground their opinion vpon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their cause, concluding, that in as much as God is iust,
he will graunt victorie to the right, and will ouerthrowe the
wicked. This was Iobes friendes disputation, where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that for that Iob was afflicted, vndoubtedly he was wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
Which reason is drawen out of a certaine rule, which it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that nature hath printed in our hartes, that is, that God
punisheth the euill, and in mercie rewardeth the good deedes.
There vpon did the inhabitants of Malta report that Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
would not permit S. Paul to liue, when after he had esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
so dangerous shipwracke, the Viper leaped vpon his hande.
Howebeit notwithstanding this rule be certaine and true, yet
do manie therein diuersely deceiue them selues, concluding
thereby that GOD sendeth no affliction but to the wicked,
as if hee laide not his crosse also vpon the good: As Iob, the
Prophetes, and Martyres: yea, his owne sonne Iesus Christ,
and that for the mortifiyng of the fleshe, and more and more to
quicken man in good liuing: and for his sonne, to the ende in
him to punish our sinne which hee tooke vpon him. Others doe
<pb facs="3"/>
beleeue that God wil neuer suffer sinne to bee long vnpunished,
notwithstāding y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> hauing long waited patiētly for our repentāce,
his clemencie is at length conuerted into iustice. Some againe,
that it is vnpossible for the wicked to gette the vpper hande in
an euill cause, notwithstanding wee dayly see it fall out contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
vndoubtedly the Turkes victories &amp; conquestes in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
haue no foundation, but consist vpon meere tyrannie and
vsurpation. For although Christians sinnes, especially the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
in Gods seruice, haue bin the causes of our punishment, yet
must we confesse that the christians, what errors soeuer some of
them do in their doctrine maintain, are not neuertheles so farre
deuoid of the truth, as are the Turkes, and yet do we see howe
mightily in few yeres they haue cōquered &amp; encroched vpō chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stendom.
Also before the comming of the Turkes, namely soone
after the time of <hi>Mahamet,</hi> there came such a flock of Sarazins,
that they deuoured first <hi>Egypt,</hi> then all <hi>Affrick,</hi> &amp; rooting out
Christianitie out of the said countries seazed vpon al Spaine: yea
proceeding forward, they camped in <hi>Aquitain</hi> vpon the riuer of
<hi>Toyre:</hi> insomuch that it was to be doubted y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they might soone
haue caught hold vpon France, &amp; so vpon the rest of christēdom,
had not God raised vp that mightie Duke of <hi>Brubant, Charles
Martel,</hi> who defeating them, driue them beyond the Pirenean
mountaines. But if we list to consider the examples contained
in the holy Bible, whose reasons are more exactly expounded by
the prophets, we do find that in the time of K. <hi>Hezechias,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the head citie, namely Hierusalem, was not forced, yet
the lesser townes being taken by the enemie, the flatte countrey
spoyled, the K. and the princes of <hi>Iuda</hi> had no more left them
but the bare walles of Hierusalem. Also, albeit God did maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
strike the armie of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> and that his own children
flew him in his gods temples: yet were not gods people free from
suffering much, and from seeing the enemie enioy the most part
of their law: their cōmons did beare that which nowe we know,
&amp; more then we would, that is what an enemy entring by force
of armes into a land is able to do. But Nabuchadnezers victories
were far others, whē he tooke, burned, &amp; sacked euē the head ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
together with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> very temple of Hierusalē, &amp; took their K. P.
&amp; hie P. prisoners, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lu pulled out y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> eies, &amp; fettered some of thē
forcing the cōmons during the siege to eate their own dong &amp;
<pb facs="4"/>
Who is hee therefore that dare accuse God of wrong, sith such
tyrants be called the Axe in the Lordes hands, as the executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of his iustice? Further wee see, that those that haue the most
right are by the wicked robbed, slaine, &amp; murdered, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
Gods doing. For it is said: Cursed be he that doth the
Lordes worke negligently, in which place the holy scriptures do
speake of such ministers and instruments of God. In this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of <hi>Don Bartholomew de las Casas,</hi> wee do finde a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
example. For I pray you what right had the Spaniards ouer
the Indians: sauing that the Pope had giuen them the said land,
and I leaue to your iudgemente what right hee had therein:
for it is doubtfull whether his power doe stretch to the distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of worldly kingdomes. But admit hee had that authority,
was there therefore any reason that hee should for crying in the
night, <hi>There is a God, a Pope, &amp; a King of Castile who is Lord
of these Countries,</hi> murder 12. 15. or 20. millions of poore rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
creatures, created (as our selues) after the image of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God: Heere doe I, as in the beginning I said, see a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
depth of Gods iudgements. For it is a small matter to say
that the wicked doe molest better men then themselues, for the
causes aforesaide: but to see a whole nation, yea, infinite nations
perish so miserablie, and as it semeth, without any cause, is it that
maketh most men to wander, yea euen astonisheth such as do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
these effects by the rule of their owne reasons. Howebeit
we haue two examples in the Bible, though not altogether like,
yet very neere. It is saide in the ouerthrowe of Sehon: <hi>In those
dayes wee tooke all his townes, and destroyed men women and
childen in the same, neither left we any thing remaining.</hi> The
like sentence is there also of <hi>Og</hi> king of <hi>Basan,</hi> yea, Moses sone
after alloweth all that was done, commaundeth <hi>Iosua</hi> to doe as
much to all the other kinges in his iourney as was done
to those two. If wee seeke the cause of such executions,
man will bee as it were at his wits ende and stande mute. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
if men should consider the example of king Saule whom
God reiected, because he did not wholy discomfit <hi>Amelec,</hi> but
saued their king, and reserued the fattest of their cattell for
the sacrifices, their vnderstanding woulde giue sentence cleane
<pb facs="4"/>
contrarie to gods. What will they say, was it not a comēndable,
yea, a noble minde, for a king to spare his brother, either for an
Israelite to spare the cattell to the ende to sacrifice them to the
God of Israel: yet was Gods sentence pronounced by <hi>Samuel</hi>
cleane repugnant thereto, God <hi>loueth obedience better then
sacrifice.</hi> And not long before God had commaunded both,
namely, that the Cananites and Amalekites shoulde bee rooted
out: and therefore hee was to bee obeyed, and for their diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
the Cananites remained thornes in the eyes of Israel,
and the king of <hi>Amalec</hi> whome <hi>Samuel</hi> neuerthelesse hewed
in peeces, was the subuersion of Saule and his royall familie, But
here may expresse reasons be alleadged for such iudgements of
God, which seeming seuere to man are neuerthelesse, in that
they proceeded from God, meere iustice. Moses saith, when
the Lord thy God hath reiected them before thy face, think not
in thine hearte, saying: The Lorde for my righteousnesse hath
caused mee to enter possession of this lande, seeing hee hath for
their wickednesse rooted out these nations before thy face.
For thou art not through thy righteousnes and vprightnesse of
heart come to inherite their land, but it is for the abhominatiōs
of these people, whom the Lord thy god hath expelled before thy
face.</p>
   <p>True it is, that as in a cleeare sunnie light we may more easily
discerne all that is obiect to our sight, euen so of things contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the holy Scriptures commonly the causes are to bee
founde: but for other matters, as the destruction of diuers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
among the Heathen: and finally for this so cruell and hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rible
example, conteined in this booke, there can bee alleadged
no particuler reason, other then that gods iudgemēts are bottō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
pits: also that sith he hath done it, it is iustly done. And yet
are not the Spaniardes beeing the executors of this vengeance,
more excusable then <hi>Pilate</hi> for condēning our sauiour, or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
or <hi>Caiphas</hi> for procuring his death notwithstanding gods
counsaile and hand wrought those things. For behold gods sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
pronounced against the wicked, whom he vseth in chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the good, whom by those meanes he doth trie, and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
the wicked according to their desarts:</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Oh Asshur, the rod of my wrath: and the staffe in their hands
is my indignation. I will sende him to a dissembling nation, &amp; I
wil giue him a charge against the people of my wrath, to take
the spoyle, and to take the pray, &amp; to treade them vnder foote
like the mire in the streete. But he thinketh not so, neither doth
his heart esteeme it so, but he imagineth to destroy and to cut
off not a few nations. For he saith, Are not my princes altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kings? Is not Calno as Charchemish? Is not Hamath like
Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus▪ Like as my hande hath
found the kingdomes of Idols, seeing their idols were aboue Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
&amp; aboue Samaria: Shall not I, as I haue done to
Samaria and to the Idols thereof, so do to Hierusalē &amp; to the
idols thereof? But when the Lord hath accōplished al his worke
vpō mount Siō &amp; Ierusalē, I wil visit the frute of the proude
hart of the K. of Ashur, &amp; his glorious &amp; proud lookes, because
he said, by the power of my own hand haue I done it, &amp; by my
wisdom, because I am wise. Therfore I haue remoued the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the people, &amp; haue spoiled their treasures, and haue pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
downe the inbabitants like a valiant man. And my hand
hath found as a nest, &amp;c.</hi> So that although the wicked for a
time doe triumph, yet doth not God leaue their abhominable
cruelties vnpunished. But Gods iudgements being in the mean
time such, that by the wicked he punisheth those that be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:
notwithstanding their wickednes be somewhat lesse, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the good bee chastised by the cruell and bloodthirstie: it is
certaine that wee are not thereby to iudge that our selues shall
haue the victorie ouer our enemies, because our cause is the
better, for we are replenished with vice enough, whereby to
leaue vnto god sufficient matter to punishe vs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as I saide two thinges mee thought, and yet mee seemeth
in these Countries worthie admiration: One is, that wee
trusting that the defence of our libertie is vnto vs a iuste occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
doe not in the meane time consider that wee commit no
lesse faults, then those which Ezech, cast in the Sodomites teeth,
Beholde the iniquitie of thy sister Sodom was pride, fulnesse of
