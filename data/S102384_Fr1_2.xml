      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ignorant generally complaine of too much preaching, and some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of too much writing. The first haue no eyes to see, either the grace of <hi>God</hi> in his word, or their owne want of grace, for want of that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ous word. The other (I thinke) in this, haue squint eyes, or at least looke not the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ght way to the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</hi> For did they condemne onely the wanton, idle, and vaine Pamphlets, (which too licentiously <hi>panda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> for lust) stand forth in every shop, or those tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent libells, which being engendered in earthly mindes, breake forth into all bitternesse, and fill the world with stormes and schismes, <hi>who would not rise up with them against the wicked?</hi> But the bookes by
<pb facs="3"/>them censured, nay despised, and derided, are such as tend to edification; and are scorned, either because they savour not of profound and deepe learning, or not bumbasted with multiplicitie of reading, or not stucke thicke enough with the flowers of <hi>Rhetorike</hi>; when yet our owne experience makes us see these despised labours wonderfully to prosper in the Church: whether it bee that the <hi>Lord</hi> delights to glorifie his power in infirmitie, and takes no pleasure in the wisedome of words, (which makes <hi>the crosse of Christ of no effect</hi>) or as light, so the word, is most cleere and powerfull, when least mixed. Famous is that historie of <hi>Sozomen,</hi> who hath left it upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that in the first <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> when an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Philosopher</hi> did not a little stumble the learned <hi>Christians,</hi> a simple old man stept out, and with plaine dealing both confuted, and converted him: No que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion there is great, and even necessarie use of those speciall gifts in the Church: yet by such examples the <hi>Lord</hi> plainely shewes, that hee will not haue his meanest grace despised. I am perswaded, that with as much reason, and lesse blasphemie wee may quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with the Creator, for making so many rivers and fountaines on earth, so many starres in heaven; as with the Redeemer, and blessed <hi>Spirit,</hi> for storing this Kingdome with those gifts which make it as a <hi>watered garden,</hi> and another firmament, full of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious lights, shedding their beames into every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
   <p>For my selfe, if any desire to know the reasons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling mee to write what before I had spoken, and giue way to my private and weake meditations to
<pb facs="3"/>looke out in publike, upon so learned an Age; the chiefe are these.</p>
   <list>
      <item>
         <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First; That redoubled and trebled commaund of our most gracious Saviour,<note place="margin">Iohn 21. 15. 16. 17.</note>
         <hi>Feed my sheepe,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that inforcing motiue, <hi>As thou lovest mee.</hi> Oh! who can loue him sufficiently who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to death, <hi>whose loue passeth knowledge</hi>?<note place="margin">Ephe. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>9.</note> Or how can any man feed too much, when no man can loue enough? Therefore that <hi>Apostle,</hi> there so adjured, contented not himselfe to feed by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, but to this day feedes us by his writing. The same precept is often by his blessed <hi>Spirit</hi> pressed upon his Ministers:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 2. and 4. 10.</note>
         <hi>Feed the flocke of Christ. As every man hath received the gift, so let him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>o other,</hi>
         <note place="margin">Act .20. 28.</note>
         <hi>as good Stewards of the manifold graces of God. Take heed to your selues, and to the flocke, over which the holy Ghost hath made you Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers to feed the Church of God, which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased with his owne bloud.</hi> O strong adjuration! Now <hi>God</hi> forbid, that I should ever esteeme any paines sufficient for that, for which <hi>God</hi> thought not his bloud too much.</item>
      <item>
         <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly; The streight account which our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne <hi>Lord</hi> hath foretold he will exact of all his servants,<note place="margin">Math. 25. 26. 30.</note> to whom he commits these treasures of his grace, so that the single talent shall bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, and the slothfull person adjudged to a fearefull condemnation, and execution for not putting it to the banke.</item>
      <item>
         <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly; The profit of <hi>Gods</hi> people, especially those committed to me by <hi>Christ.</hi> Surely there is a wonderfull loue betweene a faithfull <hi>Pastor</hi>
         <pb facs="4"/>and his faithfull people. The <hi>Galatians</hi> could giue their eyes;<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 15.</note>
         <note place="margin">Rom. 16. 4.</note>
         <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> their liues to the Apostle. But beyond all admiration was the loue of that Apostle,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 5.</note> who not onely <hi>loved the more,</hi>
         <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 22. 23. 24.</note>
         <hi>the lesse he was beloved,</hi> their neglect (as it were by <hi>Antiperistasis</hi>) kindling, and enflaming his affections, but could willingly deferre his joyes with <hi>Christ</hi> in heaven, and still liue under the bloudie persecution of <hi>Iewes, Gentiles,</hi> false Brethren, and (which is worse then all these) the fierie opposition, and loathsome, but forced struglings with <hi>remainders of sinne,</hi> that hee might build the Church. He knew not which to choose, his presence with <hi>Christ</hi> in infinite felicitie, or his edifying the Church with all worldly miserie.</item>
      <item>
         <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Lastly; Though there be euē innumerable lights heaven, yet is ther not one in vaine: the very least and most obscure haue their use, their light, and influence: yea those infinite little starres, which by us cannot be discerned, by reason, partly of their distance, partly of their smalnesse, yet doe they paue, embrighten, and point out that <hi>milkie way</hi> in heaven. And I doubt not, but this little and weake worke shall through his power, who brings light out of da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>kenesse, direct some, or further them in that blessed way to eternall life.</item>
   </list>
   <p>But it may bee, some will stop my way with slight e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tertainment, and strong opposition of the world.</p>
   <p>This cannot weigh with those stronger argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inciting mee to this dutie. I remember the <hi>Astronomers</hi> distinguish the visible fixt starres
<pb facs="4"/>into six severall magnitudes; Those of the first and chiefest exceed the whole earth in quantitie an hundred and seven-fold, and even the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and cloudy of the sixt magnitude, eighteen-fold with advantage. Thus those first and great starres (the holy <hi>Apostles,</hi>) their followers and immediate Successours how wonderfully they did surmount the whole earth, may easily appeare in this; that when all the world interposed it selfe to ecclipse their light, yet did they then shine more bright, and filled the whole earth with the glorious splendour of the <hi>Gospell</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> So e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in these last ages, we haue knowne that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the opposition of <hi>Popes, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> and many other <hi>Princes</hi> (the whole earth indeed being banded against a very few, and farre inferiour to those fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>st Ministers) yet did they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome all their malice, and shed the long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured light into all parts of the <hi>Christian</hi> world. For my selfe I rest assured, that one heavenly sparke in the least of those starres shining in the right hand of <hi>Christ</hi> shall not, nor cannot by any earthly opposition bee so ecclipsed, but that it shall breake through, and both enlighten, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame some of those whom <hi>God</hi> hath chosen.</p>
   <p>It may be some also will object, that other more learned, and every way more sufficient, haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready laboured in this Vineyard, and set forth their workes on this Psalme.</p>
   <p>I willingly confesse it: yet I know not any more but one, even that eloquent <hi>Apollos,</hi>
      <note place="margin">M. <hi>Bolton.</hi>
      </note> powerfull and mightie in the word; and am certaine, that
<pb facs="5"/>learned and religious men will not disdaine, that when hee from this living fountaine hath filled his silver Cisterne, I should also with my earthly pitcher draw, and poure out some of the same wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life unto the sheepe of my <hi>Master.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now most worthy <hi>Patrone,</hi> I haue beene bold to entitle you, and your worthy Lady to this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, not onely in remembrance of your much loue, and my long courteous entertainment in your house (such as I never saw any Gentleman giue unto their Minister;) or that first I initiated my weake Ministerie in your Familie and Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; but especially because I acknowledge my selfe, and whatsoever is mine</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Yours in the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ;</hi> To whose grace, and fulnes of it, he shall ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you, and all yours, who thirsts and longs for your soule; <hi>PHINEES FLETCHER.</hi>
