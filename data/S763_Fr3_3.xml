   <p>NOw by way of advertisment to the <hi>Reader,</hi> in this <hi>Circular</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of <hi>Logarithmes,</hi> you may make use of the Projection of the <hi>Circles</hi> of the <hi>Ring</hi> upon a <hi>Plaine,</hi> having the feet of a paire of <hi>Compasses</hi> (but so that they be flat) to move on the <hi>Center</hi> of that <hi>Plaine,</hi> and those feet to open and shut as a paire of <hi>Compasses</hi> (which some call a <hi>Sector</hi> abusively) now if the feet bee opened to any two termes or numbers in that <hi>Proj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ction,</hi> then may you move the first foot to the third number, and the other foot shall give the <hi>Answer;</hi> and so moving those feet along <hi>Circularly,</hi> as one foot passeth by any number in the <hi>Projection,</hi> the other foot shall shew his proportionall number in that <hi>Projection;</hi> it hath pleased some to make use of this way. But in this there is a double labour in respect of that of the <hi>Ring,</hi> the one in fitting those feet unto the numbers assigned, and the other by moving them about, in which a man can hardly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the <hi>Instrument</hi> with one hand, and expresse the <hi>Proportionals</hi> in writing with the other. By the <hi>Ring</hi> you need not but bring one num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to another, and right against any other number is his <hi>Answer</hi> without any such motion. But this or the former I leave to such as shall best affect them, only the latter for <hi>Construction</hi> I account most <hi>facile,</hi> and for <hi>expedition</hi> most <hi>excellent,</hi> and upon that I write, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some uses of those <hi>Circles</hi> amongst themselves, and conjoyned with others, in the resolution of such <hi>Questions</hi> which are ordinarily practised in <hi>Astronomy, Horolographie,</hi> in plaine <hi>Triangles</hi> applyed to <hi>Dimensions, Navigation, Fortification,</hi> &amp;c. as a preparative ground for a more ample worke, and as a declaration of the <hi>admirable,</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> use of this <hi>Ring</hi> in expedition, and facility. But before I come to <hi>Construction,</hi> I have thought it convenient by way introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to examine the truth of the graduation of those <hi>Circles</hi> which may be from the ensuing <hi>Tables</hi> and directions.</p>
