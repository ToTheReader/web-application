   <head>The Translatour's EPISTLE DEDICATORIE to the ENGLISH FATHERS of the Societie of IESVS.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>MOST Vertuous, Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, &amp; Learned MEN</hi>; To whome should I rather addresse this my small labour, then to yourselues, who are partly interessed in the <hi>Person,</hi> whose Worke is here translated, since you are all members of that <hi>Societie,</hi> in
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
which he dyed: partly, in the <hi>Cause</hi> with him, since you haue deuoted yourselues to the propagation of that Religion, for which he dyed? In which Combat no doubt he well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred (though in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sense) those words of a holy Father: <note n="(a)" place="margin">
         <hi>August. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Confess. c.</hi> 5.</note>
      <hi>Moriar, ne moriar.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The Worke, which at this present receaues from me, an English tincture and dye, is in its <hi>Originall</hi> of such worth, that I neede not to marchandize and stall forth the valew of it, seing your owne Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can best censure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For I presume, that di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
of you haue (I will not say, read, but) euen studyed the Booke it self. Only this I will maintayne, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour hath here in discoursing of the supreme Mysteries of the Catholike Fayth, inuested (as it were) and cloathed them in such roabes of speach, as best sorte to their <hi>Reuerence</hi> &amp; <hi>Maiesty</hi>; since a Man is able to glasse in this small Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, the full perfection of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and Oratorie.</p>
   <p>His Vertues, Learning, Christian feruour, and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, I will not here endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to display; for I grant, I am not able to pensill them
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
forth; Who was in his owne time reputed (by his enemies) <hi>euill,</hi> because he was remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>good</hi>; And whose Centrall cogitations were euer fixed vpon the gayning of Soules, for which (as aboue I intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) he dyed the <hi>death of Saints:</hi> Who now ioyeth, in that he then lamented; and laugheth, in that he wept: <note n="(b)" place="margin">
         <hi>Ps.</hi> 125.</note>
      <hi>Qui seminant in lachrimis, in exultatione metent.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now for my more peculiar dedication of this my Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation (besides the reasons aboue sett-downe) my owne respectfull affection towards your <hi>Order</hi> inuiteth me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>
Which affection is not grounded without iust cause. For you are the <hi>Men</hi> (I meane your <hi>Order)</hi> designed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre &amp; re-edifye the decayed Walls of the Cittie of God: you are the <hi>Men,</hi> whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince and charge is not only to re-estate the Catholike Church in such Countries, out of which she in former ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes hath beene vnworthily exiled; but withall (to speake in the <hi>Idiome</hi> of the Prophet) to <note n="(c)" place="margin">
         <hi>Esay. c.</hi> 54.</note>
      <hi>enlarge the place of her Tents, and spreade out the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayns of her habitation, euen amōg the Gentils:</hi> you are the <hi>Men,</hi> whose function in Catholike
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>
Countryes is so to <hi>organize</hi> (as I may say) the Soule of youth, as that it may receaue the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> of Learning and Pietie: you are the <hi>Men,</hi> who doe indoctrinate your Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and followers (howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>resie</hi> and her Attendāts barke to the contrary) in true Allegiance to their Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Soueraignes; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not vndeseruedly was that worthie Souldier, the <hi>old Prince of Parma</hi> (once Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Low-Countryes) accustomed to say, <hi>That for keeping of a Towne in dutie and Loyaltie to the Ciuil Magistrate, he had rather haue it fortifyed
<pb n="9" facs="5"/>
with a Colledge of Iesuits, then with a Garrison of Souldiers; since by the one (sayd he) Obedience is procured chiefly through seruile feare of man, by the other through feare of God, and of their Soule's perdition:</hi> To conclude, you are the <hi>Men,</hi> who not only by <hi>Inherencie,</hi> but euen by <hi>Production,</hi> may be iustly stiled Literate and Vertuous; since you no lesse plant these Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in others, then you enioy them in yourselues. So desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous you are to spreade and fructifie in all worthie and charitable Actions. But what is here your remuneration and Reward? Giue eare vnto the
<pb n="10" facs="6"/>
Prophet, &amp; exult: <note n="[d)" place="margin">
         <hi>Daniel c.</hi> 12.</note>
      <hi>Qui docti fuerint, fulgebunt quasi splendor firmamenti; Et qui ad iustitiam erudiunt multos, quasi stellae in perpetuas aeternitates.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I would not be thought by anie, as if I were perswaded, that besides yourselues, the Church of God were not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with manie others, who most painefully labour in the Vineyard of our Lord, much enriching and cultiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, by their pious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours. No. God forbid, my Affectiō should so farre trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port my Iudgement. For I (euen with ioy) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that there are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="11" facs="6"/>
all countryes of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (and euen among my owne Ranke of Priests in England) manie others, most learned, most zealous, most religious, most laborious in the spirituall good of their Christian Bretheren; &amp; who would be readie to engage their bloud for the Saluation of Soules. For here we must rest assured, that as in the <hi>Celestial,</hi> so in our <hi>terrestrial Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
      <note n="(c)" place="margin">
         <hi>Ioan</hi> 14.</note>
      <hi>Multae mansiones sunt,</hi> there are manie different sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and Professions of men; yet all (though by seuerall wayes and courses) leaueling at one and the same Marke.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="12" facs="7"/>Only this I say (<hi>most Worthie Men</hi>) &amp; this at all times I wil say: The Church of God hath receaued that comfort &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitt by your <hi>Order,</hi> as that Luther and his broode (for <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falshood</hi> euer moue about one and the same <hi>Center</hi> of Religion) had made farre greater incursions through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Europe, had they not beene withstoode and beaten back by Perswading, by Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, by Writing, by Prayer, by exemplarie liues, and by diuers other forcible meanes of Men of your Profession. This then being a veritie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, the lesse is anie one
<pb n="13" facs="7"/>
to marueile, why I doe dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this my small worke to you, since I see, you so pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly dedicate yourselues to God. And thus humbly besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching you to vouchsafe (now and then) your charitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me, in the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of your chiefest Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for the expiating of my maniefold sinnes, I cease euer continuing.</p>
