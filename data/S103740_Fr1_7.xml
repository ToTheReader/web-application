   <head>THE PREFACE TO <hi>Maister Iuell.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS heape of Articles, which you haue layde to gether: Maister Iuell, the greater it ryseth, the lesse is your aduantage. For whereas you require but one sentence for the auouching of any one of them all: the more groweth your number, the more enlarged is the libertie of the answerer. It semeth you haue conceiued a great confidence in the cause, and that your aduersaries (so it liketh you to terme vs whom God hath so stayde with his grace as we can not beare you cōpanie in departing from his catholike churche) haue litle or nothing to saye in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Els what shuld moue you both in your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sermon, and also in your answeres and Replyes to Doctour Cole, to shew such courage, to vse such amplification of wordes, so often and with such ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie, to prouoke vs to encounter, and as it were at the blast of a trumpet, to make your chalenge? What, feared you reproche of dastardnes, if you had called forth no more but one learned mā of all your aduersaries, and therefore to shew your hardynesse, added more weight of wordes to your proclamatiō, and chalenged all the learned men that be a lyue?<note place="margin">In the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mō fol. 46</note>
   </p>
   <p>Among cowardes perhappes it serueth the tourne some tymes, to looke fiercely, to speake terribly, to shake the weapon furiously, to threaten bloudily, no lesse then cutting, hewing and killing but amōg such
<pb facs="10"/> we see many tymes sore frayes foughten, and neuer a blowe geuen. With such bragges of him self, and reproche of all others, Homer the wisest of all poetes setteth forth Thersites, for the fondest man of all the Grecians, that came to Troye. Goliath the giaunt so stoute as he was, made offer to fight but with one Israelite.<note place="margin">1. Reg. 17. Eligite ex vobis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tū, &amp; des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendat ad singulare certamen.</note> Choose out a man amongst you (quoth he) and let him come and fight with me man for man. But you Maister Iuell in this quarell, aske not the combate of one catholike man only, but as one suer of the victory before proufe of fight, cast your gloue as it were, and with straunge defyaunce, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke all learned mē that be a lyue to campe with you.</p>
   <p>Now if this matter shall so fall out, as thouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe appeare euidently on our syde, and the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on youres, that is to witte, if we can not bring one sentence for proufe of any one of all these arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, out of the scriptures, aunciēt councelles, doctours, or example of the primitiue churche: yet wise and graue men, I suppose, would haue lyked you better, if you had meekely and soberly reported the truth. For truth as it is playne and simple, so it needeth not to be set forth with bragge of high wordes. You remember that old saying of the wise, <hi>Simplex verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis oratio.</hi> the vtteraunce of truth ought to be simple.</p>
   <p>But if the victory (loth I am to vse this insolēt word were it not to folow the metaphore which your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge hath dryuen me vnto) fall to our syde, that is to saye, if we shalle be hable to alleage some one sufficient sentēce for proufe of some one of all these articles: yea if we shall be hable to alleage diuerse and
<pb n="2" facs="10"/> sundry sentences places and authorities for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of sundry these articles: In this case I wene, you shall hardly escape amōg sober mē, the reproche of rashnes, among humble men, of presumptiō, among godly men, of wickednes. Of rashnes, for what can be more rashe, then in so weighty matters, as some of these articles import, so boldly to affirme that, the contrary where of may sufficiētly be proued? of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, for what can be more presumptuouse, then in matters by you not thoroughly sene and weighed, to impute ignoraunce and vnablenes to auouche thinges approued and receiued by the churche, to all learned men a lyue? Of wickednes, for what is more wicked, then (the former case standing) so to remoue the hartes of the people from deuotion, so to bring the churche in to contempte, so to set at nought the ordinances of the holy ghost?</p>
   <p>As you folow the new and straunge doctrine of Theodorus Beza and Peter Martyr, the prolocutours of the Caluinian churches in Fraunce, whose scolar a long tyme you haue ben: so you diuerte farre from that prudencie, sobrietie, and modestie, which in their owtward demeanour, they shewed in that solemne and honorable assemble at Poyssi in September 1561. as it appareth by the oration which Beza pronunced there in the name of all the Caluinistes. In which oration with humble and often protestation, they submitte them selues, if cause shall so appeare, to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aduise and iudgement, as thoug they might be deceiued, vttering these and the like wordes in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places. If we be deceiued, we would be gladde to
<pb facs="11"/> know it.] Item, [For the small measure of knowledge that it hath pleased God to impart vnto vs, it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that this transubstantiation, etc.] Item, [if we be not deceiued,] Item, [In case we be deciued, we would be gladde to vnderstād it, etc.] But you Maister Iuell, as though you had readde all that euer hath ben writtē in these pointes, and had borne a waye all that euer-hath ben taught, and were ignorant of nothing tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the same: and none other besyde you had sene ought, and were hable to saye ought: saye meruelouse confidently, and that in the most honorable and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent audience of this Realme, that you are well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that none of your learned aduersaries, no nore all the learned men a lyue, shall euer be hable to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage one sentence for any one of these Articles,<note place="margin">In the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mō fol. 49</note> and that because you know it, therefor you speake it, least happely your hearers shuld be deceiued.</p>
   <p>Likewise in your answere to Doctour Coles first letter, you saye, speaking of these Articles, you thought it best to make your entre in your preaching with such thinges,<note place="margin">Fol 6.</note> as where in you were well assured, we shuld be hable to fynde not so much as any colour or shadow of Doctours at all. Where in you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your self from plainenesse, so much as you doo in your presumptuouse chalenge, from modestie. For being demaunded of D. Cole, why you treate not rather of matters of more importāce, then these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles be of, which yet lye in question betwixt the churche of Rome and the protestantes, as of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christes body and bloud in the Sacrament, of Iustification, of the valew of good workes, of the
<pb n="3" facs="11"/> sacrifice of the Masse, and of such other: not vnwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting how much and how sufficient authoritie maye be brought against your syde for proufe of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctrine there in, least all the world shuld espye your weakenes in these pointes, you answer, that you thought it better to begynne with smaller matters, as these Articles be, because you assure your self, we haue nothing for cōfirmation of them. Thus craftely you shifte your handes of those greater pointes, wherin you know scriptures, councelles, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, and examples of the primitiue churche to be of our syde, and cast vnto vs, as a bone to gnaw vpō, this number of Articles of lesse weight, a fewe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, to occupie vs withall. Which be partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning order, rather then doctrine, and partly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queles of former and cōfessed truthes, rather thē prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall pointes of faith, in th'exact treatie of which, the aunciēt doctours of the churche haue not imployed their studie and trauaile of writing. For many of thē being sequeles depending of a confessed truth, they thought it needelesse to treate of them. For as much as a principall point of truth graunted, the graunting of all the necessarie sequeles is implyed. As in a chayne,<note place="margin">Epist. ad Gregoriū fratrem.</note> (which comparison S. Basile maketh in the like case) he that draweth the first lynk after him, draweth also the last lynke. And for this cause in dede the lesse number and weight of such auncient auctorities may be brought for th'auouching of thē. And yet the thinges in them expressed be not iustly improued by any clause or sentence, you haue sayde or vttered hytherto.</p>
   <pb facs="12"/>
   <p>Verely M. Iuell if you had not bē more desyrouse to deface the catholike churche, then to set forth the truth: you would neuer haue rehearced such a long rolle of articles, which for the more part be of lesse importance: whereby you go about to discredite vs, and to make the world beleue, we haue nothing to shew for vs in a great part of our Religion, and that you be to be taken for zelouse men, right reformers of the churche, and vndoubted restorers of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. As touching the other weighty pointes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reupon almost only your scoolemaisters of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, Suityerland and Geneua, bothe in their preachin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and also in their writinges treate, you will not yet aduenture the triall of them with making your matche with learned men, and in the meane tyme set them forth by sermōs busyly among the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and simple people, vntill such tyme, as you haue wonne your purpose in these smaller matters.</p>
   <p>Thus you seme to folow a sleight, which king Alexander the great vsed, to further the course of his conquestes.<note place="margin">In vita Alexādri Magni.</note> Who as Plutarche writeth, where as he thought verely, that he was begoten of a God, she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him self toward the Barbarians very haute and proude. Yet among the Grekes he vsed a more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, and spake litle of his godhead. For they being rude and of small vnderstanding, he doubted not but by wayes and meanes to bring them to such beleue. But the Grekes, whom he knew to be men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledge and learning, of them he iudged, as it proued in dede, the matter shuld be more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyly skanned, then symply beleued. Right so you
<pb n="4" facs="12"/> M. Iuell persuading your self to haue singular skille in diuinitie, among the simple people you vtter the weighty and high pointes of Christen Religion that be now in question, in such wise, as the protestantes haue written of them, and with vehement affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with misconstrewed and falsefied allegations, and with pitifull exclamations, you leade the seely soules in to dangerouse errours. But in your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, which you knew shuld passe the iudgement of learned men, the pointes of greater importaunce you coouer with silence, and vtter a number of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of lesse weight for the more part in respect of the chiefe, though for good cause receiued and vsed in the churche, (I speake of them as they be rightly taken) denying them all, and requyring the catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes your aduersaries to prooue them. Where in you shew your self not to feare controlment of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but to mistrust the triall of the learned.</p>
   <p>Likewise in the holy Canon of the Masse you fynde faultes, where none are, as it may easely be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, thinking for defence thereof, we had litle to saye. But of the prayer there made to the virgine Mary, the Apostles and martyrs, of the suffrages for the departed in the faith of Christ: in your whole booke you vtter neuer a worde, though you mislike it, and otherwheres speake against it, as all your secte doth. And why? Forsooth because you know right well, we haue store of good authorities for proufe thereof. And by your will, you will not yet stryue with vs in matters, wherein by the iudgement of the people, to whom you lene much, you shuld seme
<pb facs="13"/> ouermatched. And therefore you serch out small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in comparison of the greatest, such as the old doctours haue passed ouer with silence, and for that can not of our part by aunciet authorities be so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply affirmed, at least waye as you thinke your self assured. And in this respecte you laye on lode of blame, contumelies and sclaunders vpon the churche, for mainteining of them. Where in the marke you shoote at, euery man perceiueth what it is euen that when you haue brought the catholike churche in to contempte, and borne the people in hand, we are not hable to proue a number of thinges by you denyed, for lacke of such proufes, as your self shall allow, in certaine particular pointes of small force (which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely you report to be the greatest keys and highest mysteries of our Religion): then triumphing against vs and despysing the auncient and catholike Religiō in general, you may set vp a new Religion of your own forging; a new church of your own framing, a new gospell of your own deuise. Well may I further saye, <hi>cathedram contra cathedram,</hi> but not I trowe, as S. Augustine termeth such state of Religion; <hi>altare contrâ alture.</hi> For what so euer ye set vp, if ye set vp any thing at all, and pull not downe onlye all maner of aulters must nedes be throwen downe.</p>
   <p>Now being sorye to see the catholike churche by your stoute and bolde bragges thus attempted to be defaced, the truth in maner outfaced, and the seely people so dangerously seduced: Imbarred of libertie to preache by Recognisance, and yet not so dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in conscience of dutie apperteyning to my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
<pb n="5" facs="13"/> I haue now thought good to set forth this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise in writing, whereby to my power to saue the honour of the churche, which is our common mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to defend the truth in whose quarell none ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture is to be refused, and to reduce the people from deceite and errour, which by order of charitie we are bownde vnto.</p>
   <p>For the doing here of if you be offended, the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of good and right meaning shal sone ease me of that griefe. Verely myne intent was not to hurt you, but to profite you, by declaring vnto you that truth, which you seme hytherto not to haue knowen. For if you had, I wene you would not haue preached and written, as you haue. Your yeres, your maner of studie, and the partie you haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned your self vnto consydered, it may well be thought you haue not thoroughly sene, how much may be sayde in defence of the catholike doctrine touching these Articles, which you haue denyed.</p>
   <p>For the maner of doing, I am verely persuaded, that neither you, nor any of your felowes, which of all these new sectes by your syde professed, so euer he lyketh best, shall haue iust cause to complaine. The whole treatise is written with out choler, with out gaull, with out spite. What I mislike in you, and in them of your syde, I could not allow in my self. Where truthes cause is treated, humaine affections, where by the cleare light is dymmed, ought to be layd a parte. Glykes, nyppes and scoffes, bittes, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and gyrdes, become not that stage. Yet if I shall perhappes sometymes seme to scarre or lawnce a
<pb facs="14"/> festered bunche, that deserueth to be cut of, you will remember I doubte not, how the meekest and the holyest of the auncient fathers in reprouing hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, oftery m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> haue shewed them selues zelouse, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, eager, seue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>, sharpe and bitter.</p>
   <p>Whose taste so euer lōgeth most after such sawce, in this treatise he shall fynde small lyking. For it is occupyed more about the fortifying of the Articles denyed, then about disprouing of the person, who hath denyed them. Wherein I haue some deale fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the latter parte of Chilo the wise man his counsaile, which I allow better then the first. <hi>Ama, tanquam osurus, oderis, tanquam amaturus.</hi> loue, as to hate, hate, as to loue.</p>
   <p>If any man that shall reade this, be of that humour, as shall mislike it, as being colde, lowe, flatte and dull, and requyre rather such verder of writing, as is hote, lofty, sharp and quycke, which pleaseth best the tast of our tyme: vnderstand he, that before I intended to put this forth in printe, I thus tempered my stile for these consyderations. First, where as a certaine exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of a learned man of fiue or six sheetes of paper spredde abroade in the Realme in defence of some of these Articles by M. Iuell denyed, was fathered vpon me, which in dede I neuer made sentence of, and therefore a storme imminent was mystrusted: that by chaunging the hew, which many know me by, that know me familiarly, in case it shuld come to the handes of many, as it was likely, I myght escape the danger of being charged with it, and neuer the lesse satisfye my frendes request, and in some parte
<pb n="6" facs="14"/> also my conscience, and doo good. Secondly, that I thought meeke, sober and cold demeanour of writing to be most sitting for such kynde of argument.</p>
   <p>Thirdly and specially that my hart serued me not to deale with M. Iuell myne old acquainted, felow and countreyman other wise, then swetly, gentilly and courteouslye. And in dede here I protest, that I loue M. Iuell, and detest his heresies.</p>
   <p>And now Syr, as I loue you, right so I am desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse of your soule helth, which you seme either to forgete, or to {pro}cure by a wrong waye. Bethinke your self I praye you, whether the waye you walke in, be not the same, and you the man, that Salomon moued with the spirite of God, speaketh of. There is a waye,<note place="margin">Prouer. 26</note> that semeth to a man right, and the ende of it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to damnation. Certaine it is, you are deceiued, and maineteine vntruth, as it shall appeare by this treatise. Here in you susteine the euill of humaine infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. Mary, when deceite is by plaine truth detected, then to dwell and continewe in errour, that proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not of humaine weakenes, but of deuilish ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie. But you M. Iuell as many men thinke, and I trust, are not yet swallowed vp of that gulfe. Fayne would I doo you good, if I wist how. I feare me your sore is putrifyed so farre, as oyle and lenitiues wil not serue now, but rather vinegre and corosiues. You remember I doubte not, what Cicero sayth. that medicine to profite most, which causeth the greatest smarte, And what Salomon also,<note place="margin">Prouer. 27</note> The woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of à frend, to be better then the kisses of an enemie.</p>
   <pb facs="15"/>
   <p>The best salue any man can minister vnto you, verely I thinke, is, to exhorte you to humilitie, and to denying of your selfe. For if you could be brought to humble your selfe, and to denye your selfe, doubtles you shuld see in your selfe, that you see not. If you were humble, you would not be so pufte vp, and swell against your mother the churche, you would not contemne her, whom you ought to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.<note place="margin">Genes. 9.</note> You would not reioyse like the accursed Cham, to shew her vnsemelynesse, if by corruption of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, any perhappes be growen. For by auctoritie and publike consent, saye what ye will, none is maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined. If you would denye your self, to be the man you be not, you shuld better see, who and what you be in dede. Denye your self to be so well learned, as you seme to esteme your selfe, and you will be a shamed to make such straunge crakes and vauntes of your being wel assured of that you haue preached and written touching these Articles, where in you are deceiued. Denye your selfe to be a bishop, though you haue put on the bishop of Salesbury his white Rochet, and you shall be content and thinke it meet also, to geue a rekening of the doctrine which you preache openly before the high estates, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conferre with D. Cole, and with meaner men also,<note place="margin">In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynning of the first ansvver to D. Cole</note> which more insolently, then reasonably, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to doo. And by such conference, you shall be aduertised of your errour. Denye your priuate iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement and estimation of your long studie in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which you acknowledge in your replyes, and of your great cunning in the same, and you shal eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="7" facs="15"/> see and remember, that your tyme hath ben most bestowed in the studie of humanitie and of the latine tonge, and concerning diuinitie, your most labour hath ben imployed to fynde matter against the churche, rather then about seriouse and exacte discussing of the truth: and that in cōparison of that holy and learned father B. Fissher and others, whom you geste and scoffe at,<note place="margin">In the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mō fol. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
