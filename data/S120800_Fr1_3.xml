   <head>Iohn Francis Petit to the <hi>cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Olibius</hi> a Greeke writer (courteous reader) saith, that such as thinke a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat historie sufficient for the knowledge of the generall, doe no lesse (in his opinion) erre from the truth, than he which seeing the members of a goodly creature diuided, doth thereby iudge of his perfection: but if you take these distinct and diuided parts, and make it a perfect creature, giuing it life and forme, and then shew it him againe, without doubt he will confesse his own errour, and say he was like vnto them that dream. True it is, we may haue an apprehension of the whole by the parts, but it is impossible to haue any certein knowledge. For my part, I do herein concurre with <hi>Polibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi> and say moreouer, that he which thinkes to vnderstand perfectly the moderne storie of any countrie or state, without knowledge of the auncient, drawne from the spring, manners, and gestes of their auncestors, whose actions he pretends to write, is like vnto him, that saies hee knowes a man, for that he hath seene him, or heard him speake, and yet cannot say of whence he is, what his parents were, nor from whence he is descended: euen so, whosoeuer reads the historie of any nation, without knowledge of their beginning, can neuer be fully satisfied, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath not laid a true foundation vpon antiquitie; for by the comparison and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of auncient deeds with the moderne, and conferring one with another, it is impossible but they should find out the truth, and reap a singular content and profit by the historie. So it fals out with me, who, for my owne delight, and to auoid idlenesse, hauing (in the heat of our warres, and other domesticke imployments) vndertaken to write the historie of these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, I did thinke I could not be well satisfied with the knowledge of la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>e accidents which haue happened since my time, for these sixtie years (whereof I haue learned something from my deceased parents, and haue beene my selfe an eie witnesse, for these fourtie yeares; and as the Poet saith, <q>
         <hi>Quaeque ipsa miserrima vidi, &amp; quorum pars magna fui:</hi>
      </q>
   </p>
   <q>
      <l>Which miseries I wretch did see,</l>
      <l>And bore a share in each degree)</l>
   </q>
   <p>if I had not endeauoured to recouer what I could of the antiquitie of the said prouinces, both out of their owne ancient chronicles, and from their neighbours. If I haue herein vsed a ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>sh style, it is no wonder▪ hauing not therein laboured to please the French, whose eares are something delicate; but remembring the manlinesse of the nation to whom I write, I haue left this womanish nicenesse, seeking only those things which are proper and profitable for the storie. And in these latter times, I haue beene forced in many things to follow the rough style of them of Arthois, Henaut, and of the court at Brussels, in many declarations which I haue beene forced to insert, although they differ much from the manner of French writers. Who so writes a historie should not (labouring to adorne his style) alwaies striue to mooue mens affections: neither is it fit to pursue with a continued style the miseries of the time, by inuectiues or otherwise, the which is more proper for tragicall Poets; but he must make a true relation of mens words and actions: for a historie and a tragedie haue contrarie ends. In a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie (if the truth be not apparant) wee must striue to mooue the auditors, to hope, feare, care, anger, ioy, and such like passions, by coniectures: but in historie, wee must endeauour by all meanes to relate sincerely whatsoeuer we will write of men, and of their actions; for conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures may serue the one, to entertaine and abuse the audience; and truth the other, for the readers instruction and profit. I must confesse it is a commendable thing in an honest man, to
<pb facs="4"/>
affect his friends and his countrey, and to hate their enemies; but he that vndertakes to write a historie, must moderate those passions with discretion, sometimes commending his enemies when their deeds deserue it, and blaming his friends and neighbours when their faults doe merit it, least he be reproached with <hi>Paulus Iouius,</hi> of whom it is written:</p>
   <q>
      <l>
         <hi>Dum patriam laudat, damnat dum Iouius hostes,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Nec malus est Ciuis, nec bonns Historicus.</hi>
      </l>
   </q>
   <q>
      <l>
         <hi>Iouius</hi> in praising Italie, and baiting of her foes,</l>
      <l>Against the lawes of historie (though not of dutie) goes.</l>
   </q>
   <p>Beleeue me, as the bodie of any creature (when the eies are out) is vnprofitable, euen so, if truth wants in a historie, the discourse is fruitlesse: and therefore, when occasion is offered, they must not forbeare to blame their friends, nor to commend their enemies, neither yet thinke it light or dishonest to praise them (vpon good occasion) whom in some places they haue iustly blamed; for it is not credible, that they of whom we write haue alwaies done well, nor continually erred; wee must therefore in our censures iudge grauely and vprightly of mens actions, seeing that truth is the life and soule of a historie, without the which (how goodly a glosse soeuer it carries) it is but a fable. To comprehend then the moderne with the auncient they shall find here (not that I will put antiquitie out of question, beeing impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) for the better vnderstanding of the historie of these prouinces, a particular deduction, wherein we intreat of all things (as farre as we could recouer) that haue past in the said pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, whereby they shall receiue a great contentment, comparing the auncient with the moderne times. I haue begunne with the first institution of the earles of Holland, by king <hi>Charles</hi> the bald, where wee will set downe orderly the genealogie and acts of the said earles, since <hi>Thierry</hi> or <hi>Theodoric</hi> of Aquitaine, the first earle, instituted in the yeare 863, vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> of Henaut; the race of which <hi>Thierry</hi> hauing successiuely continued from father to sonne, for the space of 563 yeares, ending with <hi>Iohn</hi> of Holland, the twentieth earle, sonne to that <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> who was slaine by <hi>Gerard van Velsen:</hi> to which <hi>Iohn</hi> of Holland, dying without issue, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the said <hi>Iohn</hi> earle of Henaut his cousin, sonne to <hi>Alix,</hi> sister to <hi>William</hi> king of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, great aunt to the said <hi>Iohn</hi> of Holland, who died in the yeare, 1300.</p>
   <p>And from the said <hi>Iohn</hi> of Henaut vnto cont <hi>William</hi> of Bauaria, the fift of that name, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the franticke, sonne to the emperour <hi>Lewis</hi> of Bauaria, and to <hi>Marguerite</hi> of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naut, sister to <hi>William</hi> the fourth, who died without children; which house of Henaut ending in the said <hi>Marguerite,</hi> it fell to that of Bauaria, and had but foure heads; all which together, ruled the said countries of Holland, Zeeland, and Henant, but fiftie and one yeares. In which familie of Bauaria (comprehending the said <hi>William</hi> the franticke, and the countesse <hi>Iacoba</hi> or <hi>Iaquelyne</hi> who died also without children) there were fiue heads, which gouerned in all 82 yeares, vnto <hi>Philip</hi> (called the good) duke of Burgoignie, cousin to the said <hi>Iaquelyne;</hi> whose gouernment, with duke <hi>Charles</hi> the warlike his sonne, and that of <hi>Marie</hi> daughter to <hi>Charles,</hi> wife to <hi>Maximilian</hi> archduke of Austria, continued but fortie fiue yeares. After which, that of the said <hi>Maximilian</hi> then emperour (as father and guardian to <hi>Philip</hi> of Austria his sonne) of the said <hi>Philip</hi> hauing maried <hi>Iane</hi> Queene of Castile, of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift emperour, and of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> king of Spaine last deceased, vnto the yeare 1582, when as <hi>Philip</hi> (for the causes specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this historie) was declared by the generall Estates of the vnited prouinces, to be fallen from the soueraigntie and gouernment of the said earledomes and countries of the vnion, are ninetie three yeares: and since the said yeare 1582, vnto this yeare 1608 (Arthois, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naut, and other prouinces, beeing voluntarily fallen from the generall vnion) the said prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Holland, Zeeland, and others, haue gouerned vnder the authoritie of the said generall Estates and the priuat gouernments (hauing vnited vnto them Gueldres, Zutphen, Vtrecht, &amp;c.) of <hi>William</hi> of Nassau prince of Orange, &amp;c. and of prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his sonne. All which worke, we haue proportionably diuided into sixteene bookes, and continued it vnto these times, as you may see by the course of the historie; from out of which (besides the contentment thereof) the reader may gather good instructions, as well for matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and gouernment, as for exploits of warre, and most necessarie for all sorts of men to know at this present time, especially for such men as are imployed in the managing
<pb facs="4"/>
of any of these three estates: For seeing that men do iudge of al things, either by rules and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which are taught in schooles, or by examples and presidents, which hystories do furnish, precepts without examples making no deepe impression, nor mouing the affections, it shall be alwayes good, yea and verie necessarie, to confer (in the managing of affaires) the examples of things past with the present time, that we may learne by others, what wee are to do, or not to do, to imbrace or auoid in the whole course of our liues. For as the poet saith,</p>
   <q>
      <l>Happie is he that learnes to gather wit</l>
      <l>By others harme, yet neuer feeleth it.</l>
   </q>
   <p>For this consideration a hystorie was called by the antients, The testimonie of time, the light of truth, and the mistresse and myrrour of mans life; for that in the person of another, shee giues instructions to all those that will vuderstand how to gouerne themselues well. They are well worthy of commendation, which haue endeuoured to register the memorable acts of time, and to impart them to posteritie. And although that this age hath much restrained the libertie of writing, which did shine in the antient Chroniclers, <hi>Froisart, Monstrelet, Comines,</hi> &amp;c. yet will I neuer abandon my selfe to flatterie, nor feare (two plagues in a hystorie, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the mind) but will make my discourse free and true. I must confesse, that in some actions which are to be blamed, I giue my censure, as in like maner I spare not to commend those actions, whereas vertue, religion, and valour, do shine: but in matters which are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, I suspend my iudgement, rather than to ingage my selfe among so many difficulties, for there must needs be a confusion; whereas passion rules. Truth is my North star (and yet it may be, that some now liuing, and posteritie hereafter, will not giue credit to some things which we write, the which in another age (better I hope than ours) will be held too cruell, barbarous and inhumane; the which notwithstanding were most true, yea more execrable and abhominable than we haue described them: desiring rather to moderat with modestie, than to aggrauat any thing. In the progresse of this hystorie, I do not follow the Dutch Chronicle, the difference of the stile, and the maner of writing French in matter of hystorie (disagreeing much from the Dutch) will not allow it: besides, there are so many idle and ridiculous things in it, more like the <hi>Romant of the Rose,</hi> or the <hi>Legend of Lyes,</hi> than a true hystorie, as I haue purposely omitted them, and as I heare they are rased out of the last impression of the antient Dutch Chronicle. And whereas they shall find the deeds of so many braue old warriours, earls of Holland, with other noblemen, and knights, so barely related, in regard of those at this day, and as the modern French writers describe them; they must not accuse our diligence, who haue searcht for them as curiously as we could; but the negligence &amp; ignorance of antient writers, who haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselues idle, and too too carelesse: or else the iniurie of the time which hath supprest them; or it may be the wars, which haue wasted and consumed them. And for that in these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, since the emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the 5 there haue beene so many writers of diuers religions, euerie one writing according to his passion, or according to the affection which hee bare to them of his religion, I haue endeuored to hold a meane. I will not say, but such as are most pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionat, may sometimes discouer what religion I hold most pure (for I neither can nor ought to denie it before men, no more than before God) yet hath it not (in matter of truth) made me to incline more to one part than to another, to publish or suppresse the vertues and vices, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and disgrace of one or other. And for that the ground of our ciuill wars is written too partially (or rather inuectiuely) by some; as by <hi>Surius</hi> the Chartrous monke, by <hi>Ersingerus, vander Haec, Iansonius Documensus,</hi> &amp; others, built vpon a meer accusation of rebellion and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the king of Spaine, and his edicts, touching matters of religion, and the Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as those words of rebellion and disobedience comprehend much in them, and haue a large interpretation. But the better to informe posteritie, who (it may be) will not be so partiall, as to interpret all things past, to rebellion and disobedience, as these partiall men haue done. I haue bin very large in the description of the originall and first spring, together with the causes and motiues of our troubles, and of the wars which haue followed against the Spaniards, and their adherents, by the insertion of many declarations, which I haue thought very necessarie for this subiect, for the explaining thereof. I haue also of purpose extended my selfe (to serue for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and direction to posteritie) in the description of the most remarkable sieges of towns of either part, as of Harlem, Leyden, Alcmar, Hulst, and Bomel, by the Spaniards; of Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, Gheertruydenbergh, Steenwic, Groningue, and others, by the Estates: in which sieges

I would also intreat the courteous Reader, not to stumble, nor take exception at the tearmes of <hi>Roman Catholikes</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> which I vse, speaking of the one or the other: Persuading my selfe, that the Catholikes wil not except against this epithete <hi>Roman:</hi> as also they of the Religion (who pretend it to be reformed) will not reiect the name o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      <hi>Protestants,</hi> seeing they not onely pretend it to be reformed, but protest and maintaine with all vehemencie, that it is so, be they of the confession of Ausbourg, or others, howsoeuer they will call them, be they Luthe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
