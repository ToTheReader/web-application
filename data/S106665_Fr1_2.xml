   <head>❧To the right honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my very good Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, Earle of Warwike, Baron Lisle, of the most noble order of the Garter, Knight, general of the Q.

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen as I conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (right honorable) how many godly, and notable workes, had ben set forth by excellent lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, to the great vtility, and profite of such as should with an vpright iudgement studiously reade them: I determined with my selfe, and thought it sufficient for discharge of my cōscience, if I wholy imployed that sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple talent committed vnto me, in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the word, (though simply, yet sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely) according to that function, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I am called. And so it came to passe by the good prouidence of God, that on wednesday, being the 17. day of this
<pb facs="3"/>
moneth of Ianuary. I preached at Blād<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Forum, in the Countie of Dorset, at the Session holden there, where both the honorable, and many of the worshipfull, which harde me, tooke my simple trauels in very good part, as both then, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence I haue well perceiued. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, sundry, not onely of the multitude, but some of higher calling so much misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked my sayd Sermon, that they thought I spake somwhat more then became me, but yet I prayse God that those which take the matter most greuously, are but potte companions, who thinke that I haue done them an exceeding great miu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for that I opened to the Magistrates, how shamefully the Saboth day (which God would haue to be kept holy) was prophaned with druncken and vngodly reueling, and all kinde of iniquitie, in so much that some are cast, (I know not how,) into such a heate therewith, that it seemeth, they want but the chaynge and turne of tyme, to put me in a greater heat then they themselues would be in wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, who also by their sinistrall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes of my Sermon, would very faine cause others which heard me not, to be of their owne corrupt, and peruerse iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. I haue therefore thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<pb facs="3"/>
and not without aduise &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faile, to call to my remembraunce my sayd Sermon, and to commit the same to writing (and to the iudgements of the godly) wherin I haue vsed such diligēce if I be not much deceaued, that such as heard it shal finde not very many things added, but yet lesse left out or omitted, certenly, to my knowledge not one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
   <p>And now (right honorable) if I should follow that laudable custome of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which commonly do dedicate their works to such personages as they thinke to be most worthy, and to such as be of honour, or worship, beyng desirous to further vertue, and the sincere religiō of Iesus Christ, with the fauourers of the same: To whom should I dedicate these my poore simple trauels but to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who being not onely my especiall good maister and Lorde, as full oft I haue felte, but also vnder God and the Queenes Maiestie, one of my chiefe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectours and defenders agaynst all such as would offer me iniury?</p>
   <p>And although I should laye a part all those respectes, yet (my case standing as it doth) I know not to whome by better right I should dedicate this my Sermon
<pb facs="4"/>
then to your honour, who among many other, both honorable and worshipfull cā witnes with me, that for the tyme I was with you in Newhauen the minister and preacher there, and also this last yeare with you in the North partes, one of the preachers of the Queenes Maiesties ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, I vsed at both places, when occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was offered to speake plainely before your honor and the rest, and yet not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting I trust, before whome I spake, yea and when I sawe that great necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie so required, and that duetie draue me thereto, I practised (your honour well knoweth) a certeyne kind of discipline, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon those, that by birth and paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage were farre aboue me. I do willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and of set purpose put your honour in mynde of these thinges (which otherwise might full well haue bene buried in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion) to the entent, that when such as so stomake me for telling truth, shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that as well your honour, as a great many of other, men of high calling in this common welth, Gentlemen and Captaynes of great worshippe, actiuitie, courage, &amp; valiantnes, besides the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of common Souldiers, were not onely well pleased with my plaine speach among thē, in preaching against abuses,
<pb facs="4"/>
but also willing to redresse the same, and to shew them very honorable, &amp; worship full towardes me both in word &amp; deede, for my plainenes with them: It may be that these men (by such a president before their eyes) will somewhat qualifie and content thēselues forasmuch as betwene such as I haue named, and them, (if the question be for worship, office or digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) I see not well how there may be any comparison. Our heauenly father pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue your honour with all yours, and graunt you the continuaunce of his loue and fauour.</p>
