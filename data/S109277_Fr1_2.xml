   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, TRVELIE NOBLE, MAGNANIMOVS, AND worthy Lord, Sir DONALD MACKAYE, of STRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEVER Knight, Lord Colonell, &amp;c.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Have (reposing in your Lordships in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous nature) assumed the audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for two respects, to present these my Neophiticall labours vnto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. The first reason moving me so to doe, is this: Each generous minde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes your Lordship to be well affected towards every act or aime (being vertuous) of whatsoever qualitie. The which report hath much imboldned mee (though meanly acquainted) to offer out of the indigencie of my illiterate skull, this litle mite, assuredly expecting (that since it proceeds of a loving &amp; liberal mind, that your L. will accept thereof (though it be not of such value) even as well as of theirs (who out of the abundant riches of their prudent and learned experiences) doe vsually throw moe talents into the The saurie of your Lordships praeexcellent and admired worth. The second reason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing me, is this, That in regard this my Poeticall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordium, is the first perspicuous invention of my stirile braine: and therefore consequently fearing the insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie
<pb facs="3"/>
thereof, I esteemed it my best to make choyce of your Lordship, as my worthy <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> whose gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and great respect, is of sufficient power to palliate all the infirmities of this Pamphlet, yea and to shrowd the very same from the impetuous obloquie, and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous scandall, of the most calumnious carper, or Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke Inveigher. Therefore since for your Lordship I did it, and to your Lordship I direct it: then good my Lord vouchsafe to patronize it. By which means I shall prove fortunate in my attempt, &amp; your Lordship (as you are of every worthy one already, much respected) shal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of me be more &amp; more reverenced, &amp; intirely &amp; infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly affected, as I have special reason, being tyed many wayes thereto by dutie-bound obligation: of the which I esteem this last none of the least, and shall perpetually acknowledge it so to be, wishing your Lordship (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall of the same vndeserved benefite) the perfect frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each terrestriall happinesse here, and immortall felicitie hence, vowing likewise solemnly (during life) to continue,</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your Lordships dutie-bound and obsequious servant, whom your Lordship may absolutey dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of,
Iohn Kennedie.</signed>
