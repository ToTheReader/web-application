                 <title>A new handling of the planisphere : diuided into three sections. In the first is a plaine and sensible explication of the circles of the sphere, and such termes as appertaine vnto the doctrine de primo mobili ... The second sheweth how vpon any plaine ... hauing one circl diuided into degrees, and crossed vvith tvvo diameters at right angles, most conclusions of the astrolabe may for all latitudes or countries be readily and exactly performed onely vvith ruler and compasses. In the third, being a supplement organicall, is contained the making of certaine easie instruments for the perfecter working the former conclusions, as to know what degrees and minutes be in any circumference giuen ... Pleasant and profitable generally for all men, but especially such as vvould get handines in vsing the ruler and compasse ... vvithout being at the charge of costly instruments. Inuented for the most part, and first published in English by Thomas Olyuer</title>

   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVL SIR IOHN PETER KNIGHT, at Thornedon in Essex.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>Nowing well (right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) after the dispatch of much weighty busines, which for the good of others you willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vndertake, and, by report of the shire, with very great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and all vprightnes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, that as it were for your recreation, you perused often bookes of Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie: some while since I sent the manner how three or foure problemes Geographicall might bee wrought vpon a plaine with Ruler and Compasse only. At my leisure afterward taking that subiect in hand againe, I followed it so farre, that I deuised af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the like way to handle most conclusions of the Astrolabe, or problems Astronomicall concerning the <hi>Primum mobile.</hi> When I had almost brought my purpose to effect, it was my chaunce to light vpon <hi>Clauius</hi> his Astrolabe, where I found as much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and performed euen by <hi>Ptolomeis Analomma,</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>the very modell of <hi>Iohannes de Roias</hi> his Planisphere, as learned <hi>Guidus Vbaldus</hi> hath fully proued, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the ground vpon which I haue framed much of my worke. Notwithstanding, perceiuing (as by comparison euery one may see) that except the 5. and 28. taken out of <hi>Manrolycus,</hi> the 14. and 23. out of <hi>Commandine</hi> and <hi>Vbaldus,</hi> my constructions were very farre differing from <hi>Clauius,</hi> amending those defects which <hi>Gemma</hi> noteth in <hi>Roias</hi> his worke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides taking the matter to be commodious, and not vnpleasant for trauellers, and all such in generall as delight in Astronomicall and Geographicall deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, I set light the reproachfull name of an English Scribler, and tooke courage by publishing it to the view of the world, to hazard my selfe to euery rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders censuring. Vpon this resolution I am bold to vse your Worships name in the front of this booke, testifying therby the earnest and vnfained affection which I beare, and long haue borne both to you and yours: in regard whereof making no doubt, but that this little mite shall be gently accepted, with remembrance of my dutie to your Worship I take my leaue. S. <hi>Edmunds Bury</hi> in Suffolke, 6. Ian. 1600. after our English accompt.</p>
