too shewe the gentle reader what way he may safely take, too

faith of the weaklings, whom Gods woord willeth to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with all myldnesse and modestie, and for whose releefe

written. Wherfore keeping as euen a hand as I can, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

of the Gospell may take occasion too slaunder the doctrine,

from it, or the perfect sort, occasion to find iust fault with me:
I will no longer trubble your grace with delayes, but (by Gods
leaue) proceedeforthwith too the matter.</p>
   <p>The substance and ground of this Epistle to the Ephesians
is this: That beyng once throughly instructed and rooted in
the fayth of Iesus Christ, wee must (for full confirmation and
stablishment of our consciences in the louing kyndnesse and
fauour of our God, ageinst all assaultes and temptations both
of body and soule,) stye vp in mynd aboue the world and all
worldly things, too the beginninglesse loue of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through

<pb facs="3"/>
onely begotten sonne, before the foundations of the world
were layd, freely of his owne mercy, without respect of any
desert, worke, or worthinesse of our owne: In consideration
wherof,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 20.</note> it is our dewtie on the other syde, too glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="3 letters">

acceptable obedience, togither with the fayth from whence
the same springeth, is bred and brought foorth by the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
woorking of Gods holy spirit in our myndes, for Iesus

   <p>This doctrine then belongeth not at all too the carelesse

which is grounded altogither vppon the Canonicall

with the doctrine of Election and Predestination without
guyde: &amp; such may haue neede of exhortation, admonition,

which alwayes followeth, and oftentimes ouertaketh euē the
strongest, but not of instruction, otherwise than by the woord

borne infantes in Christ, whether it bee in respect of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>yme, or
in respect of knowledge, or in respect of both: forasmuch as
this doctrine is of such nature as it cannot bee learned by any
preceptes or perswasions of wisdome, vntill the kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>wledge
and loue of God in Iesus Christ, be first well felt and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
digested by fayth in the bowels of mens hartes: they haue
neede too bee both cherished and trayned foorth by degrees,
and as it were by parcelmeale, too the right conceyuing and
vnderstanding of so great a mysterie. For although Gods free
Election and Predestination, according too the purpose of his
owne good will, euen before all time, bee in very deede the
first cause and onely originall welspring of our saluation or
endlesse welfare, and of all the things that further or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
the same: yit is it not the first poynt in doctrine wherby
too bring men to saluation, nor the first Loadestarre that men
must looke at, as soone as they bee entered intoo the way of
saluation. Which thing appeereth sufficiently by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
order of teaching vsed throughout the whole holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where both the Prophets and Apostles and Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,<note place="margin">Hebr. 6. 1. 2.</note>
doo alwayes begin the ministration of saluation at the
preaching of repentance, and so proceeding too fayth and free
forgiuenesse of sinnes, too newnesse of lyfe, and the right vse
of Sacramentes, too the rizing agein of the dead, and the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
iudgment: doo finally deliuer foorth the doctrine of
Election and Predestination as a sheeld ageinst all assaultes, to
make me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> perseuer and hold out to the end in the way of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
through all aduersities, tormentes, and temptations,
as shall appeare more plainly hereafter. This doctrine then
is (as yee would say) the roofe of Christianirie, which beyng
orderly, substancially, and workemanly reered vppon the rest
of the building, is as a couering and safegard too the whole,
defending it frō all iniuries &amp; anoyances of wynd &amp; weather,
and giuing it continuance with perpetuitie: so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
is added afterward, may well make too the adorning
and beautifying of it, but not to the safetie and strength of it▪
And therefore if it bee set vppon a false or ouerfeeble founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,


<pb facs="5"/>
or while the building is yit greene and vnperfected, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the stones bee well clozed, settled and dry: the weyght of
it beareth downe the whole house to the ground, to the great
losse, and (but if the more grace of God bee) too the vtter and
vnrecouerable vndoyng, both of the buylder and of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
   <p>What then, will some man say? Is it not too bee taught? Is
it not to bee learned? Yis verily: and that with all earnestnesse
and indeuer of mynd: howbeeit, not at al aduenture, not in
haste, not rashly, not presumptuously: but with singular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection,
reuerence, warenesse and humilitie, as al the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
haue vsed to doo: least whyle wee take vppon vs too swim
without a bladder, before wee haue learned too beare our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
vppon the water, wee bee caryed away with the violence
of the streame, or sink for fayntnesse ere wee can recouer too
land agein: or least (which worse is) whyle wee bee ouercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in medling with the secretes of Gods Maiestie, wee bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed
of his glory. How then may wee wade safely in
it too our benefite? Euen by seeking of our selues in Iesus
Christ. Let vs see if wee can fynd our selues there. For the
scripture assureth vs,<note place="margin">Actes. 4. 12</note> that there is no saluation but onely in
Christ Iesus, nor no damnation to them that are in him. Now
therefore,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> like as too knowe the originall cause of our death
and damnation, wee must not raundge beyond the fall of our
first father Adam,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> bycause that by him sinne entered into the
world, and by sinne, death: so to fynd our recouerie and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
wee must not seeke elswhere than in Iesus Christ, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is ordeyned to bee the onely propitiation and attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for our sinnes,<note place="margin">Iohn. 2. 2. &amp;. 4. 10.</note> and there is not any other name, (that is

than the onely name of Iesus. For he is the way,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14. 6.</note> the

(as sayeth Saint Iohn) he that hath not the sonne,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2. 23. &amp; 5. 12.</note> hath not the
father,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 12.</note> and he that hath not the father, is a straunger too the
couenauntes and promises of saluation, without hope and
without God in the world, and so consequently in stead of the
substance he ketcheth but a shadowe or a dreame or rather
nothing at all. Nay rather he ketcheth euerlasting damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
according to this saying:<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 28. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

damnation) that wheras light is come into the world, (which
lyght is Christ) men haue loued darknesse better than lyght:
that is to say, they haue loued the blynd imaginations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions
of their owne ignorant mynds, better than the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

sayings, and of a number mo tending to the same purpose, the
pith and effect is this, consisting of two members: Namely,
that such as are rightly and vnfeynedly in Christ, haue vtterly
renounced their owne wit, will, wisdome, strength, reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

only taketh no comfort in the doctrine of Gods eternall elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

wee must hold fast the foundation too the ende, which

obedience and ryghtuousnesse of Christ. And therewithall,
vppon assured trust of his strength and assistance, wee must
fyght manfully ageinst our owne lustes, and ageinst all maner
of temptations and crosses, with the weapons of Gods word,
continuall and hartie repentance, feruent prayer, often fasting,

so hateth he the deceytfull man.<note place="margin">Psal. 5. 6.</note> So then, wee must nother
finne wilfully and presumptuously, nor despayre and shrinke

lyke as wee must continually pray God to keepe vs from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous

myght the eazlyer conceyue, and the better vnderstand and
