   <head>¶ The Printer to the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>HEre hast thou (gentle Reader) the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of Iohn Walsh of Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery in Dosetshiere, touching Sorcerie and Witchcraft, which he learned (as hereafter is shewed) of a certayne Priest named syr Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert of Dreiton. Wherein thou mayest see the fruites of Papistes and papistrye, and their yll exercises of their ydle lyues, which hath bene no small hurt to all common weales. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not onely the simple people haue bene falsly seduced and superstitiously lead: but all estates haue beene sore greeued and troubled by these their practises of Sorcery and Witchcraft.</p>
   <p>It would be to tedious to shew but a few hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of their diuelish practises, and to to hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible factes in murthers and other mischiefes: which not onely the fat belly fed Moonkes, flat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tering Friers, and idle lusty Priestes practised and vsed: but also the holy fathers them selues Popes, Cardinals, and Bishops were chiefly and wholye geuen to the studye and exercise of these most wicked and diuelish sciences, and by these meanes did worke to come to the Papall seate, hie dignities, and great wealth. Which was (as the histories declare) wyth the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and poysoning priuely one of anothrr.</p>
   <p>As first Pope Alexander the sixt, hauing so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietis
<pb facs="3"/>
with wicked Sprites and Diuels, gaue hymselfe body and soule vnto them, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion he might attaine to the Popes seate, and dignity: which they promised him and fulfilled, but he enioyed it not long, contrarie to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. For he being priuely conueyed into a chamber in a certain place called Mount <hi>Cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and ther questioning with his Demon how long hee shoulde raygne Pope, was aunswered that he should raigne. xi. and. viij. which this ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly father vnderstood to be so many yeares: but he was deceiued. For after he had raigned Pope xi. yeares and. viii. monethes, this Diuel would <unclear>no</unclear> lenger be without hys praye, but strayght came to the Popes court deckt like a Courtier, and at the Popes chamber doore dyd knock ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry loudlye, saying that he must needes speake with his Fatherhood. The doore being opened, he came and spake with the Pope, al others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bid to auoyde. But they were so earnestlye talking together, that many did rightly confect that they were at contention. For the Pope stoutlye affirmed his time not to be expired. For (sayd he) I had promised me. xix. yeares (for. xi. and. viij. is. xix.) and of these. xix. yeares, I haue raygned but. xi. yeares and. viij. monethes. But this courtierlike Deuil replied and sayd, that <unclear>he</unclear> mistooke his wordes, for I sayd not (sayde he) xix. yeares, but I ment. xi. yeares and. viij. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes, and therefore nowe thou must needes
<pb facs="3"/>
dye. Whereat the Pope being abashed, fall to entreating, but all was in vayne. For assoone as this Deuil was gon, the soule of this Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted miserably from his body wyth horrible cryes, fearefull groninges, and deadly beway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges. In this sort dyed this horrible Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer (as sayeth <hi>Hieronimus Marius</hi> in his worke intituled <hi>Eusebius Captiuus.</hi>) In which worke the history of this wicked Pope Alexander is ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry lyuely set foorth, both as touching his wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked lyuing and horrible factes. Whose terrible ende may be an example to all Sorcerers, Cun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iurers, and Witches.</p>
   <p>Like vnto hym was Pope Gregory the. vij. otherwyse called Hellybrand (Hildebrande I should say) who was also a great Sorcerer and Nigromancer, as <hi>Benno</hi> the Cardinal doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in his worke of this Gregories life. Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he also had a Familiar sprite, whereby he wrought manye mischiefes in the common weale of Rome, as well for the satisfieng of his fleshly and beastlye lust, as also for to encrease hys ryches and dignitie.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Platina</hi> also writeth the lyke of Pope Iohn. 8. Pope Siluester, Pope Bennet. 8. with dyuers others, which were better practised in those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish sciences, then in godly diuinitie.</p>
   <p>Much like to these was Pope Paul the third, who as <hi>Sleidan</hi> declareth, exercised sorcerye and Witchcraft, and therby committed. ij. horrible
<pb facs="4"/>
murthers, and poysoned his Moother and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uew, that he might enioye hys inheritaunce the sooner. He poysoned also his own Sisters hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that he more freelyer might haue her at hys wycked commaundement.</p>
   <p>Pope Clement the. 8. was also of this Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitis, as in the Comentaries vpon the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Doctors of Paris is declared: where hys style is thus set foorth: that he was a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard, Empoysoner, Homicide, Bawd, Symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacke, Sodomite, Periurer, Whooremaister, Nigromancer, Church robber, and a practiser of all kinde of wyckednes.</p>
   <p>These with a great many moe of that abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable sea of Rome wer thus occupied, whose endes were most terrible, as their lyues were most wicked. And these faculties their inferiour sorte, as Moonkes, Friers, and Priestes also v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and would teach the same witchcraftes and Sorceries to such men and women, as they had committed euyll wyth. As of late was confessed of a woman which vsed Witchcraft and Sorce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye, that she learned the same of a priest, whose harlot she had bene many a yeare. I exhort all men therfore to flee from them and these dyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish practises, as from Deuils incarnate, least in following them with lyuing here pleasantly a litle while, they be tormented with thē in hell perpetually. Which God for hys Christes sake wythdraw and let now and euer.</p>
