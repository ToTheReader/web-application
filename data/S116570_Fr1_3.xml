For pride and vaine glory blew the Angells from heauen, made shipwracke of <hi>Adam:</hi>

      <note place="margin">Dan. 4.</note> and threw

<note place="margin">Math. 11.</note> condemned Capernaum,
<note place="margin">Mark. 9.33</note> and made Senacharib an example, for all that behold him to be godly.
<note place="margin">Thess. 2. 4.</note> It infected Christs disciples: it distroyed <hi>Corach: Aman: Absolon, Adoniah.</hi> It is the marke of Antichrist and it hindered the scribes and Pharises from heauen because they loued<pb facs="5"/>the prayse of men more then the prayse of God.
<note place="margin">Iohn. 12.43.</note> It vniustified the Pharisies: descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth false Apostles: and vnmasketh Hyppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.
<note place="margin">Luk. 11.</note> It is like a rocke that will breake our ship: a winde, that blasteth our fruite: and a thiefe, that will steale our goods, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by <hi>Seneca</hi> to a whirlewind: by
<hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> to a bladder: and by <hi>Austine</hi> to smoake.
<note place="margin">Cor. 2.10:</note> The scripture saith, there glory, is there shame, yea that of all thinges it is most miserable. For
<hi>sequitur superbos Victor a tergo deus:</hi> God resisteth the proud, conquers the hauty: and will one day bring there stinking bodies,
<hi>magno faetore</hi> from there nastie sepulchers.
<note place="margin">Psal. 62.</note> Let not therefore the wise man glorie in his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: the strong man in his strength, nor the rich man in his riches.

<note place="margin">Timon.</note>

   <p>The marchant bragging of his wealth is puffed vp: when as oftentimes the wind will make claime vnto his good, and be lord of his trafique,
<note place="margin">Antipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> Set not therefore thy hart vpon riches, loue not the world, and beware of couetousnesse, for the couetous man is like fire, the graue, an hell that neuer haue enough, like the wolfe, the hogge, and the dog. that following two men leaues the stran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger, and cleaues vnto his master: so the worldling for sakes Christ and follows mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as <hi>Gehezi,</hi> that to gette the mony lost his master: and what shall it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitte<pb facs="6"/>thee to win the world and loose thy soule.</p>
   <p>The second hindred <hi>Esay: Diues,</hi> the Epicure.
<note place="margin">Sam. 2.11.</note> It led <hi>Dauid</hi> to wantonnesse, <hi>Salomon</hi> to idolatry, <hi>Sampson</hi> to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:

      <note place="margin">Silius. 15.</note> It changed Rome: burned sodom: vanquished Babilon, and destroyed Israell It turnes men into beasts, women into swine and makes all worse, <hi>asino vel cane,</hi> then the dog, or the asse.</p>
   <p>The third hindred the Pagan from bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme the Papist from verity:
<note place="margin">Christos.</note>
      <hi>Ely</hi> from pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie It is <hi>aries quo murus Euangilij qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur:</hi>

<note place="margin">Acts. 21.</note> and <hi>Paule</hi> will die for the name of Iesus.

   <p>The third contrary winde is feare of pouertie: persecutions: punishments: reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: rayling: scorning: whipping: Impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: banishing: killing, all which are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to christian saylers.
<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> For the Church is <hi>Noe</hi> and it must be tossed her <hi>poesie facere bonum et habere malū</hi> to doe well but to haue ill, and her coulor shall be blacke, and cannot be changed. A god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans life is no life but calamity, <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> dayes were few and euill.
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note>
      <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was tossed from post to piller: the saints suffered all kind of misery: yea Chirst himselfelfe,
<note place="margin">Greg.</note>
      <hi>non exiit sine flagello, qui ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit sine peccato,</hi> he must not depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whipping, that came and liued without sinning. This hindred many from sayling after Christ, as
<hi>Ciprian</hi> reporteth. The Theater relateth, and the Tripartite recor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth, Iewes, and Gentles, Grecians, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>barians. <hi>Liberius Spiera,</hi> Nichomachus This made <hi>Aaron</hi> to make the Idolatrous calfe.
<hi>Nichodemus</hi> to come by night vnto Christ, <hi>Peter</hi> to denie his master, Origen to<pb facs="8"/>offer to an Idol, and <hi>Damascet</hi> to worship <hi>Mahomet,</hi> howbeit Christ must enter by the crosse into glorie, his followers by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in to heauen, and they which endeuour shalbe blessed and receiue the croune of life.</p>
   <p>The second hinderer is the greatnesse of the Lord: and of all the burdens that euer man did beare, sin is the heauiest, like a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone about our necks, a masse of lead about our feete, a rocke of stone vpon our heads, and a mightie mountaine on our backes.
<note place="margin">Decles. 22</note> So heauy as heauen could not hold it: Paradise not beare it: nor earth sustaine it, but hell must receiue <hi>Corath, Dathan</hi> &amp; <hi>Abiram.</hi> The sinner is like a filthy stone, that cannot rowle, a blindfold mowle, that cannot see and a loaden asse, that cannot goe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must needes be hindered.
<note place="margin">Sam. 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>7.</note> Purge thē this filth, cast away this vaile, and disburdē thy shippe. The auncient gamesters would wrestle naked:
<hi>Dauid</hi> would not fight in <hi>Saules</hi> harness: and hee; that vseth maste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, abstaineth from all thinges, that may hinder him.
<note place="margin">Cor. 1.9.25.</note> Behold Christ came to beare thy burden, vnload thy vessell, and ease thy shippe, He was made the son of man, that<pb facs="8"/>thou mightst be the child of God, he was lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in swadling bands, that thou mightst be loosed frō the bonds of sin. He was wrapped in ragged clowts, that that thou mightst be cloathed with his righteousnesse innocency He was poore that thou mightst he rich: A stranger that thou mighst be sure of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly citie. Hee payed tribute that thou mighst he free from the trihute of hell. Hee was debased, that thou mightst be exalted, accursed, that thou mightst be iustified: con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demned, that thou mightst be saued: Died, that thou mightst liue: and calles for euery one tbat is weary and heauy loaden to come vnto him, and he will ease them.</p>
   <p>The third hinderer is vnskilfulnesse in the carde, ignorance in ayming, and rudenesse in guiding:
<note place="margin">Math. 11.28.</note> for by this meanes, he may roaue at random, misse the hauen, and hinder his iourny:
<note place="margin">Iudg. 16.</note> Blinde <hi>Sampson</hi> cannot finde the Pillars vnlesse he be guided
<note place="margin">Acts. 9.</note> nor <hi>Saule</hi> Damascus vnlesse he be directed but if the blind leade the blind, both fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to the ditch, and may be drowned. Not vnlike vnto this temporall blindenesse is the spirituall darkenesse of ignorance and infidilitie. For the ignorant goe<pb facs="9"/>they know not whether, they walke in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they are very fooles, they are like the blind Sirians: they rowe among ther ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and there voyage is distruction.
<note place="margin">Iohn. 12</note> Seeke then for knowledge, Christ is the light:
<note place="margin">Prou.</note> bee skilfull in the carde, his word is the lanther:
<note place="margin">Iob. 4.</note> walke not in darkenesse, Christ is the way, drowne not in error, his worde is the truth.
<note place="margin">Iohn. 8,</note> To know God is life euerlasting <hi>Ignoratiô scripturarum est ignoratio Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iohn. 12.</note> to be vnskilfull in the scriptures, is to be ignorant of Christ. These are <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder: <hi>Dauids</hi> key, and will leade thee into all truth, without these thou art like the So<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>domites looking for Lots house, the Iewes see king for Christ, the Pilot rouing at the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen but cannot hitte it.
<note place="margin">Iohn 17.</note> For the scriptures are our sword, ballāce, rule, square &amp; dore that opens to vs the knowledge of God and conducts vs to euerlasting happinesse.
<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding albeit the scripture be a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle that burneth most brightly and the sun that shineth most clearely yet they are not so vnto the blind, the hid, the dead, but only vnto him, whose darknes is inlightned, whose eares are vnstopped, and whose eies are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to heare, to see, to beleeue the worde of<pb facs="9"/>truth. The Isralites hard the thunder but saw not God, the two disciples hard &amp; saw Christ but knew not Iesus, before their eies were opened. Infidility is a stōe that must be remoued, a cloud that must be dispersed, &amp; a death that must be quickened, He that is troubled with this disease hath hands with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out feeling, eares without hearing, &amp; eyes without seeing.
<note place="margin">Aug.</note> O then let vs aske, seeke, and knocke for faith.
<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.5.9.</note> For faith is the inlightning of the mind: the victorie ouer the world: &amp; the gate wherby God enters into our harts it is the star that leads the wisemē to Christ the woman to her groat: and the Prodigall child to his father.
<note place="margin">Math. 2.</note> It is the light: by which we walk:
<note place="margin">Luke. 15.</note> the life, by which we liue, the sheild be which we are defended, &amp; the Cinosura be which we sayle, without this we shoot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the butte:
<note place="margin">Cor. 2.5.</note> run beside the goale, and row beside the hauen.</p>
   <p>Forthly as <hi>Noes</hi> Arke receiued al kind of creatures:
<note place="margin">Gennes. 7.</note> the ship beareth al sorts of bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dens: so doth man all manner of miserie.
<note place="margin">Eurip.</note> For what is life but violence &amp; griefe: the body but a sepulchre, the figure but fetters, birth but earth, and to liue but to die, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> cals man vnhappy,
<hi>Antiphanes</hi> death. <pb facs="10"/>stipendary <hi>Nazinanzē</hi> a race, of vnstabilitie, borne to laboure, and brought vp to miserie, euen pleasure breedes paine, welth woe &amp; singing sighing, so that
<hi>Menander prefers</hi> all creatures before man for happines, whose ioy is but sorrow, whose mirth is but griefe &amp; whose whole life but wretched miserie: our cōfort is in God our goodnes Christ our captaine and heauen our happie hauen.</p>
   <p>Fiftly, as the ship is in continuall danger of waues, windes, gulfes, or rockes, so is mās life of sin, sickenes miserie, and misfortune, both sea and land water, and earth, all are full of mischefe, paine, trouble, ill, harme &amp; hurt: in such sorts as the poets add these E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithits to the sea and say;ling, tēpestuous, boi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>strus, froward, dangerous, as they that saile the sea can well recount the dangers of the same.
<note place="margin">Colas. 3. Gal. 5. Acts. 27.</note> But tent ines more strang titles giue the scriptures vnto man, as inordinate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, couitous, wrathful, angrie, malitious cursed, proud, seditious, drunken, hating, murderous, yea what not? So that as a ship in daunger of drowning must be helped, by vnloading, stopping, pumping or anchoring so must man in this perilous world. When <hi>Pauls</hi> sbip was in hazard by tempest, they<pb facs="10"/>lightened the burden, eased the vessell and cast out the very tackling. And when thy ship is in daunger and loaden with the cares of the world, feare of death and pleasure of sin, thy remedy is to ease it by faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and good workes which <hi>Abraham Dauid, Peter,</hi> and the rest did.</p>
   <p>Secondly the leaking shipe must be men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded, and thy sinfull soule amended. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will drowne the ship, and sin will smite thy soul, water must be kept out by stopping and sin by risisting. for euery assent the soule giues to Sathan, sin, the world and the flesh is like a fearefull rift in a crased vessell: <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes</hi> resemble great waues and close rifts: some being great and manifest, others close and secret. The first like mightie waues wil swallow vs vp quickely the second like hid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den rifts will sinke vs suddenly, Sathan suggested, <hi>Eue</hi> delighted, <hi>Adam</hi> consented and all were drowned, <hi>Tecum prius ergo voluta haec anime, ante tubas, galeatum sero duelli paenitet.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Genes. 3. Iuuen. 8.</note>
   </p>
   <p>VVhen the stead is stolne it will be to late to shut the doore, when the house is burnt to poure on water, and vvhen the battle is done to put on harnesse. Stop sin in the thought<pb facs="11"/>refist it in the entrance, it is a serpent, bruse it on the head; a cocatrise, kill it in the egge: and a wolfe, distroy it in the litter. Sin is thy enemie looke vnto thy waies, a thiefe looke vnto the doores: a Dalila looke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy soule: thy senses are thy porters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware they be not beguiled. Be thy sins secret yet a secret stab will take away thy life: bee they hidden, yet hidden poyson will rob thee of thy selfe: be they smale, <hi>de guttis mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis implentur flumina</hi> yet small drops makes great flouds and drown much ground and therefore stoppe it out betimes.

   <p>Thirdly he must pumpe to ease the ship of water: and man repent to ease his soule of sin.<note place="margin">Esa. 38.</note>
      <hi>Hezechias</hi> plague sore must haue a plaister of figges to draw the poyson from his heart:
<note place="margin">Luke. 3.9.</note> and thy pestilent sin a plaister of Gods word, to keepe the infections from thy soule.
<note place="margin">Tim. 1.4.</note> The dropsie body requires a sweate to purge out humors, and mans dropsie soule the feare of God to driue out sin. <hi>Naaman</hi> must be washt seauen times in Iordan to cleanse his body and we be bathed seauen times in repentance to scoure our soules. The surfetting stomacke must haue a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to helpe his bodie: and man true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession<pb facs="11"/>to ease his soule, The sickely body must keepe a diet to preserue his health and the penitent man must abstaine from sin to saue his soule, vnto which if he add exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of good workes he shalbe happie.
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.18.19.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Fourthly in danger the marriner will ly at Anker for his saftie: so must man in the sea of this world for his securitie. His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers must be faith, hope, and prayer: the ground must be the Trinitie: then will the Anker hold, and the ground neuer faile: For we haue Gods promise &amp; his othe that by two things, vvherein it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that God should lie we might haue strong consolation, which haue our refuge to hold fast the hope, that is set before vs, which we haue as an Anker of the soule both sure and stedfast. And if God be with vs, let windes, waues, rockes, sin, Sathan, &amp; the world, fret, fume, blow, all shall not hurt vs.</p>
   <p>Sixtly, and lastly: as the tossed seafea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring man wearied with waues, withered with wind rushed with rockes, and greened with gulfes wil make mirth and melodie at his safe arriual in the earthly hauē: so much more the christian sayler, whose ship is him<pb facs="12"/>selfe,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> whose windes, waues, gulfes, &amp; rocks are his prosperous, sinister, troubles, tempta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions, trangressions,
<note place="margin">Psal. 42.</note> and whose hauen is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which he vewes a far of, salutes out of the sea, sighes after with heauie grones, &amp; praise for dayly with watred eies, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue with ioy, embrace with hymmes, and retaine with euerlasting praise his ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssed entrance in the happie heauens.
<note place="margin">Apoc. 22.</note> How willing where the Saints to die: <hi>Paule</hi> to be dissolued, and <hi>Dauid</hi> to be with God? This makes the good man dy singing like the swan liue praying with the saints: and cry rūning dravve me, drawe me with the Church, <hi>Ocurramus, sequamur</hi> saith <hi>Ambros: Curramus non passibus sed afflictioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> saith <hi>Barnard</hi> let vs run, follow, flie, here is not happinesse: let vs hast, post, saile with hearts, with hands, with grones, sobs, and sighes, there is felicitie, where whē thou arriuest, thou shalt haue Father Son, and spirit to receiue thee, Angels, saints, and all the heauenly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">

   <p>The way and method, I haue opened in this short treatis for a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the rich, comfort of the poore, and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation vnto all.</p>
