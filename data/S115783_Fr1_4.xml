      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas Doctor Vrbane hath here set down, the doctrine which our Sauiour Christ taught his disciples on the way to Emaus, in a dialoge, and not (as it semeth) in a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mō, as both in this booke it is called, and in deed it is, (for euery godly dialoge, such as this is, is a sermon, or rather a great many sermōs) think it to be done (beloued reader) for thy profit, &amp; good insāple. For though this familiar kinde of talking, be not the most glorious kinde of oration for the teacher: yet is it the most commodious way of instruction for the learner. And here behold, how the godly byshop sought more thy profit, then his owne prayse. Agayne it is a good insample for all, that haue charge of others, thus to instruct them, and reason with them in diuinitye, and commonly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue hard a sermō, that so they may see how their younglinges heare, and beare away the sermō, which they here. But maryed men especially haue in this dialoge a good ensample (as good byshops of their houses) to instruct their wyues, and to haue such talke with them at home, as may be to the vse of edifiyng. Then which nothing is more comely, nothing more fruitfull, nothing more necessarye.</p>
   <p>For as man, and wife, are the Image of Christ, and his spirituall church: so ought there communication to be of heauenly, and spirituall thinges. And they which will vse this way of domesticall instruction, shall reape the fruite thereof, euen to haue their wiues cōforts, not crosses, and helpers, not hinderers of their godly proceedings: yea they shall haue thē (though they be but women) by this meanes as great defences to their houses, families, and people, as was Lot to Sodome, as was Phenies to Israell, and as Moses was to the Iewes, when he stode in the gappe, and tourned away the wrath of the Lord. But women children, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies cōtrarily vsed, do shew contrary fruites, and worke contrary effects. And here if any aduersarye of the gospell, hold that such hye matters, would not be handled in such
<pb facs="10"/>
homely dialogs with women, send them to the example of Christ in the gospell, and the apostles in the Acts, who are Vrbans warrant in this matter. And if they require exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of doctors they shall finde that Hilarius in his booke to his daughter Aphra, Ambrose to his sister, Hierom to Principia, Hedibia, Algasia, Eustachius, and Paula, and Saint Augustine to his mother, haue all vsed the lyke participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hye misteries with women as Vrbane hath here done in this dialoge. And therfore can it not be sayd, but that this manner of teaching is godly, profita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, and vsual. Wherefore receaue it, reade it, and pray beloued reader, that thou mayst profite in it, to Gods glorye, and thy saluation.</p>
