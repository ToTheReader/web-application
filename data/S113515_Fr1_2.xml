   <head>TO THE RIGHT Honorable, <hi>Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and my very bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> Benefactors, the Hon: Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> most <hi>Worthie Gouernour of the</hi> East Indian Company, Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the graue Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, &amp; the rest of that famous Societie: <hi>All Health and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>RIght Honorable, Worshipfull, and dearly beloued in our Lord Iesus: It hath beene an ancient and laudable Custome of
<pb facs="3"/>
the Church of God, as to ordaine generally certaine ordinarie <hi>Loue-Feasts</hi> and Christian Meetings, for the more comfortable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and maintenance of <hi>Brotherly Loue,</hi> which is the <hi>Bond of Perfection:</hi> so more especially, when the Lord hath enlarged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in any extraordinarie Fauour vnto his Church, by deliuering the same out of some desperate and inexplicable danger. We haue not onely the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse <hi>commaund</hi> of God, to be enlarged in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse accordingly, but to expresse our thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: as principally by exercising our selues in <hi>Psalmes</hi> and <hi>Hymnes,</hi> and
<pb facs="3"/>
spirituall reioycings; so also (to testifie our renued interest in the <hi>Creatures,</hi> which such Extremities might haue vtterly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs of) in this respect also, to solace our selues in a more <hi>liberall vse</hi> thereof by solemne <hi>Feastings,</hi> and all such outward Meanes, as together with inward refreshing of the Minde, might also tend aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to the comfort of the body; as being much weakened and disinabled with the feare and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of former Dangers. And thus wee may finde, that the Church of God hath vpon such Occasion accordingly practised. See <hi>Hest. 9. Nehem.</hi> 8.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
And thus doe wee at this day solemnize the Memoriall of <hi>our Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and glorious Deliuerance</hi> from the Kingdome of Darkenesse, by the True <hi>Light</hi> of the World, <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> Who as at this Time shined as it were in the darkenesse and obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of his <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that so hee might bring <hi>Light out of Darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> and by his abasing of himselfe vnto the <hi>shape of a Seruant,</hi> might restore vs to the <hi>glorious liberty of the Sonnes of God.</hi> Wherein howsoeuer happily we are not free from some vniust <hi>imputation of superstition,</hi> by such, who being not able to discerne betweene the
<pb facs="4"/>
right <hi>vse,</hi> and <hi>abuse</hi> of things, doe therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our <hi>Liberty</hi> for the common <hi>abuse</hi> thereof in these licentious Times, by turning the same as an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to the flesh: yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought their aspersions any whit to discourage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny religious heart from an holy improuing of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the glory of God, seeing they proceed rather of superstitious singularity then any sound ground of Truth: Neither may we doubt, but that our <hi>reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and spirituall Behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> herein, as it shall iustly cleare vs from any impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of superstition, so it may also free vs from the danger of any such abuse,
<pb facs="5"/>
which the loosenesse of the times is guiltie of. For howsoeuer it may not be denyed, but that such <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations</hi> as were meerely of <hi>Humane Inuention;</hi> or though they were of <hi>Gods</hi> appointment, yet tending to the obscuring and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogating of the <hi>Truth of Christ,</hi> were meerely su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious, and so to bee renounced of vs, as they were <hi>abolished by Christ:</hi> such as were the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of <hi>Moyses,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer else of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Yet whatsoeuer <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> haue their <hi>Equitie</hi> from the Law of God, and Practise of the Saints, according thereunto, and withall are so farre from
<pb facs="5"/>
opposing the <hi>Uertue</hi> of Christ, or Christian <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,</hi> as that both in their <hi>Intent</hi> and <hi>Use</hi> they may further to the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable enioying of both: as these haue their suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent warrant, because they further that blessed <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> betweene <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and serue also for the maintenance of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Societie</hi> betweene <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> so may wee lawfully vse our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie herein, so all things bee done to the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God,</hi> and <hi>mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Edification:</hi> Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, seeing the lawfull <hi>Custome</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> ought to bind vs wisely heerein, if
<pb facs="6"/>
we will not be <hi>contentious,</hi> whereof we haue no such custome, neither the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, howsoeuer to him that <hi>doubteth,</hi> this libertie may be <hi>sinne;</hi> &amp; that much more, if hee shall proceed to <hi>condemne others,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himselfe is not resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and that most of all, if hee shall <hi>depriue himselfe</hi> of the <hi>libertie in good things,</hi> vpon pretence of some <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill</hi> that doth hang vpon the same (as the manner of some is:) yet should this rather prouoke vs to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue our libertie to the best in all spirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that so eyther the Mouth of Iniquitie may be vtterly stopped, or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="6"/>
graciously to glorifie our God with vs, euen on our behalfe. The <hi>Meanes</hi> and <hi>Triall</hi> hereof, seeing it consists in the <hi>holy orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and gouernment of the Affections,</hi> as euidencing the inward puritie of the hart; which being purified by Faith, all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pure thereunto: therefore shall this Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at this Time prooue most <hi>seasonable,</hi> wherein by our <hi>libertie in the flesh,</hi> we may be so easily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to exceed to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of the flesh. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely shall it serue for the restrayning of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancie at this time: But seeing <hi>the whole course of our Christian Life</hi> is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
<pb facs="7"/>
ledde, and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly followeth the wise <hi>Temper of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> and so is also approued and perfected thereby: Therefore also shall this <hi>Light</hi> prooue a profitable <hi>Guide,</hi> to conduct vs throughout all the <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Infirmities</hi> thereof: As seruing for an Armour both to enable vs in the <hi>Conquest</hi> of such E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, which will bee sure at all times to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose vs in our Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iourney; as also the better to comfort vs, in regard of such <hi>Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and outward faylings, which doe oftentimes mainely challenge the
<pb facs="7"/>
truth of our proceeding. For as, if there be a <hi>willing minde,</hi> the Lord <hi>accepts</hi> it aboue what we do, or can doe, that so wee may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne a <hi>truth</hi> of Grace in the <hi>imperfection</hi> thereof: so seeing the Lord <hi>will perfect the worke he hath begun in vs.</hi> And yet in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that still his <hi>power must be seene in our weakenesse,</hi> that he may haue the only glory; therefore as this is for the present our <hi>euidence</hi> of sinceritie, that we <hi>loue</hi> &amp; <hi>affect</hi> what we cannot do, <hi>greeuing</hi> withall for our fayling heerein; so by these <hi>contrarie affections</hi> about the same <hi>Obiect,</hi> wee doe not onely Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the <hi>Spirituall combate,</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>
but do daily interesse our selues heereby in the <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> of our <hi>Christ,</hi> by whom we are not only <hi>sustained</hi> in the combate, aboue any abilitie in our selues, but also by his <hi>vertue,</hi> we are daily strengthned against all oppositions, that so in time we may be <hi>more then Conquerors.</hi> But of these things more particularly in the <hi>Treatise</hi> ensuing. Which as I haue now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my promise, published for the <hi>Common good;</hi> so because we liue in a <hi>prophane</hi> and <hi>surfeting Age,</hi> wherein all is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too little for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the <hi>Flesh:</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery little too-much, that serues by the restraining
<pb facs="8"/>
thereof to the satisfaction of the <hi>Mind:</hi> therefore are my <hi>Meditations</hi> sorted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; As in some <hi>breuitie</hi> and much <hi>weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> to <hi>stumble</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, who stands vpon <hi>colour</hi> more then <hi>cloth,</hi> doting rather vpon what may affect and puffe vp the <hi>giddy braine,</hi> then what may reforme and humble the <hi>honest heart:</hi> so thereby also to exercise, and stirre vp the <hi>dulnesse</hi> of the best; that what seemes not so apparant at the first view, may by more serious <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation</hi> and feruent <hi>prayer</hi> be better conceiued, and more profitably digested. And therefore also haue I beene the briefer in this
<pb facs="9"/>
      <hi>Generall discouery of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Affections;</hi> because my purpose is (God-willing) to adde shortly hereunto a <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Discouery of each se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Affection,</hi> according to their <hi>Order, Nature,</hi> and <hi>Differences;</hi> wherein by the Grace of God there may be some profitable supply in <hi>speciall,</hi> for what soeuer is wanting in the <hi>Generall direction.</hi> Meane while, that I might not be wanting to the season, whereby the time may in some measure be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the hearts of Gods children raysed vp to further hope. I haue thought good first to frame these <hi>Wals</hi> and <hi>Gates</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/>
for the <hi>Citie,</hi> that so the <hi>Inward buildings</hi> may be more safely erected and perfected. Of all which, as I haue bin bold to make choice of your <hi>Honours</hi> &amp; <hi>Wor.</hi> as <hi>Patrons;</hi> and <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> as to whom being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready bound by so many former fauours; I could not choose but renew my <hi>Bonds,</hi> by paying this poor <hi>Interest,</hi> though far I hope from any base <hi>Usurie:</hi> yet binding hereby to a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall <hi>debt</hi> of <hi>loue,</hi> which is then best paid, when stil it is owed. And so I humbly request you to accept ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not as a <hi>discharge</hi> of my <hi>debt,</hi> but only a <hi>pledge</hi> of the <hi>renewing</hi> of the <hi>bonds</hi> of my best <hi>affections</hi> towards your
<pb facs="10"/>
Worships, which seeing they ought not to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by any <hi>outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing</hi> thereof, therefore my hope is, that you will accept of my <hi>endeauours</hi> herein, not according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which I <hi>haue,</hi> but answerable to my <hi>affection</hi> therein. Comforting my selfe heerein: that seeing God hath giuen you wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to discern of things that differ, and our hearts are in the <hi>hands of God,</hi> that if we preuaile with <hi>him,</hi> we shall preuaile with <hi>men:</hi> therefore, as my desire heerein, is to approue my selfe vnto <hi>God</hi> and the consciences of his people; so <hi>other things</hi> shall be so farre supplied, as that still
<pb facs="10"/>
the power of God may be seene in our weakenesse, and the Lord may haue the glory of all his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. What <hi>others</hi> ayme at in these <hi>endeauours,</hi> I mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not; neither doe I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie at what they <hi>reape:</hi> much lesse doth it <hi>stumble</hi> me, what <hi>this way</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our selues knowne to the World, daily heares of, either <hi>vaineglory</hi> or <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy lucre,</hi> or such like: It sufficeth me, that my <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> is with God, and that I haue daily <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>his paiment</hi> and <hi>mans,</hi> that so I might trust <hi>him</hi> better, and <hi>man</hi> the lesse; and yet still not to faile any good occasion,
<pb facs="11"/>
whereby I may prouoke <hi>men,</hi> that they may be like vnto <hi>God</hi> in a wiser dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall of their <hi>Affections.</hi> This is that I ayme at in this Treatise. This I shall heartily labour for in my best <hi>deuotions</hi> and suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations vnto our <hi>God</hi> for you, that he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in you al wisedome and spirituall vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that you may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the most excellent, and like <hi>wise Merchants,</hi> still be buying that <hi>Preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pearle;</hi> and hauing once obtained it, labour stil to <hi>husband</hi> it with most aduantage to <hi>Gods glory</hi> and the <hi>good of his Church,</hi> being neuer weary of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, that so you may
<pb facs="11"/>
reape in due time if you faint not, that so you may fight the good <hi>fight of faith</hi> and finish your <hi>course with ioy,</hi> and so <hi>lay hold of Eternall life.</hi> And so I heartily commend you all to the grace of God in Christ Iesus. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in him.</p>
