      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader: That God may have the onely glory of this our deliverance, give mee leave to looke backe unto that voyage, which the <hi>Dutch-men</hi> made into <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> in the yeare <hi>1596.</hi> In which place, they having beene (like our selves) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken with the Winter, were there forced to stay it out as wee were. Which being an Action so famous all the world over, encouraged mee both to publish this of ours, as also now to draw out some comparisons with them: that so our deliverance, and Gods glory may appeare both the more gracious and the greater.</p>
   <p>This <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> stands in the Degree <hi>76.</hi> North latitude: our wintering place is in <hi>77.</hi> Degrees and <hi>40.</hi> Minutes, that is, almost two Degrees neerer the North <hi>Pole</hi> than they were; and so much therefore the colder. The <hi>Dutch</hi> were furnished with all things necessary both for <hi>life</hi> and <hi>health;</hi> had no want of any thing: <hi>Bread, Beere,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> they had good, and good store. Victuals they had Gods plenty; and Apparell both for present clothing, and for shift too: and all this they brought with them in their Ship. We (God knowes)
<pb facs="5"/>wanted all these. <hi>Bread, Beere,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> we had none. As for meate, our greatest and chiefest feeding was the <hi>Whale Frittars,</hi> and those mouldie too; the loathsomest meate in the world. For our <hi>Venison,</hi> 'twas hard to finde, but a great deale harder to get: and for our third sort of provision the <hi>Beares;</hi> 'twas a measuring cast which should be eaten first, <hi>Wee</hi> or the <hi>Beares,</hi> when we first saw one another; and we perceived by them, that they had as good hopes to devoure us, as wee to kill them. The <hi>Dutch</hi> kill'd Beares, 'tis true: but it was for their skinnes, not for their flesh. The <hi>Dutch</hi> had a <hi>Surgeon</hi> in their Companie; wee none but the great <hi>Physician</hi> to take care and cure of us. They had the benefite of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and Purging:</hi> wee of neither. They had their Ship at hand to be-friend them; wee had here perished, had not other Ships fetcht us off. They had <hi>Card</hi> and <hi>Compasse,</hi> wee no direction.</p>
   <p>If the <hi>Dutch</hi> complained therefore of the extremity of the cold, (as well they might) and that when in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their house, they (as Carpenters use to doe) put the iron nayles into their mouthes, they there froze, and stucke so fast, that they brought off the skinne and forced blood: how cold, thinke you, were we, that were faine to maintaine two fires, to keepe our very morter from free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing. The <hi>Dutch</hi> complain'd, that their walls were fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen two inches thicke on the inside for all their fire: and if ours were not so, 'twas our paines and industry at first in building. The <hi>Dutch-mens</hi> clothes froze upon their backes, and their shooes were like hornes upon their feete: but that was their owne ignorance; for they had Sea-coles enough with them, if they had knowne how to use them. If their drinke and Sacke were so hard fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
<pb facs="5"/>into lumps of yce, that they were faine to cut it out; how much harder was it for us, that were forced to make hot Irons our best toasts to warme the snow withall, for our mornings draughts? They used heated stones and billets to their feete and bodies, to warme them: which, though an hard shift, yet was it better than we had any.</p>
   <p>Lay now all these together, the distance of place, wee being many miles more into the cold than they: the want both of meate and clothes; and that the house wee lived in, we had but three dayes respite to build for nine moneths to come; and then may the world see, that <hi>the Dutch had the better provisions, and wee the abler bodies.</hi> If therefore the <hi>Dutch-mens</hi> deliverance were worthily accounted a wonder, ours can amount to little lesse than a miracle. The greater therefore our deliverance, the greater must be Gods glory. And that's the Authors purpose in publishing of it. God keepe the Readers from the like dangers. So prayes he that endured what he here writes of</p>
