      <hi>TO</hi> THE GENTRIE OF ENGLAND.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orthie Gentlemen (omitting all elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Eloquence, which oftentimes is vsed as a varnish, to couer vnprofitable labours; As cunning Goldsmithes doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich their basest Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, when they Gilt it with their purest Gold) J purpose to render to you an accompt of two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which induced me to take this paine, and to publish this worke.</p>
   <p n="1">
      <hi>1.</hi> Jt is common among Phisitions; That though profound Learning, and frequent Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, haue furnished them with abundant skill, in their Honourable profession: yet they doe still
<pb facs="3"/>
striue to make their knowledge more perfect, in the discouerie of the imperfections of other mens bodies, then of their owne: Jn like sort it is the common custome of our times; that many hopefull Gentlemen (whom Nature and Arts haue beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, with the rich treasures of their bountie) do endeauour to be more exact and refined, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Religion, Lawes, Gouernment, Maners, Strength, and Sites of forraine Countries, then of that Kingdome wherein themselues were borne.</p>
   <p>But as that man is wise in vaine, who is not wise vnto himselfe; So it is a simple grace (nay to speake plainly, it is a foule disgrace) to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (especially to such a one, as hath, or doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to spend much time abroad to know the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of forraine Nations) to be ignorant in the State of his owne Countrie at home. The Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of which, affordeth as much varietie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable instruction, to captiuate the Readers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the perusall, as the fairest Pictures doe contentment, when with their artificiall beauties, they doe allure mens eyes to looke and to gaze vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
   <p>To this end therefore, that hencefoorth such worthy Gentlemen as are purposed, in long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueling, to enlarge their experience, by the view of
<pb facs="3"/>
foraine Countries, may first be furnished with a conuenient knowledge of their owne; J vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke this labour, and doe present it vnto you, with this my first reason which induced me thereunto.</p>
   <p n="2">
      <hi>2.</hi> The second reason of my so doing, sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out of mine owne conceit; which (as J con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture) deceiues me not. For, in regard that the Histories of this Kingdome, are frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, yea blemished, by too too many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening Occurrences, and by a multitude of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagant Obseruations (which doe much differ from the true Method, and Nature, of a well digested and composed Chronicle; and thereby doe extend it into a needlesse and an vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble length) J am resolued that the Readers ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie (to obserue and to remember) is much weakned thereby: And that many yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who doe egerly striue to attaine to much knowledge in a short time, doe rather bend their Studies and their courses, to reade ouer the more narrowly contracted Histories of other Countries, then the voluminous Discourses of their owne.</p>
   <p>Wherefore to inlighten their knowledge much, by reading this little; J haue thrust forth into the World this short Historie, of the Raignes, Deeds, and Actions, of twentie of our English Kings; which J will neither praise, least J
<pb facs="4"/>
wrong it by mine owne commendation; nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise, least you (beleeuing mee on my word) should thinke your time ill spent, to read what I haue written.</p>
   <p>J know that such as are worthily descended, or who by learning are made worthy, will not only winke at some imperfections, because some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is to be gained by the rest: but will also take in good part the presentment of a small gift; if it be deliuered with a friendly hand. To such only, and to none other (which are you) doe J dedicate these my labors: Being confidently assured, that they cannot want their expected reward, which is nothing, but your kinde acceptance, and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full loue.</p>
