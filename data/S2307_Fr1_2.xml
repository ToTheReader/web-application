      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the budding branches of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good materiall tree, at their due tyme thorough the mighty worke of God, bryng forth fruite pleasaunt and comfortable for the contentation and refreshyng of the outwarde man: althoughe not eche branche or bough replenished with lyke quantitie, So likewise the branches of the beautiful tree of gods eternal truth thorough hys gracious appointment, bryngeth forth such fruite, as is for the comfort and sustenance of the inwarde man, the spirituall soule: and thoughe euery branche be not endued with like aboundance, or replenished with lyke quantitie of swete perswasions, yet not in the quantitie onelye, but as well in the qualitye, consisteth the vertue of eche thynge. And for as muche as we shall render accomptes of the talentes receyued, and therefore are admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, whether they bee fewe or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, muche or lyttell, yet dyligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to employe and bestowe theym,

to the aduancement of gods glory, and the edifyeng of our christen brethern. I therfore as one of the vnprofitablest vnfruitfullest, and moste vnworthiest the name of a branche of that tree, yet being desyrous to imparte vnto others suche fruite as God hathe indued me with: and to employe my talent to the glorie of God, and the comforte of my bretherne: haue therefore enterprised this lyttell woorke, whiche althoughe not in that sorte and order, as if it had bene touched by the handes of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: yet I nothyng mystrust, but that the gentill reader wyll conceyue the beste of my good wylle and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng. And forasmuch as the maner of many men, when newe workes come to their handes, is, to satisfie them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues with readyng here &amp; there a piece, and being soone wearie, theyr trauaile to none effect. I haue therfore thought good to require thee gentill reader, not to thinke it troublesome to reade and againe to rede ouer these so few leaues whiche vnto the godly mynded, shall be both pleasant and comfortable: and as herein thou shalt perceiue the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

punishmentes &amp; iust plages which god hath in store, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> transgressors of his preceptes, and neglectours of hys wordes, to the ruine decaye and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of that people and contrey: so shalte y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> lykewyse beholde his vnspea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable and inestimable benefites and blessynges, whyche he of his almighty mercy, most plentyfully and abundant<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly poureth vpon that people and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where his holy and blessed word, with thankful hartes is embraced. Of which both) in this realme of EnglƒÅd we haue had the experience, as to the reader shall most perfectlye appeare. Thus partly for the declaryng my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to God, &amp; the zeale I beare vnto his truth as also my harty desyre of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinual prosperous estate of my contrey as nature forceth me, I haue through the sufferance and assistance of God, symply fynished my enterprise begon, geuynge hym whollye the prayse.
