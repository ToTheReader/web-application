      <hi>To the most Reuerend</hi> Father in God, Iohn by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prouidence, Archbishop of <hi>Caunterbury, Metrapolitane of England</hi> his grace, and one of her Maiesties most honorable priuie Counsell, <hi>Samuell Cottesford, wisheth euerlasting felicitie.</hi>

   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Am not ignorant (most Reuerend Father in God) how dangerous a matter it is to publish anything to the common view of the world, more dangerous by farre then all the aduenterous traffiques made by Sea, into the Indian coasts for gold,
<pb facs="3"/>
for if therin God giue successe and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, their aduentures once made and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes safelye ended, their great perrilles and dangers they haue bene in: after nine dayes wonder (as we say) shalbe scarse spoken off. But the case standeth otherwise with them that shall put thēselues vpon the multitude, whome if they either by their publike prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching or writing shall not affect, they shalbe sure to beare the skarre of their reprochefull tungs to their graues, &amp; hardly be thought off all their life after, let them in the setting downe of the trueth beare themselues ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so vprightly: Such is the miserie of our dayes, so great are the discretions of mindes, the diuersities of iudgementes, and the ouer speedy taking of matters to hurt, without weighing before hand, or aduised counsaile taking before resolution, contrary to <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> his iudgement: who saith, <hi>Stablish thoughts by counsell.</hi> The consideration whereof, partelye hath long stayed me from attempting anything, as also mine owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiencye in comparison of many others more fit for this worke: yet by the matter which in this tretise I haue handled, wherin
<pb facs="3"/>
I haue had some good times deliberation, at length thus farre J haue beene drawen, not in vanitye of minde, as delighted to heare my selfe, as perhaps some will not sticke to iudge, whose misiudging affections as of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of our time I not weighing, being men heady and preposterous, some of them being carried by a proud conceite of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: others led in respect of persons, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to fauour, not weighing the trueth for it selfe sake, which causeth that many of them in stead of light, haue taken holde of darkenes and walke therin: and in stead of the simple trueth, haue waded ouer head and eares into foul and abhominable errors. The reason therefore as I suppose is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he that pleaseth to run, before he can well goe, nay scarse creepe, such as are our multitude: shall stumble dangerouslye and that most vnrecouerably, I speake it J say, in regarde of the people of our daies, and those also who pretend conscience of religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, who, how offensiuelye so euer themselues walke before men, it matters not in their owne iudgement, so they can finde but one dart to cast at the minister, and
<pb facs="4"/>
haue neuer so little skill to comptroll their teachers, whome though we are not to sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from being but weak in faith, yet when a case of controuersies disputable shalbe, they are to be put aside. <hi>Rom. 14. 1. Eum vero quifide est infirmes assumite non ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ad certamina disceptationū, &amp;c.</hi> Him that is weake in faith take vnto you, but not for cōtrouersies of disputations: such are they that speake euill of those thinges which they know not, and in the things they knowe naturallye, as beastes without reason they corrupt themselues: as saith <hi>Iude.</hi> Such they are as no kinde of teachers can long satisfie, whose affections therfore in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the trueth to follow as concerning pleasing of them is meere folly:</p>
   <p>But if we will stand vpon pleasing of men, (and men pleasers, ministers in any wise may not be) except it be in matters tending to edification, according to the rule of Th'appostle <hi>Rom. 15. 2.</hi> We shall not please God, of which people I may say againe as a certaine heathen Poet spake of the people of his time.</p>

trueth, they become great Clarkes and master teachers of errors: of whom whilest amongst many of their points they stand in this one: of calling, chusing and ordeining Ministers: they omit in the meane time all teachers and teaching, especiallye all other that are not of their owne choosing, and so with <hi>Aesops</hi> Dogge, whilste they snatche (not that I speake it in contempt of the Church ordinance concerning that poynt) after shadows, in comparison J may say, they leese the substance, by whom J could wish, that this one thing were considered, spoken though by a Heathen. <hi>Aliud estaliquid suadere quod faciun dum sit aliud ferre quod recte mutari non potest.</hi> Jt is one thing to perswade a matter to be doone, and an other thing to tollerate that which rightly or conueniently cannot be changed: Other people there are, whome our daies do breed, whose eyes the God of this worlde hath blinded, vnto whome the ministrie of the woord is but vile, being in their eyes as dung, which yet if we were as the fat dung is to the barren ground, it were well and profitable for them, and we could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented

so to be accounted, conditionallye that our doctrine might make their barren harts more fruitfull: these are they that can make some reckoning of the trueth, so long as thier profit be not spoken against. Neere they be of alliance to <hi>Lisander</hi> the Lacedimonian, who affirmed by mouth that trueth was to be preferred before lyes, but in the valuing of them together ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their worthines, he made recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them more or lesse, according as they brought gaine to the cofers: vnto these of so many sortes, so diuerslye minded, if a man should seeke to frame himselfe in euery respect, in attempting any thing that might make either to the glory of God, or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of his Church it would cause him to giue ouer his trauaile euen in the very mid way: To omit therfore the consideration of all sortes of people, with whome your grace in experience is better acquainted then my selfe, I hauing already borne the burden of their reproches, and to leaue them (if so be they will vouchsafe it) to the Treatise it selfe, which I to this ende in a louing affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all (if it may be so accepted) haue
