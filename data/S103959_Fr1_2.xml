      </gap> these last fifty years, they haue gone beyond all men: so in their twoo last exploytes, namely the powder plotte of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Kings murther, they haue excelled themseluees the truth whereof is most apparant, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee respect their <hi>Subtilty</hi> in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and <hi>Malice</hi> in performing; or their <hi>Craft</hi> in concealing, and <hi>Impudencie</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying both these actions.

   <p>And for the two latter, who knoweth not that though all Records haue regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred them, and most nations of the world proclaimed them the founders and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the pouder Treason; yet had they not onely▪ contriued to haue cast it vpon

   <p n="1">1 That <hi>Garnet</hi> the Provinciall (with his six names) &amp; other Iesuits were found guilty of the powder Treason.</p>
   <p n="2">2 That <hi>Garnet</hi> was arraigned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed onely for that.</p>
   <p n="3">3 That he freely and openly confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed both at his tryall and his death, he had neuer been on the racke in his life.</p>
   <p n="4">4 That he confessed (without torture) he knew of the powder-plot in confessiō.</p>
   <p n="5">5 That he first denyed and forswore this and diuerse other matters which hee
<pb facs="4"/> afterwards confessed, and defended the same by aequiuocation.</p>
   <p n="6">6 That <hi>Oven</hi> confest he kild himselfe with his owne knife, to avoide the racke, least it should make him confesse such things as he had rather dye than discover.</p>
   <p>All these thinges are as cleere as the Noone day, and yet (forsooth) the good seely innocent <hi>Iesuites</hi> must not bee held guilty of the powder treason: but what shall we say to this impudency; if it do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that not onely <hi>Garnet</hi> and his Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish brethren, but all the great <hi>Iesuites</hi> in the world, were priuie to that plot? what shall we thinke, if the very case <hi>in terminis,</hi> (the powder treason in the particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances) were propounded, debated, and resolued amongst the Iesuits before it came to passe? what if <hi>Garnet</hi> was resolued from the principall Father of the society, that though hee knewe the particulars of such a plotte, yet hee ought not by any meanes to reveale it? I for my part will be but the reporter, let the wise reader iudge.</p>

      <pb facs="4"/> this case not long before the pouder trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: A Priest is made priuie in confession, that in such a vault or vnder such a house such a quantity of gunpouder is purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly layd, as if it be not remooued there is evident danger, that not only much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but euen the Prince himselfe are sure to bee murthered. The <hi>Iesuites,</hi> mooues what the confessor is to do in this case: &amp; for answere hee cannot but confesse, that most Doctors hold, hee ought with wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and warinesse to discouer it: but for conclusion he resolues, that the safer and better opinion is, he ought to conceale it: Wherby (Right Ho:) your Lordship and all the world may see, that if <hi>Garnet</hi> did conceale the powder treason, hee did no more then he had the <hi>Iesuites</hi> resolution aforehand for his warrant in that case. If then, <hi>Garnet</hi> were arraigned and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned onely for being priuie to the plot: If it be knowen to all, that he was privie to it by confessiō, and to some that he knew of it otherwise also then by confession: If he was neuer on the racke, and therefore

   <p>And nomore question is there (if all were knowne) that they were the forgers, the Authors, and Abbetors of this late dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astrous and fearefull french murder: and let them not doubt; but the Author of truth and reuenger of all bloud (but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of his anointed) will vnmaske them and discouer it to the full: they plot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
