   <p>MOST illustrious, most renowned <hi>Foster-Mother,</hi>
(if it may be lawfull for me, a <hi>quondam-sonne</hi> of
yours, even now to stile you so;) the tender regard I have
of your unspotted fame, hath enforced me, out of my <hi>fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
duty,</hi> to acquaint you with some notorious <hi>Errours,</hi>
and more than ridiculous <hi>Oversights</hi> of an <hi>Individuum-vagum-sonne</hi>

which if you correct not in due season, (as I
presume you will) are like to make the world beleeve,
that <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> to<note n="b" place="margin">Players and Playes, (whom both Fathers and Pagan Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors rightly stile, the plague of soules) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move in times of pestilence from infected places where they have brought a plague, to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>

I here acquaint you, are contained in a new divulged
<hi>Booke,</hi> much like the <hi>Authour;</hi> intituled, <hi>The lawlesse

that <hi>Giles Widdowes Rectour of St. Martins Church in
Oxford,</hi> was the <hi>Authour;</hi> for whose use alone, (if wee
may beleeve the <hi>Title)</hi> it is imprinted, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it fit for other mens use, unlesse it be to make
them laugh these winter-nights. It was my chance in my
late passage through <hi>Oxford</hi> towards <hi>London,</hi> to heare,
that this ridiculous <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> (which made mirth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in writing) was newly preferred (and that by
publike license) to the <hi>Presse,</hi> to make the <hi>Authour</hi> of
it (no simple <hi>Ignoramus)</hi> a <hi>foole in print.</hi> Whereupon I
repaired to the <hi>Printing-house,</hi> where I found the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Copie, (which I onely turned over, not perused) so
mangled, so interlined and razed by <hi>Mr.</hi>

      <hi>Page,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

was scarce one <hi>page</hi> in all the Coppie, in which there
were not severall written Errours, Absurdities and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies
quite expunged; and if all of them had had
the <hi>signe of the Crosse upon their faces,</hi> as well as some,
the Printer questionlesse should have had no worke
When I beheld so many <hi>Errours crossed</hi> in the written
Coppy, (perchance to please the Authour, who in his

      <hi>Booke</hi> hath made the <hi>Signe of the Crosse a necessary Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,</hi>
he meanes (I take it) for to <hi>crosse out</hi> his Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights;)
I expected none at all in the printed <hi>pages;</hi> on
which I had no sooner cast mine eyes, but I espied di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>Bedlam Errours,</hi> and those so grosse, that I thought
such visible notorious malefactours (whose very faces
did proclaime their guiltinesse, though their tongues
were mute) could never passe through an <hi>Vniversity

pitty on the crazie Authour, with whose many
knowne infirmities I was of olde experimentally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,
whiles I was a resident in <hi>Oriell colledge;</hi> and
withall compassionating the oversight of the <hi>Licenser,</hi>
who for feare of <hi>crossing</hi> out all the Booke, (as hee had
<hi>crossed</hi> out very much) permitted such foule grosse <hi>Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taes</hi>
to passe <hi>uncrossed;</hi> (perchance because the <hi>Anti-puritan

<hi>Vice-Chancellour;</hi> the other to your <hi>Sonne, Giles

they were divulged, for feare they should eclipse
your honour, and blurre their owne repute. The Copies
of which Letters I shall here set downe, that so your

that though they give an infinite advantage to my cause,
(which needes no <hi>Patron</hi> but it selfe;) yet I have chosen
rather to advise you privately as a friend, in time for to
correct them before they flie abroad, in print, then to hazard
your owne, or the <hi>Vniversities</hi> reputation, in suppressing, in
repenting the publication of them, when it is too late. For
mine owne part, I desire not to crush <hi>Mr. Widdowes</hi> his
Infant in the cradle, as though I feared it, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it worthy the <hi>Presse,</hi> much lesse a <hi>Reply:</hi> but my
desire is to conceale his knowne weaknesse, (if not the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities</hi>
and your owne Oversight) by a timely discovery
of his authorized grosse mistakes; which if they should take
printed wings, and fly about, (as they are almost ready to
forsake their nest) I shall be forced in my owne defence, to
passe such a publike <hi>Censure</hi> on them, as will not onely
scare the oft distracted Authour out of his crazy wits, but
draw perchance some blot of disreputation on your selfe,
