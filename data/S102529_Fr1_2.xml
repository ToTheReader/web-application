   <head>TO THE MOST REVEREND Father in God, and singular Patron of all good learning, the Lord Archbishop of Canturbury his Grace, Primate of all England, and Metropolitane, and one of the Lords of his Maiesties most Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Priuie Counsell.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT honourable, and my gracious</hi> good Lord, I make bold to present to the view of your wisdome, foure Sermons prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by me, though not very lately, yet not very long since, vpon speciall occasions, as their titles shewe. Beeing hitherto vnwilling that they should see the light; though thereunto I haue bene greatly importuned, both by the instance of diuers my iudicious friendes, and (for some of them) pressed, by the reuerend authority of your Graces owne name, which (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) I haue hitherto detrected; as knowing how little need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is, to pester the world with any more bookes, which groneth already vnder the burden of them: Yet am I now beaten from my former resolution, by the incessant importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of certaine seduced, and seducing spirits, who (swelling with a windie opinion of knowledge, falslie so called) haue taken great exception at the second of these Sermons, which was preached at your Graces visitation, and as yet, make no end of traducing it to the world, as tending directly vnto the disgrace of preaching. For the detecting of whose igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and conuincing of their malice, I am now not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, to publish to the world what was spoken at that time: if your Grace doe not esteeme it, as a thing borne out of time. Not doubting, but that wich passed the fauourable censure
<pb facs="3"/>
of so reuerend and so learned an assembly as then were the hearers, will now find like acceptance, with all that be iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and indifferent Readers. As for Papists, and (their confederates in this cause) our schismatickes and Sectaries, I neither expect, nor respect their approbation of it. They be now (as we hope) not in any so great number, as that any great reckoning is to be made of them: especially, in your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces peculiar Dioces, which (I am verily perswaded) is better defecated and purged, both from Papistes and Schismatiks, then any other quarter of this land; which as it is our most blessed peace and quiet, so may it be your Graces exceeding ioy and comfort.</p>
   <p>These slender labours and indeuours of mine, I presume to offer vnto your Graces patronage, not onely in respect of my strict obligation vnto your Lordship for many of your forepassed most honorable fauours: but also, because (in true account) your Grace may rightly be esteemed the very anchor of all these, &amp; my selfe but the instrument: they all of them receiuing their first motion and being (either directly, or occasionately) from your gracious fauour, as from their first mouer: which, as it giueth me full assurance of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable acceptance; so it bindeth me to performance of all dutifull obseruance; and to pray for the continuance of your Graces most prosperous and happie estate, that as God hath made you hitherto a notable instrument, to settle and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish both his truth and Church amongst vs, so wee may long inioy you, to the comfort of all them that wish well vnto them both.</p>
