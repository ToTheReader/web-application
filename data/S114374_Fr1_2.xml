      <salute>SIR,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ookes are more necessary in a state than arms: Arms are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us from the invasion of foes, bookes are to preserve us from the infection of errors; enemies can but kill the body, errors endanger the soule. There are crept into the Churches, a number of false opinions; some that oppugne, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that obscure the grace of God. The earth is of it selfe prone enough to bring forth weedes, but should one withall sow tares, we should have much ado at harvest. Our hearts are ranke enough to breed errors, and our wits cunning enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them: but the scripture tells us, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious man comes and sows the tares of false opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and of weedes tares are the very worst: sith therefore errors are so plenty, bookes cannot but be very necessary. Tis true there bee many, and it
<pb facs="3"/>
may bee, according to the complaint, too many bookes abroad already; because many bee to little purpose, some little to the purpose: but of good and learned bookes, bookes fitted to the errors and diseases of the time (as this is) there neither be, nor well can bee too many: Many errors require many bookes. Nay, I may safely say, that many bookes are more necessary now than ever; for that wee are fallen into the very age of the Church, wherein as diseases in the body, so errors, the sicknesse of the soule, doe and must abound: For errors are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evills in the Church, that they that are approved may be made manifest, saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> And this is all that Satan hath gotten by stirring up the corrupt witts and pens of many abroad (and some at home) to write they care not what. Now wee doe begin to see, that Truth is the daughter of time: Truth is never new, but let an old Truth be newly proposed, and at first wee suspect it, let it settle a little, and in time truth gains ground, and wins upon the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and consciences of men; but erroneous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions just like new fashions, when they are first on foote many doate upon them, give them but some time, and they grow stale and vaine: so now what by the decrees of Synodes, and the writings and preachings of the learned Time, hath brought it so about, that there are few Schollars or others that minde these matters, but doe begin to see thorow the conceipts of the Arminians. Though then this treatise might have beene abroad sooner, yet I dare promise that it comes not in too late; for hee that reads it with judgement shall soone see, that in the
<pb facs="3"/>
doctrine of <hi>Arminius,</hi> there is more wit than truth.</p>
   <p>I doe here commend it to your reading, as to one whom the Lord hath made willing to learne, and able to judge, as also under your name unto the good of the Church, to stand as a testimony of my duty and love unto you, and of your zeale and love unto the truth.</p>
