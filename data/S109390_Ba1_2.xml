   <head>❧ AN ADƲER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TISEMENT TO THE REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</head>
   <p>BYcause that it is a small matter to haue the knowledge of rules without practise, I thought good at the end of this my treatise to aduertise you to practise the same, as you learne them. And for the dooing hereof, you must get some litle French bookes to beginne withall, which touche the matters that you are desirous of. As they which will reade the holy Scriptures, they may thereof haue so exquisite, and eloquent as a man can deuise, as the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Christian Institation of M. <hi>Iohn Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi> his Sermons, which may be found seuerally, and many other good bookes, aswell great, as small, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the most excellent and renowmed men of our tyme. And as for them, which are delighted to reade bookes vpon some other matter, I woulde admonishe them to buy a little booke Intituled: le <hi>Theatre du Monde,</hi> which is worthily so called, seeing that it contayneth not onely the glasse of the Worlde, as concerning the matter, but also for the quantitie, of the booke, the glasse and Treasure of the eloquence and purenesse of our tongue. There bee other also,
<pb facs="63"/>
verye good and pleasaunt, by reason of the diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of matters, which they contayne: as the booke of <hi>Propos memorables,</hi> the booke of <hi>Facecieuses nuicts,</hi> the booke of <hi>Nouuelles</hi> de la <hi>Rayne</hi> de <hi>Nauarre,</hi> where a man maye discouer the subtill practises of the worlde, and the meane to take heede of them, and manye other such lyke discourses, the which you may knowe of the bookesellers, as often and when you wyll, you neede onely but aske them generallye, some good Frenche booke, of such a byg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and vppon such, and such a matter, and they will shew it you by and by. As touching the rest, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as I doubt, that you will not vnderstande, all the woordes that you shall reade, I counsell you to haue likewyse a little Dictionarie, Frenche and Englishe, or Frenche and Latine (for them that vnderstande it.) For there you shall finde easilye, after the order of the crosse rowe, the signification of all woordes. And afterwardes you shall see easily in the first Booke of the present Treatise, howe they are to bee pronounced and after in the seconde, of what part of speache they be, and if they be Nounes, what Nounes, of what number, &amp; of what case: and if they be Verbes, in what moode, and in what tense you shall place them, and so of the other partes.</p>
   <p>And thus dooe I shut vp the little Riuer of the little spring, which it hath pleased God to gyue
<pb facs="64"/>
me, the water whereof, (if it be his will) shall serue you, to sprinckle, &amp; make to grow, herbes of our French tongue, in the Garden of your memorie, which shall be to you hereafter no lesse pleasaunt in smell, than profitable, so that, if I see that you make pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages to receyue the same, and that your Herbes thereby may spring. I shall beseeche our good God, that he woulde in such sort encrease the vaynes of the Spring of my vnderstanding, that I may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doe the thing, that may be to your profit and contentation, as I praye hym, to maintayne you in good prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. So be it.</p>
