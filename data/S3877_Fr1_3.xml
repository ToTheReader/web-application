   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that I had atchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the enterprise of the translation
of this litle booke (right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull) to the end I might communicate,
illustrate, and expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the same to them which vnderstand not the latine
tongue, aswell for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the studious reader, as the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Leuinus Lemnius</hi> the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned author: I called to mind
a certain brief &amp; graue poeme of <hi>Rhianus</hi> the Greke poet concerning
the imprudencie &amp; incōstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of some men, whiche cannot moderate their
troublous affections &amp; perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mind with equanimitie, which is a
singular vertue &amp; soueraign remedie of al griefes incident vnto humane
life: which moderation of mind whosoeuer wanteth is either puffed vp with
prosperity, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with aduersity. We, saieth that poet, do
erre &amp; iudge amisse cōcerning the <pb facs="3"/> manifold giftes of God,
and receiue them foolishly and vnaduisedlie. For he that is poore &amp;
destitute of liuing, doeth with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, griefe, &amp; heauines of heart, lay
great blame on the determination and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt of God: but he neglecteth the
vertue, industrie, and apt inclination of his owne mind: neither dare he for
feare say or do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing where rich men bee in presence, but bashfulnes
&amp; pensiuenes do consume his heart. Contrariwise he which liueth in
prosperitie, to whō God hath giuen riches, preeminence, &amp; authority,
oftē times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth his cōdition, beginning, educatiō, and mortalitie:
and eleuating himselfe with arrogancie and depraued hautines of hart,
thūdereth like <hi>Iupiter:</hi> &amp; though somtime he be of little
stature, he stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vp his head on high, &amp; with amiable armes
wooeth faire <hi>Minerua,</hi> and seeketh to attaine to the top of
<hi>Olympus.</hi> When I had well pondered this pithie poesie, I was animated
and encouraged therby to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate these my little labours &amp;
lucubrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to your worship, as a testification of my prompt wil, readie
mind, &amp; grateful hart: So that I was dismaied neither with the
<pb facs="3"/> consideration of my poore lowe estate, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the feare
of some such highmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mē, as the poet here doeth reprehend: who being
aduaunced and adorned with worldly welth, wisdom, dignity, &amp;
prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, &amp; euery daie expecting and desiring most exquisit and
pleasaunt nouelties, will peraduenture cōtemne this rude, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polished
peece of worke. Therefore submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the same to your fauour and
protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I attempered my penne, not to be plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the learned,
whereunto I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to attaine, but to please and profite the meane
&amp; vnlearned multitude, which is my only desire. And although I know there
be an infinite nmber of learned students, whose diligence herein might haue
bene farre more commendable in polishing this translation with perfect and
excellent Rhetoricall skill, and so could haue come nearer to the elegant
stile of the learned author: Yet I thought it better, thus bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rudely,
as I could, to attempt the same, then that it shouldly hidden from the
vnlearned, for whose instruction, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and exhortation it was meete
and requisite to dinulgate the same. For to <pb facs="4"/> what end is a man
borne &amp; brought forth into the light of this life, but by his indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie
to glorifie his Creator, and to benefite his neighbour? He hath liued long
inough whosoeuer hath liued vnto nature wel and sufficiently, vnto
himselfe &amp; his owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation blessedly and happily, vnto the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of others profitablie, vnto the glorie of God acceptablie and
thankefully. Hee hath not liued, which hath left no issue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of
him, which graffeth not trees for another age to come, and so profite his
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie, which sheweth not some good and profitable doctrin vnto the
people that shal be born after him. For as we at this day are the better
stablished &amp; more surely confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; groūded in the true faith,
because we haue learned and receiued the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our harts of Christ,
of his Apostles, of the fathers, of the primitiue Church, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of
this last Church, which was a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and scholler of sinceritie and
veritie Euen so our posteritie shall learne and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire vnderstanding
and knowledge of this our age, &amp; of their auncestors &amp; fore-elders, and
will be glade to heare of our cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and agreement in true religion, and
<pb facs="4"/> our mutuall confirmation and establishing of our assured
and liuely faith in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and will be delighted with the proper
erudition of humanitie, and profitable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of morall doctrine, which we
deliuer and leaue vnto them. Therefore trusting your worship will accept this
fruite of my studies, be it neuer so vnripe, so vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and
vnpleasaunt, and wil regard ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the beneuolent affection of the giuer,
then the gift it selfe: I am therevpon em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened to present the same
vnto you, as a token of this good and happie newe yere &amp; many moe, and
also as a declaration of my willing and dutifull mind towards you, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
power were correspondent to the same. Truly I haue good and iust cause
to assure my selfe of your fauour, prompt readines, &amp; alacrity
towards me in cōdescēding to this my humble request, &amp; haue as it
were the hope thereof in my hands, when I consider your courtesie,
affabilitie, and bountie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men but specially towards them, in
whome some signification and token of Godlie zeale, vertue, and industrie,
not coloured with hipocrisie, doth appeare: So that if your christiā
modesty would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <pb facs="5"/> your praises to be emblazed to your
face your bountifulnes in the propagatiō of the gospell of Iesus Christ,
&amp; the preferment of good learning (you being a benigne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone of them
both) deserueth to be more highly cōdecorated, thē this my barbarous
epistle can possibile reach vnto. Wherfore your worshipp vouchsafing to
graunt this my humble sute in the chearful acceptaūce of this my trauaile, I
shall thinke my selfe most bound to your benignity, &amp; shal haue
great cause, during life, to pray to God the father for his son Christ
Iesus sake, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in you great plēty of his good &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
giftes, and to lift vp his merciful and louing countenance vpon you, all the
daies of your long life led in holinesse &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes acceptable
vnto him, &amp; to accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late &amp; blesse you with worship, renowne,
prosperity, &amp; felicitie: And whē our bodies shall be restored to a
far better state of life, and ioyned togither to their soules, to giue you
the most happie fruition and possession of eternitie, immortalitie, and
most blessed life, that shall neuer in euerlasting conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuaunce of
time be chaunged. Amen.</p>
