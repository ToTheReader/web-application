   <p>BRETHREN, hearing what paines
and labour many of your reverend and
learned Pastors (who sometimes were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
minded) doe lately vndertake in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places, by their publick teaching and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by their priuate conference, and all other
meanes possible, to perswade to conformitie; I
am bold (lest they should reioyce in your flesh)
to present this my poore mite vnto your
godly consideration, as casting it into our
Lords Treasurie, most humbly beseeching
those that are rich in grace, and haue siluer,
gold, and precious stones conferred vpon
them, to offer them freely and seasonably for
the seruice of his Sanctuary, euen to build vp
the decayed places of the gates, barres, and
walles of the most holy Citty. Alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided,
that nothing be done confusedly, or at
a very venture; vpon the warrant of no ill
<pb facs="3"/>
meaning, or a supposed liberty, as if it had
been sufficient to bring wood and timber,
stone and morter, and all other needfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision
in all abundance, of any kinde or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
length, bredth, thicknesse or temper,
even as the most learned and wise of those
times thought meet, and not to haue every
thing fitted and prepared by the Lords owne
direction, so as there may need neither axe nor
hammer, nor any toole of Iron to be heard to
reform and amend the same;<note place="margin">1. King. 6. 7.</note> but if any thing
be not well, to put to or take from as occasion
shall require: No, no, all Gods outward
worship,<note place="margin">Deut. 12. 32. &amp; 32. 47.</note> and publicke or divine seruice, must
in every part and ceremony or gesture thereof,
bee so pure and free from all kinde of mixture
of any humane invention, as all things of the
very least moment whatsoever, being directly
ordered according to the patterne shewed in the
Mount of Gods holy word, every beleeuing
heart may reioyce at the most comely order
and holy beauty of Gods own Ordinances, and
adiudge it high presumption to tender any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
by farre-fetcht devices and novelties,
or some old Tradition, or worme-eaten Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
full of incertainty, to the direct disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of the all-sufficient truth, and offence of
tender consciences. In all humilitie therefore
labour to be able to giue good and sound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why you dare not conforme to the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
gesture and ceremonies, nor to any thing
else which is not within the compasse of the
most vn-erring patterne, the holy word of the
<pb facs="3"/>
all-commanding God, and bee sure to build
your refusall safely upon the rocke, and not
upon the sand; vpon the commandement of
Christ, and not upon your owne humours, or
any mens iudgement and practise, be they never
so learned, zealous and holy: yea, in whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you haue not Gods word for your war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>(Thus saith the Lord, thus did our
Lord, or the Lord never tequired this at
our hands)</hi> therein submit your selues loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and peaceably, yea most readily to them
that are over you in the Lord. And in any
case nourish not that most pestilent humour
of that man of Sinne, a delight in opposition
to superioritie, but in all humility, in matters
that are but meerely grounded on opinion, and
not on the Scriptures, thinke better of other
mens iudgements then your owne: for God
giues no saving grace but to the humble, to
the humble in deed, not to the humble in
shew. Get this vertue therefore my brethren,
for then the yooke of Christ,<note place="margin">Math. 11. 29. 30.</note> which now you
are to draw in, will be most easie and without
griefe; and his burden, part whereof you are
presently to beare, light and full of comfort:
yea, though you be made the gazing-stockes
of the world, and be hated and scorned of all
men, as the very off-scouring of the earth, for
bearing witnesse to this part of the truth, yet
shall you by humility bee inabled with much
cheerefulnesse and spirituall consolations, to
endure all things, and to suffer all things; yea,
consider I pray you, that the very true and
<pb facs="4"/>
most direct way to reigne with Christ hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is of necessitie to suffer for him in this
evill world; and to suffer for any part of the
truth in Gods worship, is to suffer for
Christ. Beleeue it therefore as verily as you
doe any other thing, that God hath purposely
predestinated you to these particular trials,
euen in every circumstance and instrument
thereof. Seeing then you must drink of this
Cup, pray heartily that his name may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
and then what matters it though wee
be despised, disgraced, scorned and derided, so
long as our Lord and master may haue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
thereby? Will not every true hearted
subiect suffer and endure any paines, trauell,
or losse of goods and life for his King and
Soueraignes sake, yea and that most cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with a manly and valiant courage? And
shall not we much more doe the like for the
King of Kings, who hath done and suffered
a hundred thousand of millions more for vs?
he lost not an eye, a hand, or a foot for vs,
but was content to giue his whole body and
soule also, yea he spared not his whole person
for vs, and that also when we were his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 5. 10.</note>
he suffered disgrace, not onely before
the Princes, but all manner of contempt by
the vilest, and of torment by the cruellest,
yea and the most grievous paines that the
fierce wrath of God in all extremity of his
iustice, could possibly inflict upon his soule
and body. Doe you think he hath forgotten
these things? No my deere brethren, in that
<pb facs="4"/>
hee suffered and was tempted,, he is able to
succour them that are tempted; yea assure
your selues he puts euery one of your teares
into his own bottle, obserues every hidden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and close practise of your adversaries,
keepes a Register (not to be corrupted) of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
word, presentment, information or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate,
that is made, signed, put up, exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or uttered against you, and sets downe also
every disgrace and contempt that is cast vpon
you, and keeps a iust reckoning of every pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
for fees that is exhausted from you for
exactions, excommunications, absolutions,
and of whatsoeuer other open or under-hand
proceedings practised against you, and will
assuredly call to iudgement both you and
all your aduersaries, and backe or hollow
friends, euery one to giue a particular and
most strict account of all these things, and
to them that haue done well herein, hee will
giue everlasting life and glory; but they that
haue done ill and unconscionably, rather ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the time then the Lord, shall certainly
goe into eternall fire.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 13</note> Gird vp therefore the
loynes of your minde, and feare not them
that haue onely power to imprison your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and take away your goods or liues, let
neither their perswasions nor threatnings
cause you to conforme to errour (of which
nature is every thing not warranted by the
word of truth) but feare him, who when hee
hath done as much as they possibly can, is
able also to cast body and soule into hell fire,
<pb facs="5"/>
Christ saith vnto vs all,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 4. 5.</note>
      <hi>Him feare,</hi> even feare
to do any thing in his worship &amp; seruice, but
what you haue good warant for, under his
hand and seale in the sacred Scriptures that he
will not be offended at it, but acceptably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it at your hands, and so blesse the use
thereof unto your soules. For else (at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
best that can bee sayd for it) is not this
directly to tempt the Lord, and to dare him
to his face, when in his publick worship wee
dare doe some things of speciall note, which
hee most carefully obserues, and that before
his face and most assured presence, yet onely
upon the Canons or perswasions of sinfull
men not consulting with the word whether
God will be pleased or offended therewith or
no?<note place="margin">Deut. 18. 19. 20.</note> There is difference (I confesse) betwixt
that which the Lord hath expresly forbidden,
and that which he hath not directly nor by
any good consequent commanded, but yet it is
onely <hi>secundum magis &amp; minus,</hi> to conform
to the latter is to do wickedly, but to subscribe
to the other, is to become abhominable.
Therefore in such cases of extremity, the
chusing of the lesse sinne may very well argue
a most wise and carnall discretion, but not any
honest heart or sincere affection. You know
brethren, that in the begining the Lord put
an everlasting enmitie betwixt the seed of the
Woman and the seed of the Serpent, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
afterwards into the Citty or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, where himselfe is pleased to
dwell as supreame Lord and King peramount,
<pb facs="5"/>
ruling &amp; governing his people especially in his
owne service) by his owne Spirit according to
his owne Lawes in his owne Word; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Synagogue of Sathan, where he also
sits upon a Royall throne (indeed not in his
owne likenesse, but most exactly trickt vp
and transformed into the similitude of an
Angel of light) teaching by his seruants many
things, commendable by the light of nature,
yea and commanding with great authority
(of all possible learning, reason, discretion,
wisedome and Philosophicall vnderstanding,
garnished with the pretious ornaments of
most admirable Oratory) many diuine and
excellent truths of the word, but enterlacing
ever and anon some doctrines of darknesse,
yet very covertly, alwayes in outward shew for
holy ends and godly purposes, and never vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
but upon most graue and good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
yea very learned, sound, and divine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
renouncing the Divell (forsooth)
most directly and professedly, out upon him
naughty meat, what did ever any body meane
to bestow the sealding and plucking of him,
the very savour or sent of him is death irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable;
but retaining the broth wherein he
was sodden, or the principall brewisse, or some
speciall part thereof, oh it is very good and
most wholesome diet indeed, (the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his <hi>benedicite</hi> light upon them that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it, for else all the fat had been in the fire)
yea I tell you this with good houshold bread
is even Angels food, (full glad would they
<pb facs="6"/>
be the proudest of them to lick their lips af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the leavings of it) though indeed every
common understanding cannot diue into the
deepe mystery thereof: Separating from and
quite banishing for euer and a day, the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
doctrines of Popery, the reall presence,
praying to the Saints departed, the supremacy
of the Apostolike Sea, and such like, fie for
shame, that any body should so much as once
name them, seeing without all question they
are most damnable, and came verily from
hell; but yet retaining diuers gestures and
ceremonies thereto appropriated, and thereby
first begotten, oh here be many rare bits and
sweet morsels, euen admirable and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
uses of, such as the Holy Ghost could
never for his life foresee or thinke of, and
therefore indeed it never came into the minde
of the Lord to require them, euen because he
did not prouidently enough consider what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and comelinesse, what vnity and much
other vndiscerned goodnesse their generall
conformity would instantly produce. For
seeing the Diuels to deceiue the world with
greater ease, and to be more free from suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
will put upon them the likenesse of Gods
holy Angels, why should not these againe to
bee revenged on their enemies, transforme
themselues into the likenesse of Diuels,
by conforming to some of their ceremonies,
that so more powerfully they might draw the
seruants of Sathan vnto God? What if the
damned crue were guld a little, and some
<pb facs="6"/>
other fooles made faine a while, yet were not
this an admirable peece of seruice, and do they
not deserue all the packe of them to be hangd
up, yea by the very heeles, that will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to the lawfulnesse hereof? All which
premisses being most grauely pondered, and
carefully considered, certaine nice and nimble
wits, of a very deepe diuing reach, and most
high soaring humour, are lately risen vp, and
now growen full ripe, who haue vndertaken,
not to dispatch all the labours of <hi>Hercules</hi> in
one houre, nor by their sweet melody to make
the wilde beasts, the sea hideous monsters,
the fell fowles of heaven, and all the huge
mountaines of the earth in one instant to bee
silent, and at a trice to conforme to their
measures of most indifferent mildnesse; but
with great facilitie (though it be a very
strange wonder I tell you, yet do not thinke
it incredible) to reconcile euen these two so
contrary seeds, and by divine appointment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
opposite Citties, (O what a blessing
are these peace-makers worthy to haue?) for
the speedier and more safe accomplishment
whereof, they haue most wisely provided and
discouered to all our horizon; the full perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their so learned sufficiency, for they
haue most strongly builded and highly erected
(euen in the very aire) a very great, yea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all question the goodliest castle that euer
mortall eye beheld, called <hi>Saint Neuter-hall,</hi>
or as the base vulgar speak. <hi>Newt-hall,</hi> which
is furnished with all store of every kinde of
<pb facs="7"/>
warlicke munition either for offence or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
so that by the place it is inaccessable,
and by the power of it utterly impregnable,
(all their aduersaries may cast their caps at
it) the constituted Regent hereof is a most
sage and honourable graue person, Lorded out
of their owne loynes, one <hi>Grando, Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fico,
Cavileiro, Segnioro Indifferento,</hi>
whose colours vnder the conduct of two great
commanders they haue made full (not a man
missing I warrant you) with most able fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of an invincible temper, and indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
constitution, neither hot nor cold, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>flesh nor spirit,</hi> but indifferently dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
(I do not say for God or the Divell, but)
as times and occasions do best serue for their
purposes. Now this is the man, and these
bee his forces and arguments my brethren,
that make strongest head against you: hee
perhaps will faigne hypocritically, that hee is
at vtter defiance with all the seed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and would not for a world be a meanes
to perswade you to conforme to any of his
damnable devices, no not in the least circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
whatsoever, because they all come from
one root, and flow from the same fountaine;
and to make this good, he will not sticke by
Drum and Trumpet to proclaime open and
intestine warres against all their damnable
courses and dissembling proceedings; yea, to
giue you full satisfaction, hee will take his
corporall oath that his iudgement is directly
contrary to them, though for some speciall
<pb facs="7"/>
considerations him thereunto moving, his
practise in outward shew carries some image
or resemblance of them: yea and at the very
worst he protests to take neither part, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a most quiet and peaceable disposition,
too too unwilling to disturbe the rest and
ease of the Church in which he was bred and
liues, but rather to bee conformable to the
times, he pretends onely to stand indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
minded, and equally disposed till matters be
setled, and in the meane season looke which
way the most take,<note place="margin">1. King. <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>. 6. 8.</note> he will encline, presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
they are absolutely in the right; yet
trust him not my brethren, for he that is not
with Christ, will easily be hired by this great
mans two gallant commanders knight mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
<hi>Feare,</hi> and Lord generall <hi>Favour</hi> (men
of exceeding prowesse, and great experience)
to take Armes against Christ; yea all that are
not professed and publick friends to the Citty
of God, wil be content (under pretence of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Churches peace) at their request
secretly to labour, and underhand closely, yea
most strongly to practise for <hi>Sathans Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,</hi>
and when time and opportunity
serues to shew forth yea openly to professe
their dissembled malice. In the meane season
learned subtilty, and great shewes of peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
honesty, do but quite cover over grosse
deformity, and most cleanly conceale vile
and abhominable hypocrisie. <hi>Stand fast</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and quit your selues like men,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 10.</note> take unto
you the whole armour of God, but in any case
<pb facs="8"/>
beware of the weapons of the Synagogue,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 1. 4. 6.</note>
      <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of words,</hi> entising speeches of mans
wisedome, and the wisedome of this world,
which will, seeme most learnedly and fully to
giue any man sufficient satisfaction, if he tie
not himselfe precisely to the word of God:
for they haue in them as intising allurements
hereunto, as any beautifull harlot in the
world. Looke you therefore unto Iesus
Christ our Lord, who is the authour and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher
of our faith, and of all the meanes
substantiall or ceremoniall thereof, or any
way circumstantially conducent thereunto,
and is gone up on high, and given gifts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men, according to his word, even whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
in calling, in doctrine, in ceremony, or in
gesture is to be conformed unto: he is gone
I say to prepare a kingdom and an eternall
weight of glory to bestow upon every one of
his Cittizes, who haue fought the good fight
of faith, such honour shall all his Saints haue
in the very presence and sight of all your Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoguish
aduersaries that now so molest and
trouble you, who standing neither on the
right hand nor on the left, but aloofe off in
their ayrie Castle, even indifferently disposed
betwixt both, shall finde to their cost, that
whosoever is not in the right is verily in the
wrong (be it doctrine or gesture) and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Citty of God, is certainly for the
Synagogue of Sathan (be it for calling or
ceremony) and he that is not directly for the
truth so farre as he sees, is (at the very best)
<pb facs="8"/>
indifferently for errour and falsehood: yea
and therefore whatsoever they pretend, all
that loue not the Sheepe of Christ, but woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
his Lambs, and persecute his seruants, shall
haue their full portion with the filthy goats.
And as for my Lord <hi>Indifferent,</hi> who will
not loose his present wages of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
for the most assured hope of future
glory, vnlesse his honour very nimbly bestirre
himselfe, and retire quickely into the old, or
some new erected Purgatory; ten thousand to
one, his portion will be fearfull in the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming
furnace, though now for the present
he triumphes and makes a most glorious flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.
Looke therefore my brethren to the
last end of these things, and then shall you
never doe amisse. Now the God of peace,
who will shortly send our Lord Iesus to make
triall of every mans worke, preserue and keepe
you, and make you wise according unto god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
that you may discerne things that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and so be of one minde and of one pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
and so may haue peace, not with the
world, for all that will liue godly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
onely to him, must haue tribulation
therein; but with God, and amongst your
selues having your consciences pure within,
and liues outwardly unspotted in the world,
for nothing is availeable but a new creature,
godlinesse is the morter whereby the house of
God is builded: all the gifts of Art and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without this, do pull downe and not set
vp; yea, though they haue both zeale and
<pb facs="9"/>
knowledge. I beseech you therefore let this be
well tempered before any stone be layd, and
then may we safely fall to building, yea then
shall the worke prosper in our hands, let <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biah,
Shamballet,</hi> and all the dissembling ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the truth doe what they can. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my brethren, whatsoever in the worship
of God, helpes not by his owne appoyntment
unto holinesse, cannot possibly be of Christ.
For is it not the fruit of the Spirit? (if it be
conformed unto) then must it needs be a
fruit of the flesh, and therefore <hi>lusteth</hi>
(though perhaps closely and secretly, yet most
naturally and constantly) <hi>against the spirit,</hi>

in the world with all their learned

them. Keepe that therefore which by
the faithfull ministery of our godly and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
pastours hath been committed to you,
take heed of curious, vaine, and unmortified
spirits, nimblenesse of wit is no helpe to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
of the spirit. Seeing then you

      </gap>lucked away with the
bewitching errours of them that are carnally
minded, and so by little &amp; little, conforming
first to this, then to that, at length by degrees
you fall from your former stedfastnes, rather
striue to grow in grace, and in the knowledge
of our Lord Iesus Christ, by cleaving more
and more to Gods owne ordinances, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="9"/>
more and more all humane <hi>Inventions</hi>

worship, but what is revealed in the word,
which if you desire to know,<note place="margin">Math. 7. 7.</note>
      <hi>seeke and you

your knowledge, or any other Talent upon any
cause or consideration, seeme it never so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,

there is any appearance or likenesse of evill;
ye<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

      </gap>forme to nothing, be it gesture, action,
or ceremony in Gods publicke worship, (if it
be not the commandement of Christ) which
hath any resemblance of Idolatry in it, though
the Idolatry it selfe be sent packing, for veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such inventions haue in them (though pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
never so often) an Idolatheous disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Haue you no fellowship therefore with
them: and so I pray that the peace of God
may be with you all that are in Christ Iesus.
Now unto him that is able to keepe you that
you fall not in these times of triall, and to
present you faultlesse before the presence of
of his glory, with ioyes unspeakeable and
glorious, even to God onely wise, bee
glory and maiesty, dominion,
and power both now and
for evermore,
Amen.</p>
