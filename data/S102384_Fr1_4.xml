   <head>¶ The Preface to every Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all Sciences whether liberall, or manuall, that Scholler makes the most happy progresse, whose Master doth first by instruction lay downe before him the grounds of his Art, and then farther opens them by practise, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. That guide will best conduct us, who not onely points out the way with his finger, but beats it with his foote, and cheerefully calls us after him.</p>
   <p>This happines our great, and onely <hi>Doctor</hi> affords us in his scriptures, who both propounds distinctly the mysteries of our faith in the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and the rule of our manners in the law, and with all illustrats both in the plaine tracte, beaten by himselfe, and his faithfull members, whose footsteps of holy faith, and conversation, printed deepe before us, haue made the way much more easie for us that follow.</p>
   <p>It is no small light to us, when we see the combate between the <hi>Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>it,</hi> and the flesh doctrinally expressed. <hi>Gal. 5. 17.</hi> But when we behold it acted personally in the Apostle (Rom. <hi>7.</hi>) and view him wrastling with that loathsome, and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome enemie, even the <hi>bodie of death,</hi> sometime taking, sometime giving the foyle, crying out for helpe, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth into thankes for his victorie, it doth not onely cleare our understanding, but powerfully workes on our affections, shewes our enemie, and kindles us against him; first teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="8"/>us, that fight we must; then instructs us how to fight how to overcome, and how to use the conquest.</p>
   <p>Therefore I dare boldly affirme, and every good <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> experience will confirme it, no portion of scripture yeelds more comfort to a soule struggling with sinne, and almost fainting under the burthen of corruption, then that duell there managed by the Apostle under the persōs of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And this is the reason why the booke of <hi>Psalmes</hi> is by all acknowledged the most profitable, and usefull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> because we here behold lively drawne, by <hi>Gods</hi> owne finger, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the face, and hands (the outward profession, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) but the very heart of that man, who was according to <hi>Gods</hi> owne heart: and so may take there a full view of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry limb, and be acquainted with every joynt, and feature of the new, and inward man: wee shall there see that heart e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in action, continually drawing from that living fountain the word (to which it cleaues unseparably) the waters of life, and having throughly concocted them in the affection, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning them againe to every part for growth and practice.</p>
   <p>Sometime we may perceiue him, as a Conquerour, with that stone which the builders refused, casting downe the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> which de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ies the <hi>Israel</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> even every high thing, which exalst it selfe against the knowledge of <hi>God</hi>; yea with his head in his hand, bringing into captivitie every thought to the obedience of <hi>Christ</hi>; sometime againe faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as in the battell with <hi>Ishibenob</hi>) under the speare of those uncircumcised affections, which still border on <hi>Gods</hi> people, and are sworne, and restles enemies against the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Here may you view him tugging, with that roring Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>who seeks whom he may devour,</hi> and reskuing out of his mouth that almost lost sheep; there againe compast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with mighty bulls of <hi>Basan,</hi> gaping on him with their mouths, bayted with <hi>dogs,</hi> even <hi>the assembly of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and crying</hi> lowd for helpe, that his soule may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the sword, and the power of the dog. Oft-times
<pb facs="8"/>you may heare him, like the Larke, singing, and mounting in his song; his heart well tuned, and his tongue co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sorting with it, both full to the brinks, and overflowing with praise, and thanksgiving, yet often mourning like a dove, and chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering like a swallow, his spirit drunke up, and sinking in the deepe waters, sticking fast in the mire, where no stay is: sometime faith even soring so high that it is sing'd with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, sometime plunged in the deep labouring for life, altogether benumbd, and almost frozen in despaire.</p>
   <p>In a word, the Booke of <hi>Psalmes</hi> is a field, where we may be most skilfully trained in all our <hi>Christian</hi> warfare: where this great Commander, famous for earthly, but far more renowned for heavenly victories, will breed us up in skill, and courage by his owne example: where, of the one side wee shall learne to know all our spirituall enemies, their colours, weapons, stratagems, their manner of charging; of the other side our Captain, succours, armours offensive, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, our discipline, conflict, victory, and triumph, and all these not onely by relation, but action in our fellow-souldier, and an old experienced Commander.</p>
   <p>This was the cause why having in the flock (over which the great <hi>Shepheard</hi> hath set me) for some yeers layed a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the more contemplative, and doctrinall parts of scripture; I after desired to build on this ground, and lead them on to the practicall, here to learne of this holy <hi>Psalmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>t,</hi> how to doe that, which they have there learnt must be done. In this little brooke this net hath not wholy beene in vaine; which hath perswaded me to let it downe into the sea; I haue not fished for vaine glory, or applause of men, nor used such trammels, as may enclose any such game. He that hath spent most labour this way, hath tooke nothing, but that prouerb: <hi>He hath fished fair, and caught a frog.</hi> But if <hi>Christ</hi> may receiue any glory from hence, or any of his members pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </hi> I heartily commend thee true <hi>Christian</hi> Reader; earnestly praying, thou mayst grow in knowledge; and more, in practise of what thou knowest.</p>
