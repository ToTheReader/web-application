   <head>To the right Honourable the L. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls, and to the right Worshipful the Senators of the Common wealth of <hi>Bream, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi> and <hi>Boxtehud,</hi> his Lords and Patrons most highly to be reuerenced, salutation and tranquilitie.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a thing to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> (right Honorable &amp; Worshipful) that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man,<note place="margin">The miseries of the life of man.</note> through the fal of our first Parent, is runne into suche miserie, yea, and so farre blinded, that is, must continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beare not onely manye discommodities, tentations of Sathan, persecutions of menne, wars, troubles, famines, al kind of diseases, and finally death it selfe, but also that it neyther vnderstandeth the causes of these euilles, nor yet seeketh or receiueth fitte remedies for the same.</p>
   <p>For there are many of so peeuishe nature, that if they know any, that can both shew thē their greef, &amp; also giue them medicin against the same, &amp; be moreouer willing so to do, they think that they are rather to laugh at them, &amp; to beare grudg and hatred against them, then friendly to heare them, or to giue them any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde for their labour. Which despite, if anye
<pb facs="17"/>
in the world, truly Diuines &amp; Phisitions are wont especially to feele: as who then at length begin to be hated of some, when as they haue done them most good, &amp; do proue indeed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience true, that which <hi>Xenophō</hi> affirmeth, namely shamlesnes to be the companion of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnes. Which thing although it bee so, &amp; that I my self sōtimes haue had profe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet haue I not iudged, that I ought therfore to slack diligently to do the dutie of a Christiā Phisition, both in studying out of such thinges, as are profitable, &amp; in putting thē in practise which I haue founde out, by al meanes that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in me, with hand and foote. Wherfore, whē as certaine yeeres past, folowing the counsaile of <hi>Mesua,</hi> wherin he biddeth in althings to set God before, I haue published, and put forth 2. treatises of matters in diuinitie, which are the true Phisick of the soule: in the one whereof, which is written against the absurd and fond heresies of our time, I haue gone about to roote out false opinions, being as it were corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: in the other, which is entituled, of the knowledge of the wil, &amp; grace of God, &amp; of the fruits &amp; signes of this true knowledg, my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was with sound doctrine of Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as it were with good &amp; holsom nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to feede and strengthen the vnskilfull: I
<pb facs="17"/>
many times thought, and hereafter wil think, if God spare me life, according to my power, to perfourme the same, in mine own proper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, that is, in the Phisicke of the bodye.</p>
   <p>But whereas I haue spoken of Diuinitie,<note place="margin">The studie of diuinitie apper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taineth vnto al.</note> I would not haue it so taken, as if I meant rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thrust my sickle into an other man his har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uest, &amp; to play the busie body. For letting passe great &amp; weightie controuersies, I onely dealt with those things, which are approued of al, or inueighed against such things, which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of the better sorte, and that with such reasons, which I haue learned &amp; marked, both in the schooles and also in the Church Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it no vnlawful thing, if the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler render some parte of his Lesson: sith it is manifest by the testimony of al men, that from the first beginning of the world, euen vnto our time, it is not onely right and lawful, that men indued with the vse of reasō, might iudge of re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion, but also that it is profitable and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, that they be able perfectly to iudge, that is to saye: to discerne and knowe the false from the true, the hurtfull from the holsome, the counterfeited by men, from that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by God. For like as al men consiste of two partes, that is, of a soule, and of a bodye, so also there ought to be in al men a twofolde
<pb facs="18"/>
action: one, wherewith it becommeth vs to magnifie God, and to prayse him: the other, whereby we are bounde to imploye our studie and trauaile vpon the Common wealth. And as there is notwithstanding great kinred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them selues, betweene these two parts, albeit they be distinct and seueral by nature: so these actions cannot without great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes bee parted asunder, the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
   <p>Wherefore they doe very wickedly, whiche doe so follow their wordly busines, either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or priuate, that they haue either none at all, or else verye small regarde of diuine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and not like men, which for the studie of diuinitie doe for slow their matters at home &amp; abroad. Vnto whith iudgemente your wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome also giueth moste honourable witnesse, whilest in your Cities you studie not onely this, that your citizens may liue together commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously and quietly, but also beeing instructed in the doctrine of saluation most rightly, maye walke godly and holyly. For where but one of these thinges onely is cared for, it cannot bee, that the Common wealth &amp; the Church can any long time be happily gouerned. Which thing, besides the examples of certaine other countryes, the most afflicted kingdō of France,
<pb facs="18"/>
and the miserable Prouinces of the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in Flaunders (alas for pitie) doe at this day declare. For what other cause is there of their miserie, such almost as hath not beene heard of, than the contempt of pure religion, the not caring for the trueth of God, and the wicked persecution of those which were follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of true godlines? For whilest the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate doth rather seeke to maintaine his own authoritie then the pure seruice of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streineth his subiects to obey his wil, rather then the wil of God: And finallye giueth eare to the counsailes of moste wicked Doeg and Machiauel, rather then vnto the counsailes of Gamaliel and Abdias: there must needs folow such effects, as there haue gone causes before. And because y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I know you with al your heart to detest this hurtful opinion &amp; meere tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical kind of gouernment: &amp; rather endeuour hereunto, that it may go very well with your subiects of your dominiō, aswel in minde, as bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, I cannot chuse but highly commend this godly meaning, &amp; most holy care of yours: and not only cōmēd it, but also according to my duty with my labour &amp; trauail such as it is, to help forward the same. For as much therfore as at this time y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> same sore sickenes of the plague,<note place="margin">De ther. ad pison.</note> w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Galē doth rightly tearm a cruel Dragon, doth be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginne
<pb facs="19"/>
to breed euery where through out al our countrie of Germanie in a manner, &amp; is very hot in some places not farre from vs, and as it goeth, like vnto a Canker, eateth vppe all the thinges that are next vnto it: manye learned Phisitions haue written diligently of the curing of those, which are taken with this disease, &amp; also of the preseruation of euerye perticular person, &amp; haue left their counsails in whole bookes, a practise greatly doubtlesse to be commended: but beecause I haue perceiued this their endeuour not to be sufficiēt, but that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> infectiō is daily neuertheles increased, &amp; gro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>weth with his stirring, &amp; gathereth strēgth by going, especialy because there is no publike course &amp; order taken for the auoyding of this euil, I haue cōsidered, that there is need of sōe greater help, namly, which must be vsed by the authority of the magistrat, in whose trauel the chief hope of staying this miserie consisteth &amp; lieth. Concerning w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>, whē as in times past I had gathered somthing, which I had noted in most famous Cities &amp; countries, partly by vse and experience, &amp; partly had iudged to be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto reason, I thought it might be a work worth the trauaile, if I should beat it again v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the anuil, &amp; set it forth: that if happily sōe certaine could be perswaded, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> for the turning away
<pb facs="19"/>
of this euil some thing might bee done by the trauaile of man, they might haue some course to folow: and that if they should thinke some thing to be wanting in my counsaile and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, they might in deed and trauaile thēselues supplie the same. For this cause is not suche, which may content it self only with fine speech &amp; fit laying foorth of the matter, but such as being once with wisdome aduised vpon, must betimes be accomplished, and (as they say) bee brought into action.</p>
   <p>And whereas right honorable my meaning hath beene to dedicate this my paines ioyntly to your L L. there were two causes especially mouing me thereunto: of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> which the first did seeme to binde me as it were by a certaine du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: as in whose dominion I haue now spent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most these 18. yeeres, &amp; haue had a publike stipende of the common wealth of <hi>Breme</hi> in especiall, and minding in a maner there to end my life, that of whom I haue receiued most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same I might rēder again as much duty as in me lyeth. The second was cōsidered of me in the misterie of your number cōsisting of three, whilest that in this Bishopricke you seemed vnto me as it were in one body to repre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent three principal members, the braine, the hearte, and the liuer, and in great consent of
<pb facs="20"/>
mindes, in agreeable gouernment of your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and finally in peaceable folowing of true religion, to resemble a most beautifull harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of a trinitie: wherein I iudged my selfe to owe this dutie not to one of 3. (especially sith this care appertaineth indifferently vnto all magistrates) but vnto three rather in one. Wherefore it shall bee your part (right honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and most reuerend Lords &amp; Patrones) to take in good woorth this testimonie of my readie good will and seruice, and to take as commended vnto you, this care of the cōmon saftie, which I haue heere in some measure portraited and drawen out. Which things if at any time they shall be ouerruled by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, which cannot bee called backe, it shall be sufficient to haue approued your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour and good will vnto men. Christe Iesus the true turner away of all euill, and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition as wel of the body as of the soule, begottē of vnbegotten, God in man, true life in death, (that I may end with the woordes of Egysip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus) preserue you with your subiectes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt of this deadly infection, and alwaies in good health. Dated at <hi>Breame</hi> in the yeere <hi>1581.</hi>
