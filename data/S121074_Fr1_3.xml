      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen,</hi> I had hop't, in a cause of such conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as is the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration of Trade,</hi> wherein all of vs by <hi>Sympathie</hi> haue our part, and feele the waight; the very <hi>Vinculum amicitiae,</hi> would haue knit vs all together, in that same <hi>Idem velle &amp; nolle,</hi> to haue beene all of one minde for the Common good. Or if I had therein seemed to any of you, more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then wise, you would haue hid that fault vnder your good interpretation of my zeale for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, wherein all of you haue your interest: And that every one of you would haue beene more readie, to haue lent mee a supply in your confirmation, then a
<pb facs="7"/>reply by way of refutation: that so <hi>Iunctis ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> wee might all of vs haue essayed to repaire the decay of Trade, none to ruinate. Nor indeed can I so say of any of you: for <hi>Malynes</hi> is with vs, but he is not of vs: if hee had beene of vs, hee had not beene against vs, in the <hi>Common-good.</hi> You know, it is the Counsell of <hi>The King of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,</hi> to beware of those that come to vs in <hi>Sheeps clothing: Malynes</hi> would teach our Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men a way how to improue their <hi>Wolles:</hi> but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that collour, would cozen vs of the <hi>Cloth.</hi> This is one marke, whereby you may know, hee is not of vs: and if yet you would haue another, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him with his <hi>Par:</hi> and by these two you shall know him <hi>Ex vngue.</hi> Two such <hi>Pars</hi> to <hi>Pare</hi> away the <hi>Wealth,</hi> of our <hi>Cōmon-wealth,</hi> as I haue not observed to be proiected by any in all my time. Him and them I leaue to your Iudgement, when you haue perused this ensuing short Discourse. The charge and trouble whereof, but worth neither, you may thank your selues, to haue drawne vpon you, by your too ready entertainment of such things as these. Hereafter I doubt not, but your experience will direct your acceptance, vnto things of better worth. If not, or if you respect me; I shal expect that
<pb facs="7"/>you <hi>Paire</hi> me with some better <hi>Par.</hi> In the meane time, I shall presume, that in your interpretation and sentence, you will bee like your selues: and if any thing herein, chance to be lesse pleasing to any of you; that you will be pleased to beleeue, that I may haue some reason also for that, more then was fit to write. Here and there, if you meete with a little <hi>Latine,</hi> or the like, which you doe not like; let it alone for their sakes that vnderstand it: and if you will take my word, there's sense besides, and not a word of it but of some vse, in the whole discourse: and no more reason to be thurst out of the <hi>Circle of Commerce,</hi> then out of the Circle of all other sciences, which haue ever enioyed that liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception. God grant that your perusall and my paines, may bring some glorie to God, honour to the King, benefite to the Publique: to all which I am truely deuoted, and therein,</p>
