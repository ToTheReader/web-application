   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y louing brethren, if this smal treatise shal happen to come into your hands, I pray you giue it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, make it fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar vnto you, by often reading the same. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you haue in your studies many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent works of this argument, <hi>Hyperius, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmus, Hemmingius, Daneus,</hi> and our good countreyman Maister <hi>Perkins, &amp;c.</hi> Yet you shall finde here many things that are more sutable to vs countrey Diuines, which haue pastorall charges. For I know not how it commeth to passe, that many haue long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored in their Ministrie, and yet haue little or nothing profited their auditorie. Many causes there are of this nonproficiencie, in
<pb facs="4"/> some ignorance, in others negligence, and the iust iudgement of God vppon the people (who because they doo not hunger and thirst after righteousnes,<note place="margin">Math. 5. Acts, 16. Act. 17.</note> nor attend vnto the preaching of the word, as <hi>Lydia</hi> the purple-seller did vnto <hi>Paul,</hi> nor search the scriptures with the noblemen of <hi>Berea</hi>) therfore their harts are blinded with the Israelites, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne and despise Christ with the proude Pharisies.<note place="margin">Ioh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</note> But in my conceit, this is not the least hinderaunce to the prosperitie of the Church, when as the Pastors and Ministers of the same haue no respect, neither how they liue, neither how they teach. Here therfore is plotformed vnto vs, what the life, and what the doctrine of Ministers ought to be, &amp; here is set downe a plain and easie method of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the word of God aright.<note place="margin">Dan. 12.</note> If we then bee desirous <hi>to shine as the brightnes of the firmament, and to be as the stars for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and euer, let vs teach others by our life and doctrine, and endeuor to turn many vnto righteousnesse.</hi> Let vs not preach our selues, but Christ crucified, not for filthie lucre, but of a readie mind, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king only the glorie of God, and the conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="4"/> of the souls of our brethren, that we may vnfainedly protest with S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note>
      <hi>My word &amp; my preaching, stood not in <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
         </hi> intising speech of mans wisedom, but in plaine euidence of the spirit, and of power, that your fayth should not bee in the wisedome of men, but in the power of God.</hi> Thus beseeching the Lord for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie sake to blesse vs, and comfort vs, in this our troublesome and painefull calling, and to giue vs grace <hi>to take heed to our selues,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 20.</note>
      <hi>and to al the flocke whereof the holie ghost hath made vs ouerseers, to feed the Church of God, which hee hath purchased with his owne bloud:</hi> In all dutiful loue I take my leaue.</p>
