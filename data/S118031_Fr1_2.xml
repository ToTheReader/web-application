                 <title>Redde debitum. Or, A discourse in defence of three chiefe fatherhoods : grounded upon a text dilated to the latitude of the fift Commandement; and is therfore grounded thereupon, because 'twas first intended for the pulpit, and should have beene concluded in one or two sermons, but is extended since to a larger tract; and written chiefely in confutation of all disobedient and factious kinde of people, who are enemies both to the Church, and state.

      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS is a Piece which craves your Patronage. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines nothing but what is just and honest; and yet is like enough to meet with such as shall oppose it: For I both know
<pb facs="3"/>and finde it true by experience, that hee who sides not with the humours of the common multitude, incurres the <hi>odium</hi> of not a few. And indeed my comfort is, 'twas alwaies so: <hi>Obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit.</hi> That great Apostle could have said as much;<note place="margin">
         <hi>Galae.</hi> 4.15.16.</note> for whereas he remembers the good will that the <hi>Galatians</hi> once bore towards him, he findes the case quite alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and is now become their enemie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he telleth them what is truth: Not that he ever taught them other, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee presseth the more earnestly, where he fears or findes their reluctation. They had (as well appeareth) a minde to go astray; and he not yeelding to them, but directing otherwise, is slighted for his labour. But if it be good (as he also spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) to be zealously affected alwaies in a good thing; 'tis fit that men submit and learne with patience, till they come to the knowledge of what is good; otherwise their zeale cannot but be preposterous, and violent passions take place of true and
<pb facs="3"/>righteous informations. This is that which I only ayme at, a rectifying of such as walke amisse: and if herein my poore endeavours may but finde a curteous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, I account my paines as much as nothing; being alwaies willing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote what I can, the happie prosperitie both of the Church and State. When therefore this Booke which I now send abroad, shall be so happie as to kisse any of your hands; be pleased to shelter it under the zealous wings of your favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable protection. And so praying God to blesse you alwaies; I rest devoted to do you the best service that I can,</p>
