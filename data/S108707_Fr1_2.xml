      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F Euents</hi> be the certainest and least suspected <hi>Councellors</hi> as they that cannot looke but like themselues: for their sakes I hope to be accepted, and for their sakes to haue so much of the priuiledge of an historian as to be allowed to speake truth; which if it carrieth no other then it owne beauty, cal it not a fault, since thereby I giue you proofe I desire not to steale your opinions with inticements. I haue deliuered you the last <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>This;</hi> that out of the experience of both, you may frame the succeeding. I haue spoken them truly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is fit you should see them in their nakednes, for to iudge by them is to know them without colours. Lastly I haue touched, (though not neere to the life) the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble happines of this Iland in our Prince; A Prince whose vertues giue luster to his authority, and that authority to his actions; so as he needs not the pruiledge of his fortune, since all his performances are able to stande vpon their owne force, needing neither countenaunce nor power to giue them reputation. Amongest his vertues I haue showed his vprightnes, that lighted by that great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you may bee free from all partialities. Thus haue I
<pb facs="3"/>
performed the duty I owe to you, and my Country, I knowe honestly: if you thinke so my rewarde is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Free I am from hiding a corrupted will vnder ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretence; And as I haue finished this epistle without mingling it with salutations or excuses, so haue I passed through the boundes of my purpose, wooing no one but all, and all without any other aduocate but truth, the colours vnder which all honest spiritts and good Common-wealthes-men ought to venture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. And so not doubting but the same minde that is truly inclined to the good of his country will allowe my intent and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my errors, I rest.</p>
