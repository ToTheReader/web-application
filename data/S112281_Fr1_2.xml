   <head>To the right Honorable and vertuous Lady, the Lady Margaret Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas, hir grace, Countesse of Lineux, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Robinson Citizen of London, wisheth long and happie life, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of honour, and the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euerlasting bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse.</head>
   <p>HORACE the POET testifieth (right Honourable and vertuous Ladie) that Poets in times past, haue beene addicted either to profit and pleasure them selues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, either else in commune to write both sweet and necessary things, for the life of their posteritie. As Heathen Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets haue had this humour, meriting wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie fame, in that by their fained imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, they semed to fauour &amp; further the welfare of humaine life. So other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue indeuoured, but not all leueling by one liue to publish their works, some after one manner, some after another, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according as the holy spirit of God
<pb facs="3"/>
had operation of their harts, either lese as their owne singularitie lead them to profit and pleasure them selues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whose imperfection, as their age could not so well discerne, but flattered hir selfe with the nusled ignorance of the time then present, sleeping in absurditie: so when it pleased y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lord to spred forth the bright beames of his glorious gospel ouer the nations of the earth, such as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured of the spirit of God, haue more &amp; more illuminated thē selues &amp; others &amp; such as were blinded in their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, beeing nakedly manifested to the world, haue with the world bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ful perfection, and awaked out of their dreames, by their posteritie: wher vpon euen the most ancient Poets, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiographers &amp; writters, were they now liuing, they might finde no small occasiō to reioyce at the good industrie of their posteritie, euen in these dayes where it is apparantly extāt, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> by studious practitio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners of our age, the workes of sundry aū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authors haue made the most fertile increase of fallowed groūds by the sweat of others, which their remisnesse and
<pb facs="3"/>
imperfection had left as wast ground beefore, whereby their fame is more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified then decreased, vertue more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced then abandoned, and the age present &amp; henceforth more edified, then defrauded of so noble benifits of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and perfection of lyfe.</p>
   <p>This as my simple capacitie by dayly experiēce could comprehend in the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes of others: So reputing it a thing acceptable and laudable with God and man, I haue wished such abilitie in mee, that I might wade through this streame, to the gratefull acceptation of God, and the world. And the rather doe I take good courage vnto mee heere in, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I haue founde no small gratefull good will of such as in this my natiue Countrie, fauouringe vertue and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering good literature, haue once or twise heeretofore accepted my former slender consecrated studies, in such sort, that I agnize my selfe more indebted to them in power and good will, then I am able, or thinke I shall bee able to performe requitall to their condigne demerites. Among whome the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="4"/>
testimonie of your honours most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bountie, hath not a little excited mee to the consideration of my greatefull du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie heerein. And I cannot tell whether God giues it mee for my good hap, that I lately had this worke brought mee by one, whom I suppose sauoureth my good proceeding in, this pointe. Albeit this worke it selfe (beefore I toke it in hand) was both of imperfect phrase in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie, &amp; of indecent application in the Moralitie, bearing the title of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Gesta Romanorum: which when I had diligently perused the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance thereof, I thought it beehooued mee so to trauaile therein, that I might not onely make a simple thing better, but so to handle the same, that it might gaine mee the better credit for my good meaning. And when I had reformed and repolished so well as I could, the seuerall histories, &amp; corrected the application of the Moralitie in many places, I thought best to adde therevnto (not impertinent for better light and farther intelligence of the Readers capacitie) a forme of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb facs="4"/>
purposed before euery history which being done, I intituled it A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde of auncient Histories, videlicet, Gesta Romanorum, newly persued and corrected, wherein wishing to bee profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and pleasing the best, gratefull vnto all, and grudged of none, voide of scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and blemish of suspition in euerye part, I yeelde the same with all humble and heartie duety, vnder the Honorable patronage and protection of your most noble &amp; magnificent prerogatiue. Most humbly crauing pardon of your honour for my bolde presumption, in dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so simple a trauaile vnto you, and no lesse humbly beseeching your good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishippes thanckfull acceptaunce of my vttermost good will in presentatiō here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I hope then to haue the better good will of all others, for supportation of my pretended good meaning heerein. And so right Honourable and vertuous Ladye, shall I finde manifold causes of dutiefull respensation what I may, though to dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pēse I shal not be able, yet in good will &amp; power, I am &amp; will bee prest to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost performāce of my exacted due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
<pb facs="5"/>
In practise &amp; prayer, resting boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to all my will willers. Vnto the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God I pray amongst all others for the long and prosperous good estate of your Honour in this life: And finally for your established felicitie immutable in the life euerlasting, which God graunte.</p>
   <closer>Amen.</closer>
