      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have observed in private families, that the carefull father disposing of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to several imployments, sends some to school, some to his plough, some to his flocks, while perchance the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, as uncapable of greater businesse, has the libertie to play in his hall. So is it in our Society (which joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledges you our carefull and indulgent parent) those of stronger abilities, more reading, and longer experience, are busied some in one, some in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the graver and more serious studies: while I, the last of that learned Body, am task'd to these light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er exercises. Accept, Sir, a thing born at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and preserved by your patronage. Not but that I vow the fruits of my more precious houres to your service: for when I consider the magnificence of our buildings, the riches of our endowments, the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of those before me, and all these bless'd in your auspicious government; I finde a fire kindled in my breast, whose flame aims higher, and tells me, so glorious a hive the royall Founders meant not to shelter drones. So wishing our whole Body long hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in so provident a Governour, I rest, what my oath and peculiar ingagements have bound me to be,</p>
