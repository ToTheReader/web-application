   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Publication of this subiect whereof now I write, hath bin by importunitie extorted from me, who would haue beene content to haue concealed it, knowing the diuersitie of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning things of this nature, and that not among the ignorant, but among some of the learned. For my part I meddle hearewith nothing but matter of fact, and to that ende produce the Testimony of the liuing and the dead, which I hope shall be Authenticall for the confirmation of this Narration, and free mee from all censorious mindes and mouthes. It is none of my intent here to discusse, or dispute of Witches or Witchcraft, but desire most therin to be dispensed with
<pb facs="3"/>
all, knowing, that in such a little Treatise as this is, no matter that can be effectuall therein can pe compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; especially, in so short a time of deliberation, as three or foure dayes. And the rather doe I now publish this to purchase my peace, which without it being done, I could scarse at any time be at quiet, for many who would take no nay, but still desired of me written Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of this insuing Declaration. Another reason was to defend the truth of the cause, which in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, hath receiued a wound already, by most base and false Ballets, which were sung at the time of our retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the <hi>Witches</hi> execution. In them I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to see and heare such ridiculous fictions of her bewitching Corne on the ground, of a Ferret and an Owle dayly sporting before her, of the bewitched wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man brayning her selfe, of the Spirits attending in the Prison: all which I knew to be fitter for an Ale-bench then for a relation of proceeding in Court of Iustice. And thereupon I wonder that such lewde Balletmong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers should be suffered to creepe into the Printers pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and peoples eares.</p>
