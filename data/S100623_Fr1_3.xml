                 <title>The philosophers banquet : Newly furnished and decked forth with much variety of many severall dishes, that in the former service were neglected. Where now not only meats and drinks of all natures and kinds are serued in, but the natures and kinds of all disputed of. As further, dilated by table-conference, alteration and changes of states, diminution of the stature of man, barrennesse of the earth, with the effects and causes thereof, phisically and philosophically. Newly corrected and inlarged, to almost as much more. By W.B. Esquire</title>

   <p>Good Reader, many things hath beene written by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, and the over cloying humor of this age hath so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened the world with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of al kinds, that searce there is one subject left, upon the head whereof a hundred haue not trampled over: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which impartial hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, if it bee possible to say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one corner hath escaped this scrutenous search, and
<pb facs="6"/>
beene raked over with a ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hand than other, I may say it is this, although not denying, but most parts hereof have beene formerly handled and drawne into large volumes, both to the tediousnesse and cost of the Reader and buyer, whereas in this they are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and briefly abridged, to be turned unto with facility and ease; diuers excellent additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things very materiall and necessary, out of <hi>Albertus Magnus, Lemnius Scotus,</hi> and others, being in this second impression inserted, which in the former addition were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, (although very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to this purpose and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) the which whosoever hath formerly bought and read in the infancy and imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="6"/>
shall not repent him to doe it againe in this maturity and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>penesse it is now growne unto. The use of this Booke is, to make a man able to judge of the disposition and state of his owne body, of the effects, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and dispositions of those things wee daily feed our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with. The next is, to giue vs a generall insight and briefe knowledge of Emperours and Kings, or men of greatest place and eminencie that are most notified in the world for vertue or vice. All these interlaced, with excellent positions, witty questions and answers upon divers and sundry argument<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>, the perfect use and insight whereof, doth accomplish a man for discourse, behaviour and argument at the Table of
<pb facs="7"/>
our superiours: Written first by <hi>Michael Scotus</hi> in Latine, and for the benefit, good approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and like thereof, formerly done into English; and now thirdly published and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (being a booke of speciall notice in this kind) to as much more, by the same Author;</p>
