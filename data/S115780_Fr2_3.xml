To be bryefe, it is worthy to be written on the dore sylles, and on the dores of the house. And (oh) I woulde to God, that the voyce of the lord, myght (as the vehemēt sowne of the heauenly trumpe) astonny the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of all men so, that the drousye and slougyshe myght leaue theyr slouthe and idlenesse, and the forwarde and willynge be encouraged. For we see that mankynde (not muche inferioure vnto the angelles) is negligent, &amp; wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ignorante of hys owne worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so that he is letted and holden backe with innumerable other occupa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions and busynesses, and as the wyse man sayeth.

Nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther do they passe for the manyfolde rewardes that wysedome promyseth when she calleth them, nor yet for the punyshmentes that she threateneth. They passe not though she crye neuer so often in the myddes of the multytu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des, and in the greate gates of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye sayenge.

And what diligence was that so greately praysed: or what sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of money was it, that he lent and woulde receyue agayne with vsurye: It nedeth vs not to sende into far coū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>treys for straunge merchaundise. Yea we mai gain much more precious thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges at home, that is to saye, our owne soules vnto christ, for the which al the world can not be a sufficient pryce. we may adourne &amp; decke our soules with vertues, which are the true &amp; vncoūtre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fayt richesses.

preysed aboue all martchaundyse of golde, sayenge vnto hys sonne, Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye is the man that hathe aboundaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce of wysdome.<note place="margin">Matth. xxv. mar. xiij Luce. xij xix</note> So greate a treasure, so innumerable commodities may we get vs, yf we bestowe the talent that is geuen vs a ryght.

whereby all workes muste be tryed, whether they be iuste or vniuste, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby all spirites muste be tryed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of god or not, the keye wherwith the heauens be shut and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, the instrument wherwith we do confort the werynesse of thys oure exile, the soueraygne medicyne, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with all dyseases are cured, the presēt remedye agaynst all daungers, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyques of Christe beynge absent frō vs, which we ought to kepe, obserue and worshyppe with all deuocyon, the chariote of fayth, the carbunkle of cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritye: after that, I saye, the worde of fayth is praysed and set furth vnto vs by these names and many other,<note place="margin">Matth. xxv</note> christ also praysed it callynge it a summe of money or talent, and by these names he doeth also prouoke vs vnto mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaundyse, to put vs in mynde, that we haue not receyued it for oure sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues onelye, but for others also. And notwithstandynge that he, by hys spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite, worketh all thynges in all: yet doeth he make vs hys workemen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng but onely hys instrumentes. And
<pb facs="55"/>
as he hath in heauen his ministrynge spirites: so hathe he in the earthe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted vs his spirituall ministers, and stuwardes of his spiritual miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to thentent that we shoulde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate vnto our brothers for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke the celestiall philosophie, euen with lyke charitie as he brought it from heauen vnto vs. Neyther is it vnfea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melye to calle syluer moneye, but the money that is shut vp in the coffer is not moneye, euen by the testimonie of the heathen, which affirme that there cometh no fruite of moneye, if it be not vsed, and this thynge taketh place chifelye in spirituall thynges. For they are geuen, for the moste parte, not so muche for oure priuate commo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditye, as for the profite of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacyon. Wysedome (sayeth the wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) that is hyd, &amp; the treasure that is not seene, what vtilyte or profyte co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of either of them. And therfore hath God geuen vs hys worde, not that we shoulde hyde it vnder the grounde, but set it abroade for the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyte of others. And therfore muste we
<pb facs="55"/>
before all other thynges see, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe thys talent, the fayth in Christe, and the charitie towarde oure neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures do increase, and that we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer oure soules from worldely desy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res, from the tyranny of pryde and en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uye, and to be briefe, that we get suche a treasure, that we be made newe mē, strayngers in thys worlde, and (put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge of the olde Adam) partetakers of heauen, not carnall but spirituall. For to dyge in the ground, is to be car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal, and to knowe and teache thynges that be carnal. Nowe yf we beyng car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal, shoulde presume to teach other the thynges that be spiritual: we shoulde not teach them, but for our sakes shall the worde of god be yuell spoken of. And for as muche as in our lyfe we serue the deuyll, and Christe in oure wordes: we shall hynder more with oure lyfe, then we shal profyte wyth oure wordes. It is the parte of an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryte, to carye in hys hande, the Te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stament, goodly beset with golde and gylted, and to dispute and reasone
<pb facs="56"/>
of the worde of God in euerye feaste or bākette, and yet in the meane tyme, to lyue as one voyed of all mercye, im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pacient, ignoraunte of charitye, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myndefull of modestye, and paste all shame. The eternall wysedome loueth none suche preachers, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge that it suffereth them. But we muste see that we honoure and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence god in hys miracles and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that he wrought, illumyne oure soules with hys helthsome doctryne, and that we (conceyuyng a sure hope in god through hys benefyte shewed) do inwardely burne with the fyer of loue. To conclude after that we (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge ryche of spiritual gyftes) haue gayned one talent by an other, and do possesse two talentes, that is to saye ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe and doctryne: then muste we go for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde merilye,<note place="margin">Eph. vi</note> gyrdyng vp our loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and pullyng on oure shoes to go forwarde in the Gospel of peace, that we may also wynne the soule of oure brothers. For thys is the wyll of god, that vntyll suche tyme as Christ was gone into heauen, secrete thynges
<pb facs="56"/>
shoulde be spoken secretely in the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of our frendes, but fence he is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and the spirite comē, deniynge him selfe to noman that wyll desyre hym vnfaynedlye:<note place="margin">Mat. x. mar. iiij. Lu. viij. xij. Matth. xxviij mar. xvi i. co. iiij a Iob. xij c Sap. i. b</note> he would that the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell should be preached on the toppes of houses, &amp; that the preachers should runne into all the costes of the earthe, and declare the gospel vnto all naciōs estates, ages &amp; sexes, in whome was any hope of any sparke of light, what shoulde candles do vnder a busshell. What shoulde money do without gai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes. And what shoulde fyre do,<note place="margin">mat. v. b mar. iiij. Lu. viijb &amp; xi. c</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it burne. Furthermore, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were not sufficed with the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge of helthfull doctryne, whylse they were yet on lyue in thys worlde, but to the intent to profite theyr poste<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryte, they occupyed theyr pennes, that the spiritual traualle myght contynu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beynge forth spirituall children. All they therfore be without Christiā charitie, and are infideles, whiche do let preachynge, and do forbyd that the christian people shoulde haue the new Testament, &amp; the olde, to reade there
<pb facs="57"/>
in theyr common tonge, as thoughe our misteries were oracles, and the christian writtynges contayned in the any thynge that loueth darkenesse. No doubte we are muche bounde to thanke God, for that he hath geuen the lyght of hys trueth vnto al nacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in theyr owne tonges and lāgua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And besydes that euery nacyon is ryche in hys owne language: thys is also a syngular benifite, that we ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue hys worde purelye and vncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the greke tonge, euen as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles wrote it. So that yf they trans<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>latours haue in any place sayled of the true meanynge. We may by the firste copyes amende th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

Let vs be occupyed in them therfore. Not as the Pharisees, we sistynge on their chayres, do teache the thynges that they do not. Not as men destituted of charitye, &amp; as Angelles preachyng mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>steryes. Not as men tournyng syluer

For there is nothing to let in thys matter. There is no lack of money. For looe, we haue the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, we haue also the Epistles, and besydes that we haue the talent, not the crueltye of that Lorde that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth where he showed not,<note place="margin">Matth. xxv.</note> for looe we maye occupye thys at libertye.
<pb facs="58"/>
Let vs not laye for oure excuse, that we lacke cunninge or knowledge. For yf the word of God be in our hertes: we shall lacke neyther diligence nor wysedome.<note place="margin">Matth. xxv mar. xiij Luc. xij and xix.</note> Let vs thynke, that Christ hath not left vs money vnnumbred, but numbred, that is to saye a pounde of the which he wyl, that nothynge be conueyed awaye, nothynge altered or chaunged, nor any thynge spent in id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenesse.

vnfaythfull, he wyll condemne to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall tormentes. What shall ryches<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se auayle then: what shall honoure, what shall greate frendshyppe auayl, what shal any thyng auayle then.
