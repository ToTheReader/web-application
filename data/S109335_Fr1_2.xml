   <head>TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCESSE, Ladie Marguerite of France, Queene of Nauarre, and the onely sister of the most Christian King of France.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eneca</hi> the Philosopher (to whome without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, the learned among the Latines gaue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence for morall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie) saith in fewe words, but full of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that Fortune is neuer at rest; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that she vseth not to giue ioy without sadnesse, sweete without sowre, rest without labour, honour without enuie, and generally no felicitie vvithout his contrary: the vvhich novv I perceiue to be verified in my selfe. For vvhereas shee hath giuen me occasion of ioy
<pb facs="3"/>
in offering mee an oportunity to shew my dutifull reuerence to your royall Maiestie, and also to our famous Citie, by your happy approach thither: thereby she hath made me sad and melancholious, in that she hath so much hastened your said coming, that I had not the leisure to prepare and file these hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred morall Emblemes, accompanied with an hundred staues of verses, expositors of the same: the which in their first inuention (such as they are) I dedicate to your most excellent Maiestie. But that your Maiestie may not blame me, in that (following the errour of the Gentiles and Ethnickes) I attribute to Fortune that which (as a Christian writing to a Christian Princesse) I ought to attribute to Gods prouidence: I say therefore, that your said happy comming depēded not any whit vpon fortune, but (euen as do all other humane actions) onely vpon Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who (as it is necessary to beleeue) doth all things for the best: and that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently your sayd coming hath not bene to me hastie, but for the best. Wherefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
<pb facs="3"/>
the precedent with my selfe, I do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume humbly to present vnto your Maiestie my said Emblemes, although they haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but to halfe the number that I intended; beseeching your Maiestie to receiue them (such as they are) according to your accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med benignitie, and that with so good a will as they are by me your poore seruant offered and presented. Moreouer (Madame) it is not onely in our time that Emblemes are in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and singular regard, but it hath bene of ancient times and almost from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world: for the Egyptians (which thinke themselues to be the first people of the world) before the vse of letters, wrote by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures &amp; images, as well of men, beasts, fowles, and fishes, as of serpents, thereby expressing their intentions, as is written by most ancient authors, <hi>Chaeremon, Orus, Apollo,</hi> and the like, which haue laboured diligently and curiously to expound the saide hieroglyphicall figures: whereof likewise <hi>Lucan</hi> maketh mention in his <hi>Pharsalie,</hi> and <hi>Polyphile</hi> the author of the
<pb facs="4"/>
Moderns, in the description of his dreame, <hi>Clius Rhodiginus</hi> in his commentaries of the ancient readings. <hi>Alciat</hi> hath likewise in our time set out certaine Emblemes, and adorned them with Latine verses. And I (imitating these abouesaid) esteem the time wel bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which I employed in the deuising &amp; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of these saide Emblemes: and I shall think my selfe most happy, if the reading her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may yeeld you any honest recreation: pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God (most noble Princesse) that he will send you long life and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting happinesse.</p>
