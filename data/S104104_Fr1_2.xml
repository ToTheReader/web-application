once to dare to vent any the least misprision of you in these particulars, so would they continue blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials vnto you, albeit I had neuer beene borne, or these my lines had neuer beene directed vnto you; yea as these blessings from God stirre vp all good mindes to loue your ciuility, courtesie, Mansuetnesse, and good natures; so also are they as Precedents of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disposition to others, who seeking after grace striue to imitate, and expresse that in themselues, which they behold, and see in you. Flattery I haue euer hated, and accounted it the very basery of base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, yea I know it dwels no where, but in a base beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly, and degenerate breast. It is a plaine <hi>Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto,</hi> to as many as know you, and mee that not only publike Motiues, but priuate also both inuite, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force me to the tendering of this my loue, or rather to the rendering of this my thankfulnesse vnto you for your charity extended, both to my dead, and to my liuing. And I trust the God of heauen for Christ his sake will neuer wipe out that Christian kindenesses which you haue shewed to both. Touching this occurrence, you see in the frontispice what the summe is, which because it gaue some content to his sacred Maiestie; and for that I was not able, it being an itinerant Sermon so fully to expresse my self being streightned with shortnes of time, &amp; for asmuch as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers desired (because it was an vnusual Scripture to be handled) that, what I had deliuered with some speed in the voyce of a liuing Man to a few, might be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to the view of many, I haue beene contented to bury it in a dead letter, and subiect it to the censure

of more then a good many curious in this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious age. Especially hauing considered that indeed a mans liuely voyce moueth much, yet a mans wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting teacheth more. Words spoken are <gap reason="foreign">

These considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I say perswaded me to this ouerture. And the best is, that vsuall by word of <hi>Ne sutor vltra crepidam,</hi> cannot iustly be obtruded vpon me.
