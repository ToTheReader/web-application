      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Pious Christian whilst upō earth, takes his time to doe his taske, he is or would be, all in grace, and all to duty; well knowing that the time is short, the worke great, the wages sure; and that the best improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of parts and talents will bring
<pb facs="3"/>
in the master the greatest advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and himselfe the present and most lasting comforts: This is the fruit of a well led life, to advance God in glory and a Christian in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: such as serve God in fulfilling his will must to heaven, carry their graces with them, enter into their masters joy, &amp; if they be eminent in profession or publike in place, leave behind them their example, or some other monumēt to the world of their fidelity in their places; happy such servants that can thus imploy their times and improve their talents: This was the endeavour of that shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and burning lampe <hi>D.</hi> Sibbs the author of this work which I now make bold to present unto your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; such holy and usefull truths were delivered by him in his life

time, that the judicious conceive, may prove very profitable unto the Church, being published after his death; I conceive thus of the man; what he did in his ministery in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, or in his conference in private, it was done aptly, pithily and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably; his art was to hide his art, &amp; <note place="margin">Artis est ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare artem.</note> to say much in few words; he did not desire to cloud his matter from his hearers, or to walk so long about any one text, till errors were vented, or his auditors tired; you shall find him to be himselfe &amp; one constant to his own principles, al along the treatise; here you have no new errors broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or old truths deserted, but opened maintained and honoured, the glory of teachers, expectation of hearers, and recompence of readers.

(and let it still be) to content your selves with humble knowledge, cordial respect &amp; vitall expressions of received truths, that you are not in number with those that change their judgments, (and I feare their religion) as they do their frinds and fashions; being cōstant in inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and that with you it is not, truths <note place="margin">Non ex per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus fidem, sed ex fide personas, <hi>Tertul.</hi>
      </note> for persons, but persons for truth. I doubt not the admittance of these Sermons unto your respect &amp; patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; my only request is, that as the authour did honour you, so these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of his (now made publike) may bee as so many divine beames, holy breathings, and celestiall drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, to raise up your spirits to hate the dominion of the Beast, to helpe forward the ruine of mysticall Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, and all other Vnprosperous

buildings, and builders; that you may become Successefull seekers, gayning faith Triumphant, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the Hidden life, that at length you may obtaine the redemption of your bodies, knowing that <hi>Balaams</hi> wish is not enough, unles the faithfull Covenanter take you into covenant with himselfe, this alone yeelding to you the demand of a good conscience, which shall bee your defence against the Sword of reproach. These I leave with you, and you with God, and rest,</p>
