   <head>To the Christian reader, grace &amp; peace from Iesus Christ our Lord.</head>
   <p>THere came lately to my hands divers writings, controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sundry poynts of religion. The occasion of writing them, was, the cōtradicting &amp; spreading abroad as erroneous some doctrine taught by <hi>Mr Ainsvvorth</hi> one of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the English church at Amsterdam: The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception arising, as it seemeth, from <hi>Mr Broughton</hi> or a book of his lately set out touching <hi>corruption in handling of religion.</hi> Now of these writings, there were some, both from the one &amp; the other that wrote them cōmitted vnto me for the delivering of them, and (if I would) to take a copie. By reason wherof, as also considering that this controversie concerneth divers points of Religion profitable to be observed; and both parties (I take it) being willing to have them seen and dulie weyghed of any: I have thought it good to publish in print al the writings that hetherto have passed from one to another, not doubting but it may much further the truth And bring glorie vnto God. And now I desire both the Authors to take this my doing in good part, and thee (good Reader) indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to read &amp; equally to iudge of the matters here contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, as thou shalt see the truth by eyther of them to be proved vnto thee. Farewell.</p>
