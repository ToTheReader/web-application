   <p>In the dayes of <hi>Henrie</hi> the second of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> father to <hi>Charles,</hi> the
great massacrer and murderer of Godes Sayntes, when the Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ine
of the Gospell beganne to breake forth in that kingdome, and
the name of <hi>Hugonot</hi> as a by-word of reproch was giuen to the profes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sors
thereof: in the very entrie as it were of those troubles and hurlie
burleyes for religion, it is recorded of the Italian weomen and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
popularitie of that countrie, that hearing of the great sturre that
was then risen about those <hi>Hugonotes,</hi> they would needes knowe of
their gostlye fathers and holy inquintinge Fryers, what those <hi>French
Hugonotes</hi> were: vnto whom that deuoute and Pop-holy generation
(not vnlike themselues) made this wholesome and catholike answere:
<hi>That they were not men</hi> forsooth, <hi>but vglye and monstrous shapes of men,
headed like Dragons, faced like Dogges: eared like Swine, snoured like Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
with Boares tuskes and Asses iawes, yea such as would eate and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure
vp their owne mothers, &amp;c.</hi> wherevpon the poore weomen and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
multitude, neuer requyringe nor examining the matter any farther,
fell straight to a kinde of hissing &amp; clapping their hands, with most bit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
out cries and hatfull exclamations against them, with fie on them
wretches, fie on them wretches. Now even thus good reader (and no
better then thus) fareth it with me at this instant. The name &amp; sound
of <hi>Darrell,</hi> of his imprisonment, and the cause therof, hath in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
possessed &amp; overspread the whole land. why, what is he saith one?
what is the matter saith another? Answere is made presently and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilye
by our two English Inquisiters. <hi>Samuell Harsnet</hi> and his master,
togeather with such others, whom they with theire crooked conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
haue be witched, that <hi>Darrell</hi> is forsooth <hi>a cogger, a cousener,
a Iugler, an Exorcist, a counterfeite, a deuill-flinger, a deuill-driuer, a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer,
a deceiuer, an Impostor,</hi> and I know not what: that <hi>of an impious
simplicitie he holdeth it lawfull to lye, cogge and faine, so it be to a good end,
(as his fauorits tearme it,) to the glory of God, in which regard he hath tak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>en
vpon him to be deeplye seene in the mysterie of deuils, and hath playd his
publike prize in this iuglinge science, casting out more deuils by prayer and
fasting after a good dinner perhaps, then euer any? of the Apostlee did at so
full a season.</hi> And this in effect not onely the streetes and Tavernes
haue ronge off, but (as I haue bene informed) the very benches and
<pb facs="4"/>
Seates of Iustice haue sounded with the noyse of this <hi>Darrell,</hi> the <hi>deuil
driuer,</hi> and of the <hi>counterfeite</hi> trickes that he should teach. VVherein
notwithstandinge I thanke God, when they haue thundered out the
vttermost they can against me, I may truly say (and that with the testi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monie
of mine owne hart and conscience) that I am iust so guiltie of
the thinge they charge me with, as the fore-recited <hi>French Hugonotes</hi>
were of all that rablement wherewith they were so besmeared and de
pictured by that Italian munckish fraternitie. For if it be true that the
had heades like <hi>dragous,</hi> faces like <hi>dogges,</hi> eares like <hi>swine,</hi> snoutes like
<hi>serpentes,</hi> and that they would eate vp their <hi>mothers, &amp;c.</hi> Then is it also
true I confesse, that <hi>Darrell</hi> is such a mounstrous vile fellow as is heere
layd forth and described. But alas good reader this is no new thinge:
looke backe to ages past and thou shalt find it to be an old inueterate
ouerworne practise of sathan, newly furbished and set abroach againe
by his instrumentes, to paint out the professors of the gospell in the
most ougly deformed shape they can deuise: (as we see by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ and his Apostles and so consequently by his ministers spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially:)
not that they be such indeede as they are despitfully featured
out, but to this end, to make them more odiously enuied and maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
hated of the world, which is the speciall marke the enimy shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
at.</p>
   <p>Now the principall thinge that is charged vpon me, (and which I
haue all this while denied, and still denye) is, <hi>teachinge to counterfeite.</hi>
But what is this, that <hi>Darrell</hi> should thus <hi>teach to counterfeite?</hi> why no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
els forsooth, but a <hi>reall entrance and possession of the deuill of and
into the bodies of men, to be dispossessed and remooued thence by fasting and
prayer, and all to grace and make good the hipocriticall fasting and exercise
of the puritans, which otherwise (without some such fetches and deuises) wou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ld
prooue starke naught.</hi> This then we see is the sinne, if it be true. And
suerly allow it to be true and to be such indeede as they haue layde it
forth to be with all his circumstances, I my selfe will subscribe &amp; ioyne
with them in the condemnation of it to the bottome of hell, and the
sinner to the very depth of the graue, as wherin (if it be rightly examī<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
and weighed,) is closlye shut vp and included not onely the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of God and disgrace of his workes, but a foule and detestable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
of Godes church and a mocking of Gods people, with a scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and shameles contempt both of magistracy and ministerie. And
can not the wisdome and maiestie of the state of <hi>England</hi> finde out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
punishment and correction for so wretched and greiuous an enor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitie
as this? no question but it can, may, and ought, if the partie were
once orderlye and by law convicted. But as it was not the manner of
<hi>Romanes</hi> in auntient time for fauor to deliuer any mā to death before
<pb facs="4"/>
the partie accused had his accusers before him, &amp; leaue to defend him
selfe: so is it not the manner of the Honorable Courtes of Iustice in
<hi>England,</hi> to proceed to sentence before conviction, or to punishment
before apparant proofe. And this is it that hath and doth make me
more confident in defense of myne owne innocencie, and the equitie
of my cause, even the reuerent opinion and estimation that I haue of
the ordinarie courtes of Iustice in this land, before whom whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
I shalbe called, I know it is not a hundred of such lying and libel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling
discourses as this of <hi>Samuell Harsnetes,</hi> that shall any way swaye
them, either to sentence or censure the meanest of her Maiesties sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iectes
without euidence and proofe.</p>
   <p>But my fault they will needes haue to be double: one <hi>an error in my
Iudgment,</hi> the other <hi>a plaine knacke of knauery</hi> (for I can call it no bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter)
<hi>in my practise.</hi> For the first my simple Iudgment (as I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy
both by word &amp; writting made knowne) is this: <hi>That as the bodies
of men may really be possessed of Sathan in this age as well as in former
times: so the ordinarie way and meanes of their dispossession and deliuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is prayer, or prayer and fastinge.</hi> This is (in effect) all that I hold,
and contend for. wherin I willinglye referre and submitt my selfe to
the godly learned of our Church. I challeng no power to worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
nor guift aboue others to cast out deuils. I haue not vsed any
adiuration: all which are fathered vpon me, but I condemned the
same in others. And now before the Lord and men I doe vtterly &amp;
from my soule renounce them, as heeretofore I haue often done with
my tongue &amp; pen: what grosse and dangerous <hi>error</hi> then doe I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine?
For the other that is <hi>my knacke or packe of knauery in teachinge
to counterfeite, and fayning a dispossession by prayer, when their were no
such things performed:</hi> I cannot be perswaded (for all this impudent &amp;
shameles discourse of <hi>S Harsnetes,</hi> so bedecked and adorned with my
<hi>L. of Londons flowers</hi>) that they themselues in their consciences doe be
leeue this knacke of knauerie against me in that sort as they haue sett
it downe.<note place="margin">1</note> The reasons that induce me so to thinke be these.</p>
   <p>First,<note place="margin">as men proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
         <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly call them.</note> because they would not suffer <hi>Somers</hi> or rather the deuill in
him to doe his trickes, though they were sundrie times desired pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liklye
and priuatly that he might doe them for the better endinge of
the controuersie, and that he offered to doe the same.</p>
   <p>Secondly, their manner of proceeding against me contrarie to
the ordinarie course of iustice and equitie:<note place="margin">2</note> yea such as heathens and
infidels would blush and be ashamed to vse: as appeareth by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
in the treatise following. Now what neede they to haue vsed
any such extraordinarie and vnlawfull proceedings, If they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the truth of that which they pretended against me, or that
<pb facs="5"/>
they had any iust matter or sound and cleare euidence to convince
me by? nay if they weare not in themselues perswaded, that <hi>Darrell</hi>
would cleare himselfe of <hi>teaching to counterfeite,</hi> if he should be admitt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
to a proceeding according to the lawes of the Realme in such cases
prouided?</p>
   <p>Thirdly, their very writtinge against me in this case in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as they haue done,<note place="margin">3</note> is sufficient in the iudgment of the wise to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
and discouer the guiltines of their consciences this way. For what
a test were it to punish treason or rebellion by <hi>Booke-writting?</hi> I will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglye
confesse the sinne they charge me with (if it be true) to be as
bad as rebellion, and to deserue more then the pillorie, yea a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and a reprochfull death to the terror of others. And if they can
proue the thinges published against me in that printed Libell of <hi>S.
Harsnetes,</hi> they shall neede no Iurie to passe vpon me, neither will I
craue any fauour but iustice with seueritie. Seeinge then the punishe
not nor neuer went about to punish this supposed offence according
to the weight and desert thereof: nay haue bene so farr from that, as
within 14. dayes after the publishinge of the booke made against me,
they offered me libertie vpon condition I would promise not to pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ach
of possessiō nor dispossession: nor in my publike preaching iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the possession and dispossessinge of the persons controverted nor
deale any more in the dispossessinge of any: and yet haue publiklye
made it knowne for so haynous and notorious a crime, what doth
this argue but that inwardly in theire owne soules, they doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue
their owne lible?</p>
   <p>Fourthly, their often and ordinarie bringinge in the testimonie
of <hi>Somers</hi> against me in theire saide booke, (able to make a horse to
spue) whensoeuer they are at a stand and can by no meanes writhe
nor wrest in that which they would faine make good (being vtterlye
voyd of all honest course of defence) then forsooth comes in <hi>M.</hi>
      <note place="margin">4</note>
      <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers</hi>
dropping out of <hi>M Harsnets</hi> budget as an authenticall witnes. And
what doth more argue the guiltines of ther consciēces, the despratēes
of their cause, &amp; the shamlesnes of their defence then this? That they
are not abashed to suppresse the examinations of sundry honest men,
wise men and gentlemen of good place, taken by Comission from
the <hi>Arch. B. of Yorke</hi> as thinges of no account: and instead of them to
tell vs a tale of <hi>Robin-hood,</hi> or rather if you will, of <hi>Robin</hi> the <hi>deuill,
alias, William Somers?</hi> why alas, are they so simple or sottish to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that any man that is well in his wittes, will beleeue this or that
because <hi>Somers</hi> saith it, that infamous and notorious lyer, counterfeit,
blasphemer, and forsworne wretch?</p>
   <p>Fiftly, theire winkinge at theire 7. <hi>Lancashire</hi> counterfeits, and
<pb facs="5"/>
smoth passing by them not punishinge them, albeit 6. of them were
in the same family, nor any of those 4. whom they haue deait with,
and say vpon their examination haue confessed that they haue coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terfeted,
no not <hi>Somers</hi> their principall supposed counterfeite: but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured,
intertained, countenaunced, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>erished and made much of
him though most vile and infamous, and such as they must needes
know to haue scarce any match in lewdnes and iniquitie: as <hi>if counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting</hi>
and <hi>blaspheming</hi> were a prayse or but a spirt of youth in him,
and <hi>teaching to counterfeite</hi> onely odious in me. Now whence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
this stealing by the 7. and impunitie of all, but from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e consci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence
of man, tening him that <hi>they are no counterfeits,</hi> and therfore it
is best to let them alone, and not to punish all these innocentes: Lest
they in their innocencie denying constantlye to haue counterfeited,
and exclaming against them, should bring them to great shame.</p>
   <p>Sixety and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> the thing that most moueth me thus to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded

and Elders who deuised this shift for the smotheringe of Christs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
knewe and were perswaded in their cōsciences it was not
so, but far otherwise. Even so in this our case, though many of the
people of <hi>England</hi> doe in their simplicitie and rash credulitie verelie
beleiue that <hi>Somers &amp; the rest haue counterfeited, &amp; I instructed them,</hi> be
cause of the silly reasons printed &amp; published to that end by the <hi>B.</hi> of
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>S. Harsnet:</hi> yet the <hi>B.</hi> &amp; <hi>Harsnet</hi> which haue invented &amp; de
uised those sottish reasons, and framed a whole booke for the smother<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inge
of the worke of God wrought vpon these persons, can not but
know and be in their consciences perswaded, that they haue not coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terfeited,
nor I taught them.</p>
   <p>These then (good reader) with sundrie others are the speciall rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sons
that moue me to thinke, that they themselues (what face soeuer
they sett on it) doe not yet in their owne consciences betwixt god &amp;
them, constantly beleiue all that they haue thus published or rather
libelled against me, beinge a thinge vnpossiblie they should. And if it
fare so with the bitingest and bitterest aduersaries, I may the bolder I
thinke (even by the law and rule of equitie) be an earnest suter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee whosoeuer thou art to suspend thy iudgment, and not hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to passe any sentence against me: &amp; intreat thy patience christian
reader and fauourable censure of me thus farr fourth, as to cause thee
to stope thine eares to all vniust surmizes and odious exclamations
against me, till proofe and triall haue discouered my guiltines or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie.
And this the rather I trust you will doe, if you remember
and forgett not that saying of the holy ghost: <hi>he that is first in his owne
cause is iust, then cometh his neighbour, and maketh inquirie of him.</hi> And
that other in the same place: <hi>he that answereth, amatter before he heare it,
it is follie and shame vnto him.</hi>
      <note place="margin">pro. 18. 13. 17.</note>
      <hi>He that answereth,</hi> that is, taketh vpon
him to iudg or determine of a matter incontrouersie, <hi>before he heare it,</hi>
meaning, what can be said of both sides, <hi>it is follie and shame vnto him,</hi>
that is, a poynt of follie comming from the lake of wisdome, and such
as whereof one ought to be ashamed.</p>
   <p>And the rather I am to intreat this fauour at thy handes, in that
I haue not bene dealt with accordinge to the ordinarie course of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of this land, but altogether against the haire and in the vnreason
ablest manner of proceeding that might be, as if it were no matter at
all what violence &amp; indignitie they offer to a man of my condition,
or to so base a fellowe as <hi>Darrell</hi> is. Neither by their patience doe <hi>I</hi>
thinke, that they can for their liues giue me an instance or shewe me
the like president of their irregular &amp; disorderly proceeding against
me, in any of the honorable ciuil cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="3 letters">

the notinge, yea to be recorded and nayled on the postes of the
streetes to the veiw of posteritie. One would thinke that the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
fathers of the Church, should in their courtes and iudiciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedinges
giue their children (as they would haue them counted)
the reuerent Iudges of the land, and fathers of the common wealth,

as they would abhorr and be a shamed to followe. I haue heard
that amonge other the excellent graces of God vpon her Maiestie,
this is one that doth exceedingly grace both her person &amp; her gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
namely, that in the makinge and ordaininge of her Iudges, she
doth among other things enioyne thē this speciall charge: <hi>That what
soeuer in equitie may be produced on the behalfe of the subiecte, may be pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiently
heard and fauourably admitted without exception or partialitie and
that they should not perswade themselues to sitte otherwise in Iudgment for
her selfe, then for her subiecte.</hi> which kind of equall and christian proced<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inge
if it had bene held with me, I needed not now to haue spent my
time in refuting this shameles and malitious invectiue. what proceed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inge
hath bene vsed against me will plainly appeare by this discourse
followinge, and namely in my answeare to the second chapter of the
first booke, by the <hi>quaeries</hi> or demaundes to the <hi>Discouerer</hi> (I meane
the <hi>B.</hi>
      <note place="margin">pag. 14 of the <hi>Discouerie.</hi>
      </note> of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>S. Harsnet</hi>) iustifiynge the same, and affirminge
that <hi>this cause hath bene examined, accordinge to the vsual course by the
lawes of the Realme in such cases provided.</hi> And yet shall not the <hi>Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerer</hi>
be euer able to name in what one thing after my appearāce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the high commission, I was dealt with according to lawe. Truly
for my owne parte I can not. If he can, let him doe it. For these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
I hope good reader, that layinge aside all partiallitie and preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
you will reserue the one eare, to heare what <hi>Darrell</hi> hath to say
for the Lord and himselfe, and against <hi>counterfeiting, and teachinge So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
Darling &amp;c. to counterfeite:</hi> and that you will beware how you re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiue
a false report against your neighbour, specially against the Lord
himselfe and his workes.</p>
   <p>If any thinke that the charge of <hi>counterfeiting,</hi> and <hi>of my teachinge
to counterfeite</hi> (the summe of the booke answeared by me,) is so lying,
slaunderous, abhorring to common sence, palpable false, and vnpossi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
to be true, that it was altogether vnworthy the answearinge and
convincing, or at least of so large an answeare and conviction as heere
followeth: such may remember that the Apostles being charged with
drunckennes and to be <hi>full of newe wine,</hi>
      <note place="margin">act. 2. 13 14. math. 12.</note> Peter for them all answeare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
&amp; conuinced that vile slaunder. In like sort did our Sauiour Christ
being charged more vily to be a coniurer, and <hi>to cast out deuils through
Belzabub, the prince of deuils.</hi> which thinges are written for our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="7"/>
even to teach vs what to doe whē any such thing falleth out. Now
the larger I haue bene for these two reasons. First, I thought it fitt to
answeare to all that is contained in the <hi>Discouery,</hi> which seemeth to
make more or selfe against the cause or my selfe: least passing by some
of this kind, it might be thought I therfore did it and purposly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I were not able to answere. Againe, I cōsidered that many haue
already giuen an eare to <hi>counterfeitinge,</hi> and verily beleiue our <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makes</hi>
to be <hi>counterfeits:</hi> for their sakes therfore, &amp; that I might draw
these preiudicate: persons from their error to the imbracinge of the
truth, it was requisite to answere all that in the face made for counter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feitinge,
which could not be performed in fewe wordes. Secondly, I
knewe the credit of the aduersarie was great, my owne little, beinge
a base &amp; contemptible person in the eyes of the world. That my selfe
then and that which I contend for might be beleiued, even of this
dotinge and blind generation, It was necessarie I should not onely
cracke or diminish the credite of the a duersarie, even with his best
frendes, which might haue bene done in afew wordes: but take all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
from him, by detectinge all his filthines: for in makinge his name
to rotte and stinke, and the counterfeit cause he hath in hand, their is
hope that men will giue some eare vnto me, and that I striue for, be I
neuer so meane. Now this would be best performed in the larger pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>suite
and stirringe deepely in the falshods, lyes, and absurdities of the
<hi>Discouerer,</hi> which coulde not be donne without the multiplyinge of
wordes. For the more one stirreth in that which is stinkinge and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
the more stinking sauor it sendeth forth. And so shall we find it
to be in the ample ripping vp of this foule <hi>Discouery,</hi> to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tection</hi>
wherof we will now proceed, God assistinge vs. If
the falshood of some be detected, and thou find out
the truth by this our <hi>Detection:</hi> then open
thy mouth in the defence of that truth,
and assist me with thy prayers.</p>
