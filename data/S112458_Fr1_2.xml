   <head>To the most reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in God, Richard Bishop of London, my verie good Lord, health and happinesse heere, and in the world to come.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight reuerend my verie good Lord, euerie diuine knowes, that there is a store-house in the Church of God, into which euerie good christian brings some affliction suffered, or some trauell vndertaken for Gods sake. And although that from <hi>Abel</hi> to Christ, and from Christ Iesus to this present day, there haue beene many prizes of both sorts carried into this treasurie yet will it not be full before the ende of the world, vntill which time, neither the teares nor the trauels of the Church are like to cease. Therfore seeing it hath pleased God of his goodnesse to make mee a little Naile in his Temple, to hang some part of his seruice vppon, and hath from time to time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorded me a place among many learned men, called out from their studies in the Vniuersities, or from their particular charges in the country,


<pb facs="3"/>
to the publike seruice of the church at <hi>Paules</hi> Crosse, where euerie man bestirres him like a Bee, to carrie waxe and honny to the hiue, and euerie man is profitable in his paines: I haue brought in these labours to the church, fitted as well as I could, both to the time wherin we liue, and to that honourable assemblie to which I spake.</p>
   <p>And because <hi>S: Augustine</hi> confesses, that when he beholdes men carried away with a loue of this present world, he cannot tel how wisdome should come in season to do them any good, in that people blowen vp with prosperitie despise all that is saide vnto them: finding a great parte of the ancient glorie of this kingdome blasted with the breath of schisme, and with an expectation of warres and troubles, and espying also with the Prophet Ieremie, that there is no taking the wilde Asse in the wildernesse before she be with foale, I haue slept in in such a time, as wisedom may happely come in season.</p>
   <p>The matters I intreated of are great, and I am little, but God (which when he was great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came little to preach vnto the world) hath assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted me: and what I haue deliuered, men shall best see to be true, when reading and preaching shall be remooued, the cloude of this bodie rent in peeces, and wee with purified and glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies


<pb facs="3"/>
shall looke vppon the Lorde. I knowe, that whilst wee liue here below, as preaching is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> vnto thunder, so it is like it in the cause and effects of thunder Thun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der proceedes from a vapor lifted vp from the earth, and compassed with a colde cloude, in the motion and agitation, it catcheth fire, which breaketh out presently where the cloude is thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and being out, sometime it strikes the bodie of a man, and not the cloathes, sometime the cloathes, and not the bodie. Preaching proceedes from the meditation of the heart, lifted vp from earth to heauen, cold flesh is the cloud that keeps it in in the motion and agitation of the minde, it catches fire, while I missed (saith <hi>Dauid</hi>) the fire kindled, being streightned within vs, it striues to vente it selfe, and breakes out at the lippes of the preacher where the cloude is thinnest and being forth, somtime it strikes the princes of the earth, and not the people that stand about them: sometime againe it hittes and mooues the poore people, and not the Potentates. When these ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the almightie flie abroade, a preacher must not be dismaide to see them glaunce in the going for they sticke not euerie where.</p>
   <p>Nay, it falleth out sometimes, that the hearers deale with vs, as <hi>Saul</hi> did with <hi>Dauid,</hi> who threw a speare at him when he plaide vppon his


<pb facs="4"/>
harpe, to charme the eiull spirite that was in <hi>Saul.</hi> Of which action it was wittily deuised and written by him that cutte the whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of <hi>Dauid</hi> for the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and sette it out in pictures. Dura est mens hominis ac sancto ingrata labori, <hi>The heart of man is harde, and vnkinde to holie labours.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I speake not this in respect of any crooked measure laide vnto my trauailes, for then I should detract from that religious auditorie which gaue me gracious hearing &amp; acceptance, the glory shal be Gods, which wrought it in their hearts, and I trust, their answeres a rewarde to them in heauen, for the heede and regard they gaue vnto me. And that my sermon might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine somewhat longer with them then the time wherein it was deliuered, I haue at the request of my friendes put it foorth in print, to the view of all, dedicating it vnto your Lo. partelie to submit it to your L. graue and learned censure, and to the censure of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> according to the rule of the holie ghost, which will haue the spirits of the Prophets subiect to the Prophets: which course if euerie man could be content in humilitie to take, the controuersies of our church would quikly be composed: partly to giue some publike testimonie of my thankeful heart and dutifull affection to your Lordshippe,


<pb facs="4"/>
which hath enabled me to do some good in the church of God, in some inferiour seruices therof, according to the talent bestowed vppon me. Thus humblie beseeching God, which is the beginning and the ende of all things, to giue peace to his church and to our country, and to blesse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue your honourable labors in them both, and to crowne them in heauen when your race is runne, I humbly take my leaue.</p>
