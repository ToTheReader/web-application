   <head>TO THE READERS.</head>
   <p>REaders you must giue me leaue to present my Booke to you, without the Epithite of Gentle, Courteous or Impartiall Readers: for mine is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie; which, hee that is sure of such Readers, needs not make. And if the glory of this most loyall and victorious Count, hath still at home bin confronted with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious censures: how should a story of his Actions, euery where meet with such Readers? This therefore rather hopes to make, then find you so. And readers I call you, plurally: for it lookes to fall into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers hands, and all not alike minded▪ some may light vpon this Apologie, who by their enuious detractions from his Acts, haue bin the causers that some such as this were sit to bee made for his iustification. But I hope, that they being now out of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so no longer corriuals in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the proofe of his victorious fidelity, hath by this time either made them asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or silent. A second sort are those,
<pb facs="3"/>
whom these scandalous reports haue su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended in their goood opinions of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to the King: and to them is this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology chiefly intended: for it well hopes that by relating the treacheries who (by his martiall sentence) suffered for it, and withall truely representing his diligence and letters to the traytors, and the wants which disabled him from hindring their plots when his wisdome had discouered them: will throughly enforme such a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp; turne him now to an impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. A third sort may light vpon this, who haue liued so farre off from newes, that they neuer heard him so much as suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (for thankes be to God, his glory is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trauelled then their enuy, which hath either bin lost by the way, or turned backe againe) and I hope these men will thinke their money well bestowed: in that an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology must of necessity discouer more priuate and particular passages, whence this enuy sprang, then any generall Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of these <hi>Bohemian</hi> warres, need produce: for such a story rather relates, then proues; and besides, here are diuers letters cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed
<pb facs="3"/>
out, and letters be the very linings and insides of Stories: and this way too, this Apology giues these Readers best satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction Yet for one fauour, I must appeale to thee Gentle and Courteous Reader, for so I hope euen (in this point) to finde the first sort of these Readers; because what I entreate, although it goes with the history yet it is besides the scope of it, which is the thing they onely maligne: I meane to craue your fauourable censures, for the rudenesse of the Style. For wee <hi>Bohemians</hi> (next our vulgar) more frequently vse the neighbour <hi>Italian</hi> speech: but because the campe (whither this is chiefely sent) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poūded of diuers Nations, best vnderstand one another in the French, I haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wrote it in that language wherein I was lesse perfect. But maruell not if wee Swordmen who vse to hew out our way, now and then hacke at a word: a souldiers writing stile, is his stilletto, and when wee parlee, wee send summons, not orations, and their owne necessity perswades the vanquished to yeeld, and not the victors Rhetoricke: but if it be plaine, plainnesse
<pb facs="4"/>
best sets forth truth, as this is. And perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture it will be the better thought to be so, for the Author profession: for a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier as much scornes to giue the lye, as to take it. Seeing then this braue mans Fame hath bin put to his compurgators: I, who haue bin a witnesse of all I write, come in here as one of the Iurors, and vpon mine owne knowledge deliuer the truth, and (willingly) nothing but the truth: and to this I sweare, and you here see I lay my hand vpon the booke. Farewell, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten after him, his owne Actions shall next make their owne Apology, or need none.</p>
