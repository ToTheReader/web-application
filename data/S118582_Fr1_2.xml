   <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NORABLE SIR THOMAS BEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NET KNIGHT, LORD MAIOR OF the famous Citie of London, the right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Sir William Romley, and Sir Thomas Midleton Knights, and Sheriffes of the same Citie: increase of honor and euer-flourishing felicitie.</hi>

      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT Honorable and right Worshipfull, I haue long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that some men of greater experience and grauer iudgment then my self, ere this should haue bent their studies to cōgratulate your prosperous designements with their learned Labours: not onely in this regard, that it hath seemed gracious in the eyes of Heauen, to turne the time of destruction into mirth and exhilaration, to dispell the cloudes of desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the splendant Sun of this Citie, and to seale vp the iawes of that starued Tyger, rauening and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging too and fro with insatiate appetite, to gormandize indefinitely without partialitie: but also in respect of
<pb facs="4"/>the proceedings in your general functions and callings; therein manifesting your ardent zeale to the Church and Commonwealth, in the reformation of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and monstrous enormities nurced and fostred vp in the same Citie, wounding the hearts of many with the sting of Securitie, who thereby fall into a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie of their owne ruination: they being naturally like the Basilisk, who by stinging a man, prouoketh him to conclude his destruction with the period of a sweet sleepe; which to discusse vpon more amply, were but to light a torch, when the Sunne boasteth in his vertical point, or to multiplie leaues to a greene tree. But percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the turne of Times euent to fall out opposite to my expectation, and a time of respiration exhibited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me by sacred Prouidence, (for <hi>Deus nobis haec otiafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit</hi>) I (though most vnfit, not so much in regard of my litle scholership and reading, as in respect of my iuue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilitie and lesse experience, though <hi>Assiduè discens plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rima, fiam senex</hi>) haue thought it not impertinent to my dutie, as also consonant to your dignities, to cast this poore mite of feruent affection and congratulation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the rich treasurie of your honorable and worshipfull Patronage: being inforced hereupon to vse the meanes of that poore man, who hauing neither gold nor iewels, presented both his hands full of running water to <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes.</hi> And the rather, for that I behold many presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and pregnant demonstrations of a flourishing Spring-tide of happinesse substituted to your predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb facs="4"/>and gouernment; in the constituting of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie and requisite lawes for the supplanting and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulating of vice; and being constituted, are strictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and executed by your importunate industrie, (which (as <hi>Caesar</hi> saith) is <hi>Fortunae Imperator,</hi> and vrgeth an assent <hi>vltra vires rationis</hi>) leading this citie as peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Conductors, (or as <hi>Theodosius</hi> did <hi>Rome</hi>) to a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Autumne. For <hi>Archidamus</hi> being asked, what made the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> kingdome to flourish, answered: First, the lawes; and next, the Magistrates obseruing the Lawes: and <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, that <hi>Magistratus est custos legis,</hi> also <hi>Xenophon:</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>Non dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert bonus Princeps à patre bono.</hi> Whereupon may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that Magistrates (as <hi>Patres patriae</hi>) ought serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with iudiciall precaution, not onely to prescribe ordinances tending to the generall benefite of a citie or commonwealth; but also to be respectiue (as the father tendreth the successiue fortune of his child with care and vigilancie) that they foreslow not their progression in the performance of their due execution: for <hi>Non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet principem virum totam noctem dormire, cui populi gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacula commissasunt, &amp; à cuius cura pendent ingentia rerum momenta.</hi> But lest any man should obiect against me, that I pretend by a kind of aemulation and blandilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to adorne your merits like a <hi>Barbarian</hi> image, as <hi>Alexander</hi> was by <hi>Midius:</hi> or on the contrarie, to taxe me of calumniation with this inueterate Axiome: <hi>In medio tutissimus ibis:</hi> (which two, proue the Canker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms
<pb facs="5"/>of a flourishing countrie: for <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke being asked, what kind of beasts are most deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; he answered: that of tame beasts, the Flatterer, and of wild beasts, the Back-biter,) therefore so to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the first, as not culpable of the last, I will cleaue to the golden <hi>Medium,</hi> breaking off that discourse, and cease to discusse vpon such a Theame. And now to returne to my old taske, I humbly intreate your fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable entertainment to these my vnpolished lines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hewed out and squared by one of the meanest of <hi>Appolloes</hi> Artificers. And I the more seriously desire it, for that I am deeply resolued, they shal find a sufficient shelter vnder the wings of your Honorable and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull names and Patronage, as vnder the receptacle of a strong fortified <hi>Testudo,</hi> against the yelping chaps of those snarling Zoylists, <hi>qui potiùs pro consuetudine, quàm proferocitate latrant,</hi> barking more for custome then curstnesse: who by disgorging their mud-mixed censures vpon the studious essayes of particulars, (for <hi>Apollo nullos habet inimicos, nisi nimbos</hi>) do resolue with themselues by that meanes to win a purchase of a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall applause, and to erect an eternall monument of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to themselues, vpon the disgraces of other mens indeauours: but thereby prouing culpable to thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of their owne ignorance, and ripping vp the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of their imperfections and grosse fatuities, in the calumniating of ingenious enterprises, and by brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging backe with impudent arrogance those stolne
<pb facs="5"/>sparkes which they snatched frō <hi>Appolloes</hi> sacred flames, whereby the moistned muddie motions of their brains are enforced to euaporate in a smoothering heate; do appeare to the world, to surpasse in immanitie, the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropophagi</hi> or <hi>Canibals;</hi> who, though they gormandize on other mens flesh, yet will not deuoure themselues. Thus hoping, that these vnlettered lines shal passe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disturbance vnder the couert of your worthie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections, I humbly intreat your Honor and Worships, to admit this poore pittance into your rich banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-house of acceptation and tolleration, with no lesse willing mind, then by course of affectionate congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation it is presented vnto your hands; which, if it may find free accesse, I will turne my sequele essayes with the turne of ensuing Time, more deepely to conuerse with the <hi>Muses</hi> thereby to bring foorth a further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of my ardent affection towards your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie personages. In the meane time, Heauens prosper your worthie proceedings.</p>
