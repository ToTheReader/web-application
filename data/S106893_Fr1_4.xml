                 <title>Pyrotechnia or, A discourse of artificiall fire-works : in which the true grounds of that art are plainly and perspicuously laid downe: together with sundry such motions, both straight and circular, performed by the helpe of fire, as are not to be found in any other discourse of this kind, extant in any language. VVhereunto is annexed a short treatise of geometrie, contayning certaine definitions and problemes, for the mensuration of superficies and sollids, with tables for the square root to 25000, and the cubick root to 10000 latus, wherein all roots under those numbers are extracted onely by ocular inspection.

      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving for mine owne private recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, spent some vacant houres in the study and contemplation of those ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall <hi>Fire-works</hi> which are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of in the ensuing Treatise; J held it requisite for my further and better satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as any opportunity did offer it selfe, to make expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of some of the particularities there set downe; and I did accordingly now and then bring into <hi>Act</hi> that whereof before I had but a meere <hi>Notion,</hi> and the bare and naked <hi>Theorie:</hi> which because it could not be done so privately, but that of necessity sometimes it would come to the view of others; by that meanes it is come to passe, that more notice than J was ever wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to, hath beene taken, that J have bestowed some thoughts upon that subiect, and taken more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary paines in it. And not so onely, but thereupon also some of my intimate friends and acquaintance, who have a speciall intrest in me, have beene very instant and urgent with me that J would make my labours more publike, and communicate them to the world, by committing them to the Presse: whereto though J was
<pb facs="7"/> a long while utterly unwilling, as being conscious to my selfe of mine owne inability and insufficiency to devise and contrive any thing worthy to come to such publike view, yet their importunity hath at last so farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with me, that those rude and unpolished lines are now like to see the Sunne; and to come abroad to be scanned and censured by others. Jf thou shalt looke upon them with a faire and favourable eye, I shall bee encouraged to bestow my paines upon some other thing, which may happily give thee more content, and in the meane while shall rest</p>
