      <hi>To the right honourable</hi> Sir Thomas Sackuile, Baron of <hi>Buckhurst, Lord high Treasurer of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> Knight of the most noble Order <hi>of the Garter, and one of the Lords of her Maiesties most honorable priuie Councell: G.</hi> de <hi>M.</hi> wisheth all health, increase of honour and euerlasting happinesse.</head>

      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE two Paradoxes (right honourable) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene presented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the French King, as a meane to qualifie the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall complaints of the dearth of things in <hi>France,</hi> by prouing that nothing was growne dearer in three hundred yeares,


<pb facs="3"/>
were answered by the famous M. <hi>Iohn Bodine:</hi> who dedicated his aunswer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the President of the high court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> as a matter of great consequence and considerable in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of a Common-wealth. Hence proceeded that resolution, which embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened me to present vnto your Lordship, the substance of both their writings, with all their arguments and propounded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies: to the end, that in the ballance of your graue wisdome they may be weighed with my Replication thereunto, shewing how things are to be considered of for the good of a Common-wealth. Your Honors iudgement shall easily perceiue, that the Paradoxes are opposite, and do contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict one another, besides the slender and weake ground of their foundation: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that Maister <hi>Bodine</hi> hath mistaken the true ground of the matter, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the prices of things within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in a Common-wealth: whereas the comparison must be betweene the home


<pb facs="3"/>
Commodities of one Common-wealth, and the forraine Commodities of other nations: and that, either by way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of Commodities for Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, or by Commodities for money <hi>in specie,</hi> or by exchange. So that a due consideration must be had of the course of Commodities, Money, and Exchange: which are the essentiall parts of all trade and trafficke. Wherein must be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the end of all Merchants, which is Gaine and profite: at which scope they ayme according to their profession and practise; some by Commodities, some by Money, some by Exchange, some by all three, or that which yeeldeth them most gaine. For as money doth rule the course of Commodities: so the exchange for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies doth both rule the course of moneys, and Commodities. By the disorder wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it happeneth, that the riches of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth doth so much decrease, as it is not alwayes in the power of the wise, that haue the managing of the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

thereof, to make choice of the best, and to banish the worst: but must not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey the tempest and strike sailes, but also cast ouer boord some precious things to saue the ship and bring it into a safe port: and afterwards by degrees ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come greater things, changing the estate thereof from euill to good, and from good to better, which otherwise might haue bene preuented in the beginning by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing the causes thereof. To your most honorable iudgement I referre the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of all: and pray the Almightie to haue your Honor in his diuine prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And so in all humility I take leaue. <hi>London,</hi> this 16. of Ianuarie. 1603.</p>
