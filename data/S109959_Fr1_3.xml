   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Should peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
have made
some difficulty to
offer you any booke
but this, fearing to
demand an unjust protection, or
to make you a present unworthy
of your selfe: But th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se Ladies
which I tender you are so accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht.
I could not cherish the
least feare to produce them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sinning against their merit,
<pb facs="5"/>
and the judgement you know to
make in things of valew. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
how perfect soever they
be, they acknowledge a necessity
of your approbation to appeare in
the world: And, that if this good
fayle them, all their faire dresses,
and ornaments can gaine them a
reputation but imperfect. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them then in posture to doe
the homage they owe you, and to
learne from your mouth what
credit they may hope from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Behold the wonders of our
age, which come to reverence the
rare qualities that <hi>France</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires
in you: And to consult the
oracle which must declare their
good, or bad fortune. Confident
they are to disp lease none, if they
be but so happy to please you, and
that by the generall esteeme you
are in, your judgement shall bee
the rule to all others. Receive
<pb facs="5"/>
them Madam, as creatures
whom the report of your name
and vertue hath acquired, And
that will not shew themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
with your passe: Refuse
not your favour to these faire
unknowne, which enter not into
the world, but to vindicate the
honour of dames, and to make it
appeare that Letters are not the
peculiar heritage of one sexe;
and that men are out, when they
va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t themselves sole Monarchs
in the Empire of the sciences.
For my selfe, Madam, who doe
but lend a hand to their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
I confesse I am ravisht to
see them fall into your armes,
and that besides the lustre of
their owne beauty, they shall bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
that of yours, to render them
pleasing as your selfe, to all that
have eyes, and reason. I cannot
cease to commend their choyse,
<pb facs="6"/>
seeing it must be imagined, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as you are, you will be taken
with their courage: and while
they travaile in a designe so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
I assure my selfe you will
second their endeavours, And
that your countenance, approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and spirit, shall bring them
more than halfe their victory,
and triumph, Thus hopes</p>
