For (as one saith well) ten Sermons at Pauls Crosse doe not so much good for moouing men to true doctrine, as one of these bookes doe harme, with entising men to ill liuing; and that more Papists are made by the merry bookes of Italy, then by the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest bookes of <hi>Louaine;</hi> so that they doe not only win the wils of the weake vnto wantonnesse, but tend some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the corrupting of true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
