Written in Latin by William Bucanus Professor of Diuinitie in the Vniuersitie of Lausanna. And published in English by Robert Hill, Bachelor in Diuinitie, and Fellow of Saint Iohns Colledge in Cambridge, for the benefit of our English nation, to which is added in the end the practise of papists against Protestant princes</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, as the writings of God doe testifie that Antichrist shall be consumed by a breath: so the writings of men do also testifie, that the same An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shall be weakned by rags. The breath which shall consume him, is the preaching of the Gospell: the rags which shall weaken him are printed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. If he be burned by the one, blesse God for good preachers, if decaied by the other, thanke painfull writers. That these two are the meanes which must ruinate Antichrist, we may see by the practise of our Antichristian aduersaries. For though they haue many who declame against vs, yet will they suffer none to preach Iesus Christ: and though they haue many to write against vs,<note place="margin">Read the inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of preaching and Printing, by Queene Mary in the booke of martyrs</note> yet few will they suffer to read their owne controuersies. That they want Christ preached, behold their miserie: that we haue him preached, see our felicitie: that their people dare not reade bookes, marke the tyrannie of the pope: that we haue libertie to read so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie worthie bookes, note the goodnes of God, and care of our gouernors. To this end authoritie permits manie excellent bookes daily to be published: and though much reading be a wearinesse to the flesh, and manie bookes bring confusion to students, yet as the stomacke must be preserued by vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of meates, so the minde must bee cherished with varietie of writers. That thou mayest be moued to read old diuinitie in a new fashion I haue published in English this excellent discourse: which, because it is the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence of the best writers of our age, I doubt not but it wil be welcom vnto thee. If thou lookest for order, few bookes more methodicall: if for matter few more Iudiciall, if for breuitie few more compendious, if for plainnes few more perspicuous, if for vse few more pretious. And if either emulation amongst Stationers hinder not the sale, as it doth the sale of many excellent bookes, or the delite of vaine bookes do not hinder thee from reading it, as it doth many from the best things, I doubt not but thou shalt haue cause to say of this worthie man, as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith of a worthie woman, many Doctors haue done learnedly, but thou surmountest them all. Buy this truth but sell it not: read this booke, but forget it not. Thou shall buy much for little cost, and read much to thy great gaine. Thus I commend thee to the grace of God, and my selfe to the grace of thy prayers.</p>
