that after he had

any peece of worke, to be exhibited

vsed to lurke priuily behinde the

a young mans direction in his

the hands and heart of all humility,

godlinesse, honour, &amp; blessednesse:
I pray almighty God, to the glory of
his name, his Churches comfort,
and the posterities happy memorie;
perswading my selfe, that as in all
heartie and vnexpressible loue,
(my conscience bearing mee wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
I present the same vnto your

more to expresse my deuotion: so
also you will graciously accept
thereof, respecting rather the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
affection of the heart dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating,
then the outward thing by
it dedicated; as also assuring my
selfe, that <hi>Ionas</hi> was neuer better
guarded vnder the shadow of his
greene and tender Gourd, from
the offensiue heate of the scorching
Sunne; <hi>Vlisses</hi> neuer thought
himselfe more safe, when hee did
hold the weapon of noble <hi>Achilles</hi>
in his hand; nor <hi>Iole</hi> daughter to
King <hi>Euritus,</hi> more feared when
<pb facs="7"/>
she did stand armed with the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

shall be safe and secure, vnder the
