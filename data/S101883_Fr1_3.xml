                 <title>Antiquitie triumphing ouer noueltie : whereby it is proued that antiquitie is a true and certaine note of the Christian Catholicke Church and verity, against all new and late vpstart heresies, aduancing themselues against the religious honour of old Rome, whose ancient fait was so much commended by S. Pauls pen, and after sealed with the bloud of many martyrs and worthy bishops of that sea. With other necessarie and important questions incident and proper to the same subiect: by Iohn Fauour Doctor of the Lawes, sometimes fellow of New Colledge in Oxford, now vicar of Halifax</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y hearts desire and endeuour in this my poore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, hath bene, and is, to glorifie God, and benefite his Church. What I haue, or shall attaine vnto, standeth and resteth vpon Gods blessing, and the Christian Catholique Churches censure. My hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest prayer to God is, that my heart and worke may be acceptable in his sight, and profitable to his Church. My tender suite vnto this Church, is, that my paines may rest approued vnto each honest heart; or that I may receiue brotherly admonition from the learned, for any thing in it which is amisse. As for them that are without, I say, <hi>Parum est me à vobis iudicari, aut ab humano die.</hi> If those which sit in scorners chaire shall contemne or condemne me, I will solace my selfe with <hi>Seneca, Argumentum est recti malis displicere.</hi> If my glorious Father and gracious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iustifie me, I shall care litle who condemne me.</p>
   <p>Yet because Readers may be of diuers fashions and factions, some beneuolent and propitious, some maleuolent and captious; some ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, though malicious; some better instructed, yet humorous; some pregnant enough to discerne, yet as peeuish and peremptorie, either wittily to carpe, or wilfully to misconster, or wickedly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert and slander what may be mistaken or wrested; I haue thought good to addresse a few words, and become an humble suiter, or an earnest soliciter of all that shall reade, and will censure this my booke. For how many readers, so many censurers I looke to find. To whom I would tender in generall but two requests: That they would reade this booke with Christian humilitie, and censure it with brotherly charitie, without preiudice or partialitie. And perhaps it will not be amisse to reade twice, before they censure once.</p>
   <p>I was first moued and led to this labour by the commanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie of my most reuerend Lord, whom I am bounden to honour
<pb facs="5"/> and obey whilest I liue. A long sicknesse succeeded the first motion: yet it being rather tedious by continuance, then vexatious with pain, I made it aduantageable to my purpose, stole so much time for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and search, as furnished me with more speed to pen it, in that order wherein it is now digested.</p>
   <p>Wherein notwithstanding I had many impediments, well knowne vnto the places of my residence: as preaching euery Sabbath day, lecturing euery day in the weeke, exercising iustice in the Common-wealth, practising of Physicke and Chirurgerie, in the great penurie and necessitie thereof in the countrey where I liue, and that onely for Gods sake, which will easily multiply both clients and patients: yet the night hath affoorded me that which the day would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me: the silence and quiet whereof, hath ministred much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and meanes to further my meditations. The due consideration whereof, I do not tender as a vaine boast, or an excuse for my selfe: but to stirre vp the able minds of many that are more learned, and better furnished in this kind then I am, who liue either in Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Churches or Colledges, or are placed ouer small congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where they haue more ease and leisure, with fewer distractions and impediments then such as my selfe haue, to set their hands and their hearts with <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to the repaire of Gods Temple and Citie, against <hi>Tobiah</hi> and <hi>Sanballat</hi> beyond the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that is, the Pope and the Iesuites, with other conspirators, who terrifie the peoples hearts from so needfull and gracious a worke as the entertainment of Christs truth and Gospel, to the sauing of their soules. The Pope with Briefe vpon Briefe, Priuiledge vpon Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, Indulgence vpon Indulgence, encourageth his Iesuites and other Priests, Regulars and Seculars. They like swarmes of Locusts ouerspread the field where Gods precious seed is sowne, and are not onely diligent and painfull in compassing sea and land to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes, the children of hell, seuen times worse then themselues, but are ready to aduenture their liues, euen out of their bloud to raise a seed of sedition and rebellion to Antichrist their sole and soueraigne king; whilest too many amongst vs are so lumpish and idle, as if the danger appertained not vnto vs. We haue (blessed be the name of God) many vigilant Pastors and reuerent Doctors, that preach di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, and write learnedly of all Controuersies questioned in these
<pb facs="6"/> euill times, who neither preferre pleasure nor profit, nor honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aduancement of Gods glorie and the benefite of Christs Church; neither would spare their liues for the furtherance of the Gospell. Yet haue we some that are not prouoked by their good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, but propose vnto themselues a more broad, pleasant and easie way, as if the way were not narrow that leadeth to life. Whom I would onely intreate as brethren, seriously to consider the improbous labour and incessant industrie of our aduersaries, who are so captious as to cauill at all we say or do, that make mountaines of mole hils, great outcries vpon small occasions, God knoweth, and are readie to call our vertues vices, and for our sakes whom they hate, speake euill of the way of truth which we professe, and they know not; and neuer to suffer their hypocrisie to outface our sinceritie, their policy preuent our due circumspection, their crafty informations outstrip our plaine and honest dealing in the sight of God or men; lest their double dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in euill, rise vp in iudgement against our negligence in good: or lest their mouths be vniustly opened against the truth, for the vnholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of those that preach &amp; professe it. Let vs rather stop the mouths of foolish and ignorant men by wel doing, and glorifie God in our holy calling, lest God require it. O that the careful Gouernors, by the wel established discipline of our Church, would take order to stir vp the minds of such Ministers as are able vnto this work, and spur the idle forward, and make them go or bleed; and by due punishment chastise the insolency of fruitlesse and carelesse men if any such be, to a speedy reformation, or vtter expulsion; that the pleasant pasture of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring oxe, be not deuoured either by lazie asses or rauening wolues.</p>
   <p>My learned and studious fathers and brethren I would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pray, friendly to admonish me of any thing in my booke, which an aduersarie may not onely iustly taxe, but probably calumniate; that I may receiue aduertisement and admonition from a friend, before a reproofe from an aduersarie; that the mouth of reproach may be stopped, before it be opened to slander the Gospell for my sake. If I shall haply receiue your approbation, it shall stand for my reall and comfortable contentment and satisfaction. Ʋpon the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, curious, captious or malicious I repose not my credit. For <hi>Ea est profectò iucunda laus quae ab his proficiscitur qui &amp; ipsi in laude vixerunt.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> If I haue offended, let the righteous smite me;
<pb facs="6"/> for the stripe of a friend is better then the kisse of an enemie, when the balme of the wicked may breake my head. If the leud should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue or applaud me, I might fall into <hi>Antisthenes</hi> feare: <hi>O me miserum, metuo ne in crimen aliquod inciderim.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If any of our aduersaries shall vndertake by writing to answer this that I haue published, I would intreate them also that they would write as becometh Diuines, without the spirit of <hi>Rabsheca</hi> that railed on the liuing God. To auoid all personall calumniations, which as they are beside the cause, so do they not further the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of any honest mind, and are most disgracefull to them that vse them. <hi>Michael</hi> gaue not railing words to the Diuell. It pleased God himselfe to visite and comfort his Prophet in a soft and still aire, rather then in fire, tempest or earthquake. It was a good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Discite à me, quia ego mitis &amp; humilis sum;</hi> and as good an example to follow, When he was reuiled, he reuiled not againe. Which I remember the rather, because many of our aduersaries bookes, wherein they answer others on whom they would raile, which mattereth not so much where no person is touched, are diuulged either without names at all, like speechlesse idols, or onely with a paire of letters, perhaps truly importing the first cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of their names, but for the most part transposed, that <hi>Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> himselfe could not find out the riddle: or a plaine counterfet name, as <hi>Mattheus Tortus</hi> for <hi>Robert Bellarmine,</hi> appearing vnto the world like whifflers at a play, with vizards of diuers shapes to terrifie or delude the simple, and to abuse whom they list without controlment, while themselues are vnknowne, as disguised in such hypocriticall and dissembled attire. Which notwithstanding is not onely censured as a fault in Printers, <hi>qui saepe tacito, saepe etiam emētito praelo, &amp; quod grauius est, sine nomine authoris im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primunt,</hi> by the Conuenticle of Trent, but also by a solemne Decree is forbidden for euer hereafter: <hi>Decernit &amp; statuit, vt nulli liceat imprimere, aut imprimi facere, quosuis libros de rebus sacris sine nomine autoris.</hi> Though they haue a crafty cautel following, yet this were a good rule, were it generally obserued, especially in mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters of cōtrouersy, where there may be expectatiō of answer or reply.</p>
   <p>Finally, I would intreate, that if any answer be published, it be not generall, or at randon, or by snatches and peeces, but distinct
<pb facs="7"/> and particular, either by Paragraph and Paragraph, or by Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Chapter, as it standeth in order. These conditions are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, friendly and Christian, becoming both the cause we handle, and the men we professe our selues to be; and so let <hi>causa cum cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa, ratio cum ratione concertare.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The Lord Iesus giue a gracious blessing vnto these my paines in the worke of my Ministerie, and that not onely I, but all my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren may be found faithfull in the fruitfull emploiment of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents committed vnto vs, vnto the day of the straight reckoning and account, at that great iudgement, when euery mans worke shall be approued or disallowed before the feete of that Lord who shall iudge both quicke and dead at his appearing in glorie.</p>
