   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE industrious and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Sea-man, <hi>Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull</hi>
(that I may goe no
farther for an example
then mine owne professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because <hi>quod supranos,
nihil ad nos)</hi> being a long time crossed with
vnfauourable windes, persisteth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in attempting to attaine to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
Port: which not beeing able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieue
directly and vpon a precise rhomb
or point, he maketh his way by diuers Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders
<pb facs="3"/>
and crooked turnings, lying some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
East, and anon West, so neere his
course as the winde will permit, and by this
meanes at length he ankoreth in the wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
harbour. Euen so my selfe hauing of a
long time desired to recouer some fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
or meanes (as my most wished port)
to expresse a thankefull minde vnto your
Worships, for no small benefits formerly
conferred vpon me, <hi>(&amp; benè apud memores
veteris stat gratia facti)</hi> could neuer through
contrarie windes of aduerse fortune arriue
there in safety: but haue had a long trauerse
to and fro, with little likelihood of fairer
weather, till now at length with my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins
sharpe haled (pardon I pray you my ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Sea-phrase) I haue doubled the Cape
of <hi>good Hope:</hi> from whence I am bold to
send you this first returne of what I long
since tooke vp of you vpon interest, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
notwithstanding no way of worth to
countervaile any (though the least) part of
the debt I owe you. For it is now some
yeeres agone that I set sayle from <hi>the Hauen
of your help,</hi> bound for <hi>the Port of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
(the Vniuersity of <hi>Cambridge)</hi> beeing
fully fraughted with your <hi>fauour</hi> &amp; <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:</hi>
where, through mine owne negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
(let mee euer sigh to remember it)
hauing foreslowed my best market, and
letting go my most precious commodity,
(my <hi>Time)</hi> at an vnder-value, I remained a
great loser by my voyage; not beeing able
to make vnto you (my Worshipfull credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors)
such satisfaction as you might iustly
expect. And now entring into a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of your gentle forbearance of me, I
doomed my selfe worthy to beare the
brand of Ingratitude, if I should forget
you. Whereupon, not as any part of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but as a recognizance and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of that debt and dutie, which I
owe to your W<seg rend="sup">ps</seg>, I presume to send you
this insuing discourse, being not more plain
in the manner, then true in the matter. If
you shall daigne to giue it fauourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
I haue what I desired, and in the
hope thereof (alwaies praying for your
prosperitie and welfare) I rest</p>
