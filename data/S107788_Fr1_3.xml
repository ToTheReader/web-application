                 <title>The rooting out of the Romishe supremacie : Wherein is declared, that the authoritie which the Pope of Rome doth chalenge to him selfe ouer all Christian bishops and churches, is vnlawfully vsurped: contrarie to the expresse word and institution of our sauiour Iesu Christ who did giue equall power and authoritie to all the apostles, bishops, and ministers of his Church, whereof he is the true corner stone, and only heade.

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He moste excellent thing that Almightie God hath giuen to mankinde, is the knowledge of the trueth, the treasure of his wisdom, expressed in his holy scriptures. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it we can neither know God, nor Iesus Christ his sonne our Sauiour and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who saith of him selfe, <hi>Ego sum via,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note>
      <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas, &amp; Vita. I am the way, the trueth, and the life:</hi> and no man commeth to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but by me: and he that knoweth me, knoweth also my father. But the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this truth, which lightneth our mindes with the faith of God, and of his sonne Iesus Christ, by his holy word, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in the Scriptures, hath bene many hundred yeres couered and hidden, from the most part of all temporall men, as they are called: yea from mightie Emperours, Kings, Princes, and Magistrates of this world, through the craftie practises of the Bishoppes of Rome. Who to extoll
<pb facs="6"/> themselues and their Cleargie, aboue all Emperours and princes, haue by wicked pollicie, hidden and withdrawen from them, and from all Christians, the sacred Scriptures conteined in the old and in the newe Testamentes, that thereby the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable pride of the Bishops of Rome and their Cleargie, might not be knowen to men, least they should perceiue how farre they did varie frō the example of Christ, and the humble godly liues of his Apostles and disciples, of Bishops and ministers, for the space of vj. hundred yeares after the church was planted by our sauiour Christ. So that it came to passe, that the Bishops of Rome raged and raigned like Gods vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and no temporal prince durst as much as looke vpon the worde of God, nor haue any bookes of the holie scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, least they should haue bene excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for heretikes.</p>
   <p>An vngodly pollicie, deuised of them, to the intent, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> their deuelish pride &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable ambition might not be reformed by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> doctrine of Christ: which is most cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to their vsurped authoritie &amp; supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, which they haue chalenged and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, sith the time y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the Emperour Phocas,
<pb facs="6"/> more then sixe hundred yeres after Christ, did grant vnto Boniface the third of that name, the title and authoritie of vniuersal Bishop ouer all other Bishoppes: a thing most contrarie to our Sauiour Christes institution and commandements. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, gentle Reader, to the intent, that good Christian people should be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger abused &amp; deceiued, through the crafty practises of the Bishop of Romes decrees and counterfet gloses, whereby he hath v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped his most vniust authoritie and title of supremacy, with which he hath almost blinded all Christian people &amp; kingdoms: I haue in this treatise briefely declared the truth of our Sauiour Christs two cōmissiōs, giuen ioyntly to all his Apostles, in suche manner, that they should be in like autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and power, not one aboue the other in any degree. I haue also shewed how earnestly and straightly Christe did forbid all superioritie and dominion to be amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest thē, which I haue approued both by the holie Scriptures, and by Godly aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent writers. I haue noted farther, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was made of the Bishop of Rome in the foure first generall Councels, euen the same which was made of other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb facs="7"/> of the chiefe Sees, in Aegypt, in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, in Greece and other prouinces. I haue declared, when this vsurped supremacie did first begin, and by whome: moreouer how greatly the Bishops of Rome did fall from true Godlinesse, from the faith of Christe, after they had obtained of the Emperours, that proude vngodly title of vniuersall Bishoppe. Wherein I haue touched the wicked behauiour of a fewe of them, to giue as it were a taste of the fruites of their supremacie. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I haue opened the dealinges of good princes againste their wickednesse and tyrannie, in our owne countrie: making thereby manifest, that King Henrie the eight, was not the first king of this realme, who did expell that vsurped authoritie: but y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> almost ful two hundreth yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King Henrie the eight, it was spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at, and diuers lawes and statutes were made by diuers Kinges of this Realme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. So that by reading ouer of this little worke, they y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> desire to see the truth of this matter, shal wander, I trust, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the doubtes of darkenesse, for lacke of knowledge of the trueth, whiche is reuealed to vs by the worde of God, that
<pb facs="7"/> CHRISTE our Sauiour teacheth vs, euen hee who doeth say,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.12.</note>
      <hi>Ego sum lux mundi, I am the light of the werlde.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he that walketh in this light shall knowe the trueth, and shall not wander in darkenesse of any Popish traditions and superstitions, which is the most daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and deadly kinde of darkenesse.</p>
   <p>Now, it is saide of Christe.<note place="margin">Ioh. 12.35.</note>
      <hi>Qui ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat in tenebris, nescit quò vadit: He that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in darkenesse knoweth not whether hee goeth.</hi> Let vs therefore heare our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Iesus Christe. <hi>Ambulate dum lucem habetis, ne vos tenebrae comprehendant. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest ye haue the light of Gods worde, walke in it, least the darkenesse come vpon you, and you returne againe vnto it,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.22 Pro. 26.11.</note>
      <hi>ut canis ad vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; sus ad volutabrum. As a dogge to his vomit, as a sow to her wallowing in the filthie mire of Popishe superstitions.</hi> To the which entent, my trust is in God that this little booke shall somewhat helpe you forward by satisfying the consciences of good people, who will reade it with desire to learne the trueth. GOD graunt that we may all both learne it and followe it: that we neuer flie from it vnto errours of
<pb facs="8"/> vaine deuises of men, but onely put our whole hope, our confidence, and trust, in the death and passion of our sauiour Iesus Christ, and leade a holie life according to his worde, to the glorie of God, to whome be all honour, Dominion, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie for euer and euer. Amen.</p>
