      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Suppose and thynke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely good deuout reders / that whan you rede these pore symple werkes: some of you y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> haue had mynde to rede them / wyll nowe meruayle to se and perceyue that these ben the same werkes that went forthe before, and nothynge chaunged in substaunce / but onely the tytle, and some fewe thynges added. Some other wyll paraduenture iudge or feare in me ambicyon that I wold seme to make many werkes / and yet dyd sende forthe but the same, newely chaunged or disguysed. To satisfye therfore your deuoute myndes with the trothe in trewe
<pb facs="48"/> cōscyence / there is none such cause. But yet causes there ben dyuers appartaynynge bothe vnto you &amp; me. One cause is that I trust ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely you haue them here in a more perfecte lettre than you had before. And also more truely prynted. For (of a suretye) the tother letter was moche vicyous and faultye / &amp; that in some places, that myght seme vnto my neglygencye. And also in the same volume or boke / is one of my workes left out / whiche werke is nombred amonge the contentes of the same volume and boke. And in stede of my werke, is an other heretyke or heretycall werke set in place / and the whole boke solde for my werke / whiche thynge is the most chefe cause of the sayd muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon or chaunge. For that thynge dothe nat onely put me vnto infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye and sclaunder: but also dothe put all the reders in ieopardye of
<pb facs="48"/> conscyence to be infecte and also in the daunger of the kynges lawes, for the manyfolde erronyous opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyons that ben contayned in the same boke. Nowe iudge you (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout reders) whether these causes ben nat reasonable for the sayd mu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tacyon and chaunge. I praye you therfore of your charyte take all vnto the beste. And by my poore aduyse / rede nat those bokes that go forth without named auctours. For (doubtles) many of them that seme very deuout and good wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes: ben full of heresyes. And your olde englysshe poete sayeth. There is no poyson so peryllous of sharp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, as that is: that hathe of sugre a swetnes. I wolde gladly y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> welth and nat y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ieopardye of your soules our lord god, &amp; most swete sauyour Iesu my iudge / who kepe you, and sende you y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> increase of grace.
