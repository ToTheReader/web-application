      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Sermon, if thou be not too parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, thou shalt find, to the comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of all true subiects, the Kings title fairely pleaded against the Pope; and proued to be agreable to the written word of God, and to the example of the Church, when it was yet in the prime and flower of her age. If our Romish Rabbines could shew the like evidence for the Popes soueraigntie ouer the King, their followers (I must confesse) were to be borne with in the course of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings that way: but it being a thing, which the Scripture doth not onely not warrant, but vtterly disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uow, and which is so farre from corresponding to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of the primitiae Church, that it is antipode and quite opposite to the same, no pretence, though never so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable will absolue their doing from guilt of notorious disloyaltie, who contrarie to their allegeance do abandon the King in a right of his inheritance allowed by God; and as if that abuse were too litle, most vnnaturally do abette against him an out-landish Prelate in a most vnlawfull claime, by meare forgerie at first vsurped, and euer since by force and fraud supported and maintained. Were it
<pb facs="4"/>that the State made for it, and with fire and faggot did seeke to establish it, as a signet meet for Sions right hand, as heretofore it hath done; their fault would appeare the lesse, and they the more excusable, by how much death is of that terrible aspect, and hath so grim and ghastly a looke with it, that it is enough to quaile the courage of a right stout champion, euen in a right good cause, as we have experience of the same in <hi>Peter.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> But sith that by the positiue law of the land it is now cleane put downe, and as a bastard brat of Babylon banished the Countrie, we may iustly proclaime them for ministers of Antichrist, that in heart vndutifully wish, and by wicked practises audaciously attempt, or vnder hand couertly, but craftily, broake the restoring of it among vs againe. Wisedome would, they did looke about them, and be sure, before they take so maine a leape, lest lighting against the rocke of perdition, they be crushed to peeces with the fall. For how light account soeuer they make of the matter, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth not slightly sentence it as pettie trespasse, or veniall offence, but censureth it deeply, as a damnable sinne, for subiects to spurne against the superiour powers, as through their sides thrusting at God himselfe, whose or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance they be, and whose roome, next and immediatly vnder him, they do by speciall assignement from him occupie. And if so grieuous a penaltie as the Apostle threatens be to be inflicted vpon such as resist the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magistrate, abusing his power to protect idolatry, and to root out the name of Christ and his Gospell, as the Emperours, then being heathen, did; how do not they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the vttermost rigor of hell torments, that withstand their godly and christian King employing the authoritie
<pb facs="4"/>giuen him of God to Gods glory, and to the benefit of the people committed to his charge? They would thinke much to be conycacht in any worldly businesse they take in hand, though neuer so triuiall: How happeneth then, that they let themselues be thus sensibly gulled in a case of greatest moment, importing no lesse then their bodies and soules be worth? They are surely bewitched, else they wold neuer either by perswasion be inueigled, or by allurement entised, or by violence enforced to such an impietie, as to leaue their duety to the King, which God by expresse charge hath imposed vpon them, and to cleane vnto the Pope as a superiour commander, whom God hath inscoffed with no such priuiledge. The Scripture hath foretold of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, that he indeed would aspire vnto such an estate, and in processe of time should atchieue it, and for a certaine space hold it, till God put in the heart of Kings, to call for their owne againe,<note place="margin">Reuel. 17.</note> and with one accord and ioynt consent to pull the beast downe as fast as euer they set him vp; as already in part we see come to passe. But for any person, to whom Kings by Gods appointment should submit their swords and scepters, and may lawfully neither draw the one nor weild the other but at his becke and liking onely, they may assoone find a man in the Moone as such a one assigned there. Let them then take heede, I aduise them, how to picke a thanke and curry fauour with the Pope, they incurre the displeasure of the King: lest fearing to be beate with a paper rod, they procure themselues a whipping with quicke Scorpions; lest flying a painted smoke, they run headlong into a hot burning fire; and shunning an imagined <hi>Scylla,</hi> fall ouer helmet and crest into an essentiall <hi>Charybdis.</hi> For assuredly as the Popes
<pb facs="5"/>blessing when it is at the best, and poured out in his fuliest horn, is scarce worth a good shoebuckle; so his curse, though with bell booke and candle, is but as a fillip or fleabiting in effect: whereas disobedience to the King doth bring the offenders to vndoubted ruine, as here for the present, so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally in the world to come.<note place="margin">Spem pretio non emam.</note>
      <hi>Sannio</hi> in <hi>Terence,</hi> as simple as he was, yet would not buy a pig in a poke, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the prouerb: for so he knew he might haply be chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and disburse his money to his owne disaduantage. But these be so sottish, nay stupid, that they sticke not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to aduenture all their wealth temporall and eternal, in a ship that hath a maine breach in the bottome, and so is no sooner lanched out from the shore into the deepe, but it sinkes streight, and is sure to miscarie without hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. They might do far better, and shew more discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a great deale, to answer the Popes solliciters in that wicked motion, as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> did the harlot <hi>Lais</hi> in another vnreasonable demand: <hi>Tanti poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere non emo:</hi>

      </note> We list not buy a rue-bargaine so deare. He hath good lucke if he run not into forfeiture, that seals an obligation, and neuer takes notice of the condition; he may well come to beshrew himselfe and sit downe with losse, that strikes hands before he be throughtly made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the match; he is not like to win the game that playes his cardes at randon as they be dealt, without so much as looking whether he followeth sute or no: And are not they worthy to perish with Antichrist, that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his tyrannicall vsurpation as a chiefe article of their Creed, and therefore not onely inwardly to be assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto,<note place="margin">In their Cases of conscience, the 55. Article</note> but openly to be professed, though death ensue, before they haue well searched whether it be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="5"/>to the analogy of faith expressed in the Scriptures, the onely authentical and self-complete rule of all true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licisme? It will not serue their turne before God to say, such and such learned men so informed vs; no more then it did the Iewes, which gaue their voices to Christs crucifying, that the Scribes and Pharisees, and high Priest had induced them so to do. They would be loth to cut their coate after anothers measure, or to bespeake their shooes by anothers last; for so they might be made either too straite, and wring them; or ouer wide, and not fit them. What mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell then, if they stray from the right faith, who frame their iudgement to the opinion of other, of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge perhaps profound enough, and neuer exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether it be answerable to the platforme of sound doctrine? Truth is not pinned to the schoole doores, nor tyed to the girdle of great Clearkes, but is confined onely within the limits of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And as no gold was accounted holy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Temple, so there is no doctrine to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned Catholicke, but what hath his warrant and ground there. If all that take vpon them the name of Teachers in the Church, were <hi>ipso facto</hi> inspired of God, and Orthodoxall, the danger were not so great, nor the caution so needfull: but since all is not gold that glistereth, nor euerie one that pretends well, intends well, but there be swarmes of false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets abroad in the world, such as can say one thing, and thinke another: carrie bread in the one hand, and a stone in the other: such as in painted boxes for whosesome Triacle sell ranke poyson: vnder a
<pb facs="6"/>pleasant baite, hide a deadly hooke: and vpon counterfeit mettall, set a right stampe: Scorpions that haue amiable faces, but stinging tailes: Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles, that vnder teares can shrowd treason: Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian <hi>Sinons,</hi>

Onely I request them to peruse it with indifferencie, all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious affection set aside; and then in Gods name let them iudge, and doe as they see cause. I can
<pb facs="6"/>but perswade: it lieth in them whether they will yeeld or no. In the meane while, good Reader, I bid thee heartily farewell.</p>
