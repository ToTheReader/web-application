                 <title>A treatise tending to mitigation tovvardes Catholicke-subiectes in England : VVherin is declared, that it is not impossible for subiects of different religion, (especially Catholickes and Protestantes) to liue togeather in dutifull obedience and subiection, vnder the gouernment of his Maiesty of Great Britany. Against the seditious wrytings of Thomas Morton minister, &amp; some others to the contrary. Whose two false and slaunderous groundes, pretended to be dravvne from Catholicke doctrine &amp; practice, concerning rebellion and equiuocation, are ouerthrowne, and cast vpon himselfe. Dedicated to the learned schoole-deuines, cyuill and canon lavvyers of the tvvo vniuersities of England. By P.R</title>

   <p>IT was no part of my purpose (learned Countrey-men) when I tooke this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise first in hand, either to wade so farre therin, as now I haue byn compelled; or yet to prefix any other Epistle Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory before the same, then the large common Preface it selfe that doth ensue, which may partly appeare by the argument therof, as namely also and principally, by that which we haue set downe in the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Treatise: for that taking in hand, but to point, as it were, at the exorbitant number of some monstrous, and malitious lyes, and slaunders cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad this last yeare in a certayne small contemptible, but wicked and hatefull libell, vnder the tytle of <hi>A dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of Romish doctrine in the case of Conspiracy and Rebellion by T. M.</hi> I thought it sufficient to that purpose to shew not only the cankred vntruthes of those most false &amp; virulent calumniations; but the many inōueniences<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors first intention.</note> also, and publicke hurtes, which do, and must needes ensue to any Common wealth, that suffereth such ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous tongues to sow hatred, dissention, diffidence,
<pb facs="3"/>
and the seedes of perpetuall emnity and alienation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Subiects therof.</p>
   <p n="2">2. Which point hauing to my iudgment sufficiently performed, I saw a farre greater booke published from the same Author stuffed with Marchandize of like marke, but yet imbracing more matter, to wit, n t only the former argument, or inuectiue of heynous <hi>Rebellion;</hi> but (to vse the writers wordes) <hi>of heathenish, hellish, and execrable Equiuocation,</hi> chargin Catholicke people so deeply and desperatly in them both, as t<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>at in these two respects, they are not only in his censure insociable, &amp; intractable, but also insufferable in any Protestant common wealth: whervpon I was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as well to reassume againe that which before I had done and layd aside, vpon certayn causes whi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>h afterwards are vttered; as also to dilate my selfe much further, for defence of equity and truth, and for the repressing somwhat this violent rayling <hi>

Wherin what I haue performed for their iust and lawfull defence, I leaue it to the Iudgement of yow my learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men, after yow shall haue read ouer this our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, presuming that your learning and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is accōpanyed also with such ingenuity of good nature, and maturity of Iudgement, as yow will not be carryed away with the wynd, and sound of wordes only as others of lesser capacity; nor yet be much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the false outcryes of perfidious Make-bates, who inraged with the imaginations of hate and auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, do like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="3"/>
of this fyerie Minister to be nothing els, but euaporations of a hoate distempered brayne with aboundance of hatred and want of Christian charit.</p>
   <p n="3">3. And to say a word or two of the reasons that moued me to present this worke to yow the learned of our English Vniuersities in the foresayd sciences of Schoole- Deuinity and Lawe, both Canon &amp; Ciuill, wherof the first is, that the question of <hi>Equiuocation</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> (wherof our chiefe contention is) being a matter handled in these three facultyes, (though vpon diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent occasions) yow can far better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> therof then<note place="margin">Reasons of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</note> others, who apprehending only the name togeather with their owne conceipts therof without true knowledge of the groundes, reasons &amp; circumstances wherby it is made lawfull, doe not so eagerly, as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly, cry out against it, condemning &amp; detesting that which they vnderstand not, as largly is declared in the 7. Chapter of the ensuing Treatise, which is the first concerning that argument. But such as are more conuersant and better studied in the said sciences, and know the true principles wheron the question stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, are not so rash nor headlong, but goe more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruedly therin, distinguishing betweene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> and vnlawfull, <hi>Amphybologie</hi> or <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> as signing to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> one their tymes, cases, causes, reseruations and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, according to the obseruation of <hi>Aristotle: Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentis est distinguere;</hi> It appertayneth to a wise and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet man to distinguish; wheras the ignorant and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned doth commonly confound all without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction.</p>
   <p n="4">4. My second reason was, for that forreine Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and learned men therof, vnde standing such a booke to haue byn set forth by an English Vniuersity man, <hi>and not without direction</hi> (as he saith) <hi>from his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,</hi> wherin all vse of <hi>Equiuocation</hi> or <hi>Amphybology</hi> in any case whatsoeuer is condemned as vnlawfull, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
<pb facs="4"/>
execrable, hellish, heathenish, the black-art,</hi> and other such tearmes, without respect or regard, that in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vniuersityes in Catholicke Coūtreyes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, in all Courtes and Tribunalls, and in all learned Authors &amp; professors of the foresaid three faculties, for many ages, some vse therof hath byn taught and allowed: diuers learned (I say) haue won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred therat and laughed also, especially being aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised that this doctrine of <hi>Equiuocation</hi> is ascribed, as a new thing to the Iesuits, wheras many ages before their name was heard of in the world this doctrine was known, taught, and held. Wherfore these stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are wont to demaund, whether there be any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men indeed in these three facultyes now in our Vniuersities, and whether any be studyed in Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Deuinity and the Lawes, either Ciuill or Canon; for if there be, it seemes impossible to them that such a booke should be suffered to come forth so full of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as this is. For (say they) if they had read or loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ouer but these heads in the said sciences, to wit, <hi>of the nature of truth and lyinge</hi> of the lawfullnes of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation in certaine cases both in wordes &amp; works, as namely, in stratagemes of war, of the lawfulnes of couering some truth vpon iust occasion in the Canon law out of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> of <hi>

            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> or<note place="margin">Sundry heades vvherin Equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is touched both in Lavv and Deuinity.</note>
      <hi>vtilis</hi> in the same law out of <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> and other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; of the cases wherin a man may sweare, or not sweare lawfully, or not be bound to keep his oath; of the question whether God can deceiue, or any man else by his spirit, of the limitations of an accuser and defendant; of the obligation of a witnes to vtter, deny or dissemble the truth; of the office of a Iudge, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate, or Solicitour in accusation or defence of any body; of the cases wherin secresy is necessarily to be obserued by all lawfull meanes, both in &amp; out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and diuers other such like heades of doctrine,
<pb facs="4"/>
as occurre daylie in all the foresaid three faculties, and in the common vse of mans life; these learned men affirme, that it is impossible for our Vniuersity-Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors to haue read and weighed them, but they must confesse the lawfulnes of <hi>Equiuocation</hi> in diuers cases, and that it may be without lying (which is lawfull in no case, nor for any cause whatsoeuer.) Wherof they inferre that either their sciences are not studyed in our Vniuersites, or that the students profit little in them, or that the worst learned of all are suffered to write bookes: which thing for that it appertayneth to the disgrace of your so famous Schooles; I thought it one sufficiēt cause amongst the rest, to dedicate this Answere vnto yow.</p>
   <p n="5">5. My third reason was to moue yow by this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to consider more attentiuely what manner of men they be for the most part, that write in England at this day; how shallow in the matters they take vpō them to make bookes of; but especially to wish yow, that when any booke commeth forth, yow would but examine the truth of the citations which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by them, for this only would be sufficient to informe and satisfie yow where the truth is. And so I desire no more but your attention in this one point, for the decision of the controuersie betweene me and <hi>Thomas Morton:</hi> for if yow find him to haue dealt sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerly in alleaging his Authors, I am content he haue the victory, though he haue behaued himself other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise neuer so weakly. For triall of which point, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my self to that, which I haue handled afterward more plentifully and perticularly in the 2. 6. and 12. Chapters of purpose.</p>
   <p n="6">6. But yet for that since the writing of the ensuing Preface, I haue read and pervsed two Epistles of his last booke intituled, <hi>A full satisfaction,</hi> the one to the Kings Maiesty, the other to the seduced brethren, as
<pb facs="5"/>
scornfully he calleth the Catholickes, which Epistles haue as much gaule in them as the mans dispitefull stomake could vtter, I shall pray yow to haue patience with me, if I runne ouer briefly certaine notes out of the said Epistles, wherby yow may partly take notice of the mans talent in writing, but especially in ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge, vntill yow come vnto a more full view therof in the sequele of this our Answere that doth ensue.</p>
   <p n="7">7. Thus then he beginneth with his Maiesty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in some halfe dosen lines after the entrance of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle.<note place="margin">T M his app<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. <hi>initio.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Innocency,</hi> (saith he) <hi>which though naked was neuer ashamed, hath charged me to manifest my self vnto your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and togeather with my Aduersarye to appeale vnto your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōparable wisdome, which I doe in so constant assurance of an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right cōscience as that I shal willingly remit that iust aduantage, which the difference of comparison both betweene a legitimate or conformable subiect, and a person suspiciously degenerate, as also betweene a Minister of simple truth, and a professed Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocator doth offer vnto me.</hi> Heere yow see him vaunt of sundry points; as first of his <hi>naked innocency,</hi> which we haue afterwards to his greater shame, so cloathed with the foule ragges of his lying and most deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dealing, as she may no more be called <hi>a naked,</hi> but rather a clouted innocency, if innocency at all, and not rather malicious nocencie, intending to wound and iniury the iust, and such as are faultles and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in deed.</p>
   <p n="8">8 Secondly he appealeth to his Maiestyes <hi>incōparable</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
      <hi>wisdome,</hi> as yow see, <hi>in the constant assurance of an vpright conscience;</hi> but we haue shewed throughout this whole worke, that nothing is further of from this fellow, then any conscience at all: for that we haue taken him in so many wilfull falsifications and corruptions (wherin he could not but know that he did lye and falsify;) as besides all other examples layd forth in sundry seuerall partes of this Answere, I haue byn
<pb facs="5"/>
forced to make a speciall Chapter therof, which is the sixt of this ensuring worke, where as also in the 4. Paragraph of the 2. Chapter and els where, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der shall fynd such store of testimonyes against the vprightnes of this mans conscience, as I dare assure my selfe, he will leese, with indifferent men, <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant assurance</hi> of honesty, howsoeuer in his owne opinion he may hold the same assurance for other matters.</p>
   <p n="9">9. Thirdly he saith to his Maiesty <hi>he doth willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that iust aduantage which the difference of a legitimate and</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
      <hi>conformable subiect, and a person suspiciously degenerate doth offer vnto him:</hi> wherin what he would say I do rather ghesse by discourse, then vnderstand by the sense of his wordes. For I imagine that the Minister would<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of T. M.</note> say, that he is ready and prest to conforme himselfe to any thing, that the State or Prince shall appoint him, as well in Religion, as in other matters whatsoeuer, and that therin cōsisteth his vprightnes of conscience, to wit, to be conformable. And for that his aduersary shewing himselfe (perhaps) more scrupulous and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous in certayne pointes concerning his soule or conscience, and not so conformable: therfore he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him <hi>suspiciously degenerate, and no legitimate, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable subiect,</hi> which whither it tendeth, and towardes what gate of Atheisme, or Herodianisme, euery man that hath Iudgement and conscience in deed will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily discerne.</p>
   <p n="10">10. But of all the rest, the fourth point is the most ridiculous, wherin he intituleth himselfe, <hi>A minister</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
      <hi>of simple truth,</hi> and his aduersary <hi>A professed Equiuocator,</hi> wheras I haue shewed in the 7. and 12. Chapters of this Answere, first, that such as grant the lawfulnes of <hi>Equiuocation</hi> in some limited cases, are farre more seuere &amp; rigorous against al kynd of lying in the least things that may be (as appeareth by their knowne, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<pb facs="6"/>
doctrine by vs set downe,) then are their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaryes in the greatest; yea highest kind or degree of that sinne, I meane of lying: and in the second, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the multiplicy of conuictions, wherby I haue made demonstration of this mans falsity euery where, I haue shewed in the foresaid 12. Chapter, that he (<hi>this Minister</hi> to wit <hi>of simple truth</hi>) as also his fellowes<note place="margin">A Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of simple truth.</note> which professe themselues such enemyes of lawfull Equiuocation that may be vsed without lying, do Equiuocate euery where in the worst &amp; most sinfull sort of flat lying that may be imagined, without any reseruation or veile, or substance of truth at all. For proofe wherof I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> me to the said 12. Chapter, and shall returne to follow this fellow somwhat further in the said Epistle to his Maiesty.</p>
   <p n="11">11. For not many lynes after the former passage, by occasion of certayne wordes of him that first answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him about a march of apes; he taketh vpon him to set forth a certayne march of Soldiers cōming against his Maiesty and other Protestant Princes from the 7. hills of Babilon, to wit Rome, saying thus: <q>May it<note place="margin">Epistle to the King.</note> please your sacred Maiesty, to see how exactly they imitate Souldiers in their march? <hi>Parsons,</hi> teaching persecution against all Kings and States Protestant, doth propound for his imitation the example of <hi>Dauid</hi>
         <note place="margin">A sayned march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Maiesty.</note> in his conflict against <hi>Goliah: Allen,</hi> the example of <hi>Eliah</hi> in calling, if it were possible, for fyre from heauen to consume the Messengers of Kings: <hi>Reynolds</hi> the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iabel</hi> to knock <hi>Generaels</hi> on the head: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the example of <hi>Iehoida,</hi> and other Priestes for murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of opposite Queenes: <hi>Sanders,</hi> the example of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tathias,</hi> who fought against King <hi>Antiochus: Simancha</hi> the example of <hi>Heathenish Scythians,</hi> who murthered their naturall King <hi>Scyles: Boucher</hi> the example of <hi>Sampson,</hi> to kill, if they can, a thousand of his supposed <hi>Philisthians</hi> with the iaw bone of an Asse.</q>

but which himselfe maketh, to wit, where somtymes to seeme to finde a difference where none is, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeth our Authors flatly, and forceth them to speake one against an other, as in many places we do demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate and leaue him with the shame.</p>
   <p n="17">17. Wherfore to say as he doth that our <hi>execrable Equiuocations</hi> are sufficiently refelled by him with the testimonyes of our <hi>most principall Doctors</hi> is as true, as that <hi>he is a Minister of simple truth, and naked innocency, and of constant assurance of an vpright conscience:</hi> all which are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous<note place="margin">A fond vaunt of T.

   <p n="19">19. But now let the iudicious Reader obserue the malice, and falshood of this obseruation, and therby iudge, whether the Author therof be a <hi>Minister of simple</hi>

      <hi>truth</hi> or no. <hi>Polydore</hi> saith only that sometymes Popes, as other Princes in like manner, haue had names, that haue byn different, or rather contrary to their nature &amp; manners, which is an ordinary case if we examine the signification of men and womens names; but that Popes names were changed of purpose by <hi>Antiphrasis,</hi> or contrary speach to couer their defectes, as heere is set downe, this is a malicious lye of the Minister, and hath neither <hi>simplicyty,</hi> nor <hi>truth</hi> in it, for that all these names heere mentioned of <hi>Leo, Clemens, Vrbanus, Pius, Bonifacius, Innocentius, and Gregory,</hi> were chosen by the Popes that tooke them for the great reuerence, and estimation they had of certayne excellent men of that name that went before them; as also for the good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodement of their future gouernment, and to be styr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp the more by the memory of those names to the vertues signified by them; but especially for the honor and imitation of the first Popes that bare those names. As for example of <hi>S.

   <p n="20">20. The like may be said of <hi>S. Clement</hi> the first and next Pope after <hi>S. Peter;</hi> and the same of <hi>S.

   <p n="21">21. But he goeth further yet in folly to magnify his owne learning and to compare the same with no lesse then <hi>Aristotle. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

For that any man lightly whether he vnderstand Latyn, or no, if he see or heare the precedence both of question and answere, will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily ghesse what the reseruation is, if he suspect any to be at all, as if a man doe heare or reade the premisses of a syllogisme in English, he will easely ghesse at the conclusion, though it be in Latin; yea if he be of any meane capacity, he will gather the inference himselfe
<pb facs="9"/>
by naturall discourse. Wherfore this of <hi>Aristotles</hi> books was brought in only by the vayne Minister to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with his bookes, <hi>or,</hi> as he calleth them, <hi>his disputes, so published</hi> (forsooth) <hi>as not published,</hi> for that he imagineth that the common capacity of men cannot reach vnto the depth therof, he wadeth so profoundly in his owne folly.

      <hi>to the deceyued brethren,</hi> it is so short, fond &amp; ydle a thing, that it deserueth no answere at all, the principall point, whervpon he standeth therin, being this, that Catholicke people are seduced by their priestes, <hi>who</hi>

         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> the story, then the inference.</p>
   <p n="25">25. About the story, <hi>S.

giue them store of money and to bid them say, that in the night when they were a sleepe his disciples came and stole him away, and so they did. And <hi>S.

Or is not this an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion fit for one of those Doctors wherof <hi>S. Paul</hi> talketh, that vnderstand not what they say, or wherof they affirme.
