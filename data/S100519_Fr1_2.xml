   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N such bookes as some of our brethren haue bin lately constrayned to set out for your satisfaction: there is often mention made of the contention at <hi>Wisbich</hi> begun <hi>1595.</hi> Of this contention, there haue gone many reports: and as yet the truth thereof hath not bin so fully published, as it is conuenient: the indirect course of our new aduersaries considered. Such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with our English Iesuitisme, do ascribe all the blame in that behalfe vnto vs, that are secular Priests: in that we could not be brought to alter our old orders for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement of Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> a Iesuite to become our Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or Agent; as his faction tearmed him. To make this matter therefore as cleare as the sunne, and that no indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete Catholike may be ignorant of the truth herein, if he will not wilfully shut his eyes, or stop his eares, as our Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest would haue them: we haue thought it our duties to deliuer vnto you from point to point (as in the sight of God) the beginning and proceeding of those garboyles then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs. And at this time, we are the rather moued so to do: because it hath pleased Maister <hi>Blackwell</hi> our sayd Arch-priest, very lately to send to his twelue Assistants to be diuulged a certaine Censure, or (we know not what to tearme it) a sheet of paper, fraught neither with wit, honest dealing, discretion, or learning: but in effect with as many shifts and lyes almost as lines, in derogation not only of some of the said bookes set out by our brethren, tearming the same (as if either he himselfe, or some of his commaunders the Iesuites had made them) to be seditious bookes: but likewise taketh vpon him, to touch the said contention, not in many words, but with much follie and great vntruth. We will be bold by way of Preface, a little to touch them.</p>
   <p>These are his words. The first point (sayth he, meaning the diuision at <hi>Wisbich)</hi> was a thing long since ended with great edification, and by the meanes principally of those
<pb facs="3"/>
which are most condemned. It toucheth the greater and better part of that company. It nothing concerneth our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: it being more auncient, and hauing orders taken at the attonement by their owne consent. It is well knowne at <hi>Rome</hi> by whose meanes they were disanulled. Neither is it more vnfitting for those which liued in one house to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute rules for such as voluntarily demaunded and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them then to procure a sodality abroade. Thus farre our Arch-priest: and it is all he writeth to his assistants of this matter: which we the rather note to shew the extremity of his pride, in supposing by such an answere to the sayd bookes concerning that diuision to wipe away those imputations &amp; matters, wherwith both Fa. <hi>Garnet,</hi> &amp; Fa. <hi>Weston,</hi> &amp; he himselfe in some sort are charged. That which here he sayth either touching our contention at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> or any thing whereof he hath written to his sayd assistants against the sayd bookes, is fully answered in print by one of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, a true Catholick Priest: We hartily pray you to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the booke, and then iudge of our Arch-priest as you finde him. In the meane while and because this our treatise may come to your hands before the other, although the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story following doth sufficiently confute his words by vs now cited: yet will we giue you some little tryall of our new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors wisedome and sinceritie, by that which here he writeth.</p>
   <p>The first point (sayth he) was a thing long since ended. And what then maister <hi>Blackwell?</hi> will you reason thus? It was long since ended: ergo, maister <hi>Garnet</hi> and maister <hi>Weston,</hi> the firebrands of that garboile with their factious adherents are not to be blamed as our brethren haue writ of them in their sayd booke? But we beseech you sir vpon your small credit tell vs, is that contention long since ended? Nay rather (speake man) is it ended as yet? It was in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: whether it were meete, and according to the auncient ecclesiasticall Discipline, that a Iesuite should haue the commaundement ouer secular Priests. And is this point
<pb facs="3"/>
yet decided? There was we confesse (as we thought) an end made amongst vs <hi>1596.</hi> by maister <hi>Mush,</hi> and maister <hi>Dudley,</hi> and that with edification: but it fell out farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. The edification you make mention of was nothing sutable to that edification, whereof the Apostle speaketh: but was much more agreeable to the building of <hi>Babell</hi> that tower of confusion. For whilest we of the vnitie were quiet, and supposed all had bin well: maister <hi>Garnet,</hi> and his subiect maister <hi>Weston,</hi> were so moued, that they had bin disappointed of their sayd gouernment amongst vs, as like prowde <hi>Nymrods</hi> and boisterous hunters they cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout how to bring vs vnder them by an other stratageme, ȧs by the historie it will appeare.</p>
   <p>When he also further sayth, that the end he mentioneth was made by the meanes principally of those which are most condemned: he meaneth maister <hi>Garnet</hi> and maister <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> to be those principall persons; or else his speech is sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse: and then also he writeth most falsely. For true it is, that the end which we supposed had bin made, was compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by maister <hi>Mush</hi> and maister <hi>Dudley</hi> full sore against the harts and good likings of the sayd two Iesuites. Mary if he meane such an end of the sayd contention as they two propounded to themselues, which was but an interim to a further mischiefe, such an end, as then they respected and sought after, and do now perswade themselues to haue found it (whilest maister <hi>Garnet</hi> ruleth the roast) then indeede Fa. <hi>Garnet</hi> and Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> may truly be sayd to haue bin the especiall contriuers of it: otherwise it proceedeth from incredible boldnes to pretend them to be authors of any good peace, who breathe forth nothing but dissension and cruelty.</p>
   <p>And where he sayth (as we suppose) that maister <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> and maister <hi>Weston,</hi> are two men now most condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: it is true that they are indeed condemned for their Machiuilian practises against their brethren: being (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of their Fatherhoods) so puft vp with pride and arrogancic, as it is scarse probable to relate. But yet some
<pb facs="4"/>
exception may iustly be taken to his words, in that he sayth, they are most condemned. For in good sooth, we thinke his maistership as farre too blame as either of them, or more: in that being a secular Priest, he doth so tyrannize ouer his owne brethren by calling, and hath not the wit to see, how he is abused and made a puppie to daunce after their pipe, and to execute what they do commaund him.</p>
   <p>But it followeth for sooth: that the said diuision toucheth the greater and better part of that company. Alack alack, doth it so? It toucheth indeede the greater part: and that very neerely: for it shewed them for the time to be very factious: such as secretly banded, and combined themselues with a Iesuite against their fellow prisoners and brethren. And therefore in that hee sayth those conspiring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were the better part, he speaketh like himselfe very vntruly, as we in our indgements do esteeme of honest men. Mary in his sense, and according to the common saying, the veryer knaues, the better luck: they may well be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the better part: because none are iudged vertuous or of any estimation that oppose themselues against the Iesuites, or refuse to worship their Iesuiticall Idoll our Arch-priest. And yet we will be content to let them go for once as he would haue them: so he ioyne those words with the other that follow: and to this effect. The sayd contention tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the better part, and therefore it concerneth neither himselfe, nor any of his louing assistants, nor their impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable authoritie. But in good sooth maister <hi>Blackwell,</hi> speake truly man: doth not that contention in some sort touch your high authoritie? Was it not the ground of it? If we had yeelded to Fa. <hi>Westons</hi> agencie, had you bin euer aduaunced as you are? Did not our garboyles beget your greatnes? If maister <hi>Weston</hi> had preuailed with vs, mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Garnet</hi> would haue wiped your nose for dealing like a yong prince abroade-as you do. And therefore indeed in a right good sense, wee are your good maisters, and so you ought to esteeme vs. But if we should deale more seriously
<pb facs="4"/>
with you, and vrge you to set downe, wherein the said great part was, or is the better: what durst you say, if you haue any sparke of the feare of God before your eyes? Are they better learned? for shame you will not say it. Are their liues more sincere? I hope you will charge vs with no disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie: or if you dare, we defye you: being in our liues we trust blameles before men, and euery way as honest as your selfe at the least.</p>
   <p>As touching the orders you speake of; they were yeelded vnto (it is true) by our consent, and that most willinglie: but as for maister <hi>Weston,</hi> it so stroke him to the hart to yeeld vnto them, as he fell downe presently before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany into a swoune: such was his pride, and so vnwilling he was to be ouer-ruled for the time. And whereas our Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest saith: that it is well knowne at <hi>Rome</hi> by whose means the said orders were disanulled: we are glad to heare it, and haue taken some little paines in this treatise, to make it also as well knowne here in <hi>England.</hi> If his meaning be that we of the Vnity did first disanull them, he sayth vntruly, and they in <hi>Rome</hi> are falsely informed. No, no, those orders crossed too much the Iesuites deseignements to haue any long continuance, where they had any factious creatures to infringe them.</p>
   <p>But that which followeth, is worthie some especiall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Neither was it more vnfitting (sayth maister <hi>Blackwell)</hi> for those which liued in one house to institute rules, for such, as voluntarily demaunded and accepted them, then to procure a sodality abroade. In good faith we are sory, that we are compelled to disclose this fellowes fals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hood, and how much he is sunne-burnt with Iesuitisme. It is a world to see how artificially he doth smooth ouer in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> place diuers false, and some very absurd points. And firs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> consider we pray you: whether it was as fit for Priests i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> prison to choose a Iesuite to rule them, as for other Priests abroade, to desire to haue a Bishop to gouerne them: and whether suiteth better with the auncient discipline of the
<pb facs="5"/>
Catholick Church for secular Priests to sue to the Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall of the Iesuites to haue a Iesuite for their head: or for others to sue to his holynes to assigne them a Bishop. But let this passe: and proceede we to the rest: and when you heare the truth in a word, then consider the mans sinceritie. It will appeare vnto you by the history following, that Fa. <hi>Weston</hi> had bin laboring for a superioritie ouer his brethren for the space of seauen yeeres. To that purpose he had insinuated himselfe by hypocrisie, and vnequall distribution of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into the fauors of the yonger sort, such as were either themselues Iesuites, or else inclining thereunto. The Rules he speaketh of, were of Fa. <hi>Westons</hi> owne making. And all this was done secretly, the grauer sort of the company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neuer acquainted with it. When they had contriued their busines, as you haue heard: they pretend themselues to be more holy, then the rest of vs whom they misliked: and that therefore, in respect of the sinnes that raigned amongst vs; they would no more either eate or drinke with vs, but would haue their diet by themselues. And in conclusion, they seuered themselues from vs, and dealt as you shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in this treatise at large; more like <hi>Donatists,</hi> then Catholick Priests. And all this inquitie doth this Iesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Arch-priest couer in the sayd words, so Clarkly masked with good tearmes, without any regard either of conscience, or common honesty, but to abuse the world, for the better vpholding of his owne credit: which being gotten by fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, is still yet so mainteined. But we keepe you too long from the story it selfe: and therefore referring you for this matter to the sayd printed discourse, in answere both of it, and many other points, we commit you by our prayers to Almighty God, who open your eyes and harts, that you may truly discerne betweene wolues and true pastors of your soules, and accordingly to imbrace them, as heretofore you haue done, and we hope will do hereafter.</p>
