   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a custome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the Cretans, (gentle readers) when
they intended to vse their most bitter and vehementest execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, to desire
that those whom they hated, should fixe their whole delights and likings on an
inueterate and euill custome. This Cretan course, I feare me, is fallen vppon
our age, wherein men are so accustomed to vanitie, that nothing is pleaseth
which is not pleasant, nothing is sought after which is not amorous. Which
lamentable error and sicknes of our time, beeing so ordinarie, I almost waxe in
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire of the happie issue of my deuotion: for some I know will condemn me,
&amp; that iustly, for a <hi>Galba</hi> (who begat foul children by night, and
made fayre pictures by daie:) To whom I answere, that I paint fair <pb facs="6"/>
things in the light of my meditation, who begot the soule forepassed progenie
of my thoughts, in the night of mine error. Some other, (and they
superstitiously ignorant) will accuse me for writing these teares, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
rather with <hi>Brentius,</hi> to impaire the honor of the mother of God, than
with <hi>Bernard</hi> to inhance it. To whom I answer, that it is better
imitating many holy mens deuotion, than cleauing to a few mens foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and
gracelesse contemptes. For other that haue wept (as <hi>Peter</hi> his
apostasie, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> her losse &amp; misse of Christ,) their teares
wrought from them either for repent or loue. But these teares of <hi>Marie</hi>
the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, are not onely ratified by a motherlie compassion, a working
charitie, &amp; vnstay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loue, but by a manifest prophesie, wherein
<hi>Zacharie</hi> tolde her, <hi>Et tuam ipsius animam pertransibit
gladius,</hi> And the sword of sorrow shall pearce thy heart. And the reason is
anexed, To the end that the harts of many may be opened. This swoord of griefe,
sayth <hi>Beda,</hi> is the swoord of sorrow for our Lordes passion,
Chrisostome and Bernard, the sword of loue. To good men therefore let this
suffice, that in imitation <pb facs="6"/> of no lesse than fiue &amp; twenty
ancient, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Catholique Fathers of the Church, I haue enterprised this
<hi>Prosopopeia</hi>: to the bad I yeeld no reason at all, who wanting
deuotion, can haue no feeling at all. Some there bee that will not onely gybe
at this complaint, but impaire the person, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Maries</hi>
demerite all that which the fathers in her life helde marueilous, to whome
beside the speciall testimones of Iohn Damascene, and holy Gregory, who haue
written largely of her dignities, I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that of Bernards, <hi>Quod seminae
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperat, humilitas sine exemplo, quod faemina Deo principetur, sublimitas
sine modo.</hi> Some there be that will accuse the stile, as to stirring, some
the passion, as too vehement. To the first I will be thankfull, if they amend
mine errours: to the next I wish more iudgment, to examine circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. Some
(and they too captious) will auowe that Scriptures are misapplied, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
mistaken, sentences dismembred. Whome I admonish (and that earnestlie) to
beware of detraction, for it either shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth meere ignorance, or mightie enuie,
for <pb facs="7"/> the detracter first of all sheweth himselfe to be void of
charitie, and next of all extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth charitie in others. To leaue them
satisfied therefore, let this sussise, I haue written nothing without example,
I build no wares on mine owne abilitie. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they hold it mistaken
which they haue not read, let them acquaint mee wyth their mislikes, I will
further their readings and establish their iudgements.</p>
   <p>Finally, whosoeuer Turke like, seeketh to kill mee with reproofes,
for cherishing him with meditation, let him beware of ingratitude, least
according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Platonikes, hee proue <hi>Corpus
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuiosum,</hi> a forgetfull and fantastike bodie.</p>
   <p>Hauing thus preuented the captious, I turne to you curteous and
vertuous rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to whome I commit and commende these labors, wherein if you
exercise your selues you shall gouern your senses, which as Gregorie
witnesseth, are certaine win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, whereat the waters of temptation doo enter.
In meditating with Marie, you shall finde Iesus: in knowing Christs
suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, you shall be instamed in his loue: in hearing his wordes, you shal
partake his <pb facs="7"/> wisdome, which who inioteth, leaueth the world as
transitorie, and seeketh after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for immortalitie. Heereon Augustine
exclaimeth, Vnhappie is he that knoweth all things, &amp; knoweth thee not:
blessed is he that knoweth thee to despise all things. If these stirreanie fire
of deuotion in you, then shal I not greue to see the Baalits, my reprouers,
mangle themselues for shame, whilest the fire of Gods intire loue consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
and drieth the sacrifice, Briefly, our Lord send a plentifull haruest of teares
by this meditation, that the deuout heereby may wax more confident, the
incredulous beleeuing: the indifferent, more zealous, that now at last after I
haue wounded the world with too much surfet of vanitie, I maye bee by the true
Helizeus, cleansed from the leprosie of my lewd lines, &amp; bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing washed in
the Iordan of grace, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my labour to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
