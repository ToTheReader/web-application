      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo causes (Right Honourable and Worshipfull) haue moued me to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish this present Treatise of the plague; One is the duetie and loue which I owe to this Citie (wherein I was bred and brought vp, and for which (as the Orator <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Offices, and the Philosopher <hi>Plato</hi> in his Common-weale do testifie) euery good man ought to employ his vttermost indeuour: The next is a charitable remorse I haue conceiued to see my poore country-men and afflicted brethren turmoiled and attainted with the greeuous sicknes of the Plague: and left without guide or counsaile how to succour themselues in extremitie: For where the infestion most rageth there po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie raigneth among the Commons, which hauing no supplies to satisfie the greedie desire of those that should attend them, are for the most part left desolate &amp; die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reliefe. For their sakes haue I vndertaken this prouince to write of the plague, to the end that with a litle charge

a poore man may haue instructions by a litle reading both to know and to cure all the euil accidents that attend the diseases. It resteth in your Honor &amp; those your right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull assistance, to haue especiall care that this chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table intent of mine may be furthered by your discreet or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in such manner that these bookes may be dispearsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those families that are visited, to the end they may finde comfort and cure by their owne hands and diligence. This is the only reward I require, as Almightie God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to whose mercy I commend you. From my house in <hi>Warwicke Lane,</hi> this 19. of August.</p>
