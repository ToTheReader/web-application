      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen: I am bold to present you with the first fruits of my Skill, which albeit it may seeme hereditarie vnto mee, my Father being a Lutenist, and well knowne amongst you here in England, as in most parts of Christendome beside. I am sure you are not ignorant of that old saying, <hi>Labore Deum omnia vendere</hi>: And how perfection in any skill cannot be attained vnto without the waste of many yeeres, much cost, and excessiue labour and industrie, which though I cannot attribute to my selfe, being but young in yeeres, I haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured like a desperate Souldier to thrust my selfe into the Vant-gard, and to passe the Pikes of the sharpest Censures, but I trust without daunger, because we finde it true in Nature that those who haue loued the Father, will seldome hate the Sonne. And not vnlike in reason that I should distast all, since my meanes and helpes of attaining what I haue, haue beene extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. Touching this I haue done, they are Collections gathered together with much labour out of the most excellent Authors, as well of those beyond the Seas, as out of the workes of our owne Countrimen. The Treatise of fingering I thought no scorne to borrow of <hi>Iohn Baptisto Besardo</hi> of Visonti, being a man generally knowne and honoured for his excellencie in this kinde. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer I haue here done (vntill my Father hath finished his greater Worke, touching the Art of Lute-playing,) I referre it to your iudicious censures, hoping that that loue which you all generally haue borne vnto him in times past, being now gray, and like the Swan, but singing towards his end, you would continue the same to me his Sonne, who in the meane time will consecrate my best indeuours at the shrine of your fauours, and shall euer remaine obliged vnto you for your curtesies to the vttermost of my power.</p>
