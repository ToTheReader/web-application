   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was my purpose to let these Sermons passe into the world without a Preface; But that casting my thoughts at once on the quality of the Author, and the Maladie of this present Age, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred withall that of <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Aristot. Rhet. 3. c. 36.</note> in his Rhetoricks, —<gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>— Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems are many times in effect Medicines, they serve to cure and heale the indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the sicke Auditour. J could wish this short one might prove Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinall against the disease of these
<pb facs="3"/>times; broken out into such an heat of distemper and malignity against those sacred Magistrates of the Church, of which Number this Reverend Father Our Author was one. Bishops in the Primitive Church were anciently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> (as Saint <hi>Nazianzen</hi> insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates) <hi>heavenly,</hi>
      <note place="margin">S. <hi>Naz.</hi> or. <hi>1.</hi>
      </note> as in regard of their originall and institution, derived most undoubtedly from Christ and his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> so likewise <hi>heavenly</hi> also, for their most Christian, exemplary, and godly lives; who though they lived on earth, <hi>yet had their conversation in heaven,
<note place="margin">Phi. <hi>3.20</hi>
         </note> Philip. 3.20.</hi> And such a one (indeed) was this <hi>Bishop,</hi> whose memory is yet bleeding and precious to all that knew him. How ever some may stand affected to that venerable Hierarchie, yet it shall alwayes bee my
<pb facs="3"/>prayer to God, that first the line of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall and Apostolicall succession may never be interrupted or faile in the Church of Christ. And secondly, that she may continue still to flourish under a happie and gracious supply of many Religious and able <hi>Bishops</hi> like to this Author. Of whose Grave Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, renowned Piety and learning, J desire thee (Christian Reader) to take a better Character from his owne mouth and penne in the Sermons ensuing.</p>
