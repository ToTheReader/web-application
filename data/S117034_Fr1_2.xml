      <salute>HONORABLE SIR:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Eeting with a little Pamphlet written by way of Dialogue, and intituled <hi>A Tongue-combate,</hi> professing to containe a true Discourse of these Warres in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> betwixt the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> and the <hi>States Generall,</hi> I could not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injurie to Truth, permit so many falshoods (as vnder colour of sinceritie and modesty, were wrapt vp in those waste-papers, to bee vented for rich commodities vpon our Coast, greedie of nouelties) to passe without question or contradiction. The euer-liuing honour of my late Soueraigne deceased, vnder whose blessed Gouernment I was borne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in traduced: The justice and prudencie of my dread Soueraigne now raigning, therein obliquely and apertly aymed at: The truth of the Reformed Religion, wherin I was educated, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in oppugned: The loyaltie and reputation of this Nation whom I serue, and for whose just cause I fight, therein defamed; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked me to say what I could, and what I knew, in defence of all. And I am fitted and furnished the better to say something to purpose in this point, both by the many yeeres experience I haue had in the Seruice, as also through the manifold discourses I haue often heard, wherein this businesse haue beene diuersly debated; but especially by the many bookes I haue read and translated touching this Subject, for the satisfaction of my selfe and some honorable friends, who are knowne to be too religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to enter into courses doubtfull or questionable; at least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to warres openly wicked and vnwarrantable. Now being thus fully and clearely resolued in mine owne conscience, I could
<pb facs="3"/> not but indeuour to resolue others, who might bee doubtfull, and so seeke satisfaction. It is my duty (I take it) to doe thus; for my meanes I receiue of the <hi>States</hi> obligeth my tongue, hand, heart, and whole man, to promote their just cause in wordes, waitings, actions, prayers. He is a traytor (as I iudge) to these, to the truth, to his owne, and to himselfe, that doeth not thus thinke, speake, write, and doe, hauing the same ingagements, where occasion is presented. It concernes all Sword-men to sticke to mee, and to vindicate the honour of our deceased Queene, or present Soueraigne, Religion, the Brittish Nation in generall, and our Worthies in particular, who are made, by this blind and bold bayard, abettors of Rebels and Traytours; whereby theirs and our honours are stayned, our Armes defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the memorable workes of Warre which wee haue wrought for these fiftie yeeres continuance, cast away in obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and contempt; nay, condemned as ignoble crimes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and injustice. Assuredly, he that will not exchange a word with an enemie in this case, for this <hi>State</hi> and the <hi>Truth,</hi> which they and we professe in common, is not to bee trusted in actuall disputations, where blowes and bullets are exchanged, and questions of life and death are agitated and controuerted.</p>
   <p>If any man thinke my style too sharpe, they must consider I am a Souldier, trayned vp from my youth, to haue my sword also as sharpe in this quarrell: besides, I am exceedingly prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by a craftie Aduersarie, who vsing mildnesse and modestie to <hi>Tavvny-scarfe</hi> his owne fained creature, his Puppet, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, ouer whom hee insults, as vpon a vaulting-horse lowe enough for his leape, is yet most bitter against the <hi>States Generall,</hi> and their instruments, who intertaine and employ the true <hi>Tavvny scarfes,</hi> that will not be so easily baffeled. These he cals Rebels; and for this I often oppose him with the tearmes of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie and Oppression: The successe and Gods blessing vpon these Warres, hauing giuen him the lye, and sealed mee a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique warrant to say more in this case, with authoritie and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of truth.</p>
   <p>This I dedicate to you, who haue beene a noble instrument in these just Warres for many yeeres past, and will (I doubt not) deigne to protect my Pen, which doth but repeate that which
<pb facs="3"/> your hands hath written with bloud, and carued in large chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters vpon the wounded bodies of diuers braue &amp; bold Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites. It is now a time or neuer to declare our selues, and stand together for the truth of Religion herein oppugned: which hee that shrinkes from, for any worldly or politicke respect, or any Antichristian ayme, and temporarie temptation, shall surely be denyed hereafter of Christ Iesus, who will publiquely professe <hi>to be ashamed of them before God, vvho are ashamed of him here before men;</hi> and to spue those luke warme persons out of his mouth, whom the sudden and vnexpected alarum of bold, daring, and desperate opposition for Falshood, will not awaken from that stupide Lethargie, or reserued Foxe-sleepe of Policie, wherein they lye bed-rid, to be <hi>as couragious for Truth, as other men are for lyes,</hi> in this Age of Atheisme.</p>
   <p>The Lord by his Spirit kindle this zeale in our hearts for his Cause, and honour the militarie Profession so farre, that as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> the <hi>Priest,</hi> hath heretofore taken his Pike, and led vs by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to execute vengeance on Gods foes that would corrupt others; so <hi>vvee</hi> may now leade <hi>Phineas</hi> against that <hi>Babylonish Strumpet</hi> and her Brood, who <hi>commits fornication vvith the greatest Princes of the earth,</hi> and would impudently presse into our Tents, to doe, and cause the like villanie to be openly and vniuersally committed by vs and all men. Leade you (Sir) like <hi>Iosuah,</hi> in the head of the Troupes against this <hi>VVhore</hi> and her Adherents, and I will follow you as a faithfull.</p>
