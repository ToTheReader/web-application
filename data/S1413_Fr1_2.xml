      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His <hi>Sermon,</hi> though it be borne last, was not so conceiued. But as it came to passe in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</hi> trauell of her <hi>Twinnes;</hi> though <hi>Zarah</hi> put forth his hand first, and had a <hi>scarlet threed</hi> tyed to it, the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing marke of primogeniture, yet his brother <hi>Pharez</hi> was borne before him. I intended this <hi>Subiect</hi> to a worthie Audience, fastning my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations on it: but soone finding, that I had gras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped more sands, then I could force through the <hi>Glasse</hi> in two houres, and loath to iniure my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

methode; I let it sleepe, till fitter opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie might waken it. Now behold, without the common plea of this writing age, the importunate request of friends, I willingly aduenture it to the light. And since your fauour to my weake (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no) deserts, hath beene euer full of reall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements: since your affection to literature, (and the best of learning the Gospell) hath eue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> vouchsafed a friendly countenance to your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Ministers: I could not make my selfe so li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the censure of ingratitude, as not to intrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> your <hi>Name</hi> for Patronage. Which, though it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues better acknowledgement, and findes it from more worthie voices; yet I, that yeeld to all in learning, would yeeld to none in loue, and seruice to you. The cause in question requires a worthy defender: not for the owne weakenesse, but for the multitude and strength of oppositions. Men brooke worse, to haue their sinnes ransacked, then their inveterate wounds and vlcers searched. <hi>Qui vinum venenum vocant,</hi> they that call drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse poysoning, speake harsh to their eares, that (<hi>quasi deum colunt</hi>) embrace and worship it as a God. You are one of that surrogation, into whose hands God hath trusted his <hi>sword</hi> of Iustice. Draw it in his defence against the enemies of his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Gospell.</hi> You sit at the common sterne, and therefore are not so much your owne, as your <hi>Countries.</hi> O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

and courage rule the wilde dayes you liue in. Proceede, (worthy <hi>Sir</hi>) as you haue conformed your selfe, to reforme others. Reach forth your hand to your confined limits; ouer-turne the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> spoile the <hi>Banket,</hi> chastice the <hi>Guests</hi> at this riotous <hi>Feast.</hi> You see, how iustly, this poore, weake, course-wouen labour desires the glosse of your Patronage to be set on it. I cannot either distrust your acceptance, knowing the generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your disposition; nor neede I so much to intreat your priuate vse, (who are stored with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instructions;) as your commending it to the world. If any good may, hereby, be encouraged, any euill weakened, my reward is full. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is sexduple; whereof the first fruits are yours: whose my selfe am, that desire still to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</p>
