   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the common excuse for the Presse is ouer-pressing importunity, lest the Authour should seeme inexorable; although I might set that face on it, <hi>sine fuco;</hi> yet I will rather acknowledge ingenuously, that the especiall Apollogie for my presumption is opportunity, lest I might seeme vngratefull.</p>
   <p>Wherefore as al Riuers reuert vnto the Sea from whence they come:<note place="margin">Eccles. 1.7.</note> So I returne this small spring of the Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the immense Ocean of your bounty whence I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it.</p>
   <p>Which fauour although I had not receyued; yet (to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the truth without flattery: Amongst all those who
<pb facs="3"/>haue vouchsafed the Sunne shine of their fauours vpon me, I know none so blessed in his owne integritie, his Ladies vertues, and his Ofsprings innocency, from those sinnes which are here censured, as that he might equally protect it without impeachment from those muddy aspertions which Sinne-shadowing Hypocrites may contend to cast vpon it.</p>
   <p>Most humbly therefore beseeching your Worshippe to sweeten this Current with your good acceptance, and to vouchsafe a Conduct pipe for it vnto others: with my prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for encrease of your happinesse, continuance of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of yours, and imitation of them in others, I rest.</p>
   <p>From your Worships Guift at <hi>VVaterstratford,</hi> neere <hi>Buckingham.</hi> Feb. <hi>17.</hi>
