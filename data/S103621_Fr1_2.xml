      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, this Booke, intreting of Hawking, Hunting and Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; the originall copie of the which was doone at Saint Albans, about what time the excellent Arte of Printing was first brought out of Germany, and practised here in England: which Booke, bicause of the antiquitie of the same, and the things therein contained, being so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie and behouefull to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the Gentlemen of this flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Ile, and others which take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb facs="3"/>
in either of these noble sports, or in that heroicall &amp; excellent study of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, I haue reuiued and brought again to light the same which was almost alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether forgotten, and either few or none of the perfect copies thereof remaining, except in their hands, who wel knowing the excellency of the worke, &amp; the rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Booke, smothered the same from the world, thereby to inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in priuate with the knowledge of these delights. Therfore I humbly craue pardon of the precise and iudicial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if sometimes I vse the words of the ancient Authour, in such plaine and homely English, as that time affoorded, not being so regardful, nor tying my self so strictly to deliuer any thing in the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per and peculiar wordes and termes of arte, which for the loue I beare to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
<pb facs="3"/>
and to the honest simplicitie of those former times, I obserue as wel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seming the subiect, &amp; no whit disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the worke, our tong being not of such puritie then, as at this day the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of our age haue raised it to: of whom, &amp; in whose behalf I wil say thus much, that our Nation may only thinke her selfe beholding for the glory and exact compendiousnes of our longuage. Thus submitting our Academy to your kind censures and friendly acceptance of the same, and requesting you to reade with indifferency, and correct with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I commit you to God.</p>
