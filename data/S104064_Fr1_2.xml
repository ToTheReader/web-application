   <head>To the Right Honorable <hi>Henry Garway,</hi> Lord Maior of this Famous Metropolis; <hi>London.</hi>

   <opener>
      <salute>Right Honourable,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O whom for your long Travell, varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Language, and knowne Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I cannot but give a precedence due to your Person, as a priority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to your place; since laboured lines onely comply with judicious eares. I must ingeniously confesse your worth so farre to transcend my weakenesse, that I am almost silent in the Proem ere I enter on the Epitasis: yet presuming on your generous disposition, which ever waiteth on sollid Judgement, I thus proceede.</p>
   <p>Your breeding (Right Honourable) next to a Scholler hath beene chiefly in Mercature, and of your sufficiency therein, you have not onely given to this City ample sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; but to the severall parts of this Christian World: your personall Travell in your youth acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you with the passages and proceedings in other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne regions, have bettered your conceptions (now growing towards Age) in the management of State Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy in your native Realme: of which since the time that you were first chosen Alderman, you have given rare President; none having decided more differences, ended
<pb facs="3"/>
more doubtfull Causes; or beene a greater Peace-maker than your honoured selfe.</p>
   <p>And for the multiplicity of your Commerce, it is most manifest, that you have long Traded (to begin with the nearest first) in the Low Countries, <hi>France, Spaine, Italy, Venice, East India;</hi> and moreover in <hi>Greene-land, Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> and <hi>Turkey,</hi> of which three noble societies last named you are at this present Governour. History tells us that divers Praetors and Tribunes during the time of their Authority, have bin so indulgent over the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge; that they have not onely ratified the good Edicts of others, but devised wholsome Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of themselves: when <hi>Solon</hi> swayed the Senate no Creditor had power over the Debters bodies, but their goods onely. In <hi>Platoes</hi> Common-weale all excesse was prohibited, which amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> was cald <hi>Lex sumptuaria. Acilius glabrio</hi> made an Edict <hi>De pecuniis repitundis,</hi> Commanding all mony taken by bribery, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, or other indirect meanes to bee restored, cald <hi>Lex Acilia:</hi> Another compelled the <hi>Plebe</hi> to a liberall contribution towards all publicke Showes, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs; which was Titled <hi>Lex fannia.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But not to indanger the just reproofe of a presumptions arrogance, in prompting your Lordships in the studied Duties of your succeeding charge, I conclude with that Spanish <hi>Refran: Embia al sabio a la embaxada, Y no le degat nada;</hi> still remembring that of <hi>Cato, Imperium gero non miht sed Civitatiet socus.</hi>
