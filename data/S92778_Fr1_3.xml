<pb n="4" facs="4"/> that moste Religious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and hopefull Branch, of that Noble Stocke, FRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIS HAY, Sonne to the Earle of ERROLL; with no lesse bragging, than that <hi>all the Ministers were not able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere it:</hi> Amongst the meanest of whome, it having pleased that worthie Gentle-man, to imploy my Paynes; I drew vp an Answere, at that tyme, more to giue him-selfe contentment, (whose constancie they would haue brangled) than any-wayes to satisfie those, who by the more learned Travels of others, could never yet bee made sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, in anie poynt of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius Giddinesse, by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebriating Cup of their who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Mother. Alwayes, since that tyme, how-so-ever, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="5" facs="4"/> heard more of that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and that the <hi>Demander</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted silent; yet the busie Surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of late, and causlesse brags, of some of that <hi>Popish</hi> Crew, comming to myne Eares; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging in their vaunting and wanton humour, that a <hi>Demand</hi> had long a-goe beene made to some Ministers, concerning their <hi>BIBLES</hi> translation, and a mayne Article of the <hi>CREED;</hi> where-vnto they were never, hither-to, able to reply: Together with the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire of others, well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, hath made mee to revise my Paynes, and of new to put Pen to Paper; and so to bring foorth, to more publicke view, and more common benefite, what other-wyse was onlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a private vse: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="6" facs="5"/> anie, of indifferent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may see, how justlie they beltch foorth their boysterous Brags, and heaue with the stile of <hi>Invincible,</hi> (as they did a-before their <hi>Spanish Armado</hi>) what-so-ever commeth from the Finger-tops of their ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Fathers: as if their Brayne could hatch nothing, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Pallas:</hi> tho with a-lyke suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of disappoyntment, that preparation, and their paynes, are seene to symbolize.

   <p>These Paynes, then, Most Noble, and Religious Lord, I
