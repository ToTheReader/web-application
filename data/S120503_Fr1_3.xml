      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat the Lord hath sanctified, and communicated for the health and profit of many, ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed for the Envie &amp; displeasure of a few: Gods candle must not be put under a bushell, neither must his Talent be wrapped up, and buried in the ground: his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments are communicative, and everie reall Christian may vendicate his part and portion therein. To you therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth this Medicinall Iemme, whosoever that desire to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent contagious, and infectious maladies, to preserve your bodies in health, strength, and vigor of Nature, or to restore such as are already infirmed with desperate and dangerous diseases. Accept then this excellent Iewell as the singular gift of God, and the Medicinall vertues thereof herein mentioned, for the approved experiments, of Right Honourable, and Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull Personages, many of them for their Eminencie, and height of Honour, wherewith they are rightfully ennobled, not here to be mentioned: And the rest of such worth and dignitie, that for their pietie, &amp; learning, they are not inferior to many in the Kingdome. And although this might give sufficient satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all reasonable mindes: Neverthelesse, for that an undoubted Truth, feareth not to be exposed to all examinations, whosoever pleaseth, shall have a moneths triall of them before they buy them: To the end that by the certaintie of their owne knowledge, practice, and experience, they may be fully confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that the one halfe of the medicinall vertues of this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Cup, is not herein reported unto them.</p>
