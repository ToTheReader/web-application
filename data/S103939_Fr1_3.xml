      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y very Reuerend Father, and Honourable Lord, when on the one side I doe looke vpon the splendor of this golden Age, wherein our glorious Kingdom of <hi>Great Brittaine</hi> doth shine amidst the powers of the world, like to that fire which was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the cloud that conducted Israel: and when on the other side I doe consider how many be within our owne bowels, who cannot discerne this great Cittie vpon the mountaine, nor see the bright Lanterne which God hath
<pb facs="6"/>
planted in it to explore the workes of darknesse, as if they were burnt with the fire of <hi>Promotheus,</hi> that too much light had made them blinde, while as one sort pretending to maintaine the Catholike an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie of the Church, doth spoyle all primitiue sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie to establish that most absurd and impious ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of the Pope, tending to the extinction of this diuine Lampe which burneth so clearely among vs, and to the ouerthrow of our most Sacred Prince and Countrey. An other sort, vnder colour of phantasticke and Ideal puritie, striueth to supplant the auncient and approued policie of the Church to the destruction and danger of the whole State: I thinke that euen as the contagious vapours of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted bloud ascending ordinarilie into the braine, doe breed at length a mortall epilepsie of the bodie, euen so the mistie exhalations of fearefull Ignorance and presumption mounting continually into the seate of the vnderstanding, they doe obscure the light of temperate wisdome, and peece and peece beget a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall epilepsie of the soule. The contemplation of which pittifull astonishment of mens witts, as if they were stolne away by the enhantment of some new Circe, it hath opened my mouth, (who professe to be a simple Asse) to speake of the causes of their disease, and of the meanes as well of the peace of Christs Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, as of the intestine harmonie which ought to be in euery thing amongst vs, who are the members of this nationall Church in particular, and for their helpe to character in some chiefe circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the happinesse and serenitie of our time within
<pb facs="6"/>
this great and fortunate ISLE, while as all the Kingdomes which doe inviron it be so atteynted with pernicious errors lesse or more, that for vpright know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (like vnto that strong illusion of Ixion) <hi>pro Iunone nubem amplectuntur,</hi> in place to enioy the Queene of Heauen, which is the sinceritie of religion and true gouernment, they doe but imbra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>e a cloud of deceitfull abuses, so hath the insidious Clergie, namely of the Iesuite, betrayed the Christian liberties of both. This I doe not performe by dogmaticall grounds of Theologie, but by a briefe Empiricall discourse of such practises as I did obserue in the Church of Rome, and in other Churches during my Peregrination through diuers principall parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, while as (like to that miserable Asse of <hi>Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius)</hi> I did sustaine many changes and disfigurations of minde in matter of my faith, till in the end the Lord in his mercie brought me to act that last transmigration of <hi>Apuleius,</hi> which made him to be called the <hi>Golden Asse,</hi> that as he was said to recouer his humane shape by snatching his mouth full of Roses that were caried by the Priest of <hi>Ceres,</hi> so I smelling really the sweet odour of that deepe dyed Rose of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> the Lord <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> our great Priest, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the sauour of life to life, by meanes thereof I was restored to my liuely image, the golden historie whereof, and of the notable things which I did remarke vnder those spirituall Metamorphoses, is here set downe for the information of such darkned mindes, as be yet captiued with Circe, and cloathed in vncouth shapes.</p>

And sithence, my Lord, this Treatise hath already found an easie accesse vnto your <hi>GRACE</hi> and so benigne acceptation, that your Grace haue not onely set ouer it a censorious and skilfull Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyor, but haue been content to heare diuers points of the same agited before your selfe, notwithstanding of the most weightie and assiduous businesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I did see you to bee pressed. For this respect amongst many others, I doe not see where it can finde a surer passe to goe abroad, then in the trust of your protection, nor where it can more iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the same then from your Grace, whose pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall vigilance doth well approoue that Royall wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which did preferre you to bee the principall Watchman of this Church, and to carrie the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, for tryall of all such peeces as should bee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Lords Sanctuarie: whose extraordinarie Exaltation in the house of God, to be, from no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Primat of England <hi>ante annum vertentem aut circiter,</hi> doth testifie that the great Spirit which alwaies ruleth his <hi>Maiestie</hi> our <hi>most Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne,</hi> hath breathed vpon your Election, that you should bee <hi>tanquam Sol refulgens in Templo altissimi,</hi> a bright starre of his Church, and a conspicuous marke of his extraordinarie grace vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed vpon this great Kingdome, I say extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for if the Papall Bishops while they doe impugne the truth of Gods word forbidding marriage to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorise the doctrine of their coelibat, they do not the lesse contaminate the same with lewd and open pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and your Grace all in contrarie, while you
<pb facs="7"/>
doe stand for the Euangelicall libertie of Matrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, you doe in the meane time by the puritie of your life, practise the perfection of the cloysterrall Caelibat, taking vnto you that religious word of the more innocent and vertuous ages, <hi>Si placet licet:</hi> I thinke it is a cleere mirrour, wherein the world may see that it is the good spirit of God, who doeth freely distribute his extraordinarie giftes to such faithfull Prelates as worship him according to the trueth of his word: and that no vsurped authoritie of Popish or humane traditions can doe so much. And since there is no better meanes to make your <hi>GRACES</hi> Excellent and spirituall partes <hi>tanquam Thus redolens in Templo Domini,</hi> (as was said of that worthie Priest <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Onia)</hi> to smell as a sweete perfume in the <hi>LORDS</hi> house, then by continuing your delight to cherish the studie of vertue where it is found in the most remote partes of the land, which is indeede a sauorie presage of that perfect vnitie which God doeth dispose to bee in the whole Church of the same.</p>
   <p>Therefore let it please your <hi>GRACE</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue these first and tender Seedes of my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Seruice to God, to my most Sacred So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne <hi>PRINCE,</hi> and to this Common-wealth, whereof you are the first vitall member, and so to nourish them by the kindly ayre of your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous spirit, that they may bee found to produce a happie fruite, that is to say, a fruite which hath
<pb facs="8"/>
not aborted, nor hurt his bearer by vntimely part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with it, but comming to maturitie proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth wholesome to all those who taste it, and leaueth the Tree in full vigour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
