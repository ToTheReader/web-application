                 <title>The Messiah already come. Or Profes [sic] of Christianitie : both out of the Scriptures, and auncient rabbins, to convince the Iewes, of their palpable, and more then miserable blindnesse (if more may be) for their long, vaine, and endlesse expectation of their Messiah (a they dreame) yet for to come. Written in Barbarie, in the yeare 1610, and for that cause directed to the dispersed Iewes of that countrie, and in them to all others now groaning under the heavy yoake of this their long and intollerable captivitie, which yet one day shall have an end</title>

The other reason, for that the Iewes also (whom this argument chiefly concerneth) many of them remaine in your Maiesties Dominions: whereof in time your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, or Royall Issue (as may be hoped) raised vp of God for that very purpose, may be a happy instrument; as of the finall desolation of that <hi>Mysterie of Iniquitie Babylon</hi>: so consequently of the finishing of that <hi>Mysterie of Godlinesse;</hi> even the conversion of the Iewish Nation, the very period of all Prophecies. And then (as <hi>Iohn</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth his Revelation) come Lord Iesu. <hi>He which testifieth these things saith, surely, I come quickly, Amen.
