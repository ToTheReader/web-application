   <head>To the gentle Reader.</head>
   <p>IT was the vse amongste the aunciente Philosophers (most gentle Reader) that they neuer admitted or receiued anye scholer, vnto whome they did not indict and appoint a certain time to heare &amp; kepe silence: willing thē in no wise for to speke, vntil that by hearinge they had learned to speake wiseli and discretely. Whose exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being present in my mind, and also the rash &amp; temerarious iudgements of many conuersant before my eyes: I thoughte it good to admonish you, that folowing the example aforsaid, to bestow some labour &amp; time in perusinge and readinge this briefe worke of Chiromancy, or manuel diuina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before you entre into iudgemēt of ani effect or certainty of the same. The whiche thing if thou diligently &amp; attentislye do: I dout not, but that beside the great pleasure and delectation, thou shalt find therin that thou shalt in likewise repe &amp; gather no lesse good frute &amp; profit therof. For herby thou shalt perceiue &amp; se the secrete works of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how aptly &amp; necessarily she hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound &amp; knit eche member with other: ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hand (as vnto a table) certain signes &amp; tokens whereby to discerne and know the inward motions and affectyons
<pb facs="3"/>of the minde and hearte, with the inwarde state of the whole bodye: as also oure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination &amp; aptnes to al our external actiōs &amp; doings. For what more profitable thing may be supposed or thought, then when a mā in him self, &amp; by him self, maiforsee and know his proper &amp; fatal accidentes: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to embrace and folowe that whiche is good, &amp; to auoid and escliue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> euils which are iminent vnto him, for the better vnder stāding and knowledge therof. And for as much as the Chiromāci vnto some perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may seme obscure &amp; darke: we haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed hereunto an Epiloge or brief collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the art of Phisiognomy and circū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances vpon the faces of the signes, wyth certain canons or rules, aswel for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as also for the curing and helping of diseases, very necessary &amp; profitable. Then orderly cōming vnto Astrology, we haue described vnto you aswel by the artificiall Horoscope, as also by the naturall entring of the Sunne into any of the .xii. celestiall signes: the hole effect and power that anye of the Planets or erraticall starres maye by any meanes worke in vs, Wherby ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing recourse first vnto the hād, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and noting suche signes and tokens as therin shall appere, then becholdinge the
<pb facs="3"/>proportion and liniaments of the hole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and according to the prescript rules to way and considre the equality &amp; agreable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse betwene them, with like respecte had vnto the natiuity, iudging either by thar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Horoscope, or by the natural course of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Sun: y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> shalt not only see &amp; perceiue a great necessity &amp; affinity betwene our ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial &amp; the celestial bodies, but also forse &amp; know a. M. accidentes either to good or euil prouided vnto vs, &amp; hanging ouer our head. But least that any mā shuld thynke that hereby we attribute so much vnto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural prouidēce, as though it wer ineuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; therby vse it as a refuge or sāctuary, for al their euil actions and doinges. Vnto such we wil obiect thanswer of Crisippus writing in this maner. Although (saith he) y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> nature hath prouided al thing frō the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> by her prouidence al things are moued &amp; styrred vp by a certain neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary reason and motion: yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our dispositiōs &amp; mindes are no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der subiect or in daunger therof, then theyr propriety and quality is concordante and agreable vnto the same. For if y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> by nature our wittes be fyrst made holsōe and good, and after endued with reason and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: either they do vtterly put of and
<pb facs="4"/>auoid al euil influences and accidentes or els receiue and beare them the more easily without hurt or domage. If contrariwise our dispositions of them selues be rude &amp; grose, not endued with any kind of letters or good learning to assiste and helpe them withal: with euery light conflict or assault of our natural inclination, we runne hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into al kinde of errours &amp; vice. Euen folowinge the ensample of the Cilindre stone, which by nature being apt to roll &amp; tomble, and being cast or throwen downe in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o holow or steye places: doth run with out ceasing, not so much because it is caste or throwen, as for his owne nature &amp; apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therunto, and not hauing in it self any thing to withstand the same. The aucthor him self in like maner forseing the cauilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of certaine euill disposed persones which wold make al thinges subiect vnto the influences of the heauenly bodies: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he entreth to speak of the iudgmēts of natiuities, writeth in this sort. We ought (saith he) first to know and vnderstād that the stars do not prouoke or force vs to ani thing, but only maketh vs apt and prone: and being so disposed, doth as it were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure &amp; draw vs forward to our naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatiō. In the which if we folow y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> rule
<pb facs="4"/>of reason, taking it to be our only guide &amp; gouernour: thei lose al their force, power, &amp; effect, which they by ani means may haue in, &amp; vpon vs. Contrariwise, if we geue our selues ouer to folow our own sensuality &amp; natural disposition, they woorke euen the same effect in vs y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thei do in brute beasts. And this shalbe sufficiente at this time to answer the vain obiection of naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, wherby the frute of this woorke might by anye meane seme to be cōuerted into any vice or error, the which in dede of it self, is veri necessary &amp; profitable. What should I nede to stand aboute with longe circumstances, to describe the perticuler cōmodities of these briefe workes anexed togethers: when that the labor is so smal, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> wyth once or twise diligēt &amp; attentife re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the hole effect is known &amp; vnderstād Notwithstanding, I wold wishe &amp; desire y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> al men which shal read or take any frute of this smal treatise: to use such moderation in perusyng of the same, that they do not by and by take in hand to geue iudgment, eyther of theyr owne, or of other mens e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states or natiuityes, without diligent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection and taking hede. Wayinge &amp; cōsidering how many wayes a man maye be deceyued, as by the prouidence &amp; discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="5"/>of the man in whō thou geuest iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Also the dispensation of God, and oure fallible and vncertaine speculation.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, let al men in seking hereby to forsee their own fortune, take hede that bi the promisse of good, thei be not so elate or high minded, geuing them selues ouer to osiuetye or idlenesse, trustinge altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the naturall influences, neither yet by anye signes or tokens of aduersitye to be derecte or caste downe: but to take and waye all thinge with suche equalitie and moderation, directinge their state of life and liuinge to all perfectnesse and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that they maye be ready to embrace and followe all that whiche is good and profitable, and also not only to eschue and auoide: but to withstande and set at noughte all euill and aduerse for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, when so euer it maye happen or chaunce vnto them.</p>
