bee honoured of men, blessed of God, and beloued of
both<note n="f" place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 30.</note>.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>In this holy path, you haue so happily begun to walk,
that your personall practise of Religion, and the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
gouernment of your honourable houshold, may be a
patterne to all the greate families of these kingdomes;
wherin if Popery and profaneness found no better coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
nor encouragemēt, then in the <hi>Princes Court,</hi>
it were happy for our Church and State.</p>
   <p>Goe forward, <hi>Princely Salomon,</hi> and walke still in
the waies of <hi>Dauid,</hi> your kingly Father: so shall our <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
be happy and blessed by you: and all the world shall
praise God for you; for on whom are the eies of al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
set, but vpon you &amp; your fathers house? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the hope of the Christian world is, that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and annointed our gratious Souereigne, and
his royall issue, to hold vp his religion in these declining
daies, and to giue the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> that foil, &amp;
fall, from which she shall neuer rise; euen that deadly
blowe, wherof she shall neuer recouer.</p>
   <p>Now, somwhat to stir vp and prouoke your heroical
heart, and princely spirits to a yet farther detestation
of popish impietye; vouchsafe (hopeful Prince) the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and patronage of this discourse: the scope whereof
is, to discouer that those would but deceiue vs, who
speake or write that popery is now well reformed in
manners, &amp; refined in doctrine, and therfore they and
we by a reasonable mediation might well be reconciled

C. called Le Pacific{quod} examen, &amp;c. tending to that end, &amp; it was turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to english by some papist.</note>: for the truth is (if any man will search it out of
their owne records) Popery both for doctrin and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
is (at least) as bad as euer it was.</p>
   <p>This I affirming before an honorable audience at the
Crosse, the Papists gaue out, it was false, and I could not
prooue it, nor durst stand to it; but that wee may say
<pb facs="4"/>
we care not what, that wee are set vp to raile on them,
and make them and their religion odious before our
people: and in the Country they dispersed, I was called
before Authority for it, and silenced, and censured for
railing on the Catholickes, and that I was striken by
Gods hand with a strange hoarcenesse after <hi>I</hi> began to
raile on them, and could not speake, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>Therefore not so much to cleere my selfe, as to honor
the trueth, and to shew that it is no tricke nor policie
of our State (as it is in poperie<note n="h" place="margin">

authoritie to raile, and licence to lie, thereby to make
our enemies odious; I haue beene induced to publish
what was said, and to iustifie out of their owne records
what was affirmed of them: namely, that the deadly
wounds found to be in that diseased body of Poperie
many ages agoe, remaine rotting, rankling and vnhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

   <p>This I demonstrate in 20. or more particulars. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
all which wounds, if they be true as I haue laide
them downe; and being true, if yet they bee not healed,
then I hope your Highness, and al Christian Princes may
cleerely see, that seeing she is past hope of reformation,
there remains no more but that she is ripe for vengeāce
&amp; destruction. Which as that <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> hath
so long deserued: So God will put power into the hand,
and zeale into the hearts of our mighty <hi>King</hi> &amp; noble
<hi>Prince, to reward her as she hath serued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">

and long suffering, may now reioice and admire to
see the zeale, courage &amp; constancy of our kingly <hi>Dauid</hi>
and princely <hi>Salomon.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The King of Kings, blesse this king and prince: and
the blessed Father, for his blessed Sonnes sake, double
and trebble the graces and blessings of the blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
both vpon the father, and the sonne: whereunto, I
am sure all good subiects at home, and all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
