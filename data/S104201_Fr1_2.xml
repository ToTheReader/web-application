And as Euery godly and good man

Calling an Englische man all

this deuynd and Naturall frendship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
is the uery worke of the deuill by
his wyckid membres that hathe not

iniquite and malyce is fulfillid and go

of one body whiche of right and
office shuld be as the right hand and
the leffte in peace and Amite to resist
and withstand the forse of all strange

as this uictory and triumphe is to be
reyoysid at, so thend why god gaue it
is moost diligently to be consyderyd
who yeuithe the upper hand in the

Notwithstonding because the
right of euery iust and Laufull here is
halfe loste and more when his title
and cleame is unknowyn I haue wro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
this litle booke conteyning what
