   <head>The argument of the first booke.</head>
   <p>VVHo in more then 260. points of controuersie, speake with the holie Scripture, in the very selfe same or equiualēt words, when it speaketh of those matters expressely and of purpose, and in that sense also, which the words of Scripture of themselues, without anie exposition of man do afforde, and in which sense such words vse to be spoken and vnderstood of men, they, touching those points, agree both in words and meaning with the holie Scripture: And who speake of those points both in such words and sense, as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the foresaied words and sense, they in those points disagree both in words and sense from the holie Scripture. But Catholiks doe that, and Protestants, this. Therefore &amp;c. The Maior semeth to be manifest by it selfe, and is largely proued in the second booke Cap. 1. The Minor is shewed to the eye in all the first booke.</p>
