   <p>COnsidering the reformist Preachers are now become the BB<seg rend="sup">•</seg>. trustie actors in their most conning &amp; cruell enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, who erewhile would make the world belieue that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaded for the BB<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. tooke their ministrie from them, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it vnto them, or subscribed vnto their proceedings, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>

I thought it therfore my duetie (that the truth of these things might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare) to giue thee to vnderstand how they haue behaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in this busines, &amp; what was the power of their weapens in conference against those men, whom they haue so r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>prochfully published in their Pulpits &amp; wrytings to be silye men, whot spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, ignorant, Brownists, Schismaticks &amp;c. to the intent thou mightest equallie consider of both sides (by these few things dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed betweene them) the estate of their controuersies, as also how manie of these Prisoners Arguments against thir Church, ministrie, &amp; administation lye vppon them vnans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

For the Conferences, the truth of them thou maist perceiue in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Letters which passed betwixt them, how carefullie &amp; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon what sure ground the Prisoners related them; And if tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> finde not such pith or substance in the matters discussed betwixt them of weightie doctrines as might be expected of such men, thou must cōsider &amp; maiest perceiue that these Preachers were loth to haue the sore touched, but by euasions sought alwaies to darkē &amp; torne away the truth with indirect answeres &amp; cōning distinctions. And to make the matter more euident, I haue at the latter end anexed certeine Arguments, giuen their cheif Teachers lōg agoe to haue answered by writing, the which they haue (as these Prisoners report) closely put vp, and with an euill conscience spoken euill in their Pulpits, in stead of consent &amp; repentance. Which course of rayling &amp; denying of free confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thou see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>hall still be held in false reportes &amp; blindnes; sufficiently satisfied vppon these mens wordes to persequute these poore afflicted Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who loue not their lyues vnto death, that the truth might
<pb facs="3"/>
come to light to thy saluation. And (to my grief) I must desire thee to remember, that the Preachers are to nothing more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, then to grant these sillye men a free conference, making no scruple in the meane time to speak all maner euill sayings of them, vnconuicted by them of anie error or crime, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth both their corrupt wayes wherin they walke, that may not be brought to triall, and also their spirit to be voide of true Christian loue, howsoeuer they pretend outward holines.
