   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader: this treatise came to my hande, and I have perused it, &amp; I saw it to be but a relation out of other ancient Histories, how superstition was brought into the Church, which made me to wonder, that any, who is not a lover of popery, should suppresse it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it doth only shewe what others have written, who lyved in those ages wherein they were brought into the Church, I have therefore gott this treatise to be examined and viewed by sundry others, who are not inferiour for giftes and learned artes to any who had a hand in suppressing this booke, and all of them doe agree with me that those things which are related in it are to be found in the writtings of those Authors quoted in it, therefore I take it that those which suppressed it, if they be not Papists in their hearts, yet they hould with the Papists, that ignorance is the mother of devotion, which is expresly against the Law of God. And the Scriptures hould ignorance to be no better then Paganisme, therefore the Apostle doth tell us, that God shall come to judgment in flaming fyre rendring vengeance to all which knowe not God, 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.8. Therefore those which contemne this means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, much more they which suppresse the knowledge of God, or his truth, their end shalbe wofull and accursed.</p>
   <p>Our adversaries the Papists doe vanut much of antiquitie unto such as are not acquainted in ancient Histories, saying that their religiō is the true religion of Christ, which hath bene in all ages since the Apostles: but this short treatise doth manifest otherwise; if we search the Scriptures and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Histories we may find that all their boasting is mere delusion, which doth vanish away, and their Religion shalbe found to be no other, then the Scriptures have foretould, to witt, that Antichrist should arise in the Church of God, and corrupt all the holy ordinances of God, &amp; sett up his traditions, &amp; command them to be observed above all the ordinances of God. 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.3.4. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.11.12. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. And although they have suppressed the testimonies of the faithfull witnesses of the truth, which we produce against them, yet we do find sufficient testimonies out of their owne writers, that their religion was not receaved in many Churches till a thousand yeares after our Lords ascension, and since brought to the height by <hi>Jnnocentius</hi> the third and <hi>Honorius.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Then by their owne Authors confession, God did stirre up many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of wittnesses to his truth which we professe against their supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb facs="3"/>&amp; in all ages since, the Lords truth hath not wanted some which did witnesse it, even to the death, by giving their lives for it.</p>
   <p>And now this hundreth yeares the Lord hath given us in our land many excellent truthes to be maintained by lawes, to be professed and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced which many thousands have comfortably embraced, and are departed this life in Christ and rest with him. And now for our great sinnes the Lord doth beginne to take it away from our land, as he hath done in other countries which have had it, &amp; we see he hath sent them the sword with famine and great miseries, and he hath shaken his rod against us, to see if we will learne before it be too late, and forsake all our great and haynous iniquities. Christ tould the Iewes that those eighteene, on whō the tower of <hi>Siloam</hi> fell, were examples to them, that except they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, they should all perish; so except wee reforme our great and crying transgressions we shalbe ruinated and made an astonishment to all the world: and although we are not the first who have drunk of this cup of Gods wrath, yet we shall not receive the least part, although the Lord have reserved the Dregges of his cup for the beast and his false teachers.</p>
   <p>Wee may see the Angell of the Lord is executing of his wrath here, and all the world is in an uproare round about us. The whole frame of nature is out of order, yet wee do not lament as we should, therefore it doth prognosticate his plagues shall fall seven times heavier upon us. The gospell of Iesus Christ is departing from us, who can love his King and Country, and not lament &amp; mourne &amp; feare least his fiere wrath should consume us all in this troublesome, cruell, desperate and bloodie age in which wee live, now that warres &amp; rumoures of warres are sounding in every mans eares, and Gods enemies make Havocke of his Churches and Servants, and the Romane Antichrist doth prevayle, &amp; Gods people at this day be grievously persecuted and murdered, yea some consumed and devoured. Alas it wilbe too late to bring water to quench the fyre, when the house is burnt to ashes. This short treatise is to manifest the originall of the superstitions crept into the Churches, how most of them came from the old heathenish Romanes, except their Transubstantiation, which is a grosser kind of Idolatrie, thē ever was invented by any Pagane.</p>
   <p>Christian Reader, if you doe observe this treatise, you may have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to stop the mouthes of the Papists, and behold whence their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Masse is derived.</p>
   <p>I have in the end added some thing of my owne collecting, most out of their owne Authors, to shew the truth, how long it is since their idol of their Breaden God came first into the Church. S. O.</p>
