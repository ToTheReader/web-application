      <hi>In ancient time there were scarse seaven wise men found in the world, and now hardly seaven ignoraunt.</hi> Wherefore as manie diseased persons neede not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly medicine to asswage their paine, but also to avvake their sēses, I here exhort al you Nobles, to examine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously &amp; trie, 1. if there be anie Noble-men. 2.

   <p>And to descend vnto another kinde of our mothers<note place="margin">Iob. 17.</note> ospring; is there not an Eagle among the birds, and a Lion amonge the beasts? Yea in each kinde, doth not one excel another? as among horses, is not one more generous then another? Whie then among men, for whose vse al thinges were created, is none more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and noble then another? Doubtlesse <hi>Plutarch</hi> saide wel, that there is greater disparitie between man and man, then betweene beast and beast: for wee maie euidentlie obserue a greater difference betweene this man and that man, to saie more then <hi>Plutarch,</hi>

   <p>¶ When people did multiplie and encrease, so that<note place="margin">2 The names of Noble men.</note> they were forced to separate themselues into diuerse parts through the earth, they elected some of the most wise, valiant, renowned, and generous men of the whole troupe to be their Leaders, Captaines, and Gouernours, whō the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> named <hi>Elohim, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veelim, Beueorim, Ieduim, Aduchim, Hachamim, Nedi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vim,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Moses.</note>

      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, to signifie (as I take it) that Nobles should behaue themselues holie, as the children of God. But the wisest <hi>Latines</hi> ascended noe higher for an honorable title to their Nobles, then<note place="margin">Fost. Pomp. Non Marc.

   <p>¶ For as the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> acknowledged noe<note place="margin">3 VVho are Noble mē.</note> man to be of their Countrie, but such as had the figure of a Lance drawn vpon their skin: so no mā is worthie to be accounted <hi>Noble,</hi> but he who is marked with the glorious Character of Vertue: vnder which ensigne onlie <hi>Alexander</hi> the great would haue his souldiers fight against the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> whō he esteemed to bee<note place="margin">Iuuen. 8.</note> al vitious: <hi>Nobilitas sola est at{que} vnica virtus.</hi> It is not the great revenues, faire possessions, pleasant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, manie Lordships and infinite riches, that can make a man <hi>Noble:</hi> al those thinges are but externall accidēts, subiect to the mutabilitie of Fortune, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Nobilitie is permanent in the minde. For who wil praise his horse rather for his harnesse and furniture,
<pb n="5" facs="11"/> then for his comlie shape &amp; statelie pace? or his Hawke for her bells, hood, and chesses, then for her good flight? whie then shoulde wee esteeme a man for that which is without him, rather then for that which is within?

         </gap>.</note> not that euerie one who liues vertuouslie, and can daunt his affections, is foorthwith a <hi>Noble</hi> or a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> but hee onlie whose Vertue is profitable to
<pb n="6" facs="12"/> the King and Countrie; whom his Maiestie esteemes worthie to beare a coate of armes, &amp; to enioie diuerse priueledges for seruices done to him &amp; his kingdome. <hi>Seruices</hi> I saie, because as one swallowe maketh not<note place="margin">Arist. Ethic. 2. c. 4.</note> Summer, or one courragious act a valiant man, or one iust dealing a iust man; noe more is one vertuous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit sufficient to cause a man euer after to be accōp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Noble.</hi> He must continue in wel doing, otherwise it maie wel be thought that his good performance for once, or so, proceeded of meere accident, and hazard, or of a fauorable opportunitie, rather then of his owne proper and naturall disposition: for often times men are forced to performe vertuous effects by vitious impulsions. Behold therfore your coates of armes and their impreyses, how they change neuer, but remaine such vnto the sonne, as they were bestowed vpon the father, to incite you neuer to be wearie of wel deseru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to teach you not onlie to followe your Aunces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but also to guid your Successors. Remember they are as so manie seales, wherby the King hath bounde your obedience, faith, and dutiful allegeance to him, his, and his state: and as you can nether adde, or take awaie anie thing from them without spoiling or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifying the seale, noe more are you able to be deficient in your required dutie without the crime of Laze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiestie and condemning your selues as vtterlie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie to bee rancked in these ensuing sorts of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.<note place="margin">4 The Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of No<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble men. 1. ad.

   </p>
   <p>¶ <hi>Aristotle</hi> diuideth <hi>Nobilitie</hi> into that, which is common to manie men, tearmed <hi>Ciuill Nobilitie,</hi> and that which is more strict as peculiar to a few, called
<pb n="7" facs="12"/>
      <hi>Proper Nobilitie.</hi> In the first sense a man is said to bee noble, when hee is borne in some ancient countrie or cittie: so the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> vaunted of their <hi>Nobilitie</hi> aboue all other nations; and the <hi>Arcadians</hi> were not ashamed to contende for antiquitie with the <hi>Moone.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Plat. in Menex Herod. in Terp. Isocrat. in Panagyr.</note> Thus striued the <hi>Gracians</hi> against the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> and amongst thēselues the <hi>Athenians</hi> bragged of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie aboue the rest of the Citties in <hi>Greece,</hi> wearing golden cals wouen after the forme of a Grashopper, to testifie how they were <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> and not <hi>inquilini:</hi> so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Latines</hi> it was reputed greater glorie to be a <hi>Romane,</hi> thē of anie other cittie: as here it may be more accōpted to be borne in <hi>Londō,</hi> then in an obscure vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.</p>
   <p>But <hi>Proper Nobilitie</hi> beeing more to our purpose, I subdevide it into two branches onlie, lopping of al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sorts of <hi>Nobles,</hi> as barren, withered, dead, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable boughes, without fruit either for Prince, or people. The one branch may be tearmed <hi>Natural No<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bilitie,</hi> as that of the <hi>Iewes</hi> was, who descended of the <hi>twelue Tribes;</hi> of the <hi>Gracians</hi> who had their of-spring from <hi>Cecrops, Aeacus, Hercules, Achilles,</hi> or such like<note place="margin">Porph. Isag. 2.</note> Captains, or Princes. The other branch may be called <hi>Personall,</hi> or <hi>Inherent Nobility,</hi> because it is attained by ones own proper Vertue; as whē by valor, learning, wisdō, or other like vertuous meanes, a mā is worthilie promoted by his <hi>Maiesty.</hi> Whosoeuer intrudes him selfe, and creepes into this rancke otherwise, whether by monie, or a friend in court, I maie iustly mainetaine that his title of honor redounds in a double dishonour to him. First for surprising his Prince vnavvares, by
<pb n="8" facs="13"/> seeking a title which suits not, neither can agree with him; whereby hee brings his Maiesties prudencie in question for giuing equal honours to vnequall deserts. Which provoked <hi>Achilles</hi> his choller against <hi>Agamē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iliad.</note> and now a daies maketh manie to contemne and vilepend that, which hath beene formerlie so highlie<note place="margin">Budaeus in pād. Demost.</note> accompted of, besides the ruine of manie common wealths. Next they make their honourable friendes, who procure them this title asmuch murmured and grudged at, yea with extenuation of their iudgement,<note place="margin">Cic. ad Attie.</note> as <hi>Pompeius</hi> was disgraced in <hi>Rome,</hi> for advauncing by his authority an vnworthie person to the Consulship. <hi>Virtute ambire oportet, non fauitoribus,</hi> which who<note place="margin">Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>t. Amph.</note> so doe, howsoeuer meanelie they hee borne, I dare be bold to compare them with the highest <hi>Nobles</hi> of this Land, after this manner.</p>
   <p>¶ Certainely this common prouerbe, <hi>all comparisons</hi>
      <note place="margin">5 A compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of Noble mē.</note>
      <hi>are odious,</hi> was bred and inuented, when some wiser then my selfe woulde haue made a paralel betweene those who are <hi>Nobles</hi> by birth, and those vvho are onlie by merits. My intentiō therefore is not to grinde my selfe betweene two milstones, in extolling the one aboue the other, more then the Poet in comparing Natural and Artificial poesie.</p>

   </q>
   <p>As for others, who bragge so presumptuouslie of their Nobilitie, and ancient descent, (hauing nothing
<pb n="9" facs="13"/> else) I dare resemble them vnto the Athenian Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silaus, who walking euerie daie vpon the Pyraeum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted all the ships he saw to be his owne: or vnto the man of Abidenos,

      </q> Or vnto that ignoraunt rich man <hi>Calvisius Sabinus,</hi> who thought himself very learned because he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained<note place="margin">Seneca Epist.</note> learned men about him. Surelie such nobles may verie properly be estemed nobles of bloud; but of bloud only without bones, without flesh, without sinewes, and so of themselues vnable to beare anie burthen either for the publicke or priuate. Yea it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth no more a vitious person to bragge that he is come of this Duke or that Marques, then their good health is able to make him whole when he is sicke, or their sight to make him see when he is blind.</p>
   <p>
      <q>Virtute decet non sanguine niti.</q>
      <note place="margin">Claud. 4. Cons. Honor. Paus. 5.

Finallie vnto what can I compare more fitlie him whom the Poet describeth to be,

<pb n="10" facs="14"/> as we take it to be of good gold, &amp; to haue the Kings right stampe we change it, and giue it entercourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs but as soone as we perceiue it, to bee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfait and made of brasse, copper, or other mettall overgilted only, wee name it no more a noble. In like māner be a man neuer so wealthie, neuer so highlie preferred, if he lack the character of vertue, he is to be valued but as a stāpe of honor set vpō base bulliō; and although for a time such men please themselues with those vndeserued titles and illude the worlde, yet at length (if they mende not their manners) they will loose them with greater disgrace then they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse them with honor.</p>
   <p>Wherefore I exhort all such as couet to excell in honor that they studie likewise to exceede in vertue, (as in these seauen bookes following I will endevor my best to direct them) otherwise I wish thē to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade themselues that his Maiesty who hath erected them to honors in pretence of their vertue, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade them againe for their vice, as <hi>Caesar</hi> did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vienus,</hi>
