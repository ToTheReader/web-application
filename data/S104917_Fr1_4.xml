   <head>The Prologue of the Bishop Frier
Bartholomewe de las Casas or Casaus,
to the most high and mightie prince,
Our Lord Don Philip Prince
of Spaine.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost high and mightie Lorde, as god
by his prouidente hath for the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and commoditie of mankinde
in this world, in Realmes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces,
appointed kings to bee as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and as Homer nameth them
shepheardes, and so consequently the most noble &amp;
principall mēbers of cōmon weales▪ so can we not
iustly doubt by reason of the good willes that kings
and princes haue to minister iustice, but that if there
be any thinges amisse, either any violences or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries
committed, the only cause that they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed,
is, for y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> princes haue no notice of the same.
For certainely if they knew of them, they would
imploy all diligence and indeuour in the remedie
thereof. Whereof it seemeth that mention is made
in the holy Scripture in the Prouerbes of Salomon,
where it is said, <hi>Rex qui sedet in solio Iudicii dissipat omne
malum intuitu suo.</hi> For it is sufficiently to be presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
euen of the kindly and natural vertue of a king,
that the only notice that he taketh of any mischiefe
tormenting his kingdome, is sufficient to procure
him, if it bee possible, to roote out the same as being
a thing that hee cannot tollerate euen one only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of time.</p>
   <p>Considering therefore with my selfe most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="7"/>
Lord the great mischiefes, dammages and losses,
(the like wherof it is not to be thoght, were euer cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by mankind) of so large and great kingdoms,
or to speake more truely, of this so large new world
of the Indies, which God and holy Churche haue
cōmitted &amp; cōmēded vnto the K. of castile, to the end
they might gouern, cōuert, &amp; procure their prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
as well temporally as spiritually. I therefore (I
say) being a man of experience, and filtie yeeres of
age or more, considering these euils, as hauing seene
them committed, at my being in those countreys:
Also that your highnes hauing information of some
notable particularities, might be mooued most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
to desire his Maiestie, not to graunt or permit
to those tyrantes such conquestes as they haue found
out, and which they do so name, (whereinto if they
might be suffered they would returne) seeing that of
themselues, &amp; being made against this Indian, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
lowly &amp; milde nation which offendeth none,
they be wicked, tyrannous, and by all lawes either
naturall, humaine or diuine, vtterly condemned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
and accursed: I thought it best, least my selfe
might become also guiltie, by concealing the losse
of an infinite number both of soules &amp; bodies whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
are so cōmitted, to cause a few of their dealinges
which of late I had selected, frō amōg infinit others,
and that might truely bee reported to bee printed, to
the ende your highnes might with more ease peruse
and reade them ouer. Also whereas your highnes
maister the Archbishop of Toleto, when hee was
bishop of Carthagena required them at my handes,
and then presented them to your highnes: peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="8"/>
by reason of such great voiages as your highnes
tooke vpon you, both by sea and by land for matters
of estate wherein you haue bin busied, it may be you
haue not perused, either haue forgotten them, and
in the meane time the rash and disordinate desire of
those which thinke it nothing to do wrong, to shed
such aboundance of mans blood, to make deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
these so large countries of their naturall inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
and owners, by slaying infinite persons, either
to purloyne such incredible treasures, doe dayly
augment, these tyraunts proceeding vnder all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet
titles and colours in their instante and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
sute, namely, to haue the said cōquests permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and graunted vnto them: Which in truth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be graunted without transgressing the lawe both
of nature and of God, and so consequently not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
in curring mortall sinne, worthie most terrible
and euerlasting torments: I thought it expedient to
doe your highnesse seruice in this briefe Summarie
of a most large historie, that might and ought to bee
written of such slaughters and spoyles as they haue
made and perpetrated. VVhich I beseeche your
highnesse to receiue and reade ouer, with that royall
clemencie and courtesie, wherewith you vse to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
and peruse the workes of such your seruants, as
no other desire, but faithfully to employ thēselues
to the common cōmoditie, and to procure the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie
of the royall estate.</p>
   <p>This Summarie beeing perused, and the vildenes
of the iniquity committed against these poore inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
people, in that they are slaine and hewed in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
without desart, only through the auarice and
<pb facs="8"/>
ambition of those that pretend to the doing of such
execrable deedes, being considered, It may please
your highnesse to desire, and effectually to persuade
his Maiestie to denie any whosoeuer shall demaund
or require so hurtfull and detestable enterprises: yea,
euen to bury any suche suite or petition in the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
pit of perpetuall silence, thereby shewing suche
terror &amp; dislike as hereafter no man may be so bold,
as once to name or speake thereof. And this (most
mightie Lord) is very expediēt &amp; necessarie, to the
ende God may prosper, preserue and make the estate
of the royall crowne of Castile for euer to florishe
both spiritually and temporally.</p>
