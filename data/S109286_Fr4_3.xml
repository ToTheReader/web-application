   <head>The Argument.</head>
   <p>Vpon the second agreement (the first being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
through iealousie of a disproportion of
eminencie) betweene the <hi>Triumuiri Octaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Caesar, Marcus Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus:
Octauia</hi> the sister of <hi>Octauius Caesar,</hi> was
married to <hi>Antonius,</hi> as a linke to combine that which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
yet, the greatest strength of nature, or anie power of
nearest respect could long holde togither, who made but the
instrument of others ends, and deliuered vp as an Ostage to
serue the oportunitie of aduantages, met not with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie
she brought: but as highlie preferred to affliction
encountered with all the greeuances that beate vppon the
miserie of greatnes, exposed tost and betwixt the diuers te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nding
humours of vnquiet parties. For <hi>Antonie</hi> hauing
yet vpon him the letters of AEgypt, layde on by the power
of a most incomparable beautie, could admit no new lawes
into the state of his affection, or dispose of himselfe being not
himselfe, but as hauing his heart turned Eastwarde whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the point of his desires were directed, touchte with the
strongest allurements that ambition, and a licencious so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraintie
could draw a man vnto: could not trulie descend
to the priuate loue of a ciuill nurtred Matrone, whose en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
bounded with modestie and the nature of her <pb facs="136"/>education, knew not to cloth her affections in any other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
then the plain habit of truth: wherein she euer suted alher
actions, and vsed all her best ornaments of honestie, to
win the good liking of him that helde her but as a Curtaine
drawne betweene him and <hi>Octauius</hi> to shadow his other
purposes withall; which the sharpe sight of an equallie ie alous
ambition could soone pierce into, and as easily looke
thorow and ouer bloud and nature as he to abuse it: And
therefore to preuent his aspiring, he armes his forces either
to reduce <hi>Antonic</hi> to the ranke of his estate, or else to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sranke
him out of state and al. When <hi>Octauia</hi> by the imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Antonie</hi> (as being not yet ready to put his fortune
to her triall) throwes her selfe, great with child, and as big
with sorrowe, into the trauaile of a most labour some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation:
taking her iourney from the farthest part of
<hi>Greece</hi> to find <hi>Octauius,</hi> with whom her care and teares
were so good agents that they effected their commission
beyond all expectation: and for that time quite disarmed
their wrath, which yet long could not hold so. For <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
falling into the relaps of his former disease, watching
his oportunity got ouer againe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
himselfe, that he quite put off his own nature, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ely
became a pray to his pleasures, as if hee had wound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
out of the respect of Country, bloud and alltance, which
gaue to <hi>Octauia</hi> the cause of much affliction, and to me the
Argument of this letter.</p>
