      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas many of the Romaines euen such as were of the state of Consuls, had put thactes of the Romaynes in writing, both in Greeke, and also in other straunge language. Trogus Pompeius a man of aunciente elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, whether it were for desyre of lyke renowne and glory, or for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that he hadde in the varietie and straungenesse of the worke, compiled as well the hystories of the Grekes, as the Histories of al the whole world besides, in the Lating toūg to thentent, that as our Chronicles are redde in Greeke, so the Chronicles of the Greekes myght be red in our toung also. Wherein he enterprysed a piece of worke of great payne both to bodye and mynde. For seyng that many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, which haue taken vpon them to put in writing the doinges of some one kynge, or of some one peculiar kynd of people, do thynke theym selues to haue taken a matter of great weyght in hand, may we not wrothelye thynke <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius</hi> to haue bene as bolde as <hi>Hercules,</hi> that durst aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon the whole world, in whose bookes are conteyned the doinges of all ages, of all Kynges, of all nacions, and of all contreyes? And those thinges that the Greeke Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clers haue entreated vpō disorderly, as euery man thought moste conueniente for hym selfe, all the same thynges hath <hi>Pompeius</hi> (plaring them in theyr tymes, and settyng them in due order) compyled in Hystorye, omittyng all such thinges as were not profytable to be spoken of. Therfore of these xliiii. volumes, (for so many dyd <hi>Pompeye</hi> set forth) by leasure durynge the tyme that I was in the Cytie, I drewe out all
