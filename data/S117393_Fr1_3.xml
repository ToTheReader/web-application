      </hi> Am enforced to Epistle thee also <hi>(gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)</hi> that thou maiest know somwhat from me concerning the Editions of this Booke; I made it indeed at first to speake <hi>English,</hi> and then deliuered it to bee printed; but there were added vnto it diuers things without my knowledge. For it tooke from me neither name, nor any other thing in it else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the version. All which things thus come into it, I haue now taken out, &amp; in this Editiō haue added to this Booke neere halfe so many Prayers as there were before Meditations. So that now there is nothing in it, but that which I must either answere for as another mans, or father as mine owne. I must desire thee also, that hast seene the former Edition, to account it no violence offered to the Booke, though many things are heere inserted into the Meditations themselues, and Notes in the margin put vnto them. All that hath been done, was to help thee in thy prayers and deuotion. <hi>Fare thou well.</hi>
