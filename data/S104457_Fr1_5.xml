      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or I write onely to you that haue, or at least desire earnestly to haue a part in that glory which is already in part, and shall shortly be fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed:) I haue here presented you with a birth, as farre, I suppose, beyond your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, as it seemes, beyond the abilities of my younger yeeres: but howsoeuer, I shall intreate your kind acceptance of it, and craue you all to foster it vp in your owne bosomes; for I dare warrant you in the Lord, that if you but saue it from death by your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable warmings, it shall liue to giue you all wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thankefulnesse. If I should but tell you of those fearefull conflicts I had in my trauell of it, and my many grieuous cares in nursing it hitherto, you would surely say, it were an inhumane impiety presently to stifle it. Pray peruse it well, and I hope, I shall not need much to speake for it; it hath teares enough of it selfe to enforce your pity; and is of so good a nature, you cannot well chuse but foster it. If you imagine it is too faire to bee mine, I shall not be so presumingly proud on selfe-abilitie, as quite to denie you: for I must confesse indeed, I haue had such large experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of mine owne infirmities in the trauell hereof,
<pb facs="7"/>
that I can attribute nothing vnto my selfe, but the imperfections herein, and the glory of an instrument onely in producing its better parts. I haue been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as a common Father, as they say, in bringing forth the matter; but the forme, life and soule of it was from God alone (the Father of life) to whose sole guiding and blessed aydance, I must alwaies thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ascribe these my better performances. When I began this worke, I intended onely to treate of our Sauiours Passion, but I was so led away by that all-ruling Spirit of my God, that I ceased quickly from being mine owne man in it, and brought this to passe which now you see, <note n="*" place="margin">Neh. 1.8.</note> (according to the good hand of my God vpon me) both beyond mine owne aimes, and naturall abilities. And now, deare Christian friends, I humbly beseech you in the Lord, for your faithfull perusall of it: and may<note n="*" place="margin">Ephes. 1.17, 18.</note> the God of our Lord Iesus Christ, the Father of glory, giue vnto you the Spirit of wisedome, and reuelation in the knowledge of him, that the eyes of your vnderstandings being enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of his inheritance in the Saints.</p>
