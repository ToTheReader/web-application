      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording to the true dutie of a seruant, J en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended all my <hi>Contemplations</hi> to your now-glorious Brother, of sweet and sorrowfull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. The first part whereof, as it was the last Booke, that euer was dedicated to that deare, and immortall name of his: so it was the last, that was turned ouer by his gracious hand.</p>
   <p>Now, since it pleased the <hi>GOD</hi> of spirits to call him from these poore <hi>Contemplations</hi> of ours, to the blessed Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himselfe, to see him as Hee is, to see as hee is seene; to whom is this sequell of my labours due, but to your Highnesse, the heire of his Honor, and Vertues? Euery yeare of my short pilgrimage, is like to adde something to this Worke; which in regard of the subiect, is scarce finite: The whole doth not onely craue your Highnesses Patronage, but promises to requite your Princely acceptation, with many sacred examples, and rules, both for pietie, and wisdome; towards the decking vp of this flourishing
