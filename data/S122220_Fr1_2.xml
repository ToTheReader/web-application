hath nowe been
of longe tyme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the moste
comfortable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the body &amp; bloud
of Christ our Sauiour: in the
inquisition and determinatiō
wherof many be charged and
condemned of heresye, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
as bringers vp of new
doctryne, not knowen of olde
in the church before Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius

Fraunce, in the daies whē Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
the Norman was by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queste
kyng of England, and
Hildebrande otherwyse called
Gregorius the seuenth, was
pope of Rome: But that thou
mayest knowe (good christian
reader) how this is aduouched
<pb facs="3"/>
more boldly then truely, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall
of some certayne men
which be more ready to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their old iudgement, thē
of humilitie to submitte them
selues vnto a truth: here is
set forth vnto thee a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
of verye auncient tyme,
wherin is plainly shewed what
was the iudgement of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men in thys matter, in the
dayes of the Saxons before the
conquest. Fyrst thou hast here
a Sermon or homelye, for the
holy day of Easter, written in
the olde Englishe or Saxon
speech, which doth of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and at large, intreate of
thys doctryne, and is found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many other Sermons in
the same olde speech, made for
other festiuall dayes and son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
of the yeare, and vsed to
be spoken orderly accordyng
to those daies vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="3" facs="3"/>
as by the bokes thē selues
it doth well appeare. And of
such Sermons be yet manye
bookes to be seene, partlye
remayning in priuate mens
handes, and taken out from
monasteryes at their dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
partlye yet reserued in the
libraryes of Cathedrall chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as of Worceter, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
and Exeter. From which
places diuerse of these bookes
haue bene deliuered into the
handes of the moste reuerend
father, Matthewe Archbyshop
of Canterburye, by whose di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
search for such writings
of historye, and other monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of antiquitie, as might
reueale vnto vs what hath ben
the state of our church in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
from tyme to tyme, these
thynges that bee here made
knowen vnto thee, do come to
lyght. Howe be it the Sermons
<pb facs="4"/>
were not first written in the
olde Saxon tounge: but were
translated into it, as it shoulde
appeare, from the Lattyne. For
about the end of a Saxon boke
of lx. Sermons, (which hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute
the middest of it this
Sermō agaynst the bodely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sēce)
be added these wordes of
the translatour. Fela faegere

We let passe many good gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells,

thys boke much further,
lest it be ouer great, &amp; so cause
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
to men lothsomnes through
hys bygnes. And in an other
booke contaynyng some of
these Saxon Sermons it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
thus written in Lattyne.
<hi>In hoc codicillo continentur duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decim

de libris quos Aelfricus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas
Anglice transtulit.</hi> In thys
booke be comprysed xij. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
whche we haue taken
out of the bookes that Ael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke
abbot translated into
Englishe. In which wordes
truelye here is also declared
who was the translatour, to
witte, one Aelfricke. And so
hee doth confesse of hym
self in the preface of his Saxon
grāmer, where he doth more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
geue vs to vnderstand the
number of the Sermons that
he translated thus. Ic AElfric
ƿolde ðas litlan boc apendan

to engliscum gereorde of
ðam staef craefte ðe is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haten
gsammatica. syþþan
ic tƿa bec aƿende on hund

was desirous to turne into our
Englishe tounge from the arte
of letters called grammer thys
little booke, after that I had
translated the two bookes in
fourescore Sermons. But how
soeuer it be nowe manifest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe
by thys aboue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
how that these Sermons
were translated: I thinke not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
that there will
hardlye be found of them any
Lattyne bookes being (I feare
me) vtterlye peryshed &amp; made
out of the waye since the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
by some which coulde
not well broke thys doctrine.
And that such hath bene the
<pb n="5" facs="5"/>
dealing of some partiall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
may partlye hereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.
There is yet a very aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciēt
boke of Cannons of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceter
librarye, and is for the
most parte all in Latyne, but
yet intermyngled in certayne
places, euē thre or foure leaues
together with the olde Saxon
tounge: and one place of this
booke handleth thys matter
of the sacrament: but a fewe
lynes, wherin dyd consiste the
chiefe poynte of the cōtrouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
be rased out by some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
yet consider how the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of hym, whosoeuer he
was, is bewrayed. This part of
the Lattyne booke was taken
out of ij. epistles of Aelfrike
before named, &amp; were written
of hym aswell in the Saxon
tounge, as the Lattyne. The
Saxon epistles be yet wholie to
be had in the librarye of the
<pb facs="6"/>
same church, in a boke written
all in Saxon, and is intituled, a
boke of Cānons, &amp; shrift boke.
But in the Church of Exeter,
these epistles be seene both in
the Saxon tounge, and also in
the Lattyne. By the which it
shall be easie for any to restore
agayne, not onely the sense of
the place rased in Worceter
booke, but also the very same
Lattyn wordes. And the words
of these two epistles, so much
as concerne the sacramentall
bread &amp; wyne, we here set im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatlye
after the Sermon:
fyrst in Saxon, then the words
of the second epistle we set al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in Lattyne: deliuering them
most faythfully as they are to
be seene in the bookes from
whence they are taken. And as
touching the Saxon writings,
they be set out in such forme
of letters, and darke speech, as
<pb n="6" facs="6"/>
was vsed, whē they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
translated also for our
better vnderstanding, into our
common, and vsuall Englishe
speech. But nowe it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
we do make knowen who
thys Aelfricke was, whom we
here speake of, in what age he
liued, and in what estimation.
He was truely brought vp in
the scholes of Aethelwolde by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Winchester, Aethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolde
I meane the elder, and
greate saincte of Winchester
church: So canonised because
in the dayes of Edgar kyng of
England, he conspyred with
Dunstane Archbyshop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburie,
&amp; Oswalde bishop of
Worceter, to expell out of the
Cathedrall churches, through
out all England the maryed
priestes, which then were in
those churches the olde dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
as wryteth <hi>Ranulphus Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strencis</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
in hys pollicronicon
and to set vp of newe the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or rather superstition &amp;
hipocrisie of monkes, after
that the same had been a longe
tyme, by the iuste iudgement
of God, vtterlye abolished, the
Danes spoyling them, &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
burning them vp in there
houses, as is at large, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifullye
confessed in the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
of their owne churches.
For thys newe rearing vp of
monkerie is Aethelwolde cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in moste olde historyes,
<hi>pater monachorum,</hi> the father of
monkes. Vnder thys Aethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolde
was Aelfrike traded vp
in lerning, as he witnesseth of
him selfe in the Lattyne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of his Saxon grammer,
where speaking of hys inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of Lattyne wordes
he wryteth thus. <hi>Scio multis
modis verba posse interpret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ri, sed
<pb n="7" facs="7"/>
ego simplicem interpretationem se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
fastidiū vitādi causa. Si alicui
tamen displicuerit nostra interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio,
dicat quomodo vult. Nos con
tenti sumus sicut didicimus in scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
venerabilis praesulis Aethelwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
qui multos ad bonum imbuit.</hi> I
know that wordes may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
diuers waies, but for
to auoyde lothsomnes I doe
follow the playne interpretati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on.
Which if anye shall mislike
he may do as he thinketh best:
but we are cōtent to speake, as
we haue learned in the scholes
of the moste worthye byshop
Aethelwolde, who hath bene a
good instructour to manye, or
who hath brought vp many to
good. This he writeth of hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
So vppon this his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the schooles of Aethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolde
he became afterward to
be an earnest louer and a great
setter forwarde of monkerye,
<pb facs="8"/>
and therefore no lesse busie
writer and speaker agaynst the
matrimonye of priestes in hys
tyme. For which respecte he
was afterwarde so regarded,
that he was made by Oswalde
byshop of Worceter (as repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<hi>John Capgraue)</hi> the first ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of S. Albons newlye resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
&amp; replenished with mōkes,
and was also made abbot of
Malmesburye by kyng Edgar,
(as reporteth <hi>William of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesburye)</hi>
in the lyfe of Aldel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.
And truly he calleth him
selfe abbot in diuers of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles,
although he neuer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of what place, as in that
he wryteth <hi>Egnesh amensibus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribus
de consuetudine monacho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
To the monkes of Egne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham,
of the order and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of monkes, and in this
he wryteth here to Wulfstane
Archbyshop of Yorke, and in
<pb n="8" facs="8"/>
an other agaynst priestes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonye
sent to one Syge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferth,
with whom was an anker
abyding, which defended the
mariage of pristes, affyrming it
to be lawful. The epistle begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
thus in the Saxon tonge.
Aelfric abb. gret Sigeferþ
freondlice; Me is gesaed {that}
ðu saedest beo me {that} ic oþer

ðe he sƿutelice saegþ {that} hit

That is, Elfricke abbot doth
send frendlye salutation to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geferth.
It is tolde me that I
teach otherwyse in my English
<pb facs="9"/>
writynges, thē doth thy anker
teach, which is at home wyth
thee. For he sayth playnly that
it is a lawfull thing for a priest
to marye, and my wrytynges
doth speake agaynst thys. &amp;c.
Thus aswell in hys owne epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
as in all other bookes of
Sermons in the Saxon tounge,
that I haue sene, I finde him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
called abbot, and onely
so called. Howbeit, <hi>John Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue</hi>
who gathered together
into one volume, the liues of
English sainctes, writeth in the
life of Oswalde, that Aelfricke
was laste of all aduaunced to
the Archbishops see of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburie.

S. Albons, the church of the

and that which is at Beamfleot
reputed very famous. He dyd
appoynte abbot in S. Albons
Aelfricke, who was afterward
promoted to the Archbyshop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke
of Canterburye. Truely
thys Aelfricke we here speake
of, was equall in tyme to<note n="*" place="margin">Who dyd put out se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes out of the church of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, as the story of that house sheweth.</note> El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke
Archbyshop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
as may certainly appeare
to him that will well consider,
when Wulfstane Archbishop
<pb facs="10"/>
of Yorke, and Wulfsine by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Scyrburne liued, vnto
whom Aelfricke wryteth the
Saxon epistles, from which the
wordes concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hereafter following be
taken. And the certaintye of
thys consideration, may well
be had out of <hi>William Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesburye
De Pontificibus,</hi> &amp; out
of the subscription of bishops,
to the grauntes, letters pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes,
and charters of Aethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rede,<note place="margin">These char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters are to be sene.</note>
who raigned king of
Englād at this time. Howbeit
whether this Aelfricke, &amp; Ael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke
Archb. of Canterbury
was but one, &amp; the same mā, I
leaue it to other mens iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
further to consider: for
that writing here to Wulf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stane,
he nameth him selfe but
abbot, &amp; yet Aelfricke Archb.
of Canterbury, was promoted
to that his archb. stole vj. yeres
<pb n="10" facs="10"/>
before that Wulfstane was
made Archbishop of Yorke, as
is declared most manifestly in
the historyes of <hi>Symeon of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Roger Houeden,</hi> the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of <hi>Rochester, Flores Hystori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum,
Thomas Stubbes</hi> in hys
historie of the Archbishops of
Yorke, and in all other moste
auncient histories, aswell writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the olde Saxon tounge,
as in Lattyne: Moreouer in
many deedes and writynges of
giftes, made by kyng Aethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rede,
when Aelfricke subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
as Archbyshop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburye,
then in them is one
Aldulphus, Wulfstanes prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour,
named Archbyshop of
Yorke, and Wulfstane him self
subscribeth but as an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
byshop. But be it, that this
Aelfricke was onely abbot, and
not Archbishop of Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
yet this is also most true,
<pb facs="11"/>
that beside the prayse of great
learning, &amp; of being a most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquēt
interpreter (for which
<hi>William of Malmesburye</hi> doth
greatly commend him) he was
also of such credite and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
to the lyking of that
age in which he liued, that all
his writinges, and chiefly these
his epistles, were then thought
to contayne sounde doctrine:
and the byshops them selues
dyd iudge them full of ryghte
good counsaile, preceptes, and
rules to gouerne therby their
clergie: and therfore dyd most
earnestly request to haue these
epistles sent vnto them, as doe
well appeare by ij. shorte Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyne
epistles, set before the
Saxon epistles, wherof the one
is sent to Wulfsine byshop of
Scyrburne, the other to Wulf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stane
Archbyshop of Yorke.
And after this also byshops of
<pb n="11" facs="11"/>
other churches amonge other
cānons that they collected out
of generall &amp; perticular coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
out of the bookes of
Gildas, out of the poenitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
of Theodorus Archbyshop
of Canterburye, out of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractes
of Egberhtus the iiij.
Archbishop of Yorke frō Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus:
out of the epistles of
Alcuinus teacher to Charles
the great, and to conclude, out
of the writinges of the fathers
of the primatiue church: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
other Cannons I saye,
they collected together for the
better orderyng of their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
they doe place amonge
them also these two epistles of
Aelfricke, as is to be sene in ij.
bokes of Cānons of Worceter
librarye: wherof the one is all
in the olde Saxon tounge, and
there these epistles of Aelfricke
be in the same tounge: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="12"/>
is for the most parte all in
Lattyne, and is intituled <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitio
spiritualis doctrinae,</hi> where
these epistles be in the Lattyne
tounge, and be ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for an exhortation to be
made of the byshop to hys
clergie. There is also a like
booke of Cannons of Exeter
church, where these two epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
in Lattyne be appoynted
in stede of two sermons to bee
preached, <hi>Ad clericos et presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros,</hi>
to the clerkes and priestes,
and the epistles be also in the
same boke in the Saxon tonge.
And thys booke was geuen to
Sainct Peters church in Exeter
by Leofricke the first and most
famous bishop of that church,
as in hys owne recorde and
graūt of all such landes, bokes,
and other thinges he gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the church, it is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the Saxon tounge.

Leofrike bishop hath geuen
into Saint Peters mynster at
Exeter, where his bishops seate
is, that is, that he hath gotte in
agayne through Gods helpe,
what soeuer was takē out: &amp; so
forth, first shewing what lādes
of such as was taken from the
church he recouered agayne,
partlye by his earnest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnte,

rewardes. Nexte making also
report what landes with other

at laste to the rehearsall
of hys bookes, wherof the last
here named a Cannon on Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
&amp; scrift boc on Englisc.
that is, a Cannon boke in Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyne
and shryfte boke in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe,
is the boke we speake of,
and hath in it the Lattyne and
Saxon epistles of Aelfricke.
Thus as this boke of Exeter
church hath thys good eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
by which it is shewed,
that Leofrike was the geuer
therof: euen so the boke of
Cānons of Worceter church,
written all in Saxon, hath in it
most certayne testimonie that
the writer therof was the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
scribe of the church whose
name was Wulfgeat. For thus

haue. And let byshops take
heede that they presume not
to ordaine priestes or deacons
vnlesse they do first professe
to haue no wiues. Now albeit
thys and many other councels
helde from tyme to tyme by
the space more thē of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
yeares after this did litle
auaile, but that the priestes
did both marrye, and still kepe
their wiues, because as wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
Gerardus Archbyshop of
Yorke to Anselme. <hi>Cum ad or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines
aliquos inuito, dura ceruice
renituntur ne in ordinando castita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
profiteantur.</hi> When I call any
to orders they resiste with a
stiffe necke, that they doe not
in taking order professe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie.
Or as is reported in the
Saxon storye of Peterborowe
church, speaking of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
of Anselme, of Iohn of
Cremona, &amp; of William Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byshop
<pb n="15" facs="14"/>
of Canterburye. Ne

All these decrees auayled
nothyng. Ealle heoldon here
ƿifes be ðes cinges leaf sƿa
sƿa hi ear didon. They all kept
their wiues still by the kinges
leaue as they dyd before: Yet
it came to passe vpon thys de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of Lanfranke, that the
forme of wordes wherin the
priestes should vowe chastitie,
was nowe fyrst put into some
bishops<note n="*" place="margin">No suche demaunde of thys profession in any Englyshe pontificall before thys tyme.</note> pontificall. <hi>Ego frater

thys cōtrouersie, but also, that
more is, what was the cōmon
receaued doctrine herein of
the whole church of England,
as well when Aelfricke hym self
lyued, as before hys tyme, and
also after his time, euē frō him
to the conquest. But what was
the condition and state of the
church, whē Aelfricke him self
liued? In deede to confesse the
truth, it was in diuers pointes
of Religion full of blindnes
and ignoraunce: full of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dysh
seruitude to ceremonies,
as it was longe before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
and to much geuen to the
loue of monketye, which now
at thys tyme vnmeasurablye
tooke roote, and grewe exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely.
But yet to speake what
the aduersaryes of the truth
haue iudged of thys time, it is
most certayne, that there is no
age of the church of England,
<pb n="17" facs="15"/>
which they haue more reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced,
and thought more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then thys. For of what age
haue they canonized vnto vs
more sainctes and to their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
more notable? Fyrst Odo
Archbyshop of Canteaburye,
who dyed in the beginning of
king Edgars raigne. Then king
Edgar hym selfe, by whom
Aelfricke was made abbot of
Malmesburye. Then Edward
called the Martyr kyng Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars
bastard sonne. Then Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha
kyng Edgars bastarde
daughter. Also Dunstane arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byshop
of Canterbury, of whō
Aelfricke was greatly estemed.
Aethelwold bishop of Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
vnder whom Aelfricke had
hys first bringing vp. Oswalde
byshop of Worceter, and after
Archbyshop of Yorke, who
made Aelfricke abbot of S. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons.
Wulfsine bishop of Scyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne
<pb facs="16"/>
vnto whom Aelfricke
wryteth the first of the epistles
we here speake of. Elfleda a
Nunne of Romesey, and Wul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilda
Abbesse of Barkyng, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the dayes of king Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.
And laste of all Wlfritha
K. Edgars cōcubyne. All these
I say with some other more, be
canonized for sainctes of this
age in which Aelfricke him self
liued in great fame &amp; credite.
Also Leofricke and Wulfsine,
whom we haue shewed to haue
been the geuers of those Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
bookes wherin be seene
Aelfrickes epistles be reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for moste holy men and
saintes of their churches. And
these ij. liued byshops in the
comming in of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
Thus doe some men
now a dayes not onely dissent
in doctrine from their owne
church, but also from that age
<pb n="18" facs="16"/>
of their churche whiche they
haue thought moste holy, and
iudged a most excellēt paterne
to be folowed. Wherfore what
may we nowe thinke of that
great cōsent, wherof the Roma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nistes
haue long made vaunte,
to witte, their doctrine to
haue cōtinued many hundred
yeares as it were lincked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a continuall chaine,
wherof hath been no breche
at any time. Truely this their
so great affirmation hath vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto vs no truth, as good
christian reader thou mayest
well iudge by dulye weighing
of this which hath been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and by the reading also
of that which here followeth,
wherunto I now leaue thee.</p>
   <p>Trusting that after thou hast
well weighed this matter of
such manner of the being of
Christes body in the sacramēt,
<pb facs="17"/>
as sheweth this testimonye,
no vntruth or dishonour shall
neede to bee attributed to
Christes louing wordes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
at his laste supper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his apostles: no deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his most sacred institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
no diminishing of any
cōfort to christen mens soules
in the vse of hys reuerend sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament:
but all thinge to
stand right vp moste agreablie
both to the veritie of Christes
infallible wordes, and to the
right nature, congruence, and
efficacie of so holy a sacramēt,
and finallye most comfortable
to the conscience of man, for
his spirituall vniting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation
with Christes
blessed body and bloud
to immortalitie, and
for the sure gadge
of his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
