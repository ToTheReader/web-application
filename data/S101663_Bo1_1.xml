         <head>To the place of S. Augustin cited by the Examinar.</head>
         <p>IT is manifest that S.

<pb facs="4"/>Iewis, or heritikes: and therfore nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning to this cause.</p>
         <q>Augustin consernig Iewish ceremonies, <bibl>Episto. 19.</bibl>
         </q>
         <p>THerfore as yow on the contrarie part saye and although all the would (as you say) be against vs, you do frelie pronounce that the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Iewis, are petnicius ād deadlie to Christians and whosoeuer shall obserue thē ayther Iewor Gentill, that he is thrown down into the diuils dungeon: so doe I confirme this saynig of yours, and add, that whosoeuar Iewe or Gentill shall obserue them eyther in dede, or ells but in shew, that he ys throun doune into the diuills pit.</p>
         <q>Augustin conserninge gentil orders, <bibl>Episto. 73.</bibl>
         </q>
         <p>THe supersticiō of things wich the Gentills tied about them among the wich, earings of men, hanging on the tips of their ears, of one sid, is accounted worthy to be detested, it is vsed not to please men but to serue diuils. But who can fynd out in scriptures the particular forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of wicked supersticions wheras the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stole doth generallye saye. I will not haue you partakers of diuils: and againe what concord is betwixt Christ and Belyal? vnlese parauentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re because he named Belial, and forbad gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the societie of diuills. Is it laufull for a Christian to sacrifise to Neptune, because wee find nothuig perticularlie forbidden as conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Neptune? In the meane space let the wrett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis be warned, that if they will not obey whol som doctrin, yet at the lest wise that they defēd
<pb facs="5"/>not sacrilege. But what must wee doe with thē yf they be afraide to lose their eaerings, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not afraid to receiue the bodie of Christ, with the badge of the diuil.</p>
         <q>Augustin consernig the Ceremonies of heritikes, <bibl>Epist. 86.</bibl>
         </q>
         <p>TO fast on sondaie is a greate offēce, especia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly since that detestable heresie of the Mani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chies, wich is directlie against the catholick faith: and holie scriptures, was openlie knowē: wich Manichies did apoint that daye to thier auditors, as laufull to fast in. by the wich that fastīg on the sonday is accōpted more horrible.</p>

      <q>
         <p>
            <hi>If for any occasion the counsayle of Salomon, contrarious to it self at the first sight, maye haue place to be alleaged out of the xxvi. Chapter of his Prouerbes, that is. Ne respondeas stulto iuxta stultitiam suam, ne efficiaris ei similis, (And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine) Responde stulto iuxta stultitiam suam, ne sibi sapiens esse videatur, Aunsvvere not a foole according to his foolys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hnes, lest thou be made lylze to hym. And agayne: Aunsvver a foole accordyng to his foolyshnes, lest he may seme to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be vvise: It may novv of good congruence be uerified in the cause vttered in question for order of ministers appareill. It is not vnlznovven vvhat argumentes and conclusions, vvhat letters and vvrytynges haue ben vsed and tossed from man to man in secrete sort, for these tvvo or three yeres, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouue the libertie of the chyldren of God in the vse of externe thynges, to conuel the obedience that true Subiectes shoulde perfourme to the auctoritie of theyr Prince, &amp; to the lavves of the Realme established, to the discredityng and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such vvhich in a vvhole conscience thynlze it lavvefull for them to vveare, and yet charitably beeryng vvith the vvea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lznes of such vvhose consciences are entangled vvith fearefull scrupulositie tovvarde the same.</hi>
         </p>
      </q>
      <p>IT is well knowen, that the matter was not handled so secretlie these ii. or iii. yeres but openly setforth in the pulpit these seuen yeres: without any grete contradiction: but it may be said, this is your houre. Wee may loke for great truth in the body of your discourse, when your begnnyng is so farced with lyes. This cause was not taken in hand, to disproue your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but rather to prouue that your libertie shold not be made necessity: as the lettar of a certaine bishop written to à noble man wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessith. And to teach you to use your libertie
<pb facs="6"/>to profit, and edification, according to those say<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ings: all things are laufull for me, but all things do not edifie. Let no man seke his owne profit but an other mans: neyther to conuell (for so yow terme it) the obediens to the Prince, and her lawes: but to teach cheife obedience, to god and his word: nor to discredit and condemne them, that can away with them for wee allw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ais iudged of them as S. Paull willith, they stād or fall to their Lord for if wee had condemnid them, wee wold neuer haue cōmunicated with them but to discharg our own consciences and to labor for the synceritie, as well, in rites, as in doctrin. As for the charitable bearing wich yow speake of, doth litill appere in these sayīgs, subscribe, or be depriued, wear or preach not. This is but small bearing.</p>
      <q>
         <p>
            <hi>The small vveight of theyr reasons and argumentes so set out, theyr cause so harde to defende vvithlearnyng (so many graue vvryters of iudgement agaynste them) the matter sullye debated by the best learned men of the Realme of late, vvith thorder of the counsayle talzen in the tyme of blessed memorie Kyng Edvvarde, and fully concluded: caused diuers men (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng yet offended vvith suche vnaduised vvrytynges) to holde theyr pennes, vvithout more confuting or disprouyng the same, as vvas easye for them to do: partly stayed by the fyrst part of Salomont counsayle: Ne respondeas stulto iuxta stultitiam suam, ne efficiaris ei similis. Yea moreouer, charitie borne to the aucthours of such vvrytynges, moued some men to lzepe pacience, and the counsell of</hi> S. <hi>Paule helde others in silence, vvheras he chargeth his scholer Timothe thus: Stultas &amp; ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruditas questiones respue, setens eas parere pugnas: porro ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uum Domini non oportet pugnare, sed placidum esse erga omnes propensum ad docendum, tolerantem malos cum mansuètudine erudientem eos qui obsistunt, si quando det illis Deus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam ad a gnoscendū veritatem, &amp; resipiscant a diaboli laqueo, captiab eo ad ipsius voluntatem. Foolyshe and vnlearned que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
<pb facs="7"/>put from thee, remembryng that thei do but gender stryse for the seruaunt of the Lorde must not striue, but must be pea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceable vnto all men, and apt to teache, and one that can suffer the euill in melzenes, and can infourme them that resist, yf that God at any tyme vvyll geue them repentaunce for to knovve the trueth, that they may comme to them selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne out of the snare of the deuyll, vvhch are novve taken of hym at hys vvyll.</hi>
         </p>
      </q>
      <p>These be wordes of course, common to all them, that go about to ouertrhow any cause, wich because they are brought in without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, wee may stand to the deniall. The argumēts wear more weightie than yow cold auoid: and whan yow haue by Gods word confuted them than yow may more iustlie call them weake. The cause so easye, to defend with lerning and scripture, that yow neuar durst assaile it, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny graue writers against yow: the matter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uar fully debated by the best lerned in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme but of necessitie enioyned them caused yow to staye your pen vntill now: their neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie defēce, caused yow to write sōthing least yow should be thought to haue nothinge.</p>
      <p>Yf the rule of S. Paull had bene kept, this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of popish Ceremonies had not bene thus ernestlie moued, nor so sharplie folowd. But Paulls place is wrōglie alleged by yow, for that he meanith questiōs of genelogyes, &amp;c. wich pertayne nothing to doctrin, nor disceplyne in churchs of Christ. The question of rites and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies yow knowe Paull him self, and the writers both olde, and newe haue diligentlie handled, and therfore may not be thought a foolish and vnlerned question.</p>
      <q>
         <p>
            <hi>To enforce this text at this tyme in the particuler appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng therof, shalbe spared yet, for hope of their amendement

      <q>
         <p>
            <hi>Yf ye aslize me uuhom I coulde thinlze to be under the protection thereof: Surely I can not see, that diuers suche as be learned, and commōly iudged to be amongest this number, can muche ioy to fight under that banner, or o runne uuith them to that marlze they shoote at. For it is certaine, that many uuhō this smale route, named London Ministers, uuoulde haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned uuith them for their more honestie, be farre from their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termonations in this question, neither so handling it, nor so uuolde conclude in this cause as they do: VVho houusoeuer, some of them, do yet a litle stay at the using of this apparel in themselues, yet be not of their iudgement to condemne the thyngs of uuyclzednes, nether in them selues, nor in the use of them, as the Ministers in this Church of Englande be caled no uue to uueare them. And therefore houusoeuer they uuoulde uuyshe a libertie to theyr ouune consciences reserued, tyll they may see more in the cause, yet be they farre of to condemne theyr brothers, uuhose consciences can serue, them for obedience salze to use them.</hi>
         </p>
      </q>
      <p>Yow wold fayne perswade mē that no lerned men, are of oure iudgment, but wee ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we that the gretist part of the best lernid, yea of them that weare them, were of this opiniō. No man to our knowleg cōdemnith the things nor the vsers of them of wickednes. And yow your selfe in your examination often affirm that wee graunt them to be indifferent.</p>
      <q>

            <hi>And therfore I must nedes uuype a great many out of their brotherohed, in their singularities enteyned in this last uuriting, and say: Thei be but a ueri feuue in them selues, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then such as haue ben eyther unlearnedly brought up, most in prophane occupations, or suche as be puffed up in an arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere of them selues, peraduenture chargeable, to suche vanities of assertions, as at this tyme</hi> I <hi>uuyll spare to charge them. God graunt they do not by this degree, fall to the sectes of Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptistes,
<pb facs="8"/>or Libertines, uuhere unto some uuyse and zelous men of their ouune frendes &amp; Patrones, feare they do malze poste haste, one day, openly to professe.</hi>

      <p>Yf yow with all the lerned of your side wold procure us a free and a generall disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to haue the matter quietly debated, ād in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differentlie iudged, yow shoulde se a great nō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber redie to defēded our cause, with their tongs whom yow now blot out with your penn: for it is well known that not onelie a few vnlerned brought vp in prophane occupations, as yow vncharitable and slaūderuslie report: but a gret nomber of wise, godlie, and lernid men, such as haue bene and are the eldest prearchers in England neuar stayned with any recantacion, or subscription, brought upp in all kind of ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, both of artes and toungs, such as haue the name not onelie at home but also in forrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne nations, to be in the nomber of the best ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the realm, agree with us, in this cause, and of them partly haue wee lernid this iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherfore yow haue lost more credit with all indifferent men, by this your slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus defacing of vs, then all your examination is able to pourchase to your cause. Of the same spirit it procedith that yow charg us, with post hast towards the sectes of Anabaptists, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertins, wich ar fo farr frome such detestable heresies as yow are, frome christian charitie, so to iudge of vs. As ar the argumēts of multitude customes orders, and lerning, are fet from the schole of papists whom by this kind of reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yow more confirme in their errour, than strēghthen your cause, or weaken ours. To be
<pb facs="9"/>called from an occupation to the mynisterie of the church, is no more reproch nowe, to men mete for that function, then it was to Petar, Paull, and the rest of the apostoles. Yf they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vnmete than the Bishopes are to be blamed for admitting them and most of all for retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and daylie multiplyng others, whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ells but a capp and a Surples do make cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendable.</p>

            <hi>VVhereupon the aduersaires af true religion can uuinne no great reioyce at these mens ouersightes, as being but a ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feuue, and counted in deede none of the sincere and learned protestauntes, houusoeuer for a tyme thei seemed to be amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest us.

By the exemple of S.

      <p>And vvill yovv saye that vvee are gone out of the church of god as heretikes &amp; Antichrist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians, because vvee dissent from yovv in a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
