   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Anie bookes haue beene excellently well written by Italians concerning horsman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, a fit studie for Gentlemen to bestow some time and trauell in. Which hath moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me (diuers times) to wish, that some one able to performe it, would take in hand to translate into English some part of those workes, for common benefit, thereby to encourage our Gentlemen to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise horsemanship, not onelie for the seruice of their countrie (if need so require) but also for their owne exercise, as an ornament of greatest commendation in men of their profession. Among others, whome I somtime mooued to vndertake this labour, I entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of late my verie friend M. Thomas Bedingfield, our fellow and companion in Armes, to affoord his paines in the reducing of these few precepts, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of a larger volume written by Claudio Corte, into our English toong. Who hauing with all courtesie satisfied therin my request, and finding the
<pb facs="5"/>
worke verie well worthie the printing, I could not in anie wise consent it should be suppressed, but haue presumed (as you see) by my friends leaue, to cause it to be published, &amp; to make a briefe dedication ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto you aboue others, as Gentlemen best able to iudge of it: as also for the benefit of those which haue any gentlemanlie disposition to attaine to perfection in horssemanship. And for M. Bedingfield, I need vse no further speach, nor make any particular men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those commendable partes which we all know to abound in him, but onelie wish him that imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I thinke he is worthie of. For the matter now in hand, I referre you to the worke it selfe; which (I hope) you will thinke well worth your labour in the perusing of it, and rest of my opinion, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in short time by experience we shall find verie manie of our countriemen much profited thereby. From the Court at Richmund this first of June. 1584.</p>
