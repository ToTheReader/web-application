   <head>TO THE RIGHT Reuerend Fathers in Christ, my <hi>Lord Bishop of Carlile, and of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester.</hi> Also, to the Right Worshipfull, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Doctor</hi> NEVILE, <hi>Deane of</hi> CHRIST-CHVRCH, in Canterbury; THOMAS WILSON, wisheth <hi>all health and Happinesse, from Christ</hi> our Lord.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Reuerend, that which King <hi>Asuerus</hi> saide of <hi>Mordechaie,</hi> when he found by reading in the Chronicles the great pleasure he had done him, by discouery of a dangerous treason against him, <hi>What Honor and dignity</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath bin done to him for this?</hi> The like (though not the same) may I say, concerning your Lordships and Worship, vpon recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with my selfe, the many and great fauours which you haue done me from my youth, to this day: what duty and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice (for I may not say, what Dignity and Honour) hath bin returned to you for all this? My Conscience doth aunswere me with some checke, as his Seruants answered their King: <hi>There hath beene nothing done.</hi> If vpon this aunswere, that <hi>Heathen</hi> man entered into some deliberation with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, how to recompence <hi>Mordoche,</hi> my checke would proue a sting in the end, if I should alwayes suffer my selfe to forget your very great and most constant Good-will and benificence. For one of you; to wit, my Lord of <hi>Carlile,</hi> was vnder God, the foundation of all the learning and preferment which I enioy, hauing cherrished me in his Colledge (whereof he was a most
<pb facs="5"/>
worthy Prouest and Gouernor, neglecting himselfe and his, for the good of his house;) and afterward, sending mee to the place where yet I abide, by Gods goodnesse; and there haue beene, and still am much comforted through the great loue &amp; care of that Reuerend and most courteous Deane of that Church, whereof I am a Member. The third, vouchsafing me his louing respect, both long before and since hee was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to his first Sea. Entering into some deliberation, what I might do, not for dignifying you (albeit that were my part to do, were it in my power) but for deliuering my selfe from su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition and imputation of an ingratefull minde, I resolued to presume vpon your great and well approued benignity and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to dedicate to you, and vnder your three names (being for your place and painfulnesse, cheefe setters foorth, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Christianity) to publish a great part of this my <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Dictionarie,</hi> which with much and long labour, and not without some fruite (I hope) to the Godly Professors (for whose sake and good, cheefely, I meant it) I am sure, vvith much gaine of knowledge, and encrease of iudgement to my selfe, I haue at length (as I could) finished it. Vnto which, if your Honourable Lordships will affoord Patronage, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and gracious Aspect, I shall in such wise, acquite some part of bounden dutie towards you, as yet I will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my debt encreased▪ by the addition of dignity vnto me▪ so to grace this poore but painfull Work▪ as it may haue shelter vnder your wings, against the carping Tongues of the enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who neither will put forth their strength to do good, nor yet will beare with others, which desire to employ their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents. Thus crauing pardon of my boldnesse, and submitting my selfe and endeuours to your fauourable acceptance, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you all three, to him who is one in Essence, and three in persons; the Blessed Trinitie, in vndeuideable Vnitie. Whose wisedome and power, euer guide and defend you in earth▪ till his infinite goodnesse and mercy, haue glorified you in heauen.</p>
