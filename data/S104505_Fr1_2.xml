   <head>TO THE RIGHT
HONOVRABLE,
and his singular good
Lord,
ROBERT Earle of SALISBVRY,
Principall Secretarie to his Maiestie, &amp;c.
and the most woorthy Chancellar of the
Vniuersity of CAMBRIDGE,
Grace and peace.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are not many weeks past (Right
Honourable) since a person, disguised
by these dumbe characters of P. R.
had couertly sent forth a Booke, inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
<hi>A Treatise of Mitigation,</hi>
which he aduentured to addresse vnto
both the <hi>Vniuersities,</hi> especially that, wherein, by the
blessing of God, I haue had my education, and whereof this
is the happinesse, that it hath your Lordship <hi>Chancellar</hi>
and Protector. I therefore esteemed it my dutie in presence
<pb facs="3"/>
of your Honor, by this <hi>Preamble,</hi> to sponge out such vile
imputations, wherewith he indeuoured through me (alas)
one of <hi>the least of the Prophets</hi> to distaine both my
Mother and her Sister the famous <hi>Vniuersities;</hi> and
those honorable persons vnto whose care and prouidence they
are committed. At the first reading thereof, although (I
confesse) I receiued some such impressions as that I was not
able to imagine that any, professing Diuinity, could be so vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
destitute of humanity, as when he clamorously inueigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
against (as he pretendeth) <hi>multiplicitie of falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
he himselfe should most vsually and egregiously fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifie:
yet then, euen in my greatest iealousie of mine own mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariage,
I conceiued a double matter of comfort: first, from
my selfe, that knowing I durst present my supplications vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Iudge of the secret thoughts of all hearts, and iust
Reuenger of all lying wickednesse; I did not doubt but that
being able with true confidence to appeare before God, I
should not greatly feare the censure of man. Secondly, from
my Auersarie, presuming that he that would write in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense
of their <hi>Mentall Aequiuocation,</hi> would be found
to aequiuocate in writing. But much more was this my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uination
fortified at the reuiew of his <hi>Treatise;</hi> for euen
as the Greeke Commander, who being in apparance mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
wounded, demanded of his Souldiers, <hi>Numquid tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
est Ciuitas? numquid clypeus meus integer? Is
the Citie safe? is my shield sound?</hi> And being satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb facs="3"/>
in both recouered his health, and afterwards became
victorious: So I likewise, vnder so many ghastly wounds
of a virulent pen, hauing generally inquired and vprightly
answered my selfe, that my cause was <hi>safe,</hi> and my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<hi>sound,</hi> and free from any notorious and wilfull fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie;
I then began more resolutely to confront my Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in this Prelude and First assault: and promise (if God
shall be pleased) a more forcible <hi>Incounter,</hi> after that I
haue discharged my part in another taske of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
namely, in <hi>The Answer</hi> vnto the misconceiued
Catholike <hi>Apologie:</hi> which by this calumnious <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise</hi>
of <hi>P. R.</hi> his <hi>Mitigation,</hi> as by an aduerse tempest,
hath receiued some interruption. This <hi>Preamble</hi> (Right
Honourable) as a Suruey of some particulars, which being
vnfolded, may, if not satisfie the expectation, yet at the
least stay the preiudice and precipitation of some, I do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
present vnto your Lordship, as vnto a most zealous
Patron of the Truth, a vigilant Discouerer of malignant
practises, a prouident Directer of one of those <hi>Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
whereunto my Aduersarie presumeth to appeale; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
my selfe vnto the equanimitie of your honourable
iudgement; to which, if by this Briefe it be not manifest,
that <hi>P. R.</hi> hath in this <hi>Treatise</hi> preuaricated in his whole
cause both in the question of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and of <hi>Aequiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
betraied his Countreys State, disgraced the Romish
Schooles, strangled his owne conscience, I refuse not, that
<pb facs="4"/>
to the crimes obiected against me by him, this may be added,
That I durst affirme thus much before your Lordship. For
whose continuance of health, increase of honour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of all Spirituall Graces I shall not
cease to pray. Our Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> preserue
vs to the glorie of his sauing
Grace.</p>
