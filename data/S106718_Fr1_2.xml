   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable, hauing vpon</hi> deligent search, apprehended within the compasse of my profession, and science of Heraldry, certaine errours in descentes and successions, such as may be scandolous to the gray heares of Antiquitie, and preiudiciall to the branches of our Nobilitie; I thought it my duetie to present them as Captiues at your Honors feete, being the vndoubted Champion of trueth, and the worthy Marshall of all Heroike magnanimitie and honour: vnto whom I humble my selfe for a fauourable censure, and protection of this my poore seruice. As no childe is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but the father commonly hath a naturall affection towardes it: so these errours will no doubt, be both fathered and fauoured of the Author; whose reputation for Learning is so great, and beard of Antiquitie lately growne so long, that the goodly Britannia, Mother of vs all, is become his

daughter, trayned vp, and taught to speake Latine in his Schoole; onely she lisps, and makes no good congruitie in these principles of Herauldy: For which I challendge him; not that my exception, and challendge, is about the wordes and tearmes of our Arte, (that is the least) but touching the falsifiyng of Noble discentes, depriuing some Nobles of issue to succeede them, who had issue, of whom are discended many worthie families. Naming others to haue but one sole Daughter and heyre, when they had diuers Sonnes and Daughters. Denying Barons, and Earles, that were: and making Barons and Earles of others, that were not: mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Father for the Sonne, and the Sonne for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: affirming legittimate children to be illigittimate, and illigittimate to be legittimate: those to be basely borne, who were in deede discended of very honourable Parentage: assigning Armes, and ensignes of Honour to others not their owne. Lastly, the framing incestious and vnnaturall mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, making the Father to marrie his Sonnes wife, and the Sonne his owne Mother. These, and such like matters of importaunce, are the errours that I haue examined, and attached, to abide your Honours censure and reformation: For whom, with bowed hart and knee, I pray to God, for all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of honor, harts content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and happie victorie.</p>
