      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE chiefe cause and principall end of the
first association of men dispersed, from a
solitary sauage life, into Citties, Common
wealths, or other ciuill societies, was, that
by meanes thereof they might enioy a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
cōmon good, tranquility, &amp; happines,
whervnto al humane kind (how barbarous
soeuer) is naturallie inclined; and the speciall waies or meanes
to preserue and continue those ciuil societies thus assembled &amp;
vnited,<note place="margin">Li. 4. de le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gib.</note> in their desired quiet prosperous estate, and to defend
them from the vnnatural rapines,<note place="margin">Li. 1. de Repub▪</note> violence and oppressions, of
their domesticall wicked neighbors, and from the incursions
and inuasions of forren Enemies, is Religion, pollicie, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
militarie.</p>
   <p>Religion saith <hi>Plato,</hi> is the foundation of al Cōmon wealths,
and of humane societie; execution of good lawes, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of Iustice, (which is rightly to be called pollicie) is the
fountaine of felicitie: And the exercise of Armes and of
the Art and discipline militarie, is the maintainer of peace,
and ground of securitie; without these and euery one of these,
no kingdome can continue, and the Common wealth where
they are with good order established, doth prosper and flourish:
For ouerpassing the commoditie and necessitie of Religion and
pollicie, to be dilated of by Diuines and states-men, as more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to their profession, and impertinent to my present
purpose: Concerning the Art and science Militarie, this may
I boldly &amp; trulie write and affirme: that by the exercise ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
all Empires, kingdomes, and Common wealthes haue come
to their height and soueraintie, and haue maintained their
happy state and prosperitie; And by neglecting the same,
they haue declined, decaied, and finally been made praies to
their Enemies.</p>
   <p>The Art Militarie it was, that established the Empires
<pb facs="3"/>
of the <hi>Egyptians, Assirians, Medes, Persians, &amp; Grecians;</hi>
and that inlarged the dominions of the <hi>Romains</hi> to so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
greatnesse: This Art it was, by the which great <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
with a handful of souldiors (as they may be tearmed) did
vanquish infinit Armies, and did conquer a great part of the
world▪ and beyond the hope &amp; expectation of almen, did march
vnto the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>most parts of the Earth then known, And the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
thereof againe, hath beene the decay and ruine both of
those and many other most noble Empires and Kingdomes, and
hath caused the losse of all Greece, and a great part of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
Empire; and without the great grace &amp; especiall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Almighty God, wil be the ruine of the rest.<note place="margin">Li. 7. polit. Cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>
      </note> By men of
Warre (saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) Common wealths are conserued, and
that the Art Militarie should be alwaies practised in any well
ordered kingdome, it is both profitable and necessarie: which
<hi>Gelon</hi> king of <hi>Scicilie</hi> wel knowing and considering, &amp; that
people vnpractised in Armes through idlenesse and want of
experience incur danger to be subdued: He caused often in his
kingdome rumors of warres, and inuasions of Enemies to bee
raised, and therevpon made present preparation of resistance,
leuied souldiors, trained and exercised them in al points of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie
discipline, and led them foorth in warlike order some
certen daies march, towards the sea coast, as though hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
presentlie to giue battle to his enemies inuauding;
but his souldiors expecting the enemies, and when they should
fight, he emploied them in certaine labors and trauailes, such
as he thought conuenient, saying, that in performing the same,
they should both ouercome sloth and Idlenesse, two mortal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the common wealth; and that their enemies besides,
vnderstanding how they were void of Idlenesse, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Armes, would neuer haue the boldnesse to inuade them.</p>
   <p>The like prouident care haue diuers other noble kings, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
and gouernors of Common wealthes had, for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
exercise of their people in matters militarie, both for the
continuance of their owne estates, and to the terror of their
enemies vpon iust occasions of iniuries offred. But seeing at
this present day the contrarie, and that the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ncient and true
<pb facs="3"/>
knowledge of discipline militarie is in most parts of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
by ciuil Warres corrupted and greatly decaied, I, for the
benefit of my Countrie and Nation, wherevnto I wish a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie
and happinesse, and for the commoditie of you Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
vnto whom matiers and affaires of Armes, and also of
Iustice, do most properlie appertaine, haue with some labour
and pains, collected and set downe in this treatise, Certen or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
instructions, and obseruations Militarie, the most of
which in seruices of diuers warres vnder notable Captaines,
of diuers Nations I haue seen practised, &amp; the rest by reading
of diuers histories, I haue other wise obserued: giuing you
therewithal to vnderstand, that my intent &amp; purpose is not to
treat in this booke generally of all matters militarie by lande
which are in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>inite; for I handle not therein the approching &amp;
and besieging of Citties, and places for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ified, nor the forming
and fortifieng of Campes, nor the lodging and disl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>dging of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
nor the making of Bridges ouer riuers to passe ouer
Armies, nor in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>inite other ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ters and stratagems milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
Al which (some at one time, and some at another) haue
beene very wel written off by many principall Captaines and
gentlemen of diuers Nations, and some of them also handled
by me in some other Books of mine that I haue composed, which
I haue not as yet put in print.</p>
   <p>But in this booke I haue begun and chieflie handled (as the
Reader may see) the reducing of footmen and horsemen into
their simple and single order of rankes from point to point, and
after how to reduce them into many forms of troups, squadrōs,
&amp; battles in the field, &amp; that (chieflie) to the intent to enter
into skirmish &amp; to giue battle with the most aduantage, which
of al other matters military are of greatest importance, to work
the highest effects in the field, by reason that thereby great
victories are atchieued, and sometimes Empires, Kingdomes
and dominions conquered: And for most of al those matters
that I haue written of, I haue alledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d manie reasons to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and prooue the same: All which not withstanding, I doubt
not, but that in reading a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d perusing of this my treatise, in this
malicious time, there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ill bee some found cast in the mould of
that good fellow, who going to another mans house, vsed to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="4"/>
both his eies in his head, and returning home to his owne,
put them vp in his pocket; Many I meane that will find fault,
for one that will commend: and some (as saint <hi>Ierome</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vpon the like occasion) that wil curiouslie search and sift
euery sentence, clause, word and sillable, yea and the very let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of my writing, and then censure both my worke and my
selfe according to their <hi>Mydaslie</hi> iudgement; But as <hi>Pindarus</hi>
answered a king of <hi>Sparta,</hi> it is one of the easiest things in the
world to find fault. <hi>Sed ecquid habent melius?</hi> let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
least in passing aboue the slipper, and in correcting the
shadowes of <hi>Apelles</hi> picture, the boies that grinde collours
laugh them not to scorne, who so long as they hold their peace
thinke them by their gaie and golden garmentes to be goodlie
fellowes.</p>
   <p>But leauing enuie to worke vpon hir owne intrailes, &amp; set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
light of the malice of detractors, to you the honourable
gentlemen of my Countrey, for whose good I composed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
these discourses, and to whom with a sincere affection
&amp; deuotion I cōmend and present it; I say and protest that if it
may find at your handes that fauorable acceptance and friendlie
allowance that I expect it shall, and worke withal that desired
effect that I hope it will; I shal eesteeme my labours and trauels
well imploied, and my selfe for the same euerie waies abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
satisfied. </p>
