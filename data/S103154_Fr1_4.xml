      <hi>The Righteous shall be had in everlasting Remembrance.</hi> The Righteous; Such a One was this our Sister and my Wife, One clothed with the Roabe of Righteousnesse, which was woven out of Christs side, adorned and embroidered with sanctifying

She did not seeke Fame by well doing to be remembred, but Fame comes unsought for: and Her well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall be remembred after Her death; for 'tis worth our observation that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> sets it not down in the present time, <hi>(are)</hi> but in the future, <hi>(shall be had in remembrance.)</hi> What though the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their life time are little thought of, except to be ill spoken of? yet Time the Mother of Truth shall bring all things to light, and cause the Righteous to be had in everlasting Remembrance before God and his Angels, and the whole Theater of Righteous just Men. <note n="b" place="margin">Satis est coram Deo, &amp; Angelis, totóque piorum theatro, benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam esse eorum Memoriam.

Yet her Gaine waighes downe my losse; I confesse the losse of her enters deepe into my heart, and deeper it would goe; but that her Gaine cannot enter into the Heart of man to conceive it: her Gaine to the tongue of man, unspeakable; but my losse is unvaluable onely according to the Common waights of the World,
<pb facs="6"/>
because She was of great Estimate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the very waight of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary. My knowledge of it is now doubled, <hi>tàm carendo, quàm fruendo:</hi> for eleven yeares and halfe I enjoyed a rare Religious Piece of Gods making, and now God hath made up this his Iewell fit for His own Cabinet, 'tis most fit that I should want it. And to my wants this is added, that I want words to tell others what I want. I want my Fellow-Helper, my Bosome-Comforter; my second Heart, which did command my first Heart in a Religious way. 1. Her Faith was founded upon the Rocke, <note place="margin">1.</note> Christ Iesus: witnesse Her every Dayes taske, which was to say by Heart, and in Her Heart, the eight chapter to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> which chapter alone in it selfe is a compleat Confectionarie of spirituall Comfort beginning with, <hi>No condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom 8. vers. first and last.</note>
      <hi>to them that are in Christ Iesus:</hi> and ending with, <hi>No Separation from the Love of God in Christ Iesus.</hi> 2. Her Hope and Trust was fixed upon Her God, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <note place="margin">2.</note> that answer She gave me the last
<pb facs="7"/>
Day that She lived out in this World; <hi>Now what is my Hope? my Hope is in thee ô Lord</hi>

         </gap>39. 7.</note>. There was in her an admirable mixture of Godly sorrow for sinne, and holy Ioy for that Sorrow, which Ioy I perceived to be back'd by her Hope, to get the upperhand: though S. <hi>Ierome</hi> summes up the devout soules private carriage with God in these words, <hi>Dolet, &amp; de dolore gaudet.</hi> Surely 'twas her Practise to sorrow after a godly manner, and to rejoyce for that Sorrow. 3. Her <note place="margin">3.</note> love to man let all that knew her, speak it; Her love to God, I judge it sincere by the most cleare Expressions of it; She loved his house so dearely, that the large distance of her Habitation from Church (nigh a mile) was no <hi>Remora</hi> to keep her at home; the last Lords Day She li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, She was twice at Church. She prayed Constantly eight severall times every Day; I knew it to be most true, who was nearest to her, when she drew neare to her Father in secret. She had by heart a distinct Prayer for every Evening and Morning in the seven dayes of the
<pb facs="7"/>
weeke, besides other Prayers for other times. What a loving Mistris She was to her servants, they would quickly speak, if they could for crying. How transcendent her love was to me, her Husband? my tongue would faile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause my heart is readie to faint for want of such love, and faint it might, had not Gods Spirit brought to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance how earnestly on her Death-bed She desired me not to grieve so immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately for her, for we should meete in Heaven: and 'tis my Hope that as we were <hi>Caro una</hi> on Earth, we shall be <hi>sydus unum</hi> in Heaven <note n="e" place="margin">
         <hi>Sydus</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Starres together.</note>, of that one Holy Companie of Starres attending the Sun of Righteousnesse. And here I cannot but fixe my Contemplation on those rayes of divine Beautie which shined in her soule, for She mightilie delighted to set before her <hi>Solomons</hi> Copie of a good wife, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. They that knew her <note place="margin">Prov. 31.</note> may easily compare her life written ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that exact Copie: Sure I am, her Sisters child (whom She educated) can rise up and call her blessed, Her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
