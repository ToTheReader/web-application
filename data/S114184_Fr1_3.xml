soon after hys retorne out of Scotland was deputed Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour to treat with the Bis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shoppe of Belay and oother the Frenche kynges commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners at Hardilow castel.

Callynge to mynde I saye (I speake not of hys vnweryed di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligence in the meane time) these hys valiaunt incursions, hys oftē ouerthrowings, and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble victories ouer our enemies And yet thoughe this his last be far to be preferred aboue thē all, hauing bene so greate, and acheuing so much in so litle ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, the like not hard nor red of and (but that thear be so many witnesses) half incredible, yet is it none other sure, but suche as makes his graces vertue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nue agayn then straunge, and rather famous then woō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful.
