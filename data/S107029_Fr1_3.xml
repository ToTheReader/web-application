Who after that hee hath shewed his scales vppon his backe, and feared them with his clawes, feete, nailes and talons, cannot choose but cause that his Asses nose may be seene, &amp; vncouer his whoorish brest and belly, without all shame. The ingratitude of men haue well deserued to fall into that brutishnesse: They see the belly of a whoore naked, &amp; yet neuerthelesse this is their owne God, whom they feare and worship, and vnto whom they doe homage, with their kings, Lords, and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.

And if in taking away the coole or frocke, the Calfe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth but a Calfe, what shall the Moonke remaine, when his frocke &amp; coole shalbe taken from him, but that he is a Moonke for euery mans porredge pot? But this it is, so long as the Diuell shall be Prince of the world, the world shal haue alwaies their eyes blinded.
