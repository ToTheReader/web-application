   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Ardon I beseech you, if (being a
stanger and vnknowne vnto you) I
haue presumed to inscribe your title
on the Frontespiece of this Booke,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> to publish it to the world, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your Lo, fauourable protection. I
confesse my disability might well
haue deterred me: But the reason
which induced me to this presumption, was your noble and
generous inclination to Armes (being the subiect of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story)
wherein you haue carried your selfe so worthily in
many great and dangerous exploits, in forraine parts, vnder
two of the greatest Commanders of Christendome, as you
haue done great honour to your Country, and won vnto
your selfe perpetuall fame and reputation. This Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
hath made me confident, that during your vacancy
from Military actions, your Lordship will vouchsafe to
cast your eye vpon this History written by <hi>Polybius,</hi> who
(in the opinion of most men of Iudgement) hath beene
held to be very sincere, and free from malice, affection or
passion. And to iustifie the truth thereof, he protests that
he was present at many of the actions, and receiued the rest
from confident persons who were eye-witnesses. It is a
generall History of his time, of all the warres which past
<pb facs="3"/>
in <hi>Asia, Greece,</hi> and the <hi>Romane</hi> State, against the <hi>Gaules,</hi>
and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> which two Citties contended for the
Empiry of the world: which warre was of longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
and had more cruell and variable encounters and
battailes than any that hath beene written of: For the first
Punique warre (where they fought for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of <hi>Sicily</hi>) lasted foure and twenty yeeres; and the
second in <hi>Italy</hi> vnder <hi>Hannibal,</hi> Generall for the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
continued seuenteene yeeres, to the subuersion (in a
manner) of the Romane State, had not <hi>Scipio</hi> forced <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
to returne home to defend his owne <hi>Carthage,</hi> where
in Battell he lost the glory of all his former Victories, and
brought his Countrey into the subiection of the <hi>Romanes.</hi>
This worke I present vnto your Lordships fauourable
Censure, humbly praying that you will be pleased to beare
with my harsh and vnpolished stile, and to pardon the
errors committed at the presse during my absence: for
which fauour I shall hold my selfe much bound vnto your
Lordship, and will alwaies rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
