      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am occasioned, in saluting thee, to Apologize for my selfe. I haue beene taxed, by some, for too much tart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in these Sermons, against those who dissent from our Church in her Ceremonies and gouernment, and for ranking them with Peace-breakers. But heare my iust defence: I professe freely, if a man be of an humble spirit, peaceable behauiour, and, as his Maiesty writes, Learned and Graue,<note place="margin">Preface to his <gap reason="foreign">

         </gap>
      </note> though he doe not altogether like the Ceremonies of our Church, he is not the man whom eyther my tongue or pen shall strike.</p>
   <p>And be he Minister or priuate Christian, by how much the more strict
<pb facs="6"/> and carefull any one is in the waies of God (so it be in sincerity, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and ostentation) the more I doe esteeme him worthy of respect.</p>
   <p>But when I obserue some others, eyther by their Bookes, Sermons or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, to be proud, factious, and contentious; blame me not for taxing them as enemies to our Peace; or if thou doe, I little regard it. Pride, Faction, and contention, I could neuer like in any. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith in the like case:<note place="margin">Est ergo ecclesiae quod ferat foris g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </note>
      <hi>The Church hath that shee may suffer without, and sigh for within, yet she accounts as enemies both those that are without, and those that are within; those that are without are more easily auoided, those that are within are more hardly indured.</hi>

   <p>His Maiesty hath gone before vs in his excellent encounters: Were it not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to follow him against the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in a iust and waighty quarrell, then by taking vp the pen, to disturbe the peace of the Church, about matter of Ceremonies?
