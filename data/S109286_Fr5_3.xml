   <head>THE ARGVMENT.</head>
   <p>AFter the death of <hi>Antonius, Cleopatra</hi> (li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
still in the Monument she had caused
to bee built,) coulde not by anie meanes bee
drawne foorth, although <hi>Octauius Caesar</hi>
verie earnestlie laboured it: and sent <hi>Proculcius</hi> to vse
all diligence to bring her vnto him: For that he thought
it woulde bee a great Ornament to his tryumphes, to get
her aliue to Rome. But neuer woulde shee put her selfe
into the handes of <hi>Proculeius,</hi> although on a time hee
founde the meanes, (by a window that was at the toppe
of the Monument,) to come downe vnto her: where hee
perswaded her (all hee might) to yeelde her selfe to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi>
mercie. Which shee, (to bee ridde of him,) cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
seemed to graunt vnto. After that, <hi>Octauius</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
went to visite her, to whome shee excused her offence, <pb facs="150"/>laying all the fault vpon the greatnesse, and feare shee had
of <hi>Antonius,</hi> and withall, seemed verie tractable, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be disposed of by him.</p>
   <p>VVhereupon <hi>Octauius,</hi> (thinking himselfe sure) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solu'd
presentlie to sende her away to Rome. Whereof, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labella</hi>
a fauourite of <hi>Caesars,</hi> (and one that was growne
into some good liking of her,) hauing certified her, shee
makes her humble petition to <hi>Caesar,</hi> that hee would suffer
her to sacrifice to the ghost of <hi>Antonius:</hi> which beeing
graunted her, shee was brought vnto his Sepulcher, where
after her rytes perfourmed, she returned to the Monument,
and there dined with great magnificence. And in dinner
time, came there one in the habite of a Countrey-man,
with a Basket of Figges vnto her who (vnsuspected) was
suffered to carrie them in. And in that Basket (among
the Figges) were conueyed the Aspicks wherewith she did
herselfe to death. Dinner beeing ended, shee dispatched
Letters to <hi>Caesar,</hi> contayning great lamentations: with
an earnest supplication, that she might bee intomb'd with
<hi>Antonius.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> knowing what shee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
sent presentlie with all speede, Messengers to haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
her death, which not withstanding, before they came
was dispatched.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Caesario</hi> her sonne, which she had by <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi>
(conuaied before vnto <hi>India,</hi> out of the daunger of the
warres,) was about the same time of her death, murthered <pb facs="150"/>at <hi>Rhodes:</hi> trayned thither by the falshoode of his Tutor,
corrupted by <hi>Caesar.</hi> And so hereby, came the race of the
<hi>Ptolomies</hi> to bee wholie extinct, and the flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
rich kingdome of <hi>Egypt</hi> vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ouer-throwne and
subdued.</p>
