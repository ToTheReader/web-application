   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause the Subiect, whereupon I chiefly haue fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this discourse, aimeth only to lay open the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull hand of God lately shewed to the Queenes most excellent Maiestie, and performed by her loyall and faithfull Subiect the <hi>L. MOVNTIOYE, L.</hi> Deputy of this Land, against the insolent, traiterous, and rebellious vsurpation of <hi>Tyrone, Odonnell,</hi> and all other open and discouered rebels: And that among other his coloured and shadowed courses for his rebellion, this principally was one: namely, to reforme religion, and for his and their conscience sake. Whose religion (if he haue any at all, as I assure my selfe he hath none) is but meere Athisme, and himselfe a damned slaue in hell, without harty repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and speedy conuersion. And for that the religion whereof he makes outward shew &amp; profession, is according to the Romish▪ Church, taught, deliuered, and brought hither into this Realme of Ireland from the shambles &amp; slaughter-house of soules, I meane the Church of Rome: and maintained, defended, and earnestly vrged by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ the Pope of Rome, that man of sinne: and by his fugitiues, runnagates, and traiterous male-contented subiects of all Princes in Christendom flocking still thither: I meane his Seminaries, Iesuits, Priests, and Fryers: Who closely creepe and steale into this Land in disguised and counterfeited manner: and by whom infinite soules of men haue beene and are seduced and drawne away from the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, and obedience of his will, to follow tradition, superstition, and mans inuention, to the great danger of their soules, without speedy amendment. In regard whereof, it may please you with patience and in brotherly loue and affection: which euery faithfull and true Christian ought to haue, the one with the other, but with a single eye and well disposed hart, consider of these speciall points insuing: by
<pb facs="4"/> which the Church of Rome is made so glorious, and which heads are also so stifly and stoutly maintained and taught by that side: and then to iudge and censure whither the Church of Rome be the true spouse of Christ or no: or whether on the contrarie, it be not the false Church, and the apparant sinke and synagogue of Sathan.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First then, whereas the Church of Rome will haue their Church to be knowne to be the true Church, by the visibilitie, antiquity, and multitude thereof, and so to be seene with the outward eye, and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at with the finger: yet you shall finde that visibilitie, antiquitie, and multitude are not the markes of the true Church: but a little flocke few in number, and yet of greatest antiquitie: as by these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces foorth of Gods word may appeare. For I pray tell me where the Church was visible, when being assembled at Ierusalem, there arose<note place="margin">Act. 8. 1.</note> a great persecution against it, insomuch as they were all dispearsed and scattered? And let them tell me, where, or how the Church was visible when Christ was smitten, and all the rest was scattered and<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 17.</note> hid, and concealed themselues. Doth not S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Reuelation<note place="margin">Reuel. 12. 6. 7.</note> testifie expresly, That the Church of Christ, signified there by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, fled into a desert or wildernesse, where she had a place prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for her of God, and where she could not for a certaine season be found of the persecutors? Where was the Church in the time of <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet? When he said, <hi>They haue forsaken thy coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Kings. 19. &amp;c.</note>
      <hi>they haue destroyed thine Altar, and slaine thy Prophets with the sword, and I am left alone.</hi> Againe, it is written in the 2. of<note place="margin">2. Kings. 16.</note> Kings the 16. that <hi>vnder the raigne of Achas, there was taken a patterne of the Altar of the Idolaters of Damascus, and Vrias the High Priest remooued the Altar of the Lord.</hi> Whereby it appeareth that the Priesthood was corrupted, the Altar remooued, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the sacrifice ceased. Now I trust there is no Papist so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent to say, that either the true Church was in the Scribes and Pharisies, or in the time of <hi>Achas, Manasses,</hi> and many other Kings of Israell, so visible and populous as they would haue it: but that the Church of Christ were in that small number, wheresoeuer dispersed.</p>
   <p>Secondly, the Church of Rome holdes that ignorance is the mother
<pb facs="4"/> of deuotion: but Christ saith ignorance is the mother of error: say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>You erre not knowing the Scriptures:</hi> and Christ biddeth the<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 29. Ioh. 5. 39. Coloss. 3. 16. Acts. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>7.</note> people to search the Scripture. <hi>Paul</hi> commaunded that the word of God should dwell plentiously in the people, whereby they might teach themselues: and the <hi>Berenas</hi> examined the Scriptures.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Church of Rome teacheth, that the Scriptures ought to be taught in a strange tongue. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith: <hi>He that</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note>
      <hi>speaketh in a strange tongue; speaketh not vnto men, but vnto God, for no man heareth him, howbeit in the spirit he speaketh secret things. He that speaketh in a strange language edifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. I would that you all spake strange languages, but rather that you prophecied. For greater is he that prophecieth, then he that speaketh diuers tongues, except he expound it, that the Church may receiue edification. And now brethren, if I come vnto you speaking diuers tongues, what shall it profit you, &amp;c.</hi> Moreouer, things without life which giue a sound, whether it be a Harpe or a Pipe, except they make a distinction in the sound, how shall it be knowne what is piped or harped? So likewise yee by the tongue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you vtter words which haue signification, how shall it be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood what is spoken, for you shall speake in the ayre.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the Church of Rome doth teach there is a Purgatorie. Christ in the Gospell sheweth onely two places, namely heauen and hell: Christ said to the theefe, <hi>This day shalt thou be with me in</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luk. 16. Luke. 23. 43.</note>
      <hi>Paradise.</hi> Christ saith, <hi>Verily, verily, I say vnto you, he that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth my words and beleeueth him that sent me, hath eternall life,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 25. Phil. 1. 2. 3.</note>
      <hi>and commeth not into condemnation, but passeth from death to life.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I couet to be dissolued and to be with Christ.</hi> Againe, <hi>For we know, that when this earthly tabernacle of ours is dissolued, we haue a building of God not made with hands, but</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 1. Reuel. 14. 13.</note>
      <hi>eternall in the heauens.</hi> Againe, <hi>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from hencefoorth they rest from their labours, and their workes follow them.</hi> And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> telleth the Saints and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 9.</note> of God, and assureth them of it, <hi>That the end of their faith is the saluation of their soules.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, the Church of Rome teacheth, that since the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> man hath free-will: Whereas God saith, <hi>After that time that the</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note>
      <hi>imaginations of mens harts are onely euill euery day.</hi> Christ saith,<note place="margin">Iere. 7.</note>
      <hi>No man can come vnto me, except the father draw him.</hi> Againe,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 10.</note>
      <hi>Conuert thou me and I shall be conuerted.</hi> Also, <hi>There is not one<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> that doth good, no not one.</hi> Againe, <hi>Without faith it is vnpossible<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> to please God:</hi> And againe, <hi>Whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 1, 2.</note> Also, <hi>Except men be ingrafted into him, they can bring foorth no fruits:</hi> besides many places to like effect.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, the Church of Rome deliuereth the Sacrament but in one kinde, namely bread: Christ saith, <hi>Drinke yee all of this cup. Paul</hi>
      <note place="margin">Matth. 26. 27. 1. Cor. 11. 23. 28.</note> 1. Corinthians 11. 23. 28. saith, <hi>Let a man examine himselfe, and so let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seuenthly, the Church of Rome holdeth transubstantiation in the Sacrament, and this they would seeme to ground vpon these words: <hi>This is my body,</hi> which they will haue to be expounded lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: but why then doe they not expound the other words of Christ literally also concerning the cup? For the text saith in the 27. and 28. verses, that <hi>He tooke the cup and said, This is my bloud:</hi> I am sure they will not say that the cup was the bloud of Christ, (as the words be,) but they will graunt a figure in those words: namely, that by the cup is meant the wine in it: if then they will admit a figure in this, why may there not be a figure in the other: namely, <hi>This is my body,</hi> should be vnderstood thus: This bread is a figure of my body, (which was broken for you.) Circumcision was called the Lords coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, when indeed it was not the couenant: So likewise the Paschall Lambe is called the Passeouer, when indeed it was but a signe of the Passeouer. Christ saith, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith plainely and expresly, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. 28. that the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants doe eate bread: and therefore it remaineth bread after the words of consecration. For if it were transubstantiated into the body of Christ, then were there no bread to eate, but the body of Christ is the thing that should be eaten: but none doth eate the very body of Christ. For if euery communicant did eate the very body of Christ
<pb facs="5"/> naturally, carnally, and really (as they grosly suppose,) Christ should haue a number of bodies, which is palpably absurd and monstrous to thinke. Besides, if Christ gaue his body to be eaten really by his Disciples, at the time of the institution of this Sacrament, what was it that did hang vpon the crosse on the morrow. Moreouer, S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21, that as touching the body of Christ, <hi>The heauens must containe him to the end of the world.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eightly, the Church of Rome holdeth the Pope hath authority to depose Kings and Princes. <hi>God deposeth the mightie from their seates, and exalteth them of low degree.</hi> It is God that testifieth of<note place="margin">Luke. 1. Dan. 2. 20. &amp; 4. 14. &amp; 21. 2. Cor. 10. 4. Rom. 13. 1. 2. 3. 4. 1. Pet. 2. 13. Tit. 3. 1.</note> himselfe; <hi>By me Kings raigne, and Princes haue dominion. Paul</hi> confesseth plainely, that the weapons of their warfare are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, but mightie through God, that is spirituall. And it is manifest by the practise of the Apostles and all their precepts, (commaunding all Christians to obey their rulers, their Kings &amp; Princes, yea though they were persecutors:) &amp; the Apostles neuer had any such authority commited to them. Christ himselfe saith, his kingdome was not of<note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 36. Ioh. 6. 15. Math. 22. 21.</note> this world: and Christ himselfe refused to be made a King: Christ himselfe also paid tribute vnto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and commaunded others to giue the same, and all other dueties of subiection and obedience to <hi>Caesar.</hi> And Christ hath expresly forbidden his Apostles, &amp; in them all the Ministers of his Gospell, all such dominion &amp; ciuill iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, saying thus vnto them: <hi>The Kings of the nations raigne ouer</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 25. 26 Mar. 10. 42. 43.</note>
      <hi>them, and they that be great among them beare rule or dominion, but it shall not be so with you.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Ninthly, the Pope of Rome holds that he hath power to forgiue sinners. But the Scribes, in the Gospell could say, none can forgiue<note place="margin">Mar. 2. 7. Iob. 14. 4. Esay. 45. 11.</note> sinnes but God. <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>Who can bring a cleane thing out of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, there is not one.</hi> And <hi>Esay</hi> saith, speaking, in the person of God: <hi>I euen I am he that putteth away thine iniquities for mine owne sake, and will not remember thy sinnes.</hi> And <hi>Paul confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmeth, when he saith, Who shall lay any thing to the charge</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33. 34.</note>
      <hi>of Gods chosen: it is God that iustifieth, who shall condemne: it is Christ which is dead, yea▪ or rather which is risen againe, who is
<pb facs="6"/> also at the right hand of God, and maketh request also for vs.</hi> Againe, <hi>The Lord is slow to anger, and of great mercy, and forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing</hi>
      <note place="margin">Num. 14. 18. Exod. 34. 7.</note>
      <hi>iniquitie:</hi> And in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. God speaking in his owne person, said: that he reserueth mercie for thousands, forgiuing iniquity and transgression and sinne: besides infinite places to like purpose.</p>
   <p>Tenthly, the Church of Rome doth teach that the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not all things necessary to saluation: but their vnwritten tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions<note place="margin">10</note> must (as they say) be all receiued with equall and like autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, for so hath the Councell of Trent determined. But S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, that <hi>These things are written that yee may beleeue, and that in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing yee may haue life eternall:</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>The Scriptures are profitable to reprooue, to teach and correct, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 15.</note>
      <hi>and perfect the man of God:</hi> and further, that <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are able to make men wise vnto saluation:</hi> and God himselfe doth say, <hi>Yee shall put nothing to the word which I command you,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note>
      <hi>neither take ought there-from:</hi> Againe, <hi>Whatsoeuer I command</hi>
      <note place="margin">Deut. 12.</note>
      <hi>you, that take heed you doe, put nothing thereto, nor take ought there-from.</hi> And S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Reuelation saith, that <hi>If any man shal</hi>
      <note place="margin">Reuel. 22.</note>
      <hi>adde to this thing, God shall adde vnto him the plagues which are written in this booke, and shall take away his part out of the booke of life.</hi> I might yet adde further touching the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Christ. for that the Church of Rome will yeeld that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ consisteth in these three points: namely that he is both a Prophet, a Priest, and a King: which in words they will acknowledge, but in deeds and veritie they doe not. For how miserably and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly the Church of Rome hath mangled and defaced the reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will of this sacred Prophet, their vnwritten traditions, popish canons, and their owne deuises makes too apparant. Touching his Priesthood, which consisteth in two things, namely, the offering vp of himselfe once, for a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice: and his intercession to his Father, which remayneth to the worlds end, is so pitifully defrauded, abused, and dishonoured by them, as no pen with any modestie can set downe: as by their Purgatorie pickepurse, their propitiatorie masses for the quicke and the dead, the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous titles attributed to the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> namely, they call her
<pb facs="6"/> the Queene of heauen, the gate of Paradise, their life &amp; sweetnes, the treasure of grace, the refuge of sinners, &amp; the mediatrix of men: and not onely to her, but to saints departed they intreat with like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, and holde them their mediators. Touching how they deale with Christ in his rule and gouernement, the Pope he will raigne in mens consciences, &amp; he will be tituled with <hi>Holy, vniuersal mother Church which cannot erre, Holy father the Pope: Bishop vniuersall: Prince of Priests▪ Supreame head of the Church: Vicar of Christ: &amp; The admiration of the world, &amp;c.</hi> Touching his iurisdiction, he chalē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to himselfe both the swords: that is, both the keyes of the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie: and the Scepter of the laitie, not onely subduing all Bishops vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, aduancing himsefe aboue kings and Emperours, causing some of them to lie vnder his feet, some to hold the stirrop: kings to lead his horse by the bridle: some to kisse his feet: placing and displa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all degrees of people: pretending power and authoritie to inuest Bishops, to giue benefices, to spoyle Churches, to giue authoritie to binde &amp; lose: to call generall Councels: to set vp religions, to canonize Saints, to take appeals, to binde consciences, to make lawes, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with the law &amp; word of God, to deliuer from purgatory, and to command Angels, &amp;c. Whereby appeares, as he presumeth to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Christ in this world, so would he if he knew how also expulse him from heauen. And now gentle Reader, in equall ballance, single eye, and honest heart▪ censure whether the Church of Rome be the spouse of Christ or no: &amp; whether the word of God allow &amp; warrant his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. I cannot stand longer to inlarge of his doctrine (which is most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to Christ &amp; his Church: nor lay downe his life, which is most detestable to all men that hath any sparke of the true knowledge of Gods word:) but abruptly hasten to an end, because you may perceiue I haue but in briefe past ouer the particulars: for to discourse of these points would aske large volumes, not doubting but all indifferent men, may hereby behold vpon what rocke these Arch-rebels build their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: if it be true as they say, that it is vndertaken in regard of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion &amp; their conscience: also that all men, of what cōdition soeuer, who hath ben &amp; is lead still on to dāce after the pipe of priests, Iesuits,
<pb facs="7"/> and Seminaries, who outwardly carry a shew of godlinesse, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly are rauening and deuouring Wolues, may see what ground and warrant they find in Gods word, to approoue and allow their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and liues, indefending, maintaining, and setting foorth the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their master Antichrist the Pope, the diuels sworne cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion: whose creeping in corners, whose oyled mouthes, whose outward holines, whose monstrous hypocrisie, whose masses, whose dirges, whose beades, whose crucifixes, whose prayers, whose vowes, whose whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, whose crosses, <hi>Agnus deis,</hi> and perswasions, hath but hitherto brought foorth rebellion, disobedience to Prince, breach of Lawes and gouernment, burning, wasting, spoyling, robbing, and in generall almost an vtter ruine and waste of Ireland. Therefore in the feare of God, now come from them, and while it is yet day walke as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the Children of light, turne from these seducers, their cursed doctrine and superstitious ceremonies, and imbrace the pure milke of Gods most blessed word, and willingly, readily, and thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully come to heare the same preached and taught, which will be the perfect path for to lead you, the strong sterne to guide you, the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne to light you, and the meane by the mercy of God to saue your soules. For which euery faithfull Christian doth dayly pray.</p>
