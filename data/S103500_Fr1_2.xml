For my doing herein, I have for president Bucaeus, who hath in like sort done; this excepted, that I have neither with him brought in any testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie without the Scriptures, nor (except verie seldome) from the Apochryphall, as beeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient for foundation, howsoever of holy and profitable instruction. What is done for thy good take in good part, and the Lord blesse it to thy edification for his Christs sake.</p>
