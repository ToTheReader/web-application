   <p>This translation of
the sage <hi>Vieillard,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fruit of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vacant, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced
houres, I
purposed to dedicate in a singular respect
<pb facs="4"/>
to a worshipfull Gentleman your good
friend and neighbour, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Henry Archer,</hi>
late of <hi>Thaydon Garnon</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> who was
well versed in the French language But
his death disappoynted me of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
made my pen fall out of my hand,
lye still and stirre no further, hauing then
more then halfe finished the Booke. The
second yeare after whose death, well
weighing with my selfe, that it was a
Worke might yeeld some profit to my
Countrie men of <hi>England,</hi> I tooke vp my
Pen againe, and at starts and tymes fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
it. And then withall considering
with my selfe that a good Booke in these
dayes had need of a good man to Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
it, I called to mind that your worthy
selfe hauing beene in <hi>Fraunce</hi> and other
forraine partes, might be a fit <hi>Maecenas</hi> to
support my weake labours therein, and
so boldly adventured to Dedicate the
Patronage thereof to your good Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
And I was the rather imboldened
thereunto, vpon hope that for your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
good friend and neighbours sake,
to whom it should haue beene Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="4"/>
you would not refuse it, at least for
the workes sake, being a mixt Subiect of
morall and diuine documents and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.
And further, I hope that it will
not be accompted presumption to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
a good Booke to the learned and
vertuous. Howsoeuer, it is my dutie to
craue pardon for presuming to dedicate it
to your worship; my selfe being a man
of an obscure and humble condition. And
therefore I doe further craue your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
that I may not make my selfe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
knowne vnto your worship, then
by the two Alphabeticall letters of my
name here-vnder printed. Yet haue I
alwayes beene since I first knew you,
and still doe rest a man which doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly
reuerence you.</p>
