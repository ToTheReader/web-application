   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thou hast here prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto thee a Diet for the Soule, which if thou with a faithfull heart be carefull to obserue: It shall be a good meane to cōuey thee safely through the troublesome &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous stormes, which do continually arise in the salt Sea of this world till thou come to the ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen of safetie, which is the euerlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="2"/> of God. My desire is to adde a Preparatiue to this Diet, that it may make it more sauorie to those whome God shall enable with his grace carefully to practise the same with sincere harts to come vnto him. And that the rest which do it onely of custome, or to some other inordinate end, may bee left more without excuse.</p>
   <p>Now the Preparatiue which I adde, is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but such as God
<pb facs="2"/> hath appointed to bee mixed with euery spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall dish, that hee will haue set vpon his table, otherwise the meate will be so farre from nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing vs, that it will turne to our bane, and this Preparatiue is faith without which it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that any part of Gods ordinance shoulde profite vs. Reade Heb. 4. 2. The word that they heard profited not them because it was not mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with faith in those
<pb facs="3"/> that heardit, yea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it is vnpossible to please God. Heb. 11. 6. These are proofes suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, to shewe vnto vs the necessitie of faith. Mine exhortation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, that thou looke to thine heart, and take heede that thou bring faith with thee, when thou entrest into the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, in any part thereof, as it is here set downe in this Diet, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise in vsing of it, either thou doest set thy
<pb facs="3"/> selfe a worke, or thou art procured thereunto by some other man, but the Lord hath no part in it, and therefore thou canst hope for no blessing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy labour, because those whom he doth set a worke by the motion of his holie spirit, and outwarde ministerie of his worde: for that is the ordinarie meane whereby hee doth worke our conuersion. Iam. 1. 18. Such when they do rightly enterprise anie
<pb facs="4"/> part of those duties, which here in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise thou hast rules of. Fi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>st, they come vnto it with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, because they see with the eyes of faith, how pure the Lord is, who can abide none im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puritie, and howe vile and wretched they them selues are, whom God doth nowe summon to appeare before him, and as they come in the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their own wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednesse, so also they
<pb facs="4"/> come with greedie appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites to bee taught of God, and to bee relieued at his hand, yea and they come also with hope, that they shall bee relieued; howsoeuer the same may seeme small at the first, yet by dayly and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall exercise they doe feele it to grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, &amp; so receiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, because their hope is grounded vppon the promises, and nothing else, and this is to haue the worde mixed with
<pb facs="5"/> faith in vs, and this fruit will come of it, for God doth neuer set vs a worke vpon the meanes, to seeke for mercie and grace at his hand, but hee doth giue the thing also that wee seeke for, because hee is infinitelie mercifull. The sea is not fuller of water, nor the Sunne of light, then hee is of mercie to all these that call vpon him in truth, be their sinnes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so great. And it is al one with him to pardon
<pb facs="5"/> ten thousand talents, as to forgiue ten pence. He is as easily intreated to heale a deadly wound, as to cure the prick of a pin. It is not the greatnes of our miserie that dooth hinder this mercie, but a heart of vnbeliefe, when w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e doe vtterlie distrust the same, God dooth many times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue great and grieuous sinnes to those that doe beleeue, when hee doth impart smal sinnes be they neue<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> so small, to
<pb facs="6"/> those that are voyde of fayth: his children doe knowe this, and therfore are imboldned to seeke vnto him in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test aistresse; for whome should the wife seek vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in her trouble but to her husband? and whom should the childe seeke vnto when hee is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but to his father? By faith we knowe that God is our husband, and our Father, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath commaunded vs to call vpon him in
<pb facs="6"/> the time of neede, nay, to speake more properly, he doth set vs a worke so to doe by his holy spirit, whereby hee doth assure vs also that hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue our griefes, by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring comfort vnto vs: but as for those who set themselues a worke without the Lord. It is ether of custome to serue the time, because they would not bee contrarie to their Prince, or else for that they hauing knowledge, may be able
<pb facs="7"/> to talk of it, and so seem to others to bee that they are not, or else they do it with a mind to merit by the thing done, as if there were religion and holinesse in the bare ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, &amp; as if it were a meritorious worke to reade, to heare, to pray, to med<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e, or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any other part of Gods ordinance, bee it neuer so vnfruitfullie and barrenly passed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of them. Now any of these, though they take
<pb facs="7"/> neuer so great paines, yet shall not feele any fruit at all vpon their labors, for they are such as the Scripture speaketh of, which are euer learning and neuer come to the knowledge of the truth. If they who vse the meanes may so vaunt of faith, misse the marke of salua<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ion, they who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the meanes, must needs fall into damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherefore I do not disswade any from the vse of the meanes still,
<pb facs="8"/> but rather I aduise all to vse the mea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es still, yea and that more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, but with a better mind, and to build vpon a better foundation, that so they may receiue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fruit from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and more certain and sound comfort; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise all their glory ing will vanish like smoke, and that which they seeme to haue shall be taken from them like wise, and they left na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: what will it boote
<pb facs="8"/> them then, though their neighbors and all other men haue still thought well of them, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cōmended their waies, if God himselfe doe not approue of them, but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reiect them, and al their doings: for as wee are before the Lord, so we are in deed, and not as men do account of vs, and therefore let vs in all things seeke to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue our selues vnto God who searcheth the heart, &amp; discerneth the
<pb facs="9"/> verie secret cogitations guile cannot bee hid frō him be it neuer so close, although wee smooth it ouer with neuer so many faire and goodly shewes to the world-ward, yet the Lord can easily finde it out, and such shall bee accounted of in his sight no better then Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites yea, and all their pretended seruing of God, none other then the sacrifice of fooles, till the Lord of his infinit mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie do purge their hearts
<pb facs="9"/> by faith, because whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is not of faith is sin: and therefore wee haue great need to pray vnto the Lord that hee will increase our faith, that so both wee, and all that wee do may be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his sight, through Iesus Christ our Lorde, and Sauiour, in whome the Father is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, euen with those who in themselues are wretched, and doth free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admit them to the heauenly banquet of his
<pb facs="10"/> owne ordinance, where they shall growe and in crease till they come to his heauenly kingdome, when all the wicked and vnbeleeuing shall bee shut out. And so an end.</p>
