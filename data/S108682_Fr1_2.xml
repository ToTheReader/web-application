   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Eare &amp; louing friend, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued about ten daies gone, your letter of the 9. of this presēt: vvherī you demaund &amp; solicite againe the thing, that I so flatlie denied you, at my late being in your chamber: I mean, to put in vvriting the relation vvhich then I made vnto you, of the speech had this last Christmas in my presence, betvveen my right vvorshippful good friend &amp; Patron, &amp; his gest the olde lavvier, of some matters in our state &amp; countrie. And for that you presse me verie seriouslie at this instant, both by request &amp; manie reasons, to yeeld to your desire herein, &amp; not onlie this, but also to giue my cōsent for the publisshing of the same, by such secret meanes as you assure me you can there finde out: I haue thought good to cōfer the vvhole mater vvith the parties them selues, vvhom principalie it cōcerneth (vvho at the receipt
<pb n="2" facs="3"/> of your letter vvere not far of frō me:) And albeit at the first, I found them auerse and nothing inclined to graunt your demand: yet after vpon cōsideration of your reasons, &amp; assurance of secresy: (especialie for that ther is nothing in the same conteined repugnāt to charity or to our boundē duety tovvard our most gratious Princesse or coūtry, but rather for the special good of them both, &amp; for the forvvarning of some dangers īminent to the same) they haue referred ouer the mater to me, yet vvyth this <hi>PROVISO</hi> that they vvil knovv nothing, nor yet yeld cōsent to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing hereof, for feare of some future florish of the Ragged Staf to come herafter about their eares, if their names should break furth: vvhich (I trust) you vvil prouide shal neuer happen, both for their securitie, &amp; for your ovvn. And vvith this I vvil end, assuring you that vvithin thes five or six daies, you shal receiue the vvhole in vvriting by an other vvay &amp; secret meanes, neither shal the bearer suspect vvhat he carieth: vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of also I thought good to premonyshe you▪ And this shal suffice for this tyme.</p>
