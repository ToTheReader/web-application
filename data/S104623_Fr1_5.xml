   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, thou</hi> shalte vnderstande that this presente Auctoure whose translatiō I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer here vnto thee, doth not folowe others of the Greekes and Latines, that haue entreted of the like matter, bicause they alway (wryting any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structiōs for their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) were accustomed to aduertize them, how they ought to gouerne themselues in mariage, and also to admonishe them that they shoulde flee from the companie of euill and wicked women, and to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and careful to cleanse their dominions of all such infections, as the onely things that tended to the vtter decay and ruine of them. Neyther doth he make any mention here howe Princes ought to eschue wars and embrace peace, a thing so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as without the which, Gouernement is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether imperfect and maymed. He hath likewyse omitted to exhorte Princes to bannish out of their Courtes al Flatterers and other such kinde of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="2" facs="8"/> that do nothing else but fyl their eares with vnnecessarie pleasures and delights, whose exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise is onely to watche apte houres and tymes to feede them with toyes and fantasies, wherin they do so well play their partes, that in the ende they corrupte them, although they be very good of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and well inclined. And if thou be curious to knowe the occasyon, why the Authour hath sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and kept in silence, in the discourse of thys Booke, things so necessarie for Regimente (seing he hath so wel entreated of the rest) I can not tell any reson therfore, other than (as I suppose) that he was preuented by death, being in purpose if he had liued longer, to haue performed those points. And the cause that doth leade mee thus to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, is, for that there was founde of his doing (after his decease) one Booke of Geographie, and another of Greeke Epigrams, that were imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and vncorrected, which are at this presente in the Kings Librarie to be sene. And in place ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I am enboldned (trusting vpon the good inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thou wilt make of these my labours) to ioyne vnto it these three treatises beforenamed, of mine owne inuention, for the better and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect adourning of this worke: assuring thee, that I haue not so wel trusted in myne owne habilitie, nor presumed of my selfe so much, but that I haue vsed therin the ayde of certein famous Latin Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and specially in the Treatise of Peace and Warre, as thou mayest perceyue by the reading thereof. And as touching the other two, I haue
<pb n="3" facs="8"/> perfourmed them rather by myne own labor and trauayle, than by any other meanes, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse are not to be condemned, although (as the Comicall Poete sayeth) there is nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently there spoken, that hath not bene sayd long before. The fyrste Treatise, which is agaynste Parasites and Flatterers, thou mayest reade in my Prologue: and that of the excellencie of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the other of Peace and Warre, be the last two Chapters of this present Boke. Besydes these things before named, I haue gathered oute of many good Authoures (by the persuasion of a friend of mine) the life, maners, religion and death of that monster Mahomet, and shewed by what meanes and subtiltie he did seduce and cary away with him so many people. Al which things I praye thee fyrst reade wyth good deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration before thou do iudge, and then I doubt not but thou shalt finde matter in them, that shal be to thy conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation &amp; comfort.</p>
