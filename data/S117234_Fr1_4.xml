   <p>1 THat Iesus Christ is King and Lord of his Church: and
that all which look for salvation by him are bound to yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to him, as in all other things which he hath commaunded, so also in
his ordinance of Ministery, Worship, and Government prescribed in
his Testament, and no other. <hi>Mat. 28. 19. 20 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 13. 14. 15 16. vvith

Act. 3. 22. 23. and 5. 31. Esa. 60. 12. Rev. 22. 18. 19.</p>
   <p>2. That Christ as head and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ord of his Church hath given vnto it for
the instruction guydance and service thereof, the offices of Pastors, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,

and Titus.</p>
   <p>3. That the Primitiue Churches were by the Apostles planted in this
way and order, as being the onely true way and order appoynted by Christ,
and to be observed to the end of the world. <hi>Rom. 12. 7. 8 1 Cor. 12. 28. and 14.

   <p>4. That synce the tyme of the Primitive Churches thus planted, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
that man of sinne (as was foretold) hath made departure from this
way and order of Christ, not onely in other poynts of doctrine, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in the Ministery, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>orship, and Government of the Church. Wherevpon
is come to passe, that in stead of the former offices appoynted by Christ, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
crept in the Locusts of Antichrist, Archbishops, Lordbishops, Archdeaeōs,
Chauncelors, Commissaryes, Parsons, Vicars, Priests, and the rest of that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ort, together with theyr new and straunge entrance, administration, and
maintenance. 2 Thes. 2. 3. 4. 7—12. <hi>Rev. 9. 1—11. and 13. 11—18.</hi> and 14. 9. 10. 11.

positions.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>5. That the Nations of the earth, and this among the rest, have ben made
drunk with this cup of Babels fornications: Whereof whosoever drunketh,
God hath threatned they shall also drink of the cup of his wrath. <hi>Rev. 17. 1—5.
and 18. 3. 4. 2 Thes. 2. 10. 11. 12. Rev.</hi> 14. 9. 10. 11.</p>
   <p>6. That this nation hath (to the prayse of God, and honour of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty)
ben purged from many of the abominations and false doctrines of
Babylon aforesaid, but not from the Prelacy and other Ministery, worship
and government of the Church by Archbishops, Lordbishops. Archdeacons,
Commissaryes, Priests, Parsons, Deanes, Prebendaryes, Canons, etc. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
is evident by theyr present estate: and by these reasons follovving.</p>
   <p>First, if all the false ministery, worship, and tyranny of Antichrist wers
in all other places of the world abolished, yet so long as this Prelacy and
other Clergy and worship aforesaid remayneth in this land, Antichrist that
<pb facs="5"/>
sonne of perdition were not vtterly consumed: As the Scripture testifyeth
he shalbe by the light of the Gospell before Christs comming at the great day.
2 <hi>Thes. 2. 3. 8. vvith Rev. 14. 6. 7. 8. and 18. 19. and Ierem. 50. and 51. cap.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Secondly, the Churches of Antichrist cannot be compleet in all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall
functions, Prelacy, and Ministery of Antichrist, if they have
not the functions, Prelacy, and Ministery of Archbishops, Lordbishops,
Archdeacons, Priests, and the rest now had and retayned in the Land.
<hi>This is proved by the Popes Canons and Pontificall, and by theyr Church
constitution.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, the Churches of Christ may be compleet in the whole ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
worship, and government appoynted by Christ to his Church, and yet
be alway and altogether without the present ministery, worship, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment
by Archbshops, Lordbishops, Archdeacons, Priests etc. now
had and retayned in this Land. <hi>This is proved by the constitution of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
Churches planted by the Apostles:</hi> Which (the Scripture showeth) we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
compleet in the former, and yet never had nor knew these latter. <hi>Rom. 12.
7. 8. Ephes. 4. 11. 12. 13. Act. 14. 23. and 20. 17. 28. 1. Cor. 12. 28. Col. 2. 5. Phil. 1.
1. Tit. 1. 5—9. 1 Tim. 3. and 5. cap. and 6. 13. 14. 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 1. 2. 3. 4. 12.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, if that which is had in this Land were the true Ministery,
worship, and government ordeyned by Christ in his Church, then ought
all the Churches of Christ vpon earth to vse the same <hi>(Mat. 28. 18. 19. 20.
1 Tim. 6. 13. 14. 1 Cor. 4. 17. and 12. 5. and 14. 37. Iude. ver. 3. Rev. 22. 16. 17.
18. 19.):</hi> But even the Prelates themselves and theyr Proctors confesse
it is and may be otherwise. <hi>VVhitg. in the preface of his last book against
T. C. Also the Aunsvver to the Abst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>act: pag.</hi> 58.</p>
   <p>Finally, if that which is had in this Land were the true Ministery,
worship, and government appoynted by Christ to his Church, then might
it be found in the word of God: But that can it not. If any be otherwise
mynded, let them show the severall offices, entrance, administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and maintenance of the Prelacy and other Ministery of these assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes
out of the Scriptures and Testament of Christ.</p>
   <p>If they speak not according to this vvord, it is because
there is no light in them.
