Wherfore God, likewise, gaue them vp vnto their hertes lustes into vnclean<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, to defyle their owne bodies in them selues, which turned the truthe of god in to a lie, so that they worshipped &amp; serued the creature more then y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> creator, which is blessed for euer and euer.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Rom. 1</note>And what more ensued Sainct Paul declareth, They Iustlie receyued the re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warde of their erroure, and as they had no regarde to knowe God, euen so god gaue them vp vnto a lewde mynd, to do those thynges whiche were not comelie beyng full of all vnrightuousnes whore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome, wickednes, couetousnes, malyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, full of enuye, murther, stryfe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, euell cōdicioned, whisperers, backe biters, dispisers of god, doers of wronge

   <p>Thus doest y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> see (good Christian rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der) howe daungerous a thynge it is, to neglect or dispyse the myghtie worde of god, against whiche (notwithstanding) the gates of hell can not preuayle: so y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in dispisynge or resystinge it althoughe of a malycious or peruerse mynde, thou goest aboute to suppresse &amp; kepe it backe thou dost nothing els but procure thine owne dampnation, the worde of god flo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>risshinge neuertheles: for as the gospell is saluation, to them that beleue it, so is it dampnatiō to them that beleue it not.

Saynct Paul doth speake those thinges onelye of those y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> were before his dayes and so perswade our selues that it was nothinge meant of vs, but in lesse then we cā proue our selues not giltie in those and lyke offences that they in the olde lawe were plaged and punisshed for, let vs not perswade our selues to be cleare of lyke threatenynges. No, let vs loke for none other thinge, but to be caste vp of god into a reprobate and leude mynd and so headlonge into all fylthynes and iniquitie the iuste rewarde of our errour whose ende is death euerlastynge.</p>

      <note place="margin">Deut. viij.</note>God fed y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Israelytes with fyne Māna sente them from aboue, they abhorred it &amp; wisshed to be at their full grosse fleash pottes agayne in Egipte.<note place="margin">Exo. 16.</note> They were plaged for their vnthankefulnes.

Well, shall we thinke to escape gods wrathe? Is god become a chaungelyng? will he not punysshe vs, for our vnthankefulnes
<pb facs="4"/>
as he dyd them? yea trulie. For we be more worthy of punishment then they, seing we haue their punishmēt,<note place="margin">Num. xi.</note> for an en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sample before our eyes to beware by.</p>
   <p>God also brought the children of Israel out of Egipt by wonderfull miracle,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> for when it was vnpossible by all reason, but y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> other they shoulde haue bene des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyed by Pharao and his armye being behynde them: or else to haue bene all drowned in the rede sea before them: the mightie power of god caused the deepe sea to stande on eyther syde of them like a wall so that they passed through it safe lie, but theyr enemyes pursuinge them were drowned horse and man. Wheare as they ought with whole herte &amp; mind continually duringe their lyues to haue geuen thankes vnto that myghtie god alone for their deliueraunce: they shortly after made them a goldē calfe,<note place="margin">Exo. 32</note> fell down and worshiped it, offering sacrifyce vnto it, saying. These be thy goddes (O Isra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ell) whiche haue brought the out of the lande of Egypte. This their vnthankful Idolatry Moyses called y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> greatest sinne and was greuously punysshed: for there
<pb facs="5"/>
ensued murder of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Israelites to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> nom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre of xxiij.m. Now if it can be proued, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we haue shewd no such vnthākfulnes to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward god, haue not resisted his word nor cōmitted no such lyke offence: then may we sleape the more careles and feare no suche plages to fall vpon vs, for of thys we may be sure, God will not punysshe vs without a cause. But amongest ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny other thinges, what say you to thys, I pray you? We were longe in Egypte that is in the bondage and captiuitie of Pharao the deuyll, and when we could be delyuered by no power no merite or intercession of any creature besyde christ visyble or inuisible / mortal or immortall / &amp; wher as it was impossible to al reason, but other we shoulde be euerlastinglye drowned in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> red fiery sea of hell &amp; death being allwaies before our eyes: or els to be deuoured of the furiouse Pharao the deuyll pursuinge vs: God of his mere mercye (aboue all our desert) sente hys onely begotten sonne Christe Iesus, to become verie man and dye for vs, for in as moch as we had committed suche of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> as was forbidden in paine of deth
<pb facs="5"/>
we muste nedes be redeamed agayn by death, and that by suche a one y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> shoulde not remayne dead styll, for then shoulde not he ouercome death but death ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hym: therfore muste he ryse again and so by death ouercome death.</p>
   <p>This parte hath christ played alone. He died for our redemption,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 1. Cor. 1 Ephe. 1</note> he rose againe for our iustification &amp; so ouercame death synne and hell: and thus moste wonder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully delyuered vs out of euerlastynge thraldom and captiuite. But haue we alwayes ascribed the renowne and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our redemption and forgeuenesse of synnes to god alone? No no but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to masses satysfactorie with sondry other vayne traditions of man. To whō do we attribute, or whom do we prayse for our daylie preseruation from perilles and Ieoperdyes? God alone? No, our manyfeste actes do openly reproue vs. How many men and womē haue bene, when they haue bene in daunger / some of drowninge, some of burninge, some of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

them and raysed them vp agayn, wold shortly after get them to one ydol or other (to whom thei had vowed their pilgrimage and offeringe) as some to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ladie of Walsyngham some to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of Grace, or vnto some other foule ydoll. And where as they shoulde haue geuen glorie and praise to the one euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastyng god, which alone delyuered thē they haue kneeled downe in the sight of the whole multitude &amp; thanked a dome ymage, worshippyng and offering their ydolatrous sacrifice vnto it. Was not this ydolatry worse thē the worshipping of the golden calfe? yes trulie. For then sacrifice was commaunded to be offered to god with calues, but not calues to be worshipped: as for ydolatrous ymages were forbydden then as they be nowe. And for that the people might be y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> more allured to lyke abhomynation y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> priestes taught them for their owne aduauntage to come onely in their shirtes &amp; smockes what was this els but to say with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelytes? These be thi goddes (o Israel) whiche haue brought the out of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lande of Egipte &amp; bondage: yea and no doubt
<pb facs="6"/>
the worlde bothe hath and shall be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> as greuous plages as they were, yf it do not earnestly repent and forsake not onely suche abhomination: but also all kynde of ydolatrie that is, all inward or outwarde worshipping of the ymage of any thinge visyble or invisyble: or sea kyng forgeuenes of synnes or saluation at any creature mortall or immortal, but only at gods mercy, &amp; y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> for christes sake.</p>
   <p>More ouer for these and suche lyke our vnthankefulnes and offences, God had iustly geuen vs vp into such a lewde and reprobate mynde, that all we (a few excepte) were not onely geuen headlong into all kynde of vyce and ydolatrie: but were so ferre gone y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we were iuste par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the curse pronounced out off goddes mouthe by the prophete Esaie.<note place="margin">Esai. 5</note> wo be to you y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> call euyl good, and good euyll, makyng derkenes lyght and light derkenes, takynge bitternes for swetnes and swetnes for bytternes. In this case were we. That whiche was vyce and ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>homination, we toke for godlynes and vertue: And that whiche was godlynes and vertue in dede, we toke for heresie &amp;
<pb facs="7"/>
synne: for who was he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thought it not godly to professe him self into an abbey frier house or nonry? Who was he that spake against them, and that with gods worde but he shoulde be hated and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted? Who was he that thought but that it was hyghlie meritorious to go on pylgrimage to this or that ymage? Who was he that coulde speake against them but he should be in daunger of his life? Who durst speake against y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Popes hote purgatorie, but that he shoulde be burned to asshes? And as for the abusing of the lordes supper whiche they called the sacrament of the Aultare, he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> spake but a worde against it, or againste their wycked masses satisfactorie (thoughe it were the verie scripture) hangynge was to good for hym, he must dye most cruel death. But thankes be to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> eternall god for he (to the declaration of his glorie &amp; for his electes sake) hath styrred vp men as his instrumentes to speake, write and printe myghtelie against suche abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and he hathe turned the hartes and powers of some christen Princes a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainst them to suppresse them and roote
<pb facs="7"/>
out all suche plantes as our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther hath not planted.</p>
   <p>❧ Finally, seing that papisticall abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynations and ydolatries be now well nyghe all knowen though they be yet scarcely halfe lefte in many places, it is requisite and highly necessarie to know how a faithfull christian man, endued w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the spirite of god &amp; truely taught in hys worde, shall behaue hymselfe amonge y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> papistes, were in and how ferre he may be conuersaunt with them: namely, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther he may be present at their masse and supersticious Ceremonies w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>out offence in y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he, although by owtwarde gestures as by cappynge and kneelynge seme to worshippe with them, doth notwithstā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge in his herte worshippe the onely lyuynge god: whether he may lawfully vse suche dissimulation or not? For thy full erudition &amp; learnyng in this behalfe although veri few writers haue touched this poincte (namely in the Englysshe tongue) here haste thou (good Christiā) this notable work of M. Ihon Caluyn a man of good learnynge and godlie cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, now firste translated into En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glysshe:

which, if thou, dilygentlie reade peruse and marke with sobernes, it wyl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fullie satisfy thy mynde in this behalfe wher as certen places in scripture (afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
