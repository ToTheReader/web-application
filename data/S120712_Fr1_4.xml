      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He greatest vanity that I finde in the world is, that vaine men are not onely content to be vaine in their life, but also procure to leaue a memory of their vanity after their death. For it is so thought good vnto vaine and light men which serue the world in vain works: that at the houre of death when they perceyue they can do no more, and that they can no longer preuaile, they offer themselues vnto death, which now they see ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch vpon them. Many of the World are so fleshed in the World, that although it forsaketh them in deedes, yet they will not forsake it in their desires. And I durst sweare, that if the World could grant them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall life, they would promise it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to remaine in their customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble folly.</p>
   <p>O what a number of vaine men are aliue, which haue neyther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of God to serue him, nor of his glorie to obey him, nor of their conscience to make it cleane: but like bruit beasts fellow and runne after their voluptuous pleasures. The bruit beast is angry if a man keepe him too much in awe: if he bee weary hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his rest, hee sleepeth when hee lifteth, he eateth and drinketh when hee commeth vnto it, and vnlesse hee be compelled hee doth nothing: hee taketh no care for the common-wealth, for he neither knoweth how to follow reason, nor yet how to resist sensuality. Therefore if a man at all times should eate when hee desireth, reuenge himselfe when he is moued, commit adulterie when hee is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, drinke when he is thirsty, &amp; sleep when he is drousie, wee might more properly call such a one a beast nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the mountaines, then a man brought vp in the common-wealth: For him properly wee may call a mā that gouerneth himselfe like a man; that is to say, conformable vnto such things as reason willeth, &amp; not where sensuality leadeth.</p>
   <p>Let vs leaue these vaine men which are aliue, and talke of them that bee dead, against whom wee dare say, that whiles they were in the world, they followed the world, and liued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the same. It is not to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled at, that since they were liuing in the world, they were noted of some world point. But seeing their vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and wicked life is ended: why will
<pb facs="12"/>
they then smell of the vanities of the World in their graues? It is a great shame and dishonour for men of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and stout hearts, to see in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the end of our life, and neuer to see the end of our solly.</p>
   <p>Wee neyther reade, heare nor see any thing more common, then such men as bee most vnprofitable in the Common wealth, and of life most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, to take vpon them most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour whiles they liue, and to leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them the greatest memory at their death.</p>
   <p>What vanity can bee greater in the world, then to esteeme the world, which esteemeth no man, &amp; to make no account of God who so greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth all men? What greater folly can there bee in man, then by much trauell to encrease his goods, &amp; with vaine pleasures to loose his soule? It is an olde plague in mans nature, that many (or the most part of men) leaue the amendement of their life farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: to set their honour the more before.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> in the first booke of the Emperours sayth, that <note place="margin">A notable sentence. Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar.</note>
      <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> (no further then in <hi>Spaine</hi> in the City of <hi>Cales,</hi> now called <hi>Calis)</hi> saw in the Temple the triumphes of <hi>Alexāder</hi> the great painted, the which when hee had well viewed, he sighed maruellous sore, and being asked why hee did so, hee answered: <hi>What a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full case am I in, that am now of the age of thirty yeares, and</hi> Alexander <hi>at the same yeeres had subdued the whole world, and rested him in</hi> Babylon. <hi>And I (being as I am) a</hi> Romane, <hi>neuer did yet thing worthy of prayse in my life, nor shall leaue any renowne of mee after my death.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Dion</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> in the second booke <hi>De audacia</hi> sayeth, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Drusius,</hi> the Almaine, vsed to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site the graues and tombes of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and renowmed which were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in <hi>Italie,</hi> and did this alwayes, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at his going to warfare: And it was asked why hee did so? Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. I visit the sepulchers of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and of diuers others which are dead, before whom all the Earth trembled, when they were aliue: For, in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their prosperous successe, I did recouer both strength and stoutnesse.</p>
   <p>He saith furthermore, that it encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth a man to fight against his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, remembring hee shall leaue of him a memory in time to come.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Cicero</hi> saith in his <hi>Rhethorike,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Plynie</hi> maketh mention of the same in an Epistle: that there came from <hi>Thebes</hi> (in <hi>Egipt)</hi> a knight to <hi>Rome,</hi> for no other purpose, but only to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were true or no, that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the notable things of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whom <hi>Moecenas</hi> demanded, what he perceyued of the <hi>Romaines,</hi> and what he thought of <hi>Rome?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>He answered: <hi>The memory of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent doth more content me, then the glory</hi>
      <note place="margin">A worthy sentence of</note>
      <hi>of the present doth satisfie me.</hi> And the reason of this is. The desire which men haue to extoll the liuing, &amp; to be equall vnto the dead: maketh things so straunge in their life, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue immortal fame after their death. The <hi>Romaines</hi> reioyced not a little, to heare such wordes of a straungers mouth, wherby he praised them which were departed, and exalted them which yet liued.</p>
   <p>Oh what a thing it is to consider the auncient heathens, which neyther feared Hell, nor hoped for Heauen: and yet by remembrance of weaknes, they tooke vnto them strength, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes they were boldened: throgh feare, they became hardy: of dangers they tooke encouragement: of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, they made friends: of pouertie, they tooke patience: of malice, they learned experience. Finally (I say,) they denyed their owne willes, and followed the'opinions of others, only
<pb facs="13"/>
to leaue behind them a memorie with the dead: and to haue a little honour with the dead.</p>
   <p>Oh how many are they that trust the vnconstantnesse of <hi>Fortune,</hi> onely to leaue some notable memorie behinde them. Let vs call to minde some worthie examples, whereby they may see that to be true, which I haue spokē.</p>
   <p>What made king <hi>Ninus</hi> to inuent such warres? Queene <hi>Semiramis,</hi> to make such buildings? <hi>Vlisses</hi> the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> to sulke so many Seas? king <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander,</hi> to conquere so many Lands? <hi>Hercules</hi> the <hi>Thebane,</hi> to set vp his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars where hee did? <hi>Caius Casar</hi> the <hi>Romaine,</hi> to giue 52. battells at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come both the <hi>Asiaes? Hanniball</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> to make so cruell warres against the <hi>Romaines? Pyrrhus</hi> king of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> to come down into <hi>Italie? Attila,</hi> King of the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> to defie all <hi>Europe?</hi> Truely they would not haue <note place="margin">What was the occasiō the ancients aduentured their liues.</note> taken vpon them such daungerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, onely vpon the wordes of them which were in those dayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent? but because we should so esteem them that should come after.</p>
   <p>Seeing then that wee bee men, and the children of men, it is not a little to bee maruelled at, to see the diuersitie betweene the one and the other: and what cowardnes there is in the hearts of some, and contrarywise what cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in the stomackes of others. For, we see commonly now-adayes, that if there bee tenne of stoute courages, which are desirous with honour to dye, there are ten thousands cowards, which through shamefull pleasures seeke to prolong their life.</p>
   <p>The man that is ambitious, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him most happie, who with much estimation can keepe his renowm, and with little care regard his life. And on the other side, hee that will set by his life, shall haue but in small estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his renowme.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Syrians, Assyrians,</hi> the <hi>Thebanes,</hi> the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> the <hi>Greekes,</hi> the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> the <hi>Romaines,</hi> the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> the <hi>Germains,</hi> and the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> if such Noble-men (as amongst these were most famous) had not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured their liues, by such daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enterprizes, they had neuer got such immortall fame as they had done to leaue to their posteritie.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Sextus Cheronensis</hi> in his third book, of the valiant deedes of the <hi>Romaines</hi> saith, that the famous captaine <hi>Marcus Marcellus</hi> (which was the first of all men that saw the backe of <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the field) was demaunded of one how he durst enter into battell with such a renowmed captaine as <hi>Hanniball</hi> was? To whom he answered: Friend, I am a <hi>Romaine</hi> borne, and a Captaine of <hi>Rome,</hi> and I must daily put my life in hazard for my Countreys sake: for, so I shall make perpetuall my renowme. Hee was demaunded againe, why hee stroke his enemys with such fiercenes, and why hee did so pittifully lament those which were ouercome, after the victory gotten in battell? Hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, the Captaine which is a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and is not iudged to bee a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ought with his owne hand to shed the bloud of his enemies, and also to shed the teares of his eyes. A captaine Romane ought more to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance him of his clemency, then of his bloudy victory.</p>
   <p>And <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> sayeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when a Romane captaine shall bee in the field, hee hath an eye to his enemies, with hope to vanquish thē: but after they bee vanquished: hee ought to remember they are men, &amp; that he might haue been ouercome: For fortune sheweth her selfe in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so common, as in the successes of warre.</p>
   <p>Certainely, these were words well beseeming such a man, and surely wee may boldly say, that all those which
<pb facs="13"/>
shall heare, or reade such things, will commend the wordes which that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane spake: but few are they that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed would haue done the feates that hee did. For, there be many that are readie to praise in their wordes that which is good: but there are fewe that in their workes desire to followe the same.</p>
   <p>Such hearts are vnquiet, and much altered by sight and enuie, that they bare towardes their Auncients which throgh manfulnes attained vnto great triumphs and glorie, let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, what daungers and trauells they passed through, before they came thereto. For, there was neuer Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that euer triumphed in <hi>Rome,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee had first aduentured his life a thousand times in the field, I thinke I am not deceiued, in this that I will say. That is to say, all are desirous to taste of the marrow of <hi>Fame-present:</hi> but none will breake the bone, for feare of <note place="margin">How diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult &amp; hard a matter it is to attaine to true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> perill ensuing. If Honour could bee bought with desire onely, I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, it would bee more esteemed in these dayes of the poore page, then it was in times past, of the valiaunt <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Scipio.</hi> For, there is not at this day so poore a man, but would desire honour aboue all things.</p>
   <p>What a dolefull case is this to see, many gentlemen, and young Knights, become euil disposed vagabonds, and loyterers: the which hearing tel of any famous battell fought: &amp; that many of their estate &amp; profession haue don va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt seates in the same; immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therewith be styrred, and set on fire through <hi>Enuyes</hi> heate: So that in the same furie, they chaunge their robes into armour: and with all speede pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themselues to warre, to exercise the feates of armes. And finally, (like young men without experience) make importunate suite, and obtain licence and money of their Friends to go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the warres. But after that they are once out of their Countreys, and see themselues in a straunge place, their dayes euill and their nights worse: At one time they are commaunded to Skyrmishe, and at an other time, to watch: when they haue victualls, they want lodging: and when the pay day commeth, that pay and the next also is eaten and spent.</p>
   <p>With these and other like troubles and discommodities, the poore young men are so astonyed: especially when they call to minde the goodly wide Hawles, so well hanged and trimmed, wherein they greatly delighted, to passe the time in Summer-season.</p>
   <p>When they remember their great chimneys at home, wherby they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted their old limmes and how they vsed to sit quietly vppon the Sunnie bankes in winter. <hi>For the remembrance of pleasures past, greatly augmenteth the paines present.</hi> Notwithstanding their Parents and friends, had admonished them therof before. And now being beaten with their owne follie, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling these discommodities which they thought not of before: they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to forsake the warres, and eache one to returne home vnto his owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
   <p>But where as they asked licence but once to goe forth, now they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to aske it ten times before they could come home. And the worst is, they went forth loden with money, &amp; returne home loden with vices. But the end why these things are spoken, is, that sage and vertuous men should marke, by what trade the euill dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, seeke to gaine, which is not gotten by gasing on the windowes, but by keeping the frontiers against their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: not with playing at Tables in the Tauernes, but with fighting in the fieldes, not trimmed with cloath of gold or silkes, but loden with armour and weapons: not praunsing their palfreyes, but discouering the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushment: 
<pb facs="14"/>
not sleeping vntill noon, but watching all night: not by aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him of his apparrell and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse, but for his stout coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giousnes: not banqueting his friends but assaulting his enemies: though a knight do these things, yet he ought to consider, that it is vanitie and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse.</p>
   <p>But seeing the world hath placed honour in such a vaine thing, and that they can attaine to it by none other was, the young aduenturous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ought to employ therunto their strength with stout courage, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieue to some great acts, worthy of renowne: For in the end when the warre is iustly begunne, and that in defence of their Countrey, they ought to reioyce more of him that dyeth in the hands of his enemies, then of him which liueth accompanied with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
   <p>It is a great shame and dishonour to men of Armes, and young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telmen being at home, to heare the prayse of them which bee in the wars, for the young Gentlemen ought not to thinke it honour for him to heare or declare the newes of others: but that others should declare the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deedes of him.</p>
   <p>Oh how many are they in the world this day puffed vp with pride: and not very wise which still prate of great renowne, and yet passe their life with small honesty: For our predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors fought in the field with their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but young men now a dayes fight at the table with their tongues. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that all vaine men desire and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to leaue a memory of their vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: yet they ought to enterprise such things in their life, wherby they might winne a famous renowne (and not a perpetuall shame) after their death: For there are many departed which haue left such memory of their works as moueth vs rather to pitty their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, then to enuie their vertue.</p>
   <p>I aske of those that reade, or heare this thing; if they will be in loue with <hi>Nembroth</hi> the first Tyrant? with <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramis,</hi> which sinned with her owne sonne: with <hi>Antenor,</hi> that betrayed <note place="margin">The cruelty of Tyrants heee descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, &amp; layd open.</note>
      <hi>Troy</hi> his countrey: with <hi>Medea,</hi> that slew her children: with <hi>Tarquine</hi> that enforced <hi>Lucretia:</hi> with <hi>Brutus</hi> that slew <hi>Caesar:</hi> with <hi>Sylla,</hi> that shed so much bloud: with <hi>Catilina,</hi> that play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Tyrant in his countrey: with <hi>Iugurtha,</hi> that strangled his brethren: with <hi>Caligula,</hi> that committed incest with his sisters: with <hi>Nero</hi> that killed his mother: with <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> that robbed the Temples: with <hi>Domitian,</hi> that in nothing delighted so much, as by straunge handes to put men to death, and to driue away flyes with his owne hands?</p>
   <p>Small is the number of those that I haue spoken, in respect of those which I could recite: of whom I dare say and affirme, that if I had beene as they, I cannot tell what I would haue done, or what I should haue desired: but this I know, it would haue beene more paines to mee, to haue wonne that infamie which they haue wonne, then to haue loste the life which they haue lost.</p>
   <p>It profiteth him little, to haue his Ponds full of fish, and his parkes full of <hi>Deere,</hi> which knoweth neyther how to hunt, nor how to fish. I meane to shewe by this, that it profiteth a man little to be in great auctoritie, if hee be not esteemed, nor honoured in the same. For to attaine to honour, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is requisite: and to keepe it, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is necessarie. With great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations wise men ought to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise daungerous things. For I assure them they shall neuer winne honour, but where they vse to recouer slander.</p>
   <p>Returning therefore to our matter (puissant Prince,) I sweare and durst vndertake, that you rather desire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall 
<pb facs="14"/>
renowme through death, then any idle rest in this life.</p>
   <p>And hereof I doe not maruell, for there are some that shall alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the prowesses of good Princes, and others which will not spare to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the vices of euill tyrants. For althogh your Imperial estate is much, and your Catholike person deserueth more; yet I beleeue with my heart, and see with these eyes, that your thoughts are so highly bent vnto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturous deedes, and your heart so couragious to set vpon them, that your Maiesty little esteemeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of your predecessors, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of that you hope to gaine to leaue to your successors.</p>
   <p>A Captaine asked <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> (as he declareth in his Commentaries) why he trauelled in the Winter in so hard frost, and in the summer in such extreame heate. Hee aunswered, I will doe what lyeth in mee to doe, and afterward let the fatall destinies doe what they can: For the valiant knight that giueth in battel the onset, ought more to bee esteemed then fickle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune whereby the victory is obtained, since fortune giueth the one, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentur guideth the other.</p>
   <p>These words are spoken like a stout and valiant Captaine of <hi>Rome:</hi> Of how many Princes doe we reade, whom truely I much lament to see, what flatteries they haue heard with their eares being aliue: and to reade what slaunders they haue sustained after their death.</p>
   <p>Princes and greate Lordes should haue more regard to that which is spoken in their absence, then to that which is done in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: not to that which they heare, but to that which they would not heare: not to that which they tell them, but to that which they would not bee told of: not to that which is written vnto them beeing aliue, but to that which is written of them after their death: not to those that tell them lyes: but to those which (if they durst) would tell them truth: For men many times refrayne not their tongues, for that Subiects bee not credited: but because the Prince in his authority is suspected.</p>
   <p>The Noble and vertuous Prince <note place="margin">A mans owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science a iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene truth and lyes:</note> should not flitte from the truth wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of hee is certified, neyther with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and lyes should he suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to bee deceyued: but to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himselfe, and see whether they serue him with truth, or deceyue him with lyes. For there is no better wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and iudge of truth, and lyes, then is a mans owne conscience.</p>
   <p>I haue spoken all this, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your Maiesty might know, that I will not serue you with that you should not bee serued. That is, for to shew my selfe in my Writing a flatterer: For it were neyther meete nor honest, that flatteries into the eares of such a noble Prince should enter: neyther that out of my mouth (which teach the truth) such vaine tales should issue. I say, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee dispraysed for true speaking, then to bee honoured for flattery and lying.</p>
   <p>For of truth, in your Highnesse it should bee much lightnesse for to heare them, and in my basenesse great wickednesse to inuent them.</p>
   <p>Now againe, following our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I say, the Histories greatly doe commend <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> that gaue lawes to the Lacedemonians. <hi>Numa Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius,</hi> that honoured and addor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Churches. <hi>Marcus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> that had pitty and compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on those which were ouercome. <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> that forgaue his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>Octautus</hi> that was so welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of the people.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Alexander</hi> that gaue rewardes and gifts to all men. <hi>Hector</hi> the Troian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb facs="15"/>
hee was so valiant in wars. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> the Thebane, because hee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his strength so well. <hi>Vlisses</hi> the Grecian, because hee aduentured himselfe in so many dangers. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> king of Epirotes, because hee inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so many engines. <hi>Catullns Regulus</hi> because he suffred so many torments. <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperour, because he was father to the Orphanes. <hi>Traianus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he edified sumptuous &amp; goodly buildings. The good <hi>Marcus Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> because he knew more then al they. I doe not say, that it is requisit for one Prince in these dayes, to haue in him all those qualities, but I dare be bolde for to affirme this, that euen as it is vnpossible for one Prince to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all: so likewise it is a great slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for him to follow none.</p>
   <p>Wee doe not require Princes to doe all that they can, but for to apply themselues to do som thing that they ought.</p>
   <p>And I speake not without a cause that which I haue sayde before. For if Princes did occupie themselues as they ought to doe, they should haue no time to be vicious. <hi>Plinie</hi> sayeth in an Epistle, that the great <hi>Cato,</hi> called <hi>Censor,</hi> did weare a Ring vpon his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, wherein was written these words; <hi>Esto amicus vnius, &amp; inimicus nullius:</hi>
      <note place="margin">A poesie which Cato the Censor had engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in his Ring.</note> which is, be friend to one, and enemy to none.</p>
   <p>He that would deepely consider these few words, shall finde therein many graue sentences. And to apply this to my purpose, I say the Prince that would well gouerne his common weale, shew to all equall iustice, desire to possesse a quiet life, to get among all a good fame: and that coueteth to leaue of himselfe a perpetuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, ought to embrace the vertues of one, and to reiect the vices of all: I allow it very wel that Princes should bee equall, yea and surmount and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe many: but yet I doe aduise thē not to employ their force, but to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one: For often times it chanceth that many which suppose themselues in their life to excell all when they are dead, are scarcelie found equall vnto any.</p>
   <p>Though man hath done much, and blazed what he can: yet in the end he is but one, one mind, one power, one birth, one life, and one death. Then sithence hee is but one, let no man presume to know more then one. Of all these good Princes which I haue named in the rowle of iustice, the last was <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> to the intent that he should weaue his webbe: For suppose we reade of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes that haue compiled nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, the which are to bee reade and knowne: but all that <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi> sayde, or did is worthy for to be knowne, and necessary to bee follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I doe not meane this Prince in his Heathen law, but in his vertuous deedes.</p>
   <p>Let vs not stay at his beleefe: but let vs embrace the good that hee did: For compare many Christians with some of the Heathen, and looke how farre we leaue them behind in faith: so farre they excell vs in good and vertuous works. All the olde Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in times past, had some Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to their familiars, as <hi>Alexander Aristotle,</hi> King <hi>Darius, Herodorus: Augustus Pisto, Pompeius, Plauto, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Plinie, Adrian, Secundus, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, Plutarchus, Anthonius, Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Theodotius, Claudinus, Seuerus, Fabatus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Finally I say, that Phylosophers then had such aucthoritie in Princes pallaces: that children acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them for Fathers, and Fathers reuerenced them as masters.</p>
   <p>These Wise and Sage men were aliue in the company of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but the good and vertuous <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius</hi> (whose doctrine is before
<pb facs="15"/>
your Maiesty) is not aliue, but dead: Yet therefore that is no cause why his Doctrine should not bee admitted: For it may bee (peraduenture) that this shall profite vs more, which hee wrote with his handes, then that which others spake with their tōgus.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Plutarch</hi> sayeth, in the time of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the great, <hi>Aristotle</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, and <hi>Homer</hi> was dead. But let vs see how hee loued the one, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced the other: for of truth he slept alwayes with <hi>Homers</hi> booke in his <note place="margin">How much Homer was helde in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</note> hands, and waking he read the same with his eyes, and alwayes kept the doctrine thereof in his memory, and layde (when he rested) the booke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his head. The which priuiledge <hi>Aristotle</hi> had not: who at all times could not be heard, and much lesse at all seasons be beleeued: so that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> had <hi>Homer</hi> for his friend, and <hi>Aristotle</hi> for a master.</p>
   <p>Other of these Philosophers were but simple men: but our <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was both a wise Philosopher, and a very valiant Prince: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reason would hee should be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited before others: For as a prince hee will declare the troubles, and as a Philosopher hee will redresse them. Take you therefore (Puisaunt Prince) this wise Philosopher and Noble Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, for a Teacher in your youth, for a Father in your gouernment, for a Captaine generall in your Warres: for a guide in your iourneyes, for a friend in your affayres, for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in your vertues, for a Master in your sciences, for a pure white in your desires, and for equall match in your deedes.</p>
   <p>I will declare vnto you the Life of an other beeing a Heathen, and not the life of an other beeing a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian: For looke how much glory this Heathen Prince had in this world beeing good and vertuous: so much paines your Maiesty shall haue in the other, if you shall bee wicked and vicious.</p>
   <p>Beholde, behold, most Noble, and illustrious Prince, the Life of this Emperour, and you shal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see and perceyue, how cleare hee was in his iudgement, how vpright hee was in his iustice, how circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect in the course of his life, how lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to his friends, how patient in his troubles and aduersities: how hee dissembled with his enemies, how seuere against Tirants, how qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et among the quiet, how great a friēd vnto the Sage, and louer of the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: how aduenturous in his warres, and amiable in peace, and chiefly, and aboue all things, how high in wordes, and prosound in senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
   <p>Many and sundry times I haue beene in doubt with my selfe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the heauenly and eternall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty (which giueth vnto you Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Temporall Maiesty, for to rule aboue all other in power, and authoritie) did exempt you that are earthly Princes, more from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fraylety, then hee did vs that be but Subiects, and at the last I know hee did not.</p>
   <p>For I see euen as you are children of the World, so you doe liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the World. I see euen as you trauell in the Worlde: so you can know nothing but things of the world. I see because you liue in the Flesh, that you are subiect to the miseries of the flesh. I see though for a time you doe prolong your life: yet at the last you are brought vnto your graue, I see your trauel is great and that within your Gates there dwelleth no rest. I see you are colde in the winter, and hote in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. I see that hunger feeleth you, and thirst troubleth you, I see your friendes forsake you, and your enemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es assault you.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="16"/>
I say that you are sadde and do lacke ioy, I see that you are sicke, and bee not well serued. I see you haue much and yet that which you lacke is more.</p>
   <p>What will you see more, seeing that Princes dye: O noble Princes, and great Lords, since you must dye, and become wormes meate, why doe you not in your life time search for good counsell? If the Princes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men commit an errour, no man dare chastice them, wherefore they stand in greater need of aduise and counsell: For the traueller who is out of his way, the more he goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the more hee erreth. If the people doe amisse, they ought to be punished: but if the Prince erre, he should be admonished. And as the Prince will, the people should at his hands haue punishment: so it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that he at their hands should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue counsell.</p>
   <p>For as the wealth of the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on the wealth of the other: so truly if the Prince bee vitious, the people cannot be vertuous. If your Maiesty will punish your people with words, commaund them to print this present worke in their hearts. And if your people would serue your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with their aduise: let them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise beseech you to reade ouer this booke: For therin the Subiects shall finde how they may amend, and you Lords shall see all that you ought to doe, whether this present Worke be profitable or no, I will not that my pen shall declare: but they which do reade it shall iudge.</p>
   <p>For wee Authours take pains to make and translate, and others for vs to giue iudgement and sentence: From my tender yeares vntill this present time, I haue liued in the World, occupying my selfe in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and studying humane and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Bookes: and although I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse my debility to bee such, that I haue not read so much as I might, nor studyed so much as I ought: yet notwithstanding all that I haue read, hath not caused me to muse so much as the doctrine of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>
      <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 span">
            <desc>〈…〉</desc>
         </gap> of Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius.</note> hath, sith that in the mouth of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, God hath put such a great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
   <p>The greatest part of all his works were in Greeke: yet hee wrote also many in Latine. I haue drawn this out of Greeke through the helpe of my friends, and afterwards out of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine into our vulgar toung by the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell of my hands.</p>
   <p>Let all men iudge what I haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in drawing it out of Greeke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Latine, out of the Latine into the vulgar, and out of a plaine vulgar into a sweete and pleasant Stile: For that banquet is not counted sumptuous, vnlesse there be both pleasant meates and sauoury sauces.</p>
   <p>To call sentences to minde, to place the wordes, to examine langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to correct sillables: What swet I haue suffered in the hote summer, what bitter colde in the sharpe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what abstinence from meats when I desired for to eate, what watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the night when I would haue slept: What cares I haue suffered in stead of rest that I might haue enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Let other proue, if mee they will not credit.</p>
   <p>The intention of my painefull tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, I offer vnto the diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty vpon my knees, and to your Highnesse (most Noble Prince) I present this my worke, and do most humbly beseech the omnipotent and eternall GOD, that the Doctrine of this Booke may bee as profitable vnto you, and to the common wealth in your Life, as it hath beene vnto me tedious, and hinderance to my health: I haue thought it very good to offer to your Maiestie, the effect
<pb facs="16"/>
of my labours, though you peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will little regarde my paines: for the requiring of my travell, and rewarde of my good will. I require nought else of your Highnesse, but that the rudenesse of my vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the basenesse of my Stile, the smalnesse of my eloquence, the euill order of my sentences, the vanity of my words, bee no occasion why so excellent and goodly worke should bee little regarded: For it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that a good Horse should bee the lesse esteemed, for that the Rider knoweth not how to make him runne his carrere.</p>
   <p>I haue done what I could doe; do you now that you ought to doe, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to this present worke grauity, and to mee the Interpretor thereof authority.</p>
   <p>I say no more, but humbly doe beseech God to maintaine your esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and power in earth: and that you may afterward enioy the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Diuine presence in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
