                 <title>The new-found politicke : Disclosing the secret natures and dispositions as well of priuate persons as of statesmen and courtiers; wherein the gouernments, greatnesse, and power of the most notable kingdomes and common-wealths of the world are discouered and censured. Together with many excellent caueats and rules fit to be obserued by those princes and states of Christendome, both Protestants and papists, which haue reason to distrust the designes of the King of Spaine, as by the speech of the Duke of Hernia, vttered in the counsell of Spaine, and hereto annexed, may appeare. Written in Italian by Traiano Boccalini ... And now translated into English for the benefit of this kingdome</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He kinde welcome which these <hi>Raggualioes
of Boccalini</hi> lately found among the <hi>French</hi>
and in other <hi>Princes Courts,</hi> who suspect
the incroaching power of the <hi>House of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi>
hath moued me to collect and consecrate them in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
weeds vnto your <hi>Maiestie.</hi> The <hi>First</hi> was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by <hi>M. Florio,</hi> sometime Seruant to your <hi>Royall
Mother</hi> of blessed memory. The <hi>Second</hi> by one, vnto
whom the common-wealth cannot as yet be beholding for
his name; And the <hi>Third part</hi> by me, although farre infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
vnto either of them for any knowledge which I dare
arrogate to my selfe in the <hi>Italian Tongue,</hi> hauing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued
the vse thereof since my returne out of <hi>Italie,</hi>
being aboue 24. yeeres past, vntill this present time. Yet
neuerthelesse, when I had fully perused the noueltie of the
<hi>Authors</hi> straine, the pleasant conceits of the worke, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced
with some matters of consequence, which might
serue for caueats and annotations to such as stand inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essed
in <hi>State-affaires,</hi> I was encouraged to renew that
which I had so long neglected, and by compiling some of
the choisest Obseruations, to present them to your iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
view. And because my chiefest cares for many yeeres
<pb facs="3"/>
haue beene fixt vpon that most hopefull Plantation in the
Iland commonly called <hi>The New-found Land,</hi> I entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
this Worke <hi>The New-found Politicke,</hi> as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of my affection deuoted to that place, as for the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the stile and matter, wherein the Author poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
discouers some <hi>Mysteries of Policie,</hi> which may
rowze vp the Spirits of the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> and other
Neighbouring Prouinces, to watch with <hi>Argus Eyes,</hi> lest
the deceitfull shew of <hi>Indian Gold,</hi> a fitter bait for
<hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moores,</hi> might produce any sudden Innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
preiudiciall to the libertie of <hi>Christendome,</hi> which
ought to flourish in mutuall loue and charitie, and not to
liue in continuall iealousies to be surprized by any <hi>Prince</hi>
that acknowledgeth <hi>Christ</hi> for their vniuersall <hi>Head.
The King is wise as is the Angell of God,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues
more than it becomes a man of my ranke to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
to so high a <hi>Maiestie</hi> concerning the Affaires of long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed
<hi>Princes,</hi> whom Experience, and not the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a contemplatiue Scholar, hath taught to remember
that Verse of the Poet:
<q>
         <l>Tunc tua res agitur paries cùm proximus ardet:</l>
         <l>When the next wall vnto your house doth burne,</l>
         <l>Looke to your selfe betimes; next is your turne.</l>
      </q>
      <hi>The King of Kings</hi> long preserue your <hi>Maiestie</hi> in all
Earthly happinesse, to his glory, our comfort, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the true <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> So praieth from the
bottome of his heart</p>
