      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause there go many and diuers reports of the late conflict in <hi>Ireland,</hi> proceeding of sundry Letters sent ouer, which, although they agree in effect and substaunce of the matter, yet haue not euery one the same, nor any one the whole circumstaunce of the manner thereof: And hauing considered how that it is not onely vsuall among the people, to be desirous to know newes, but also necessary that this happy newes should be knowen vnto all (aswell to the true religious and obedient subiect, for his comfort, as to the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticious disloyall recusant, for his vtter dismaying and confusion): I haue thought it not amis to bestow some light paines of my little leisure, in gathering one sound discourse out of those sundry fragments which haue come to my hands, some presented vnto me in writing out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and some imparted vnto me (by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisements of men of good credit) out of those letters which were sent vnto her Maiestie, the true collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof I present vnto the well affected Reader, in such order as the time would serue me to dispose them.</p>
