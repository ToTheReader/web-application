   <head>AN EPISTLE To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, the causes that have moved mee to put forth this short writing, are cheifly three; the first, the glory of the Lord my God,<note place="margin">Lev. 19.2. 1 Pet. 1.15.16.</note> who as he is holy, so dooth he require that all his people should be holy, in all manner of conversation: and that all those that call upon the name of Christ should depart from iniquity. <hi>2 Tim. 2.19.</hi> The second, the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent desire which I have of the salvation of mens soules, &amp; gayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them unto God; the means whereof being,<note place="margin">Iam. 5.19.20.</note> in shewing unto them their erring from the truth, and to convert them from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing astray, out of the way. The third, is in respect of my self; for having had a hand both in the translating and printing of M. B. book, and there being in it, as I am fully perswaded, &amp; as by the grace of God I shal shew, out of the holy scriptures, errors and abberations from the truth of the living God; If I had held my peace and sayd nothing, I could not have cleared my self from partaking with other mens synns; and so should have done, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto that holy commandement of the Apostle to Timothy.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.22</note>
   </p>
   <p>To the end therfore, that the reader may the better perceive the thing intended in this writing, namely, how corruptly Mr. Brightman, dooth teach, not to separate frō the Church of Engl. notwithstanding all the corruptions which he shewes to be in her; this is the order that I shall observe, to wit, that first I will set down some of the particulars wherby he blames that Church of England, for partaking with the corruptions and manner of government of Antichrist. Secondly I shall shew some of the praises, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding these corruptions, he gives vnto the same. And thirdly what is the collection or conclusion that he gathers therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which having done <hi>I</hi> shal also declare my mind concerning these things. And thus (Christian Reader) I shall cōmit the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, or censuring of all, to thy godly wisdom, grounded upon the canon and holy writings of the holy Prophets and Apostles. Fare well.</p>
