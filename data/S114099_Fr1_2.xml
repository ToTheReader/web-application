      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing compiled this little Treatise, at the motion of a priuate friend, most especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for his benefit and mine owne comfort, once an entrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made into the matter: I found so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie good and profitable lessons, naturally to arise from this so excellent a subiect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a most absolute forme of prayer, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the blessed mouth of Christ our Sauiour, vnto his disciples, at his instant request, I thought it could not, but be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie profitable to others, as I finding the meditation hereof so sweete vnto my
<pb facs="3"/> selfe. Now this serious cogitation was a strong motiue vnto me, to publish that abroad, which I thought to keepe priuate to my selfe and to my friend; who first mooued me to take in hand this taske, to which so much the rather I condiscended: being instantly vrged therevnto, by some of my very friends, to whom I imparted the sight of this small worke: affirming that our knowledge should not be inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed within the narrowe bounds of our owne brest, but to be extended, as much as is possible, to the benefit of others. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many vigilant watchmen ouer Christes flocke, and industrious labourers in his great haruest: haue taken great paines in the vnfoulding the misteries of this most perfect platforme of prayer, without doubt to the benefit of the church) yet I know, it is not a thing super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous (as it may seeme to some) but most necessarie in these times, to refresh the memorie of their learned labours. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though praier be a daily exercise amongst vs, yet the number is very small that know
<pb facs="3"/> to performe this holy action with true sincerity. So that indeedo, that which should be a shield vnto them to defend from the assaults of our olde enemie: is a iust cause to make the Lord to vnsneath his two-edged sword against them. Some are so nousled in securitie, that they offer vp the calues of their lippes, as <hi>Caine</hi> did his sacrifice, that is by hands of others, and thinke all is well, if they giue a consent with their voice to a generall prayer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God knoweth, their hearts are wandring abroad at that instant; others haue a zeale, but it is without vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so that they know not how to pray aright, nor to whom to pray as they ought; but like the <hi>Athenians,</hi> worship an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne God, and others are so besotted with a blinde deuotion, that they thinke their prayers cannot be sanctified, vnlesse they be holyed with Popish reliques. All these things with many more duly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it is as cleare as the light, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth euery true Christian, (so farre as it shall please God to enhable him) to labor
<pb facs="4"/> to remoue these impediments. And albeit I humbly acknowledge my selfe to be one of the meanest among my bretheren to vndergoe this labour, yet seeing it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Lord, by weake meanes, to bring mighty things to passe, whereby his glory shineth the brighter. I was not discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to employ my small talent, which it hath pleased him to bestow on me, to the benefit of others, (I hope,) aswell as of my selfe. And as I wish it may be to the glory of God, and the vniuersall good of all, so more perticulerly, to the comfort of you my very good friends and louing countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whome I haue chosen, as patrons of my small worke, aswell to testifie my gratefull minde towardes you, as that by your protection it might the better be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, from the malicious tongues of such as shall carpe against it: being fully resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of your fauourable acceptance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I know you are religious obseruers of this diuine exercise, and well instructed in the word of God, which is our true Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot to direct our course aright. In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb facs="4"/> of this short, but most absolute and sweete prayer, of which our Sauiour Christ Iesus, is the author, and therefore is vsually named the Lords prayer: I haue followed the Hebrew text, especially for three respects. First, because it is the natiue tongue of the Gospell, wherein this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was first penned: secondly, because more necessarie, more significant, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly lessons are naturally to be learned from the holy Hebrew words, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered by themselues, then from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther language. Thirdly, I was instigated to take this course by the examples of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers famous and learned doctors, namely that learned and reuerend Doctor <hi>Saint Ierome,</hi> deuine <hi>Theophilact, Simon Grineus,</hi> and <hi>Sebastian Munster,</hi> and many others, both old and new writers, who follow the Hebrew text of this Gospell, and may be vnto me as strong defensiue Bulwarkes, against such as might happily impeach this maner of proceeding. But if it shall please God to reueale to any other a more expedite course, let him in Gods name,
<pb facs="5"/> with a good conscience vse his owne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie; It shall suffice me amongst the rest to bring somewhat to the building of the Lords spirituall Temple, be it neuer so meane, so it doe serue for the edification thereof. But to auoide tediousnesse, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing least I haue offended already in this respect, I commit you and all the rest of my louing friends and Country-men to the protection of the omnipotent, and onely wise God, and my labours whatsoeuer, to his good blessing.</p>
