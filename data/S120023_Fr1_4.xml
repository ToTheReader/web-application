      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE wise man in the Prouerbes sayth, <hi>He that medleth with a strife that belongeth not vnto him, is as one that taketh a dog by the eares. Prou. 26.17. Theagenes</hi> was laughed to scorne of all, because he would be medling in euery matter, and trying mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries with euerie one in running, wrastling, fencing; <hi>as though it were not lawfull for any to haue the victory where he was present.</hi>

         </gap>.</note> Lest therefore I might be thought to be busie in other mens matters, and to intermeddle where I need not, to speake in a cause where I was not retained, and to defend a wrong where I was not iniured: first mine answer is this, that the defence of the truth belongeth to all: as an iniurie offered to the bodie, euery member is readie to propulse; and an enemie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uading the countrey, it is euery mans part to resist. <hi>Hierome</hi> wel saith: <hi>Feci vt hostes ecclesiae, mei quo{que} hostes fierent; I alwaies endeuored that the enemies of the Church should also become mine enemies. Augustine</hi> also saith,<note place="margin">
         <hi>August. Hier. Epist. 9.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabiliter pulchrior est veritas Christianorum, quàm</hi> Helena <hi>Graecorum: The veritie of the Christians is farre more faire then</hi> Helene <hi>of the Grecians</hi>: We ought therefore more to striue for it, then they did for the other. Beside, I haue not held vp my shield at a shadow, no man striking me; or made answer, where no man called me; or run forward, no man thrusting me:<note place="margin">
         <hi>p. 63. l. 11. p. 88 l. 15. p. 119. l. 15</hi>
      </note> for in three seuerall places it hath pleased this Popes champion to challenge me: and so hath to my thinking bid me the base, and cast downe his gauntlet for me to take it vp. I considered that it was not fit in this case to do as children,<note place="margin">

      <hi>that being stricken, do lay their hands vpon the sore place and crie</hi>: but to requite him with the like that first gaue the aduēture, &amp; to returne the smart of the blow vpon his face that first bent his

fist.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Hieron. ad Theoph.</hi>
      </note> I say therefore with <hi>Hierome, Si superbum sit respondis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, multò sit superbius accusasse: If it be thought an insolent part to answer, it is much more to accuse</hi>: and he is iudged contentious, not which preuenteth a further mischiefe, but first prouoketh thereunto. Neither can I conceale, that to this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise I was incited and stirred vp by the reuerend Lord Bishop of London, by whose aduise and counsell I addressed my selfe thereunto:<note place="margin">
         <hi>De 5. Haeres. 1.</hi>
      </note> saying with <hi>Augustine, Ad compellendum non potest esse molestus exactor, quando ad reddendum deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus est debitor: The exactor is not troublesome in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, when the debtor is willing in rendring.</hi> I haue hitherto shewed the motiues that induced me to this worke: now also I will briefly declare what I haue done. I haue discouered in this treatise aboue two hundred vntruths and slaunders, by this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller without al conscience forged, &amp; without all modestie vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: I haue answered all the politicke obiections, by him cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly against the Protestants faith deuised: I haue his owne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, wherewith he would haue battered ours, vpon his owne forts returned. The businesse (I thanke God) was not great, which I found in the vnfolding of this Alogicall (I should say, Apologicall) Epistle. But as <hi>Caesar</hi> said of a certaine citie, which <hi>at the very first view he ouercame, Veni, vidi, vici: I came to it, I saw it, I tooke it</hi>: so may I say with <hi>Hierome, Sententias eius prodidisse, superasse est: The very laying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen of his sayings, is a sufficient confutation.</hi> His obiections required no long time to answer: to refell his arguments, it was sufficient to see them: and to ouerthrow his cause, it was enough to open his book. And as <hi>Lueullus</hi> said of his enemies, that came against him in compleat harnesse:<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note>
      <hi>That it would be more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to spoyle them, then to foyle them:</hi> so had I as much a do to collect his reasons, as to confute thē. The gaining of diuerse peeces of this book which were negligently lost, was more trouble to me, thē the first framing of that which I had carefully writtē.</p>
   <p>Now I haue also the more willingly thrust my selfe into this businesse, to make knowne to the people of God, the Lords vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable goodnesse towards vs, who hath giuen vs a Prince resolued to professe in himselfe and protect in vs the same faith of the Gospell, which was by Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> maintained: that still
<pb facs="14"/>
we may exercise our pens against the common aduersarie. Of his Maiesties raigne we may truly pronounce, as the Prophet of <hi>Salomons: In his dayes shall the righteous flourish. Psal. 72.7.</hi> All those shall be sure, we verily trust, to liue in peace and enioy his fauour, that loue the truth and follow righteousnes. God hath sent vs another <hi>Theodosius,</hi> of whō <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith: <hi>Cùm omnes homines vobis militent, tum ipsi vos omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenti Deo, &amp; sacrae fidei militatis: As al men do war &amp; fight for you, so you for Almightie God and the sacred Faith.</hi>

      <hi>Phocion</hi> being asked of the Orators, what benefit he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon the city: <hi>None but this</hi> (saith he) <hi>that while I was gouernor, none of you had cause to make a funeral Oratiō</hi>:<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> So I trust, that Religion hath gotten such an honourable patron, that Preachers the Orators of Christians, shall haue no cause to mourne for the persecution, trouble and imprisonment of such as professe the Gospell, as in former times of persecution vnder Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish tyranny, but to reioyce in the peaceable fruition of the Gospel. And how much are we to ioy in so Christian a Prince, who doth not onely publickely professe himselfe to be no Papist:<note place="margin">

      </note> but hath declared so sound a iudgement in some questions contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersed among Protestants, that we may all frō his princely mouth take out a new lesson, and learne to reforme our erroneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits? Our kingly <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> saith, <hi>That all that is necessarie to saluation, is contained in the Scriptures,</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. p. <hi>19:</hi> otherwise <hi>then some haue affirmed, that the light of nature and the light of Scripture ioyntly, not seuerally, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat to saluation:</hi> for hence it followeth, that the Scripture se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally and alone is not compleate to saluation.</p>

      <hi>if we would neuer swarue from the analogie of faith in expounding:</hi> as Scripture is interpreted by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so the Scripture is drawne by Scripture, not by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Church. <hi>Beware to beleeue with the Papists the Churches authoritie, better then your owne knowledge.</hi>

      </note> How say some then, <hi>that the word cannot possibly assure vs, that we do well to thinke that it is the word of God?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>No man is able to keepe the law or any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> as the Apostle saith:<note place="margin">

      <hi>That which was impossible to

How can a man do more, and God approue more then is commaunded</hi> (as some haue taught) if we come farre short of that which is commaunded?</p>
   <p>
      <hi>If</hi> Faith onely iustifieth, as Protestants hold, and <hi>since we could not be saued by doing, we might at the least be saued by beleeuing:</hi>

      </gap>. p. <hi>8.</hi> how then can our workes be any meanes to blot out sinne, or to procure pardon?</p>
   <p>
      <hi>If</hi> it be the property of faith to apply the promises: <hi>(for faith is a sure perswasion and apprehension of the promises of God, applying them to our soule. p. 11.</hi> as the Apostle saith: <hi>By grace are ye saued through faith. Eph. 2.8.)</hi> how can the Sacraments giue grace, and be causes of Iustification, and as necessarie in their place as beliefe it selfe?</p>
   <p>If <hi>whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne▪ Rom. 14.23. <gap reason="foreign">

      </note>If the Pope be Antichrist, <hi>and the head of a false &amp; hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical Church:</hi> how then cā the Church of Rome be the family of Christ? I hope Antichrist the head of that false Church, is no member of the Church of Christ, or belonging to his family.</p>
   <p>Thus in these and diuers other such questions, wherein we haue bin distracted, our princely <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> as another <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> that decided the controuersies betweene the Christian Bishops, hath taken vp the strife: like as <hi>Archidamus</hi> being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen an vmpire betweene two, brought them to the temple, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them not to depart till they were agreed. If there yet be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining any question or controuersie in our Church, let his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie iudge betweene vs: his Catholicke and Christian iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may reduce vs to vnitie and consent in religion. I say then with S. <hi>Paul:</hi>

      <hi>Let vs therefore as many as are perfect be thus minded; and if we be otherwise minded, God shal reueale the same vnto vs. Augustine</hi> saith wel to <hi>Hierome: Quiesca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ab his cōtētionib. nostre vitae saluti{que} parcamus; minus certè assequatur illa, quae inflat, dum nō offendatur illa, quae
<pb facs="15"/>
aedificat: Let vs cease from these contentions, and fauour our life and health; let that which puffeth vp be amended, while that which edifieth be not offended.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now to such as haue a long time stood out, and refused to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Church of England, I would exhort them now at the length to be wiser, and not to suffer themselues any longer to be abused by that Romish generation, of whom that saying of the Prophet is true: <hi>Qui ducunt, seducunt vos; They that guide you, beguile you. Isay. 3.12.</hi> The variance and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that hath bin of late between your false teachers, the igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Friers and Seminary priests, doth shew that they seeke not you, but themselues: you may say of them as <hi>Tully</hi> of <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> that were fallen out: <hi>Nosse se quem fugere, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare quem sequi debeat; That he knew whom to shun, but not whom to follow.</hi>

Remember that our Sauiours coate was not rent of the souldiers; but you see the falling out of brethrē, &amp; reioyce at it: imitate</hi> Ionas <hi>&amp; say, If this tēpest be because of me, take me and cast me into the sea.</hi> I do not wish these seditious sect-masters of Rome to be cast into the sea; but I wold haue them cast out of the land, and sent ouer the sea, that our Church be no more troubled with them.

   <p>Come then Gentlemen and louing countrimen, let vs go vp to Gods house together; beware hereafter of the Pharisies leauen: <hi>Let them alone,</hi> they be <hi>blind leaders of the blind. Mat. 13.14.</hi> Why should you pin your faith vpon the Popes sleeue? hath not the Apostle said: <hi>Ye are bought with a price, be not the seruants of men. 1. Cor. 7.23?</hi> See you not how that <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> of Rome seeketh his owne glorie and dignitie: and would make kings and Princes his vassails and subiects? <hi>Hierome</hi> said well: <hi>Si pacem habere non potest cum fratre, nisi cum subdito, ostendit se non tam pacem cupere,</hi>
