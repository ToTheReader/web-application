in the suffrage of some learned, and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Gentlemen when it was presented, nor shall they find cause I hope in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsall, to repent them of their good opinion of it. If the grauity and height of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject distaste such as are onely affected with Iigges, and ribaldrie (as I presume it will,) their condemnation of me, and my Poem, can no way offend me: my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son teaching me such malicious, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant detractors deserue rather cöntempt, then satisfaction. I euer held it the most perfit birth of my <hi>Minerua</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in justice offer it to those that haue best deseru'd of me, who I hope in their courteous acceptance will render it worth their receiuing, and euer, in their gentle construction of my imperfections, beleeue they may at their pleasure dispose of him, that is wholly, and sincerelie</p>
