                 <title>A bevvayling of the peace of Germany. Or, A discourse touching the Peace of Prague, no lesse unhappily than unjustly concluded at Prague in Bohemia, the 30. of May, 1635 : Wherein the subtilties and practises of the Austrians, the weakenesse of the Saxons, the dangers of the protestants, and the justnesse of the warre, deservedly set on foot by the French and Swedes, are most evidently declared. Written in Latine by Iustus Asterius, otherwise Stella, a Germane, now one of the advocates in the Court of Parliament of Paris, and historiographer to the French King. Faithfully translated out of the Latine copie. Whereunto is prefixed a briefe summarie of the treaty of peace concluded at Prague, as aforesaid, &amp;c. Published by authority</title>

   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost venerable is the name of Peace; the plentie it brings, is comfortable; and the happinesse of it, most desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; the possession of it, is ever blessed; and the granting of it, at all times to be laboured for. Certainely, I cannot imagine any mortall man to be so void of humanitie, that he would envie a Rest so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to the Empire, so beneficiall to the Countrey; as being that, without which neither private families, nor publike Lawes, nor the right of common societie can subsist. I cannot suppose any man to be so barbarous and savage, that, all other circumstances and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being alike, will preferre a Souldiers Coat before a Gowne, Warre before Peace; when as in this change and vicissitude of affaires, by businesse and labour, is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ease; by troubles, rest; and by Armes, love and concord. But where libertie and the safetie of the Common-wealth is pretended, and servitude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction intended; where a most unjust and trecherous Combination, is veiled with the glorious name of a Peace; where, under a pretext of Rest, the restlesse Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier doth ransack and spoile mens habitations; and lastly, where a deceitfull Condition of Mercie is a Bait
<pb facs="22"/> to draw on insulting Power: every wise man will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre even a doubtfull Warre, before a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> Peace; uncertaine safetie, before a certaine destruction; and an unsworne condition of slaverie, before a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Soveraigntie. I confesse, that nothing can happen to miserable <hi>Germanie,</hi> either more certaine, for her safetie, more noble, for her glory; or more to be wished, for the recoverie of her former felicitie; then, if by consent of the Princes, and Pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ie of the Nobles, it may be restored to her ancient concord, and now almost quite forgotten tranquillitie: And that no lesse Honour should be gained to that Emperour, who with the sweet Bond of Peace should reduce to unitie his Countrey, exhausted with slaughters and butcherie; his peoples, enraged and made furious with the injuries of former times, and like Savages exercising their Cruelties upon their owne Bowels; then there was Divinitie ascribed to him, who first joyned together in one Body so many Nations, no lesse different in manners and disposition, then in situation of Climates; and by communion of Lawes and Customes, made them the most flourishing Common-wealth of <hi>Europe.</hi> But lamentable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence proclaimes, that by that agreement or transaction of <hi>Prague,</hi> hatreds were not mitigated, but inflamed; Armes not layd downe, but doubled; proscription and confiscations not diminished, but extended beyond all Law and right. For after that, in the very frontispice of the businesse, forraine Princes were at the first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; in the progresse thereof, most of the Castles, Cities, and Countreyes of <hi>Germanie,</hi> were divided amongst the great men; the rest, that were weaker in
<pb facs="22"/> strength, not in cause, being proscribed, were stripped out of their Hereditarie Iurisdictions; the spoiles of the Provinces, the bootie and pillage of the banished, and the goods of the slaughtered, were distributed to such as did applaud the action. Next after that, for the confirming and maintaining of these Vsurpations, and Armie of <hi>do</hi> Regiments was imposed upon <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie;</hi> and, as if the Lawes and Courts of Iustice did abhorre this Pacification, the Businesses of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Chamber and holy Consistorie were left altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther undecided. No comfort or ease at all appeared from this Peace, nor the last fruit of a publike Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie; but in stead thereof, an unappeasable Warre is denounced against all, that had or should dare to complaine of the injuries offered, or so much as to whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the unjustnesse of this Conspiracie. Nothing was here done, that was fit to be done in a lawfull Peace: the former Contributions of the States, the pilling and spoiling of the Countreyes, the burthens and oppressions of the subjects were not taken away, nor so much as mitigated, but excessively encreased, establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by publike Edict; and of Souldiers payes, that were extraordinarie, and without order, were made ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie taxations. Barbarous Nations were not carried away, nor cast out of the Empire, but made to overflow it like a deluge, and let in by multitudes at the gates, set wide open. And I need not stick to say, that Cities were emptied of their Citizens, the very Deserts filled with fugitives, the goods of men and Cities, of a knowne and well-approved innocencie, confiscated, their persons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded, and their lives rated at high summes of money.
<pb facs="23"/> So that it is more cleare then the Noone-day, that in this foresaid transaction, it was not so much laboured to relieve the sinking fortunes of the Countrey, as it was by all meanes endevoured, that the remaining States of the Empire should be deluded with the name of a Peace; that the remaining strength of the <hi>Protestants</hi> should succour then afflicted condition of the <hi>Austrians;</hi> that the common Armes should with their whole power be turned against Rebels (as they call them) and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: and so in stead of concord, to have discord; in stead of truth, trecherie; and in stead of a iust Warre, a most wicked and detestable one to be undertaken: and that so much of <hi>Germanie</hi> as was alive, or had a being left, after eighteene yeares troubles; should be quite brought to ruine, by a foure moneths pacification indeed, the fates of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> growing now towards a declination, fortune could bring to passe no greater thing for them, then the discord of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Nothing could happen more acceptable to the Eagles, a good while since beginning to stoope, then to be enabled to breake those in pieces, being separated, whom they stood in feare of, being united; and now to beguile, with the pretext of a deceitfull peace, those whom hitherto they could not conquer with force<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Armes. And it was an act of no small merit, with one dash of a Pen to disband such huge Armies; to dissolve so many Leagues made with <hi>Protestants,</hi> and so solemnly sworne; to turne the mightiest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie they had, into friends; in stead of adversaries, to get assistants; to cause the <hi>Germane</hi> Faith to be traduced amongst forraine Nations, and esteemed
<pb facs="23"/> perfidiousnesse: and in a word, to bring matters to that passe, that whilest they should singly fight, they should be singly vanquished; and that those who were mightier then others, should enjoy no other privilege, but that of <hi>Ulysses,</hi> to be the first, to be saved for a time, and the last to be devoured in the end.</p>
   <p>The most illustrious Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> was taken in, to have a part in this Treatie, as one though supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in strength, yet inferiour in honourable atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; who, whether through some kinde of emulation, or rather envie of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Victories, I know not, when he saw he could not attaine an equall share of honour with them, chose rather to be an Enemie, and an Vndoer, then a fellow-sharer and a Debtor to those that were his defenders: And by this meanes, this League was tempered with so much the more disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to him; in regard, that howsoever things fell out, he was sure, that by helping and assisting others, he should derive the whole weight of the <hi>Germane</hi> Warre upon himselfe and his subjects. Certainely, nothing could happen more satisfactorie to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours desires, then to withdraw that massie burthen of Warre, under which his Countreyes did long since even gaspe and groane, and to lay the greatest part thereof upon the shoulders of the principall Elector; making this undoubted inference to himselfe, that whether he were conquered, or did conquer, he should both wayes triumph over his Enemies. So the Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation long laboured for, being at the last obtained, to the end, that he might oblige all the particular Princes by private benefites, and by participation of
<pb facs="24"/> spoiles turne Enemies into friends, he bestowed upon the Elector of <hi>Saxonie</hi> (besides the Revenues of the Church, usurped by him for the space of above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres) the Marquisat of <hi>Lusatia;</hi> and upon his sonne, the Archbishoprick of <hi>Magdeburgh;</hi> upon the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Prince <hi>Palatines</hi> Electorship, and the Citie of <hi>Donawerth;</hi> upon the Prince of <hi>Brandeburgh,</hi> the reversion of the Inheritance of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meranie;</hi> and upon the Prince of <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> that of the Duchie of <hi>Brunswick;</hi> and hath granted unto the Dukes of <hi>Mechelburgh,</hi> peaceable possession of their Countrey, which they had formerly obtained by the <hi>Swedish</hi> power. He hath taken unto himselfe the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditarie right to the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the Provinces united to it, <hi>Silesia, Moravia, &amp;c.</hi> as also the Supreme Authoritie, in judging Controversies of matters Spirituall and Temporall, and the particular Dominion of <hi>Philipsbourgh.</hi> He hath retained in his hands for the King of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> the absolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over all the Armies of <hi>Germanie;</hi> and for his younger sonne, the Bishoprick of <hi>Halberstad:</hi> And for the other Princes, as they seemed inferiour, though not in right, yet in power (as the <hi>Palatines,</hi> the <hi>Hassians,</hi> and those of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>) he commanded, that some of them should prostrate themselves as humble suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, to obtaine mercie; and others he put into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret List of proscribed men, and excluded from all hope of pardon, or benefit of the <hi>Amnestia;</hi> induced thereunto by no stronger motive then this, that with the estates and spoiles of the dispossessed, he might reward those who had either formerly done him, or lately promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="24"/> him their faithfull service. The forces of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire being by this meanes united, he denounced a most deadly Warre against the <hi>French,</hi> under pretence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering <hi>Lorraine;</hi> and against the <hi>Swedish,</hi> under colour of vindicating the <hi>Germane</hi> libertie: moved thereunto by no other consideration, but because those two Kingdomes had hitherto cast in the way fatall rubbes, to hinder the <hi>Austrian</hi> Greatnesse and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Monarchie.</p>
   <p>They say, that the <hi>Roman Triumviri,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Dion. Histor. lib. 46. p. 335.</note> to the end that they might purchase the favour of the people unto their proscription, (a thing before that time not heard of) did draw on the great men, partly by the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions of the slaine, partly by the great Offices and Priesthoods of the dead; that they obliged the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with the Patrimonies of the conquered, and with provisions of Victuals to be supplyed from the Cities, without Money: that they fined the Citizens at a Tenth of their Countrey Mannors and Farmes, and at a halfe part of their other Revenues; recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it as a speciall favour done to those, of whom a tenth part of their Revenue was so exacted, though they had not so much as a tenth part of their estate left.</p>
   <p>But this furie was confined within particular Walls; the bounds of one Citie, did prescribe limits to these slaughters; and the safetie of all, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with the butcherie of a few. Here, all the Citizens and Subjects, all the Provinces are in the same danger; no Citie, no Countrey, no Citizen is
<pb facs="25"/> exempt from the miserie of Warre; no corner of all <hi>Germanie,</hi> where the Rapines of Souldiers have not accesse: The Confederates, as well as the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, are oppressed with excessive Contributions; and as if in this eighteene yeeres Warre, bloud enough were not yet shed in <hi>Germanie,</hi> the Armes that are still bloudie with the slaughter of our friends and allyes, are transported into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sweden.</hi> And yet notwithstanding, what labour soever had beene used by mans industrie, and whatsoever Envie can endeavour for the destruction of Innocents, the justice of the common Cause remaines invincible; there hath hitherto neither wanted successe to things ill designed, nor an expected event to things very ill undertaken; but the execution of this Peace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines as unhappie, as the Treatie thereof was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just. So perpetually true is that Maxime of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, That fortune is answerable to the designes, the issue conformable to the inventions, and ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell the worst to the counseller. Neither is it to be thought strange, that so unluckie and so unjust a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification hath rather kindled a Warre, then quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched it; when as the authors of it aymed onely at this, to preferre their private ends before the publike good, to purchase their owne securitie with the ruine of others, and make havocke of the safetie of all, for the quiet of a few. And so factious spirits being drawne into contrarie wayes, in stead of an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Peace came forth a particular transaction, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to the Emperour, disgracefull to the
<pb n="1" facs="25"/>
      <hi>Saxon,</hi> trecherous to the <hi>Protestants;</hi> to them that were excluded, voide; and in the censure of Strangers, most shamefull; and as well in regard of them that contracted it, as on their behalfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom it was contracted, of no force or vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie at all.</p>
