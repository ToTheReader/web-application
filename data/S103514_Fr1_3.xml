   <head>TO THE RIGHT VVorshipfull, Maister <hi>Iohn Swynnerton,</hi> Esquire: And to the most vertuous Gentlewoman his Wife: All happines to them &amp; theyrs in this life, and in the life to come hartilie wished.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His excellent Treatise, (right Worshipfull) bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing written in the French tongue, by that honorable and learned Gentleman, <hi>Monsieur du Plessis,</hi> appeareth by his owne words, to be doone for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a mightie Atheist, who stood stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the knowledge of God, &amp; verie deepe disgrace of Religion by him dailie committed. In regard whereof, albeit hee had commended to him his learned labour
<pb facs="3"/>
of the truth of Christian religion, (able enough to stop the impious mouth of any blasphemer whatsoeuer:) yet he was the rather induced this way to deale with him, because by laying open the knowledge of a mans owne selfe, and the seuerall admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble testimonies hee carrieth about with him, Gods omnipotent glory might the more plainly be approoued, the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the soule no way be able to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, nor the truth of Gods religion &amp; his prouidence be at any time doubted of.</p>
   <p>If wee looke vpon any curious picture drawne to the life: wee immediatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that the same was the work of some rare and artificiall Painter. If wee gaze vpon the goodly Monuments and stately erected Pallaces, full of arte, industry, &amp; many exquisite perfections: wee presently apprehend, that some ingenious Maister was the contriuer thereof, and that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a skilfull workman. If discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in censuring of these and such like things, dooth so sway our oppinions: what
<pb facs="3"/>
can wee then say, when beholding the world, and attayning to the knowledge of wonderful thinges therein contained, but that perforce wee must confesse and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, an higher cause and especiall Creator of them all?</p>
   <p>Let vs come then to <hi>Microcosmus,</hi> to the little world man, and enter awhile but into this kinde of consideration. Wee cannot be so absurd and blockish, but that we will graunt he had a beginning, a cause from whence he came, that it was not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for him to make himselfe, but must needes come into the world by the help &amp; meanes of some other.</p>
   <p>This very consideration, guides vs to acknowledge a Father and Mother, frō whose loynes we proceeded, &amp; that from them wee had the benefit of life. Arising thence by further gradations, wee attaine to intelligence of our predicessors, &amp; iudge by them as of our selues: that they had an originall as we had, and were not the first men in the worlde, but ascending vp still
<pb facs="4"/>
from Father to Father, wee shall finde in the end one Father of vs all, &amp; that from him we had our first beginning.</p>
   <p>Concerning that first Father of vs all, hee must also descend of one, or el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e bee eternall, or come of some matter like to God, or at the least be GOD himselfe. Which because he could not be, hee must needes haue some beginning, &amp; be borne after some other sort, then they that did descend of him: wherein what can wee otherwise say, but that the Creator of the whole world must needes be his father? From this beginning wee can climbe no higher, but there of necessity must stay &amp; conclude: that this first Creator of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was without beginning, and because we shall else haue no place to rest at, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse him to be infinite and eternall. Thus the creature leades vs to finde out the Creator, and proceeding from one essence to another, attaines at last to the first es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, endlesse &amp; euerlasting, as the spring and originall of all in generall, to wit, the
<pb facs="4"/>
almightie and omnipotent great God.</p>
   <p>Hauing thus attained to the knowledge of God by the creature, let vs nowe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to learne to know what the creature is: which beeing the whole scope and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Treatise following, I will leaue the whole case to be resolued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as beeing therein handled at full and very learnedly.</p>
   <p>Now my humble sute vnto your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is, that in regarde of some breach of promise, concerning my <hi>Paradox Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> which long since you should haue had, but that the troubles of the time, &amp; misinterpretation of the worke by some in authoritie, was the only cause why it went not forward: that you would please to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this excellent labour, not as in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that former debt, because it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe restored me, shall shortly come to aunswer for it selfe, but rather to looke with the more fauourable regard on this, first for the honorable Frenchmans sake, whose workes doe carry no meane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
<pb facs="5"/>
through the vvorlde: And next, for the vnfained affection I beare you, deuoting my best abilities of studie to your kinde patronage, so please you but to grace them with fauourable acceptance.</p>
   <p>The Treatise against Atheisme, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the same Author, to the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and annexed to this learned labour of his, beeing likewise so lately come to my handes, I will (by Gods assistance) finish with what expedition I may, and entitle it to the kinde entertayner of this former, as beeing a booke most needfull for these times, wherein neuer enough can be sayde or written of that argument, so mightie is the multitude of blasphemous Atheists, and so dangerous their proceedings to Gods high dishonour.</p>
   <p>I am loth to be troublesome by tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to your Worship, because to the wise and iuditiall, I know a word is sufficient: the worke, my selfe, and what I can beside, I prostrate to your gentle interpretation, wishing to you, the vertuous Gentlewoman
<pb facs="5"/>
your wife, &amp; hopefull issue, all those hape<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pie blessings that this worlde can or may affoord, &amp; after the finishing of this frail-terrestriall pilgrimage, a full measure of eternall tranquilitie in the Land of the liuing.</p>
