      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the want of Lawes
occasioneth wrongs to

And want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Lawes carieth men into

themselues a burthen when they
are too many, and their very num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is a cause that few are execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
where Penall Lawes haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
no life, but in their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
And certainely that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate

deserueth better of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
then he that knoweth

Therefore is the Composition of
this Volume, that those few Laws,
and other ordinances being most

executed; Which is required
