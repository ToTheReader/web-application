   <head>TO THE READER</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He reasons be manifold (good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that mooued me to publish thys present Tale. First, that I might (in what I was able) illustrate or make better known to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world, my countrie or place of byrth: to which (as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith) each man doth ow the third part of his life, &amp; for which ther is no good man, but wil ieopard his life, aduenture his safetie, and hazard the dearest things hee dooth possesse: neither yet was there euer any man so brutish, but reioyceth to heare his countrie commended, and is deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when he heareth the same wel spoken off and praised: such is the affection that euery man beareth to it: that <hi>Ouid</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the same, said, he coulde not tel howe it came to passe, nor whence it should proceede. His words be these:
<q>
         <l>Nescio qua natale solum dulcedine cunctos</l>
         <l>Ducit, nec</l>
      </q>
Hence it came to passe that antiquity gaue diuine honor to such as had deserued wel of their countrie: either in peace, by inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting something to the profit or wealth thereof: or in war, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentring their bodies in defence thereof.</p>
   <p>Another reason was, that albeit neither my writing, nor other indeuour whatsoeuer, be able to perfourm any thing that might either beautifie or adorne the places I speake of: Yet hereby I would animate, or encourage those worthy Poets, who haue writtē <hi>Epithalamion Thamesis,</hi> to publish the same: I haue seen it in Latene verse (in my iudgment) wel done, but the Author I know not for what reason doth suppresse it: That which is written in English, though long since it was promised, yet is it not perfourmed: so as it seemeth, some vnhappy Star enuieth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sight of so good a work: which once set abroad, such trifles as these would vanish, and be ouershadowed, much like the Moon and other starres, which after the appearing of the Sunne are not to be seene at all.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, being fully resolued to leaue my country, I held best before my departure <hi>Cigneum aliquid canere:</hi> not vnlike the
<pb facs="3"/>
Swans, who before their death do sing as <hi>Ouid, Uirgil, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, Horace</hi> with all the poets do constantly affyrme. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers say, it is because of the spirit labouring to passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the long and small passage of her necke, makes a noise as if she did sing. <hi>Pithagoras</hi> did thinke their soules were immortal, and saith, how before their death, they reioice and sing as going to a better life. The maner of their singing M. <hi>Thomas Watson</hi> in his <hi>Odes</hi> expresseth thus:
<q>
         <l>Qualis vbi longo moerore Castrius ales confectus senio graui. &amp;c.</l>
      </q>
Which verses <hi>A. F.</hi> hath englished on this wise.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Like to the siluer Swan, who seeing death to be comming,</l>
      <l>Wandreth alone for a while through streams of louely Caister:</l>
      <l>Then to the flowring bankes all faint at last he repairth,</l>
      <l>Singing there sweet bird, his dieng song to Caister:</l>
      <l>Geuing there sweete bird, his last farewell to Caister:</l>
      <l>Yeelding vp, sweet bird, his breath and song to Caister.</l>
   </q>
   <p>The last, and not the least motiue was my friendes request, whose importunate demaund without breach of amitie, I could not gainsay: to whom, as also to thy fauourable construction (curtcous and friendly reader) I commit the same.</p>
