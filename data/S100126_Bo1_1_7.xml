   <p>WHEN you finde, good Reader, any straggling
testimonies of some few forraine Divines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by the formalists, which seeme to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of toleration, consider first that some did
write in the dawning of the day of reformation, and therefore
could not so soone see distinctly and clearly every corruption
which was in the Church, 2. That notvvithstanding of greater
light shining in the Church, after the rising of the Sun aboue our
Horizon, the Divines treating upon many poynts, could not bee
exact in everie one, or intending principally to beat downe such
corruptions as did most assault their owne Churches, no vvonder
that there fell from their pens some sentences not ripely digested
concerning other poynts. 3. That howbeit these had purposely set
themselues to consider the controversies of our Churches, yet not
being throughly acquainted with the particular state of the same,
might giue their iudgment in the generall case, but could not so
vvell in the particular, as many worthy Divines in England haue
done. 4. They vvere but men, and might erre in judgement, and
so appeareth by the vveak reasons subjoyned somtimes to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.
And living in Churches vvhere some corruptions doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
they might the more readily stumble at the like in others.
6. It hath been the practise of the English Prelates from time to
time, and is at this present houre, not onely to offer preferment to
Divines at home, but also to send gifts to forraine Divines, to blunt
at least the edge of their zeale, if they could not make them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
their own, as they haue done some. For proofe of this their
old practise I haue here subjoyned a few lines taken out of the
friendly caveat to B. <hi>Sands,</hi> then Bishop of London, vvritten <hi>ann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

1567.</hi> extant in the book intituled, <hi>The Register.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Although you haue, as much as in you lieth, gone about to win credit,
and as it were to tie the tongues of <hi>Bullinger, Gualter, Zanchius,</hi> and
others with your bribes, which you haue divers times sent them under the
name of friendly tokens and remembrances, yet when they shal be informed
better of more then they were the last time, and confirmed in the former
satisfaction of these two last set forth bookes, as well these that I haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
as divers more wil not bee ashamed, like true and constant professors of
the truth, to answer your L. as <hi>Aristotle</hi> did <hi>Plato,</hi> when he said, <hi>Amicus
Plato, sed magis amica viritas,</hi> that is to say, openly to confesse, not in
privat meeting onely, but in print also, that English ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

and English silver and gold are and shall bee welcome to them, as long as
they are not meant to stop them from the truth against both their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and their printed writings and confessions. Yea if yee will look well
on the matter, <hi>Gualter</hi> hath condemned you and your <hi>splendida Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficalia</hi>
alreadie. For in his last Epistle to you Lords, he denieth not that
those informations, these two that he speaketh of delivered him, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
in the Church: but trusting onely upon your words, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
your coloured lying informations too much, would not credit them
as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o too monstrous things to bee in such a realme, that hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

so good a report for zealousnesse in religion, and to be maintained of such
men, that in time of their banishment, both hee himselfe, and a great sort
more knew to be godlie, learned, and earnest in religion.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>MElanchton</hi> did write in the dawning of the day. <hi>

spirit, and did many things which he did not approue. His
advices in the time of the <hi>Interim</hi> proved pernicious to the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Churches, and grievous to all the godly. Harder things, if
true, are written concerning him. <hi>P. Martyr,</hi> freer in writing after
he had left England then he was before, in a letter to a certaine

         </gap>ullinger</hi> he was of another minde, seeing the scandals which did
arise unavoideably of them, which he did not perceiue before. He
confesseth in another Epistle to a certaine friend there, that he
could not giue full and particular direction not being acquainted
with all the particular circumstances. <hi>Tu autem qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">

ipsa consultetis arena.</hi> Which answer holdeth in other forraine Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.
The Author of this sound Reply, craving the removall or
at least the free use of the ceremonies, and that none be enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
or saying if there Deanes, Canons, and Prebendaries will pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
them in their Cathedrall Churches, they will not contend
with them, providing the Prelates impose them not upon others,
is to be understood to speak onely of the English Church, where
they haue kept possession ever since the Reformation, and as a man
almost despairing of any cure after these fifty yeares contestation
against them, rather then resolving. But all Writers condemn the
reducing of corruptions into a Church, specially after exile of
many yeares. Many worthies haue suffered much for Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
what would they haue done to withstand the re-entry of
Deformation?</p>
