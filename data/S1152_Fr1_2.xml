   <head>TO THE
RIGHT REVEREND
Father in God
WALTER
LORD BISHOP OF
WINCHESTER,
Prelate of the Noble order
of the GARTER, my
singular good Lord
and Patron.</head>
   <head type="sub">Right reverend Father in God,
and my very singular good Lord.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ETting aside
more serious
studies, and
being desirous
to recreate my
selfe with some books of
<pb facs="3"/>
medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it was my good hap
to meet with this litle tract
<hi>Of the Imitation of Christ:</hi>
And having lookt over
some of it, I began to admire
both the plainnesse and the
pythinesse of it; being so
well fitted to the capacity
of the ignorant, and yet not
unworthy the perusall of the
learned, insomuch that I
finde it to be true by mine
own experience, that the
high cōmendations so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have given of it, is not
without just cause. For I
must confesse to the glory
of God and mine own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that I have profited
more in the course of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
by the perusall of
<pb facs="3"/>
this one small book of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
then by turning over
many volumes of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies.
For I found in it
great motives to selfe-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
humility, obedience and
devotion, to humility in our
selves, to obedience towards
superiors, to devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God. I then began
to enquire whether it were
translated or no, and I finde
it is translated into all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
and into english se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
times, yet could none
of these altogether please
me; for I perceaved some of
them to stick too close to
the letter, &amp; others fly too
farre off: I have therefore
taken a litle paines to fit it
<pb facs="4"/>
to our own language and
yet not leave the author too
much. And because the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
thereof was too much
addicted to one side, I made
bold to leave out that which
might offend any Christian
palate, and have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that it should look with
an equall and unpartiall eye
upon all good Christians.
And it were to be wished
that we had more bookes in
this kind, and that we did
especially apply our selves
to such kinde of books; for
men now adaies are immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly
wedded to their
own opinions, they labour
to dispute well, not to live
well, and delight more in
<pb facs="4"/>
books of controversy to
strengthen them on that side
they are, then in books of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
to teach them what
each good Christian should
be.</p>
   <p>So that the admonition
of the Apostle was never
more seasonable then now,
<hi>Let your moderatiō be known
unto all men. Phil.</hi> 4. 5. That
therefore others may be the
better encouraged to peruse
this so plaine and profitable
a booke, I have presumed to
shelter it under your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
gracious protection.
And to whom could I more
fitly dedicate so pious a
worke then to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
in whom humility pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="5"/>
and devotion, joyned
with a singular temper and
moderation are so well met
together. The assured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of all these doth give
great assurance, that you
will favourably accept of
the weak endeavours of</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your Lordships
humbly devoted
