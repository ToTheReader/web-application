   <p>IN calling to my remembraunce (O In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland)
thou coūtrye of my natiuitie, thy
miserable present state, ouerwhelmed
with iniquitie, wherin veritie is exiled,
godlynes secluded, vertue defaced, fidelitie
suppressed, and trueth imprisoned. And on the
other syde, Falshod retayned, lyes imbrased,
impiete cherished, vyce auaunced, Infidelitie
extolled, and vntrueth set at lybertie, wherein
trew relygion is altered into supersticion, the
worde of God into mens traditions, the holy
Sacraments into blasphemous sacrifices and
supersticious Ceremonies, and the trew wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of god into execrable ydolatrie, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in
thy faythful naturall natyf Kyng is chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into a supersticious vnnaturall forreyne
Prince. Thy worthye Maiestrates, Nobilitie
and Rulers, into faynt harted tymerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
ruled of other theyr inferiours. Thy vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelant
Bishoppes and faythfull Ministers,
into greuous wolues and bloudthurstye mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.
<pb facs="3"/>
And thy infinite numbre of Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and faythful Christians, into dissembling
ypocrites, and hollow harted Papistes.) I cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydered
with my selfe what mighte be the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doupted
cause of this so miserable an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note place="margin">Psa. c. vij</note>
for the certaynte whereof I repayred vnto
the worde of God,<note place="margin">Num. 16 ij. esd. ix.</note> the onelye discloser of all
trueth in doutfull matters: wheras notably I
found,<note place="margin">prou. 28.</note> Sinne, to be the vndoupted cause of all
these alterations,<note place="margin">Esa. 3. 13.</note> plagues, and mutacions. For
Sinne was the cause of Adams expulsion out<note place="margin">Ier. 5. 30</note>
of Paradyse,<note place="margin">Ezec. 23.</note> of the ouerflowinge &amp; drowning
of the worlde,<note place="margin">Amo. ix.</note> of the consuming of Sodome &amp;
Gomor with brunstone and fyre,<note place="margin">Dani. ix,</note> of the often
captyuitie and slaughter of the people of god:<note place="margin">Iudi. 5. 8.</note>
sometyme by the Egiptians,<note place="margin">Gene. iij.</note> sometyme by the
Madianites,<note place="margin">Gene. vij</note> Moabites, Amorites, Philisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Assyrians,<note place="margin">Ge. 13. 19</note> Caldians and Babilonians, &amp;
the finall subuersion of Ierusalem by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes.<note place="margin">Iudi. 3. 4 6. 11. 13. iiij. Reg. xvij. xxv.</note>
Euen so is Sinne now the cause that
God taketh awaye the light of his word from
vs, and geueth vs ouer to errour &amp; darkenes.
Sinne is the cause that he hath takē away our<note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note>
vertuous Kinges and Princes,<note place="margin">Lu. 19. 21</note> and in stede of
them hath geuen vs ypocrites to raygne ouer<note place="margin">Amos. 8.</note>
vs.<note place="margin">Ioh. xij.</note> Sinne is the cause that he hath taken away
the hartes of our Nobilitie,<note place="margin">Iob. 18. xxxviij.</note> Counsayl &amp; Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes
in makinge them fayntharted &amp; weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges,<note place="margin">Iob. 34.</note>
being contented to submit theyr neckes
vnder the yocke of straungers.<note place="margin">Dani. iiij</note> Sinne is the
cause that God hath taken away from his peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Esay. iij.</note>
his trew Preachers,<note place="margin">Leui. 26.</note> vertuous Ministers,
and faythfull Shepeherdes,<note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> in geuinge them

ouer into the mouthes of most cruell wolues,<note place="margin">Iere. iiij.</note>
rauening thefes &amp; fugitiue hyrelinges.<note place="margin">1. Reg. 28</note> Sinne
is the cause that God hath sent a dasinge into<note place="margin">Esay. lix.</note>
the heartes of his people,<note place="margin">Iob. xij.</note> to beleue lyes, &amp; not
to credyte the truth: but to grope after vanite,<note place="margin">Iere. vij.</note>
thinking by playing the ypocrites,<note place="margin">Eze. xiij.</note> to kepe the
thinge that they shall moste certaynely forgo.<note place="margin">Naū. iij. ij. Tess. ij</note>
Finally to conclude. Sinne is the vndoubted
cause (as testifieth the scriptures) of al plages<note place="margin">Amos. ix</note>
misfortunes,<note place="margin">Leui. 26.</note> ruynes, mutacions, captiuities,
and destructions.<note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> And vnles thou repente in
tyme (O Inglād) it wylbe the cause of thy fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
desolation and vtter confusion. For thou
doest euen now norishe within thee, those that
shal consume thee.<note place="margin">Esai. vij.</note> The Lord hath whisled for
them out of a farre countrye, and they are spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delye
come, euen those that shall ruynate thine
honour, adnichelat thyne auncient worthines,
and bring thy prayseworthy fame to ignominy
and shame. Oh Sinne, how odible art thou in
the sight of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> most highest, that bringest such
confusion vpon them that hath so frendly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brased
thee. O Ingland, thou receyuedst an yl
gest to herborowe, whē thou waste contented
that synne should lodge with thee: whose loue
and frēdship is the wrath and enmite of God:
whose payment and recompence is, captiuitie,
destruction and desolation: for now thy pryde
shalbe rewarded with pouertie,<note place="margin">Esay. iij.</note> thyne abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce
with scarcitie, thy gredye purchasinge
with dispossessing.<note place="margin">Esay. v.</note> Thy sumptuouse buylding
with rasing downe, and thyne ambytion with
desolation: yea the gorgiousnes of thine appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
<pb facs="4"/>
shalbe tourned into ragges and sackcloth:
thyne abundant delicate fare, into famyne and
honger,<note place="margin">Esay. iij.</note> and the cherished beautye of thy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
and dayntie Mistresses into wythered<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and sunne burninge. Theyr fayre layde out
yelowe lockes into baldnesse, for the tyme ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth
that of force they muste forgo theyr
trinkettes of pryde, the which at the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of Gods word they would not abandon,
as are theyr abyllements of gold, tawdrye la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
bongraces, fardingals, tablettes, ringes,
with theyr garded and brodered raymente of
sundrye fashions, counterfeyting all nations:
and because theyr husbandes haue vaynly sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ported
them in the same. Theyr bloud shalbe
shed in the stretes, sayth the Lord. Esaye. iij.
This shalbe the reward of Sinne thy gest (O
Ingland) besydes the greuous Idolatry wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in
thou now lyuest, to the vtter woundinge of
thy conscientie, agaynst thy knowledge by y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisye:
the onely meane to accellerat &amp; bring
spedye damnation vpon thy head.<note place="margin">Exod. 32. iij. Re. 13.</note> For this
Sinne of ydolatry is so odious in Gods sight
that at no tyme (as testifieth the scriptures)<note place="margin">Num. 25</note>
hath y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lord lefte the same vnpunished: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be thou most certaynly assured of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
wrath and indignation, that after y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
committing of so manye sinnes, in stede of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce
doest ende in Idolatrye: yea, it is a
playne argument that thou art forsakē of god,
and geuen ouer into reprobation,<note place="margin">Ier. xliiij</note> for this is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
sinne (as witnesseth the Prophetes) that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly<note place="margin">Ezec. vi.</note>

famyne, desolation and vtter destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Oh consyder,<note place="margin">Luke. xv.</note> I pray thee (O Ingland)
how farre thou art alreadye strayed from the
shepefold of Christ, by one lytle storme of tēp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion.
Oh how cleane art thou blowen awaye
from the port of health, by one blustring blast
of a busie Bishop. Oh how is the shippe of thy
comon wealth now tossed through the vnskyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
of one that ruleth the helme. O how are
thy faythfull Christians induced to playe the
dissemblinge ypocrites, in communicatinge at
vnlawfull seruices and blasphemous ydola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
by the instigation of a fewe vnlearned
Papistes.<note place="margin">ij. Tim. ij</note> Wher hast thou learned in the time
of a storme to abandon the helme,<note place="margin">Math. x.</note> in the tyme
of warre to contracte amyte with the enemyes<note place="margin">i. Pet. iij.</note>
of thy Captayne, and in the tyme of tryall, to
cloke and dissemble thy fayth? This hath not
the worde of God taught thee, although thou
pretende dyuers excuses for the same: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the loue of thy selfe, of the worlde, of thy
goodes and ryches, thy landes and possessiōs,
thy wyfe and chyldren, thy fylthy pleasures,
and fleshly delites, the which al, thou thinking
by thy dissimulate ypocrisie to saue and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue,
thou shalte most certaynly lose and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
as witnesseth the verytie, saying: Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

yea,<note place="margin">Luke. ix</note> euen this transitory lyfe, besyde the
perpetual damnation of soule and body in the

them selues with his aduersaries, he wyl haue
no such seruing men in his Court,<note place="margin">iij. Re. 18</note> as shall halt

sekinge to please two cōtrary maysters,<note place="margin">Math. vi</note> God,

seke to couple Christ with Beliall, lighte with
darkenes, righteousnes with vnrighteousnes,
the beleuer with an infydell, and the Temple
of god with Images. In al these thinges thou
art coulpable O Inglande, through thy dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate
ypocrisie, in declining from the trueth:
notwithstāding thine earnest promyse, vowe,
and consente, to continue a faythfull Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
a trew seruaunt, and an vnfayned frend:
for who is he in thee, at this present (a few on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of the worlde doeth not abandon the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
imprisoned and exyled congregation of
God, his faythful seruauntes, and ioyne him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe
with the company of Idolaters and mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers

the holy communion and Sacrament of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
body and bloud, and to vnyte himself vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that sacrifycing bloudye aultar of the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
breddē God, the romishe Idol? who
is he that doeth not now with all diligence (in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stede
of the lyuely water of Gods holy worde
truely preached) repayre vnto the fylthy pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
of mennes superstitious doctrines, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb facs="5"/>
to satisfye theyr thyrste? yea, who is he
now in thee, that notwithstāding before tyme
he condempned with knowledge of consciēce
all maner of Images and Idols, that doth not
now dayly repayre vnto the Temples of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
in whose cōpany and that before theyr
Idolles, they praye, they knele, they are bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
they lifte vp theyr handes, they recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
holy water, and holy bread, with dyuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exteriour iestures of the bodye: And yet
(that worst is) thei affirme they do not offend
in as muche (as they saye) they do it not with
the consente of theyr harte, but onely with the
outward iesture of the body, and therefore no
sinne, in as much as the Lord onely requyreth
the harte,<note place="margin">Roma. x.</note> the whiche they geue vnto hym: as
though there myghte be made a seperation of
the soule and the body, in dedicatinge the one
vnto the seruice of God, and the other to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie:
as though the Lord had not created thē<note place="margin">Gene. ij.</note>
both, in vnyting and knytting them together,
making but one man, reseruing them bothe to
immortalitie:<note place="margin">Deu. 6. 11</note> as though the Lorde God dyd
not earnestly requyre in his lawe of euery one<note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note>
of vs,<note place="margin">Mark. 12</note> our whole soule, harte, mynde, strength,
power and outward man:<note place="margin">Luke. x.</note> and yet they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
to this knowledge, do make a separation,
whereas the Lord hath made so perfyte a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction.
But I feare me this theyr separation
tendeth to none other ende, but to deuyde thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
wholy from God both in soule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
for he wyl not haue the one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
neyther is he pleased with halfe of hys
<pb facs="6"/>
creatures. Wherefore yf he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> detesteth whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
fleeth the stewes and cōpany of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers:
yf he that hateth swering, auoydeth
the felowship of blasphemers: and yf he that
loueth quietnesse refrayneth the companye of
ruffians &amp; quarellers. How much more ough<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>test
thou (O dearly beloued) yf thou dydest in
dede hate Idolatrye, as thou pretendeste in
word, to auoyde and flee the companye of all
Idolatres in the committing of theyr Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye:
how much more I saye oughtest thou to
auoyde theyr brothell houses &amp; stewes, theyr
sinke and puddel of fylthy Idolatrye, &amp; that
not onely with the hart &amp; minde, but also with
the body and outward iesture. For the Lorde
doeth not onely requyre (as wytnesseth saynte
Paul)<note place="margin">Roma. x.</note> the confydence and belefe of the harte
vnto iustifycation, but also the outwarde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the mouth and exteriour conuersatiō
vnto saluation.<note place="margin">Num. xi.</note> Let not the greasy fleshpottes

the church of God in the desert,<note place="margin">ij. Petr. ij</note> and retourne
to thy fylthye puddel agayne. Set rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<pb facs="6"/>
for the testimony of the truth, rather
then they would ether in body or in mynd cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate

declining at any tyme frō thesame, for any
thing that the deuyl, the world, or the fleshe cā
do, or ymagine. The .ij. is called, Irenius, who
as his name importeth, is all together peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and a louer of vnyte and concorde, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he perseuereth in his accustomed maner
of lyuing, without caring for any trouble that
ryseth through any alteratiō of religiō, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he differeth from the other two, in as much
as he doeth not condemne all religion, as doth
the Mondayne, nether yet is he so variable as
is the Temporisour, but for all that he swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
from the rules of a trew Christiā, in that
the peace and tranquilitie of the cōmen welth
is more deare vnto him, then is the glorye of
God, the florishing of his word, and his own

saluacion. The .iij. is named the Temporisour,
because of his dissimulation, who obserueth
more the tyme, then the rules of a Christian,
tendering his owne saluation. The last is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Mondayn, that is to saye: a worldly man,
or an infydell, who hath neyther God, nor any
religion, in any reputacion. These .iiij. persons
thou shalt heare speake in these Dialoges, and
that so aptlye and decentlye, that (yf they had
the lyke grace in the Inglishe, as they haue in
the Frenche) thou wouldest rather iudge them
the lyuely voyces of men then otherwyse. As
it is, take it in good worth, as a testimonye of
my good wyll and earnest zeale vnto my nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
countrye. Trusting gentle Reader, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thou hast diligently perused thesame, and
examined it w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the touchstone of Gods word,
and thyne owne conscience, thou wilt searche
no more excuses to couer thy dissimulatiō and
impiete withall. For truely suche inuented ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
