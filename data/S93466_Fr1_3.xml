      <hi>THE AVCTHOR,</hi> to the Gentlemen Readers.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit I well know, that euery Gentleman, wil gentlemanly iudge of all things: yet haue I thought it no restraynt, but happely some furtherance towardes their curteous conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, most humbly to pray pardon if ought in this present Pamphlet, bee found either in very reason, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentinge from wiser iudgementes, or els through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of humors, not fittinge with their fancies: For some I haue seene so passionate in opinion, as can not see or heare patiently any thinge that contenteth not their owne eye, or squareth not euen with the rule of their owne mindes. But, if it pleased them to consider how hardly mennes opinions bee brought to concur, they would (I am sure) spare them selues, and not with choller &amp; offēce, so often trouble their own thoughts. Opinon and custome (as daily experience teacheth) do leade euery one, be hee neuer so foolish or barbarous, to beleeue his owne countrey condicions, and self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytes to bee best: and therin they that haue least rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, do no lesse constantly tary, then those that vpon sound reason in deede, experience, and learninge, haue firmed their iudgementes. For, do wee not finde that the sauadge Nations, are as lothe to alter their soyle, as are wee that inhabite a most cyuill Countrey? Or do you not thinke, that many eyther through want of wil or lack of patiēce to learn, accompt men mad, that hold them selues at continuall study? And contrarywise, would any ciuill man bee pleased, to abandon his bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, to abide amonge the sauadge? or that would leaue the study of good letters, to take plesure in those
<pb facs="6"/> toyes, which ignorant men delight in? surely no: and no maruaile, sithe the wisest, yea the Philsophers them selues, haue euen to this day dissented in opinion. For some you se haue sought the contemplatiue life: others commended the actiue: and many preferred pleasure, as that which ought most to bee desired. Sith then, for so many reasons you finde difference in the opinions of men: and that no counsell, wit, or wil, can perswade them to one minde: my meaning is not, that though in this Dialogue accordinge to mine owne fancie, I preferre the Towne habitacion, yet therby to finde fault with any, that either because his reason so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth, or his own minde so delighteth, wil driue out his dayes in the Countrey. It shall therfore please me, that euery man please him selfe, vsinge the liberty and will of his owne minde: and though it be farre diuerse from mine, yet I know not why his opinion should trouble mee, or mine offende him: so longe as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of eyther, be still in our owne powers. VVhat harme was it to <hi>Achilles,</hi> though <hi>Socrates</hi> refusing al ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, put his whole felicity in vertue? And why should <hi>Socrates</hi> bee offended, though aboue all thinges, <hi>Achilles</hi> desired honour? VVhat maketh it matter, though <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> thought that nothing was cōtrary to other? Or what offence was it that <hi>Permaenides,</hi> frantickly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, all worldly things to bee but one thing? And if <hi>Zeno</hi> perswaded him selfe that nothing mooued? All which opinions and errors, could nothinge disturbe the patience of the true <hi>Philosophers,</hi> who set their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in contemplation, and loue of Th'almighty. <hi>Tot capita, tot sensus,</hi> the Prouerbe sayth: VVe see then, that the endes of mans delights bee diuerse, and for the most parte contrary: although the ende of euery mans
<pb facs="6"/> life, is one. The life of man may therfore be compared to Iron, which beeinge vsed, becommeth bright and shyning, yet at last worne to nothing: Or if it bee not vsed, but layde vp, doth neuerthelesse consume with rustines. Euen so, mans age well imployed, weareth with some glosse or brightnesse of Fame: or if it bee without action, and obscurely passed, yet doth it not continue euer: for death (certayne) is the end both of the one and the other. God graunt that euery man may lyue in the true feare of the Lorde, and the due obedience of his Prince, so shall hee eyther in Courte, Towne, or Countrey, most happely end his daies.</p>
