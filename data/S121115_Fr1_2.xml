   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O feede thy fancie with friuolous fables gentle Reader (as to tell thee of drowsie Endimion, who desired of Iupiter, to sleepe perpetuall: or Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menides, who in seeking his fathers sheepe, tooke a nappe of fortie and seuen yeares long, or those seuen supposed Saintes, whom the golden Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend reporteth to haue slept two hundreth yeares and odde) is no part of my purpose. But rather as one in griefe of conscience, for the zeale of my God, what in me lyeth, to wake and stirre vp those wicked and sinfull sluggards, whom the cursed serpent in Paradice,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> aboue fiue thousand fiue hundreth sixtie and two yeares past, applying not the sinne of the sea calfe to their heades, but that inchaunted apple of perdition to their hartes, hath so venoumously infected with contagious poyson of iniquitie, and lulled so soundly a sleepe in the carelesse cradle of securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: that neither the golden belles of Aaron▪ the thundring trumpe of Esay, the well tuned Cimbals of Dauid, the pleasant harmonie of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists, nor the sweete comfortable pipe of Christ himselfe, could once as yet allure them to repentance and amendment of life: trusting that God by this my plaine rough Summons, penned without feare, or flatterie, shall now in the dawning of the day, ring such a peale at the dore of their conscience, as shall either moue them at length to loue him in his mercies, prouoke them to feare him in his iustice, or leaue them vnexcusable in the day of vengeance. But of all the sinfull crue of napping sleepers in generall, is lately reuealed vnto vs, one notable and pestiferous sect especiall: most odious to God, grieuous to his Church, dangerous to the State, and noysom to the common wealth▪ of whom the holy Ghost by the penne of the Apostles, hath most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly forewarned vs: decyphering them in their colours, with titles correspondent to their manners: as couetous bosters,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.3. 1. Tim. 4.2. Iud. 16.18.19. 2. Cor. 11.13.14. Apoc. 12.12.</note> disdainefull moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, false accusers, murmuring complainers, dissembling hipocrites, Authors of sectes, and despisers of authoritie: hauing a similitude of godlinesse, but haue denyed the power thereof, in whom Sathan hath transformed himselfe into an angel of light, whose restlesse rage doth manifestly shew the ruine of his kingdom at hand. These vnder a colour and shadow of religion, are so vehemently set on fire to shake off the yoke of obedience, and seeke innouation: as nothing is thought tollerable but what they like, and what they allow must onely stand for law: whereby the church is torne in peeces, authoritie contemned, vice aduanced, vertue neglected, and all men in opinion wonderfully distracted. Looke where they do loath, euerie mite is made a monster: euerie gnat, a cammell: and euerie trifle a trespasse, which must be curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously ripped vp, and made open to the view of the world. But where they like, mountaines are no moates, nor beames no blemishes: loue must couer the multitude of sinnes, and all thinges smothered vp with a shew of holinesse. Their pretence (as their Captaine saith) is to marre

the Prelate,<note place="margin">

      </note> the auncient graue Pastors, reuerend Fathers, and chiefe pillers of our Church: the middle corde of that threefold cable, the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anker staffe and stay of our common wealth: much like those raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wolues, which by no meanes would enter league with the poore sheepe, vnlesse their Mastiffes (whom they feared) were deliuered vnto them: but dangerous was that peace, and simple were those sheepe, to yeelde their dogges to such as sought to pray vpon their carkasse. They resemble in diuers points that notable and presumpteous crue, Iack Straw and his fellowes, who being diuelishly incensed with mutation, pretending a cause of libertie, stirred vp such trouble &amp; ciuil discention in this land, as nothing could appease, vnlesse the king would graunt to put downe all the nobles and prelates,<note place="margin">Richard the second.</note> reseruing onely a few to be of his counsell, and the rascall rable of begging Friers, to liue of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples deuotion: much like the prelacie which these new deuising church-founders are now so desirous to haue established: who must be no Bishops, to beare the state and title of honor, but superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents to controll Princes: no beneficed men, and why? because it bringeth a charge, as frutes, tenthes, and subsidies to her Maiesties co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, hospitalitie to their neighbors, and generall reliefe to the poore: but must liue popularly with their feete vnder other mens tables, and their tongues tyed to other mens purses. But Iack Straw was taught to know how horrible a thing it was,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 24. Psal. 105.15.</note> once to lift vp either hand, tongue or hart against the Lordes annointed, or doe his Prophets any harme, by sheathing the Maior of London his dagger in his bosom. So woulde these be learned to vnderstand,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.2.5. 1. Pet. 2.13.14. Tit. 3.1.9.10.11 Heb. 13.7. 1. Tim. 5.1.17.</note> that the word of God doth teach, and our English lawes command, obediently to honour the Prince, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence the Prelate. To conclude (gentle Reader) I craue only thy friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly censor without partialitie, not forgetting the good Hermit, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing three of his friendes come to visit him, for want of better dainties to entertaine them, bestowed on euerie of them an olde apple, halfe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified with spots. The first friend, to shew his affection, deuoured his apple hartely, sound and rotten together as it was. The second, more nice then wise, because his was spotted in part, disdainefully threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the whole. The third, making choice of the best, reiected onely the rest. So doe I wish thee, not with the first friend, to deuoure the badde with the good: neither with the second, to cast away that is good because of some bad: but with the third, to accept and vse that is wholesom, and refuse that is lothsom. Vale in Christo.</p>
