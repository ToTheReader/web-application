   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS litle booke which I presume to offer to your maiestie (my very good Lord) belongeth vnto you by a double right. First in respect of the matter: for it intreateth of the Church, whereof it hath pleased God to raise you vp to be a defender in our coutrey of Fraunce. Then in respect of the Authour himselfe: for seeing that he hath vowed and giuen himselfe to your maiestie, with all that by Gods grace he is able to bring foorth, the proprietie and right is in you. Wherfore, if it shall please you to reade, you shall finde herein a little after, what ought to be the right condition of the Church of God, and what now at this present it is vnder the tyrannie of the Pope, in the Church of Rome, and consequently, what honour God hath shewed vnto you in our time, choosing you out from amongst so many great Princes, to deliuer it from such a bondage. The world will make no accompt of these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: neither is it of the worlde. But to a Christian Prince, who will consider that God doth hold his Church so deare, that he hath giuen his dearely beloued sonne to the death, and to the contempt of the world for her sake, this honour shalbe more precious in his sight, then the whole world. This vndoubtedly is a great work, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in verely there is much toile: for the word of God is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the nations and kinges of the earth for the most part, will bande themselues together, to maintaine
<pb facs="9"/>and vnderproppe the kingdome of Antichrist. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde this, as in all great thinges, so in this there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth at the end of this toyle, a most assured victorie. For this thing the word of God telleth vs, that it must needes be that that kingdome must fall, and that Christ must be acknowledged through all, to be the King of kings, and Lord of lords, yea that they themselues which shall haue mainteyned Antichrist, shall hewe him in pieces. Of this trauel the worst and greatest brunt is already past, God hauing for the comfort of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, deuided it amongest so many great and notable personages, which in our time haue trauailed therein, and nowe haue rested themselues from their trauailes, in that same blessed happines. And if so be any thing yet remaine, it behoueth that you take good courage: For God who hath crowned you, will also crowne this good worke by you, and as for the forces which now they doe seeme to make, what are they else but the gry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ng wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings of Antichrist? And these griping, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>gings are euident and vndoubted tokens that hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>h draweth neere. God hath made you (my very good lord) to know his trueth euen from your childhoode, and he hath em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed you in his woorke in your first youth. Hee hath beautified you with great gifts to this ende, as strength of body, quickenes of spirite, valiancie of courage. And employing these in his seruice, he will crowne them in you with happines, honour, riches, and high aduauance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For these are no other then accessories, and he who hath giuen you the principall, can giue you these: and by him alone also it is that kings reigne, and that princes Judge the earth. And (Sir) this is that which he requireth of you. This is it, that Christendome loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for at your hands. This is that, which all good men
<pb facs="9"/>doe promise themselues. This then is the alone and onely marke that your maiestie must ame at. And therefore (Sir) as one of your most lowely seruants, I make this humble petition, that day and night you may liuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present and keepe before your presence, the dignitie and greatnes of this charge, to which God hath called you: that you may employ those rare gifts which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto you for the establishing of his kingdome, that you may thinke then to reigne most safely, when he shall reigne by his worde in the middest of you. This is the most sure and short way, that your trustie seruantes can direct you in for the establishing of your highnes. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech God therefore (Sir) that it will please him to assist you through his spirite, in this worke, to gouerne your heart, and all your actions, and to heape vpon you his blessings both spirituall and temporall, to his owne glorie, and the benefite of his Church.</p>
