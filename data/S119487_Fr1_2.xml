   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE manifold fauours receiued from your Lordship, euer since my first placing in the Free-Schoole of <hi>Northampton,</hi> as also your Honours late promised assistance to helpe the said Schoole to that right whereof it hath been these many yeeres vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionably defrauded, hath caused me
<pb facs="3"/> many times to wish that some good occasion might be offered vnto me, whereby I might witnesse not onely vnto your Honour, but also to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, how much I confesse my selfe obliged vnto you for the same. And therefore hauing taken some paines to turne the contents of the Bible briefly into English meeter, for the helpe of weake memories (being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged thereunto by the perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of diuers of my godly learned friends, when they saw some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance made thereinto.) Your Honor being in the very Frontispice of my dearest and worthily most honoured friends, I determined to dedicate the same, together with my humble and best seruice, vnto your Honor; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching you, that both my selfe and it, as also our poore wrōged Schoole may still bee patronized and shrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder the shadow of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable protection: so will I not feare what my backe friends can say
<pb facs="3"/> to my Booke, nor what they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise or doe against my selfe; so also shall your Honor (in respect of the Schoole) haue the praise of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to be called, <hi>A builder of that wast place, and a raiser vp of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof; a repairer of that breach, and a restorer of those paths to dwell in:</hi> And so be honoured and esteemed of me, and all my Successors, as the second Founder thereof, and be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld and equalized with <hi>Thomas Chipsey,</hi> who was the first: For,
<q>
         <l>
            <hi>Non minor est virtus quam quaerere parta tueri.</hi>
         </l>
         <l>Tis no lesse pious, things lost to regaine,</l>
         <l>Then for first Founders to giue to maintaine.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Vouchsafe I beseech you (my most honoured Lord) as cheerefully to accept of this my poore present and widowes mite (being a pawne and pledge of my euer dutifull &amp; thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minde) as <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> is said to haue receiued an handfull of water from the poore Countryman, whose
<pb facs="4"/> ability would afford no better a gift. So will I euer powre forth my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto the Almighty Preseruer of mankinde, the giuer of euery good gift, that hee would bee pleased to vouchsafe vnto your Honor, and to all your Honourable Progeny, health of body, length of dayes, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of grace and honor in this life, and the fruition of eternall blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the World to come.</p>
