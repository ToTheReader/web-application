   <head>TO THE RIGHTE worshipful and excellent yong Gentle man, mayster Henry Compton Esquier, his faythful and dailye Orator Nicholas Hawarde, wisheth longe helth, with encrese and affluence of all worshyp.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough of long tyme sithe, (ryghte worshipfull,) I had in my hart professed a greate zeale and reuerens towardes you, whiche from time to time, day by day. I sought me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to signifye to your good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stership, yet there neuer wanted som occasion which might w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>hold me from y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> mi said intēt &amp; purpose.
<pb facs="3"/>
For why, waying mine own case and condition of fortune, and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering your worthye estate and degree of worship, I did alwaies with my self yet hitherto, disalow my former attempted enterpryse. But on the other side, setting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eyes, and beholding the exceding great gentlenes, whych from your very youthe ye haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundauntly towards all men in all places declared, (whiche you as inheritaunce claime from your auncetors,) and also the no small fauoure and zeale which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually haue professed towardes learning, where in I my selfe am able not a litle to testify how you haue profyted. For omitting here, your diligent studye employed at Oxford, whyche is to diuers not vnknowen, I my selfe doo well remember that longe tyme before that, ye had attayned the Laten
<pb facs="3"/>
tounge, (and that well nyghe in your verye childhoode:) whyche thinges being so, I was embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,) presuming vpō your passing great fauour) now at laste wyth certaine confidence to declare to your goodnesse my pore harte to you long time since wholy addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: vpon which snre affiaunce so reposed in your worshyp, I haue here presented vnto you this smal treatise. Vppon the fynishinge wherof, I haue employed for the most part suche vacant time as I had, (not defraudinge my other studies,) bering in memorye ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and saying of Plinie, who thoughte all that his time to be lost, whyche hee bestowed not at booke. Nothinge doubtynge but your lenity, being suche as it is, ye wil gratefullye with fauoure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the same, and so enboulden
<pb facs="4"/>
my bashfulnesse in this behalf, as did Octauius Augustus to one, who whē he had finished a boke, (like as I this,) which he would haue deliuered to Augustus, and was come in presence before him, with trembling hand, he did both profer and withdraw y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> hys boke again, which thing Augustus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceiuing, accepted the gift, and reprehending y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bashful and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnesse of the geuer, said: what thinckest thou, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thou doest nowe erhibite a mite to an Elephante? Such clemency and familiaritye was there in y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> mighty Emperor. The like of which, also promiseth this your worships countenance: which hath now exiled, and clean put to flight, the cloudy mistes of my former bashfulnesse: So that now wythout feare or drawinge backe, I haue heare preferred to your worship these my symple tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uailes,
<pb facs="4"/>
which I chose amonge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to employ vpō this author, as chefe for sondry causes. Thone is, for the substaunce and matter, which he writeth of, whiche as it is of time and cōtinuans antique, so is it of all men far before other histories to be embraced &amp; desired to be knowen. An other cause is, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> where diuers Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers aswell Grekes as Latines haue vttred to their posteritye in wryting therploits &amp; feats atche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Romaines, as well in peace, as in warre, yet among thē al, are there few which in so good order haue placed the same: and as for breuitye and compendious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, I am assured noone there are, but of force muste graunte hym the pryce. And all be it that as Tullye sayeth, and as expery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth vs, dyuers there are endued wyth very excellente
<pb facs="5"/>
wittes by nature, whyche wittes are aided by preceptes and perfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by experience, which experiēs is alone the maistres of al things, who instructeth and teacheth vs how to demene and gouern both our selues and our doings by iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ging thynges present, and calling to memory thynges whyche are past: yet amonge all those whych are indued with suche pregnante wittes by nature, eche one hathe not attained suche perfectyon in learning, that they of them selues are able inough to attain fully to the knowledge and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge of the gestes and factes of dyuers moste victorious nations &amp; peoples: the examples of whom may aminate and encourage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to endeuour and laboure to purchase and attaine suche lyke fame and praise, as those others haue done, so muche as nothynge
<pb facs="5"/>
canne more. The knowledge of which examples, had to diuers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to thys daye lien hidde, bene vnknown, and vnattained vnto, had not that theyr default in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, bene aided by some others, able to further thē in this behalfe. Which imperfection of many, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers here to fore vnderstandyng, (to whome the talent of lernynge hath ben more aboūdantly graū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) endeuoringe them selues, to remedy &amp; supply y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> want &amp; defalt in others, haue to theyr great cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and praise immortall, by their industry and paines ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in translating diuers Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Chronicles, (as in theyr myndes best seemed to them) out of sondry languages into this out mother tounge, made perfect and healed that maime, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse the want of knowledge of
<pb facs="6"/>
the same Historyes for wante of learninge, had bred to dyuers of thys our country. By whiche ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of theirs, I was the more hardye to attempte thys enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryse, as one ryghte gladde if by oughte that lyeth in me, (whyche easelye I confesse, and graunte how slender it is,) any one myght take eyther furtheraunce or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Which my simple trauayles I haue presumed to exhibyte to your worship, not for any the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses afore sayde, (knowinge that you are in suche studies, as ye are also in all other good scyences ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye exactlye seene and parfecte,) but onelye to signifye, and as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumente to testifye the good wyl whyche to my power my poore harte vnto your worshyppe, as of duetye doothe owe: whyche then at lengthe shall be fullye satisfyed,
<pb facs="6"/>
and adiudged it selfe verye hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye, when it shall seeme to haue doone anye thynge whyche maye appeare acceptable to your good mastershyppe.</p>
   <p>And all thoughe it maye be graunted that experyence of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges maye bee attayned wythout learnynge, yet is experyence pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by learnynge, to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before that other so muche as quietnesse is more to be regarded then trouble.</p>
   <p>For as Phillip de Comines a Frenche wryter affyrmeth: a manne shall see more experyence in three monethes, by readynge of bookes, then twentye menne shall in Processe of tyme, the one of theym lyuynge after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Where by a manne shall allso vnderstande the vsage and
<pb facs="7"/>
and fashions of sondrye realmes and countries, aswell in peace as in time of warre, the ordinaunces and lawes of sondry nations, the wayes and meanes by whyche they haue enlarged their kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and the causes of the decay of the same, and howe those rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Empires haue bene agayne restored, and haue recouered their former estates. All which things like as they are plentifullye, so are they chefly contained in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> descrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of good histories, whiche hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storyes of Cicero are most worthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye called the wytnesse bearers of time, the lyghtes of veritye, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of memorye, the regentes of life, and the ambassadors of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: by whiche we maye learne how to bear all manner fortune, as well aduerse as prosperous, whyche shall administer vnto vs the very true and certain expery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb facs="7"/>
of thinges, so that wee maye certainly know howe to attayne and purchase praise and fame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall: whiche with greate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and long contynuaunce of the same, God of hys infinite goodnesse, graunt to your worship for euer. From Thauies Inne the xxii. day of Iune.</p>
