   <head>¶ To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing openlye defamed, in writing set abroade by one that hath no name: I suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> same, long time to delite himself in his own blindnesse, and to boast himselfe among hys secreto maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, being in y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> meane while better occupied, thā in wrestling with suche a one as is asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to set his name to the booke he writeth, and causeth to be imprinted.</p>
   <p>I thought that the writings of such one, coulde not haue bene hurtfull to the estimation that I and others of my calling, should of right haue among the true profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of Gods Gospell: bicause such haue inough alredie in print, and in the English tong, to aunswere all such blind barking dogs as this is. But perceiuing that some men which professe the Gospell, will rather credit such a Rayler, than take the paynes to reade that, wherin they might haue wherewith to be able to answere for vs that are rayled vpon, bycause the same was written, before thys Hell Dogge began to barke: I haue now written a short Apologie, or defence of my selfe and others of my calling, whom this Hell hound doth so egerly barke at: willing the Christian reader, to reade it with indifferent iudgement, neyther inclining to the one nor the other, till he haue read both. And bicause none shall haue cause to complaine: I haue set downe in writing all that this
<pb facs="3"/>
Dogge hath written, and then defēded that which he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth fault withall, so that euerie matter hath it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest defence ioyned vnto it, that the Christian Reader, may haue wherewithall to bring himselfe out of doubt. And least any shoulde be offended, for that I terme mine aduersarie by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> name of <hi>Cerberus</hi> or Hell dogge: I wold all men should consider the cause. He hath takē vpon him to reprehend the teachers of the truth, and those, which are or should be, the light of the worlde: and yet, as one that would not be called to an accompt of his doings, he hideth his name. Wherefore, I haue giuen him suche a name, as is méete for him: tyll he put hys name to that he writeth in the reproche and discredite of such as feare not openly to teach the truth, and when they write it, to subscribe their names to the same. When this Hel hound therefore shall set his name to his booke: I will vse none other name but that which by his owne writing shal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be his. In the meane while, let him &amp; his friends be contented that he beare such a name, as hys doings do deserue. <hi>Cerberus</hi> as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Poets do faine, is a Dogge with thrée heades, which watcheth Hell gates, whose barking is horrible, for he barketh with chrée mouthes, and his haires are snakes. His name by interpretation doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a deuourer of bodies. Wherefore, it is not a name vile inough for this Hel dogge, whose propertie is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour soules, and the good names of such as he is not able to accuse of any crime. And wyth his barking he goeth not about to trouble the Kingdome of Hel (as <hi>Cerberus</hi> did) but the Kingdome of Heauen, which is the Church of Christ, which by faith in Christ, is assured of hir eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Predestination to euerlasting glorie after this life, and in this life to deliueraunce from all euill. Of which comfort this <hi>Cerberus</hi> laboureth by his barking to spoile hir: as shall more plainely appeare in the Apologie of
<pb facs="3"/>
those, whom he seketh by his barking to dash out of coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
   <p>But least I should trouble thée Christiā Reader, with ouer manie wordes before the matter: I ceasse to write any more. Farewel in Christ Iesus. And pray to God for the presence of his holie spirite, to leade thée in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this Apologie. Amen. Finished the first of March Anno. 1565.</p>
