   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Should have humbly cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your Majesties par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for my omission of the latter part of King <hi>Edward's</hi> Reigne, but that the sense of mine owne defects have put mee in minde of a more necessary suit, to beg for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse for that part of it whichis here written. For
<pb facs="3"/>
I am not so presumptuously vaine, when I consider either the Dignity of your Office, or the Vertues of your Person, as to imagine that any writing from my unworthy selfe can bee either too short, er enough ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant to be presented to your sacred hand. For should your Maiesty vouchsafe to read it, as the precious howres of so great a Monarch (which maáe <hi>Horace</hi> affect shortnesse to <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>) would tell me the Poem were too too long; so the iudicious Censure of so wise a Prince would make mee tremble at the defects of it. Those defects (whatsoever they be) can be imputed onely to insufficiency; for neither was there Argument wanting, nor yet endevour, since I had the Actions of a great King to require my skill, and the Command of a greater King to obliege my care. Those great Actions of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third are the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of this Poem; which is there ended, where his fortune beganne to decline, where the French by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts and private practises regained that, which had beene wonne from them by eminent and famous victories: which times may affoord fitter observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for an acute Historian in Prose, than straines of height for an Heroike Poem. Your gracious Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don onely can rectifie what may bee amisse in my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and imperfect labour. In hope of which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly cast both it and my selfe at your Maiesties feet,
<pb facs="3"/>
beseeching Almighty God to blesse you with a long and happy Reigne on earth, and after to crowne you with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible glory. So prayeth</p>
