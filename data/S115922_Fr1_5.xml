   <head>An Epistle, added in the due praise
and commendation of that worthy and worshipful
Gentleman, Maister WILLIAM COKYNE,
Sheriffe and Alderman of the most renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and Honourable Citty of
LONDON.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orthy Gentleman, if the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
were to be merited by a mans owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruings
(as a number of Grosse-headed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes
will not let to affirme) you were then
happy, for you neither needed to purchase
any <hi>Popes Pardons,</hi> or to buy any <hi>Masses</hi> of <hi>Scala Celi,</hi> to
be sung for your soule when you are dead.</p>
   <p>You haue begun a worke of <hi>Supererogation,</hi> more merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
in the iudgements of all those that are (indeed) godly
wise, then either the building of a <hi>Chappel,</hi> or a <hi>Chantery,</hi>
or the giuing of perpetuities, either of lands or liuings, what
or how soeuer bestowed about any Popish purposes.</p>
   <p>This enterprize, the rather by your encouragement thus
vndertaken, for the planting of the Northerne parts of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
with the <hi>English,</hi> cannot be but acceptable in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God, when it shall draw so much to the aduancement
of his glory, making way for the <hi>Gospell</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to
be truely preached in a place where there was nothing but I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry
and superstition formerly practised; giuing light and
vnderstanding to a blind and ignorant people, to discern the
way of saluation, that do rather hope to be saued by the means
of <hi>Saint Patricke,</hi> then by the mercy of God.</p>
   <p>This action cannot be but pleasing to the Kings most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Maiesty, when the sequell shall not redound to his honor,
but likewise to his profit: But how happily will it fall out for a
<pb facs="7"/>
number of poore people in <hi>England,</hi> that are oppressed with
penury, by reason of the multitude that doth so superabound,
whereby the scarsity of victuals doth the more exceede, that
may there be releeued by their owne industry: for Ireland is
able to render relecfe to forty thousand people, but to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in those parts of the Countrey, that at this present lyeth
wast, and altogether vninhabited: and yet where the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
is best planted and peopled throughout the whole realme,
the thirde part of the commodity is not raised, that the soile
would affoord: the reason is, by the ill Husbandry of the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,</hi>
that either for want of wit, or for want of knowledge,
doth not mannage their Husbandry according to skill.</p>
   <p>And although it be out of my element to speake of husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
that all the dayes of my life, could neuer play the good
Husband for my selfe: yet I am not so dull of conceite, but
I can see a number of defects, and that in the most principall
points of their Husbandry; as in the manner of the Tilling of
their ground, and sowing of their Corne, they haue no other
meanes whereby to draw the Plough, but euery Horse by his
owne taile, so that when the poore beast by his painfull labor,
hath worne the haire of his taile so short, as it can bee no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
tied, the Plough must stand.</p>
   <p>I might speake of many other defects, and one amongst the
rest, of the vnseasonable time that they vse in the making of
their Hay: but to speak truely of their ill Husbandry in that
point: in the greatest part throughout all Ireland, they vse to
make no Hay at all, although they haue as good grounde
as any other Countrey doth affoord: so that their poore Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in the Winter season, haue no other fother, then what they
can picke vp, and gather from the ground: but in those parts
neere about <hi>Dublyne,</hi> where they vse to make Hay, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
meddle with the cutting of their grasse, till they bee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
ready to cut their Corn, so that they wil haue their Hay
haruest, and their Corne haruest, to come both together,
which cōmonly neuer falleth out, till September be wel spent:
at which time of the yeare, there sometimes falleth out great
store of raine, so that from the best Meddow Lands, which is
<pb facs="7"/>
euermore vpon their lower grounds, their hay is many times
either vtterly marred, or altogither swept away with a floud.</p>
   <p>I might heere conclude and boldly affirme, that if those
parts of <hi>Ireland</hi> that now lieth wast, were inhabited by an
industrious people, and that the rest of the Countrey were
manured aud husbanded according to skill, <hi>Ireland</hi> woulde
sustaine more people by two parts, then are now inhabiting in
it. But leauing to speake of <hi>Ireland</hi> in generall, I will come
to that part of the North now intended to be planted, namely
of the <hi>Derry</hi> and the <hi>Colrane.</hi> In the time of Sir <hi>Iohn Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi>
Gouernment, I my selfe lay at <hi>Colrane,</hi> with a hunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
souldiers vnder my leading, I may therefore speake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of mine owne experience.</p>
   <p>For the Land that is adioyning about <hi>Colrane,</hi> it is verie
firtill, and the whol Countrey that stretcheth it selfe between
the Riuer of <hi>Bande,</hi> and the riuer of <hi>Lough-foile,</hi> that was
sometimes <hi>O-Cannes</hi> Countrey, is not onely a most pleasant
place, but is likewise verie commodious both for Corne and
Pasture.</p>
   <p>On the South side of the riuer of <hi>Bande,</hi> fast by <hi>Colrane,</hi>
there lieth a goodly country, called the <hi>Rowt,</hi> no better Corn
land in any part of Ireland, and it did at that time so abound
with Conies, so exceeding fat, and therewithall so sweete, as
I neuer saw the like, neither in Ireland, nor in any other
place where I haue trauailed.</p>
   <p>What should I speake of the <hi>Salmon</hi> fishing of the <hi>Bande,</hi>
which is so famously known and spoken of: and there is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
for three moneths of the yeare, betweene <hi>September</hi> &amp;
<hi>December,</hi> such a fishing for Eeles, as I thinke is not the
like againe in <hi>Europe,</hi> especially when there shall come men
that hath skill to take them, which the Irish hath not to any
purpose, yet they take great store, by reason of the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
of such notable Eeles, both for greatnesse and for
goodnesse, as the like are no other where else to be found.</p>
   <p>I might speake heere of the fishing for fresh water Trowts,
whereof there are great plentie in euery Riuer, in euerie
Brooke, in euerie Lough, and that throughout the whole
<pb facs="8"/>
Realme of Ireland, but speciallie in those Northerne partes
about Colrane and the Derry.</p>
   <p>But let me speake now of the fishing for Sea-fish, and first
for Cod and Lyng: what shippes are yearely set out from all
the parts of England: some to New-found-land, some to Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
some to <hi>Shotland,</hi> some to <hi>Ward-house,</hi> some to one
place and some to another: and I thinke of my conscience,
that at the verie entrance aswell of the riuer of the <hi>Bande,</hi>
as of the Riuer of <hi>Lough-foyle,</hi> which are not aboue some
eight or ten miles distant, there will fall out as good fishing
both for <hi>Cod</hi> and <hi>Lyng,</hi> as in any other place that I haue
formerly spoken of.</p>
   <p>Now for <hi>Herring</hi>-fishing, who can name a better place
then <hi>Loughfoyle</hi> it selfe, and there is one other <hi>Loughe</hi>
fast by, called by the name of <hi>Lough-Sully,</hi> where hee that
were but standing vpon the shore at the time of <hi>Herring</hi>-fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing,
would thinke that the very Sea it selfe did swell of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
there are such abundance all along that Coast.</p>
   <p>Without doubt, there will be found good fishing for <hi>Ray,</hi>
for <hi>Haddock,</hi> for <hi>Whiting,</hi> for <hi>Gurnard,</hi> and for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of other fishe, which neuer faileth all along the Coast of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> if it be sought for.</p>
   <p>As I haue now spoken of fishing, so I might yet again speak
of fowling: but let it suffice, that aswell for fish, for foule, for
Conics, for Cattle, and whatsoeuer is otherwise needefull
for mans sustenance, the whole Realme of <hi>Ireland</hi> is as rich
and fertile as any other Countrey in Christendom: yea and
for all manner of fruites: as <hi>Apples, peares,</hi> &amp; <hi>plums,</hi> in
manie parts of the Countrey, where men haue bin industrious
to plant, they haue as good fruit in <hi>Ireland</hi> as anie is in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To conclude, there wanteth nothing in <hi>Ireland</hi> but the
true knowledge of God, &amp; obedience to the Prince, the which
by Gods permission, will so much the rather bee brought to a
good passe, when that part of the Countrey that in former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
hath bin most rude and inclined to inciuilitie, that hath
<pb facs="8"/>
euermore bin the receptacle and refuge for the worst disposed
people, shall by this <hi>Plantation,</hi> be made a patterne of good
example, aswell for Godly as Ciuill Gouernment, to all the
Realme besides: but there is a kind of temeritie that doth no
good, yet is conueyed by those men, that are vtterly ignorant
in the affaires of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Since my comming from <hi>Dublyn,</hi> within sixe daies after
my arriuall here at <hi>London,</hi> I thinke I was asked sixteene
seuerall times, what I thoght of this <hi>Plantation</hi> in the north
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and whether it were possible that those labouerers
and workmen that are now sent ouer for the building, coulde
saue their throats from cutting, or their heades from beeing
taken from their shoulders, before the worke were finished: or
what assurance there could bee, but that when this erection
were fullie perfected, and that men did thinke themselus to be
most quietly setled: why might not the <hi>Irish</hi> do then as they
had done before, in one night to lay wast and consume al with
fire and sword? So that I see there be a number that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
but it is but of their owne shadowes.</p>
   <p>But let timerous men doubt as they list, and let igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt
men write what they please: <hi>Ireland</hi> (God be praised)
is in no such daungerous manner of plight. That doubt is
dissolued, and the daunger is past: for menne may worke as
quietlie in those places wherevnto they are now sent, as they
might doe if they were in <hi>Cheapeside.</hi> And in that part of
the Countrey, through the which a thousand menne in times
past would haue beene intercepted, I dare now vndertake to
passe my selfe and my Boy.</p>
   <p>But there be some will saie: And why may it not come to
passe, that there may be as great daunger as euer there was,
and that the Irish may be as Potent to execute mischiefe, as
euer they haue bin before?</p>
   <p>I say, They cannot. And whosoeuer shall please to read
the sequele heerein contained, I hope shall be fullie satisfied
in that point, for onelie to that ende and purpose, I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured
these Lines. And all the matter that I ayme at
<pb facs="9"/>
throughout this whole Booke, is but to make it manifest, that
the Irish are of no such resistance at this houre against his
Maiestie, as they haue beene in times past against our late
Queene.</p>
   <p>I am not ignorant, that although Ireland be reduced to a
great conformitie, and that his Maiestie hath a number of
loyall and faithfull Subiects in euery part of that Kingdome,
yet I know againe there be some, that are not to be trusted,
and therefore I speake not of their mindes, but I speake of
their manners: And I say, that the <hi>Rebel of Ireland</hi> shall
neuer more stand out hereafter, as they haue done in times
past.</p>
   <p>If any man please to read, let him iudge of my reasons,
in the meane time, there is but one thing (worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
that is to be feared, and may very easily be holpen, if
you suffer no Papist (either English or Irish) to plant himself
among you. Looke well but to that, and there is no doubt but
the Almightie God himselfe will blesse your enterprise, and
England and Ireland both, shall hereafter call you happy, &amp;
I shall rest still to wish you well.</p>
