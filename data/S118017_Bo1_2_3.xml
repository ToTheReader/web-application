   <head>Reasons of the Authors brevitie, in the following Chapters.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRISTIAN READER,</hi> I thought good to give thee notice, that when (at least, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>) I had finished the eleventh Chapter, I heard (which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse I knew not before) that both <hi>Calvin, Musculus, Marlorat,</hi> and <hi>Gual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> (which thou maist see, I made some use of) were in English, with divers others (which I never saw) upon this Gospel. And therefore this is one cause, <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> why I have left my former Method (which was more long) and given thee only some few Notions upon some few verses of every Chapter which followes; for the most part omitting more verses, then I have touched upon; and in those which I have pitched upon, being very short; sometimes raising but one Observation, or solving some one Question, or answering some one Objection out of a whole verse.</p>
   <p>Againe, my intent at first, was to imitate and follow <hi>D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Mayer,</hi> who hath observed some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> things out of every Booke of the New Testament, in some Chapters opening but three ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, in some fixe, in some eight, in few or none at all above ten; leaving thus elbow-roome enough for whosoever shall come after. Thus (in imitation of him) I have also done, touching upon halfe a score, or a dozen verses, or there-abouts, in every Chapter, taking only up a few gleanings after him. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, this is a reason of writing, and printing Bookes, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of reading them: <hi>Vt sic bonae notiones, quasi virgulis lunatis sigantur, ne ut aves avolent;</hi> that so good notions may be held, as it were, with Lime-twigs, and not like birds flye away, as they often doe, when a man only heareth them.</p>
   <p>This was another cause of my printing these short Collections, and Observations upon this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>3</label> that so those things, which in my reading and study I met withall, and which (in my weak judgement) were worthy of observation, might not be lost, but rather be made (by publishing them to the world) publikely profitable.</p>
