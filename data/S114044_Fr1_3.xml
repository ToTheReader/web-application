   <head>TO THE COVRTEOVS RERDER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat famous Philosopher <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> extolling the Persian Lawes, testified that their Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens from their infancie, were educated and taught not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or almost to imagine any thing but honest and iust. Which was the cause, as <hi>Gellius</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Draco</hi> a Citizen of Athens made their lawes so strict and seuere, that it was said They were written with Blood, and not with Inke: whereas on the other side the Law made by <hi>Solon</hi> was compared to a spiders web, which taketh the lesser flies and suffers the greater to escape and to breake the same. So that (euerie extreame being vicious) Reason requireth a Law not too cruell in her Frownes, nor too partiall in her Fauors. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these defects are incident to the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Merchant,</hi> because the same doth properly consist of the Custome of Merchants in the course of Trafficke, and is approued by all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according to the definition of <hi>Cicero, Vera Lex est recta Ratio, Natura congruens,
<pb facs="5"/>
diffusa in Omnes, Constans, Sempiterna:</hi> True Law, is a right reason of nature agreeing therewith in all points, diffused and spread in all Nations consisting perpetually, whereby <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> is distinguished and distributed by <hi>Number, VVeight</hi> and <hi>Measure,</hi> which shall bee made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant. For the maintenance of Trafficke and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is so pleasant, amiable and acceptable vnto all Princes and Potentates, that Kings haue beene and at this day are, of the Societie of Merchants: And many times (notwithstanding their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar differences and quarrells) they doe neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse agree in this course of Trade, because riches is the bright Starre, whose hight Trafficke takes to direct it selfe by, whereby Kingdomes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales doe flourish, Merchants being the meanes and instruments to performe the same, to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Illustration, and Benefit of their Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies and States. Questionlesse therefore, the State of a Merchant is of great dignitie and to bee cherished; for by them Countreys are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, Familiaritie betweene Nations is procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and politike Experience is attained. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I haue beene mooued (by long obseruation) to put the worthines of the <hi>Customarie Law of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> in plaine and compendious writing, by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted principles, familiar examples, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiue reasons, without affectation of curious words, more than the grauitie of the Theame (in some places) did require.</p>
   <p>I haue intituled the Booke, according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb facs="5"/>
name of <hi>Lex Mercatoria,</hi> and not <hi>Ius Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum</hi>; because it is a Customary Law approued by the authoritie of all Kingdomes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales, and not a Law established by the Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of any Prince, either in the first foundation or by continuance of time. And beginning with <hi>Time, Number, VVeight</hi> and <hi>Measure,</hi> I doe descend to the three Essentiall Parts of Trafficke, diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three parts accordingly, by comparing them to the <hi>Bodie, Soule,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, namely, <hi>Commodities, Money,</hi> and <hi>Exchange</hi> for money by Billes of Exchanges. The first, as the <hi>Bodie,</hi> vpheld the World by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation and Bartring of Commodities, vntill mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was deuised to bee coyned. The second, as the <hi>Soule</hi> in the Bodie, did infuse life to Trafficke, by the meanes of Equalitie and Equitie preuenting aduantage betweene Buyers and Sellers. The third, as the <hi>Spirit</hi> and Facultie of the Soule, (being sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted euerie where) corroborateth the Vitall Spirit of <hi>Trafficke,</hi> directing and controlling (by iust proportions) the prices and values of Commodities and Moneys. For euen as, Merchants are the Instrumentall Cause of <hi>Trade;</hi> euen so is the Exchange for Moneys, the Efficient Cause with vs in the course of Trafficke, and become Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant or ouerruling the price of Commodities and Moneys, as aforesaid. This is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested by three <hi>Paradoxes</hi> alluding to the said three Essentiall Parts of Commerce, which (for a Corrollarie) I haue added in the latter end of
<pb facs="6"/>
this Booke, with such other worthy obseruations as in the first Chapter are declared. And euen as the roundnesse of the Globe of the World is composed of the Earth and Waters: So is the Bodie of <hi>Lex Mercatoria,</hi> made and framed of the Merchants <hi>Customes,</hi> and the <hi>Sea-Lawes,</hi> which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volued together as the Seas and Earth. In the description whereof, I have vsed to make repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Materiall points, according as occasion did minister vnto me for to make application there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for the better vnderstanding of the Iudicious Reader, which is the maine Scope that all Writers are to regard and care for. The meanes whereby the differences and controuersies happening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Merchants in the course of Trade are ended, is also declared, which most of all require Breuitie and Expedition, and had need of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie proceeding, as was inuented for the <hi>Common Law</hi> of the Realme of England, the due commendation whereof is added heereunto; shewing also how of the same there might bee made an <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Science,</hi> and what obseruation of other Lawes are concurring with ours, both in the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Law, and the lenitie of Equitie, most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant with the <hi>Law-Merchant,</hi> the knowledge whereof is of so great consequence, that without it all Temporall Lawes are not compleat, but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The Scope of all therefore is, That the Rule of <hi>Equalitie</hi> and <hi>Equitie</hi> may take place betweene Vs and other Nations, which <hi>Velut Ariadnae caecaregens filo vestigia, non modo nos errare
<pb facs="6"/>
non sinit, fed etiam efficit, vt aberrantes in rectam viam deducamur,</hi> as hath beene mentioned in our last Treatise of the maintenance of free trade, lately published. Concluding (gentle Reader) vpon all the premisses handled (as I hope) substantially, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and submit the same to the louing entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the profound and discerning iudgement of the discreet, wise, and experienced; wishing that (like matter set downe by the Penne of <hi>Apollo</hi>) they may sound sweetly in your apprehention, and giue to your conceit most harmonious Musicke, Pleasure and Delight. London the 25 of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember 1622.</p>
