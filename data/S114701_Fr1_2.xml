   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>VST cause there was (Right worshipfull) as well in respect of the reuerend Author, whose rest is now in glory; as also of the godly Reader, whose good herein claimes speciall stroke; that some refining hand should recommend vnto the Church of God, a more perfect coppie of this godly Exposition, than the first edition hereof did affoord: and yet no cause I find, why your worthie children, who no doubt for the Authors sake, did more gratefully accept the former dedication, should by me be depriued of their right: Nay rather, as they in heart (I am persuaded) did highly honour the Author, for his double labor in Christs vineyard; so do I reioyce, this recompence is returned for their loue, That with this worke, their memorie with posteritie shall long endure. And sith my paines herein yeelds me this right, to make choyce of some, to whom I also may commend the patronage hereof; I presume to present the same vnto your Ladiship. If this bee any kindnesse on my behalfe, I confesse it is farre short of your desert, and of my desire: some others (I know) may challenge me herein, as vnmindfull of their loue; yet because God may offer me opportunitie hereafter, to giue them good content this way, I will intreat their patience for this time, that I may ioyne the mother with the children, in this worke of loue, to affoord tuition to these godly labours of the dead. It fits you best (good Madam) in many respects, for neither will your children complaine of your admission into the society of their right, nor you esteeme the lesser hereof, because of their claime hereto by former possession. They are your owne, and you theirs; this comes vnto you all, as vnto one, accounting your vnited loue for greater safetie: and looke what grace it finds by your protection, like grace it yeelds by many a good instruction. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <note n="a" place="margin">
