   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He learned <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclite</hi> no lesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmaticall, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other his quaint speeches, hath this saying of speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and obseruation: That the greedy mettall mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, in their too eager search for the measured worlds wealth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long toile and trouble, finde
<pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>paruum in magno,</hi> a little pure sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in a great deale of vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable earth. Contrarily it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the inquisition and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute of <hi>learning,</hi> where we often finde with a little abstractiue spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, <hi>magnum in paruo,</hi> much matter in few words, euery short golden sentence and particle thereof containing incredible store of most pure substance. For as the cunning <hi>Cosmographers,</hi> draw the whole compasse of the wide <hi>World,</hi> into the narrow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of a small <hi>Mappe;</hi> so haue our learned <hi>Artists</hi> contracted the vnconceiueable amplitude of the <hi>Liberall Sciences,</hi> into volumes of small quantity. But as gold,
<pb facs="7"/>the purest of all mettals, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer couched in a little compasse, is many times beaten out into a maruellous amplitude; so the short <hi>Aphorismes</hi> of <hi>Philosophie,</hi> in the circuit of a small period, comprehend substance sufficient to fill whole volumes. Which truth is confirmed, or rather ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested by the present matter we intreat of, whereby, as <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> finding the print of <hi>Hercules</hi> his foote gessed thereby at the proportion of his whole body; so we by the view of this so little and neglected a peece of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie,</hi> may gather what we are to thinke of the whole body (that I may so speake) of learning.
<pb facs="8"/>Which I obserue the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I see many shallow headed artificers oftentimes condemne vs of folly, that spend our whole <hi>Life</hi> in the study of good <hi>Letters,</hi> and yet, (such is our grosse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit) we neuer come to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite perfection of <hi>Knowledge.</hi> As if our <hi>Artes</hi> were like the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall sciences of base Prenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that may be throughly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the compasse of seauen yeeres. It was well said of one, <hi>Ars longa, vita breuis,</hi> we haue a great taske, and a short time. I haue read of some who in the compasse of three yeeres haue sailed about the world, but I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet heard of any who in the
<pb facs="8"/>whole course of his life, how la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriously so euer passed ouer, was able to compasse the whole <hi>circle</hi> of <hi>Sciences.</hi> And therefore <hi>Theophrastes</hi> a learned <hi>Philosopher</hi> lying on his death bed, accused <hi>Nature</hi> of vnkindnesse or rather want of discretion, that so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderately doth bestow the inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable benefit of long life vpon brute beastes and sensible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that can neither acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge so high a fauour, nor by their length of daies benefit themselues and others; but man that might in time restore decai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nature by perfecting the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect artes, hath his induring but as a moment: implying that
<pb facs="9"/>the whole course of a mans life, was not time sufficient to worke perfection in. And therefore, well said <hi>Sigismunde</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> to a <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Law,</hi> whom for an excellent <hi>Stratagem</hi> against the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy he had knighted not long before, when at an assembly of his <hi>Peeres</hi> and <hi>Counsellers,</hi> the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> doubted to whether compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he might with greatest credit ioyne himselfe, <hi>Is it doubtfull,</hi> said the Emperour, <hi>whether learning or military experience is more honorable? I can in one day make a thousand good souldiers; but I am not able in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeeres to make one tolerable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</hi> So that it is no maruell though <hi>Socrates,</hi> after his long
<pb facs="9"/>time of life, yet on his death bed confessed he had many things to learne. And me thinketh these nimble witted tradesmen, doe not so much magnifie their owne quicke conceit, as publish the facility of their sciences. For as <hi>Apelles</hi> said well vnto a <hi>Painter</hi> that bragged of his speedy work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, when shewing his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture he said, <hi>This I drew euen now: Surely,</hi> said <hi>Apelles, though thou hadst saied nothing, yet should I easily haue guessed by the workemanship that it was done in haste.</hi> So may we well say to these quicke-witted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall tradesmen, a man that hath but a little insight into their trade may well thinke their
<pb facs="10"/>craftes are soone learned: and I rather maruell, (as <hi>Apelles</hi> said) that they learned no more in the same quantitie and length of time. But it fareth with their grosse phantasie as it doth with our eie-sight in an vnequall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the obiect: for as being far off we conceiue of the vnmeasurable greatnesse of the most huge hilles to bee but as a point: so the infinite excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the heauenly <hi>Artes</hi> being too farre remooued from their grosse, or rather narrow capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, come into their conceite as things of lesse moment: which if their dimme or rather weake eie sight were able to beholde in
<pb facs="10"/>their diuine nature, they would soone confesse their surpassing excellency, and exceeeding dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. But to leaue them to their pleasing opinions, and to come to our purpose, which is, in briefe to handle the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Ages</hi> of <hi>Mans life,</hi> as also the <hi>causes</hi> thereof, together with the incident <hi>qualities</hi> to euery of them, which being in some sort auaileable to the <hi>knowledge</hi> of our selues, the highest point of knowledge which can be attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto, by the iudgement of the wise <hi>Apollo,</hi> as also either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together omitted or very slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled by others, I hope my small paines and lesse ability
<pb facs="11"/>shall be accepted in good worth and accounted of, rather accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good intent of the author, than the worthinesse of the worke. In which hope of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation for my good indeuors, and fauourable pardon of my manifold errors, I come without any longer Preface to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Treatise.</p>
