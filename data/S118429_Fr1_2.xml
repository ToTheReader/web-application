And to this end J haue been caried in the true loyaltie of my heart to set my thoughts on worke, not onely how to prepare my particular selfe in all readines, to doe all seruices enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
and commanded to me, and to adde anything of my selfe, that the strength of one poore man can affoord: but also how I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and prouoke others to carrie the same minde. To my selfe I haue set downe this law, that shall neuer be repealed, that for the libertie of my conscience, the safetie of my deare Soueraigne, and the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prosperitie of my countrie, if my wealth were millions, if I could bring thousands of fighting hands to the field, and if my life were ten thousand liues; wealth, strength, life and all shall goe, to be spent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded, and ended for my God, my Queene, and my Countrie, against that Antichrist of <hi>Rome,</hi> the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious tyrant of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and all forren forces, and home-borne traytors whatsoeuer; else should I

thinke my selfe vnworthie to liue. To stirre vp others, I haue presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to giue an attempt in these few leaues following: wherein if I haue erred in any part of the matter, let my want of experience excuse me: if I haue erred in the forme, let my ignorance excuse me: and if I haue erred both in matter and forme, yet let my faults in all be excused; because my zeale to religion, my loyaltie to my deare Soueraigne, and my loue to my natiue Countrie, hath enforced me to make this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, rather choosing to bewray my simplicitie &amp; wants, than that I would defraude my countrymen from being put in minde of matter so needfull for them (in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit) not onely to thinke of, but to be throughly resolued in; that with confidence, boldnes, &amp; assurance of
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
the goodnes of our cause, we might with heart and hand be prest and readie to take our places, and to march on to the field, when our Soueraignes authoritie commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and there to set forward with a swift foote against these enemies of God, our Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and our Countrie, whensoeuer they shall dare to shew their faces against vs.</p>
