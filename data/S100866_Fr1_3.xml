                 <title>A discovery of subterraneall treasure : viz. of all manner of mines and mineralls, from the gold to the coale; with plaine directions and rules for the finding of them in all kingdoms and countries. And also the art of melting, refining, and assaying of them is plainly declared, so that every ordinary man, that is indifferently capacious, may with small change presently try the value of such oares as shall be found either by rule or by accident. Whereunto is added a reall experiment whereby every ignorant man may presently try whether any peece of gold that shal come to his hands be true or connterfeit [sic] ... Also a perfect way to try what colour any berry, leafe, flower, stalke, root, fruit, seed, barke, or wood will give: with a perfect way to make colours that they shall not stayne nor fade like ordinary colours</title>

   <head>TO HIS VVORTHY FRIEND MASTER William Englebert
<hi>Esquire.</hi> Health, and Happinesse Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Eternall, is
heartily wished.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>SIR,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He goodnesse of your disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath brought you to
this trouble and paines at this time, to peruse these Lines; by giving me
so free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your Iudicious approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my former labours: now you have
gotten a Customer of mee, for the like courtesie to bee renewed; for which
I shall bee bound in a double Bond.</p>
   <p>When I reade the words of our SAVIOVR CHRIST, after hee had fed
such a number of people with a few Loaves and Fishes, <hi>viz.</hi> How hee
Commanded the broken Meate to bee gathered up carefully that nothing be lost;
when as hee could (no doubt) have made an hundred times as much with a word
spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: I conceived that it was done for a patterne of frugality, to
shew us how carefull
<pb facs="4"/>wee ought to bee in the preservation of such things
from losse, which are ordained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and sustaine the lives of
Men: therefore I being from my Child-hood a strict observer of the great
losse that came to this Country, partly through ignorance, and partly
through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, in raysing that benefit out of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall, and
subterraneall Treasures of the Earth, ordained of GOD (no doubt) for the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe and sustenance of mens livings; thought that I could not bee
better employed, then to advertise the World thereof, and to Divulge my
knowledge, and experience in these affaires for the common profit; dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
my selfe obliged thereunto; for that it hath pleased GOD to give a large
bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to my long labours, and Charges spent in these and such
like affaires.</p>
   <p>Also when I heard the manifold complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of indigent people,
of the hardnesse of the World, and of the difficultie of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their
livings: I have knowne many people of indifferent vertuous dispositions,
for very want of meanes, to take in hand some actions which were not
laudable.</p>
   <p>These with divers other Motives have beene spurres to mee, to
Publish not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Booke of the discovery of Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall
Treasures; but also my other Booke, mentioned in the Preface ensuing, of
the Discovery of hidden Treasures in the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Earth: Both
which Bookes, if they
<pb facs="4"/>shall bee diligently perused, and industriously
practised; will administer sufficient cure for all the Maladies before
mentioned.</p>
   <p>Now whereas the Custome is to make choice of a Patron to protect
the Author from the Calumniations of malevolent spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; yea, though
experience her selfe (the Mistresse of Art) shall be ready as an
Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, to manifest the truth of his asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for that opinion is
generally Deified, and almost every where swayeth all; and this worthy
Mistris Experience (which suffereth no imposture to raigne) is many times
lightly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and thrust out of the doores.</p>
   <p>I therefore beseech you once againe to lend mee your grave
Judgement, and approbation, ripened by threescore yeares practice, and
expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, in things partly of this nature, which I will make bold to put
into the Ballance, to over-weigh the ignorance, and unskilfulnesse of all
detractors whatsoever; making no question, but that as Thunder and
Lightning caused <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> to creepe into an hole:
notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his boldnesse, and hardnesse in calme weather: In
like manner so manifest experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will drive away all Sophisticall
oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. So I humbly take my leave</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your bounden Servant, <hi>Gabriel
Plattes.</hi>
      </signed>
