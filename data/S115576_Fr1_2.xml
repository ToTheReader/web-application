      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing with an vnskilful hand taught this booke to speake English, I thought that I should be like an euill player marring the last act of the tragedic, or a carelesse pilot drowning the ship in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, if I ventured it to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers censures of men, before it were entrusted to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of some such authoritie, as might restraine and binde the ouerflowings of other mens more hard opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For although the worthines of the subiect might worke in me an ouerweening hope of his kinde enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; yet I cannot satisfie my selfe, vnlesse it passe vnder the tutele &amp; protection of some one, whose fauour may (like the verticall sunne) abate all shadowes, either of enuy or disgrace, which are in this (still woorse &amp; woorse) age of the world readie to discountenance the fruites of any mans labour. Wherefore considering with my selfe, where to bestow it, I was emboldened by the inducement
<pb facs="3"/>
of diuers reasons to presume on your Lordship, ascertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my selfe, that the honorable vertues, which haue wound you into the liking of all men, haue setled so good an impression, as is forcible ynough to make that seeme commendable, which is graced by your Honors name onely. And for this respect amongst infinite others here for speciall reasons silenced, in hope of fauorable accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I most humbly present it to your Honor, challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to my selfe nothing but the imperfections in the harsh composure, and conueiance of the stile, retaining yet (as I trust) the former strength and substance. If your L. vouchsafe to receiue it, it may be that (although in the perusall it cannot enforme your Honor any thing, which you were ignorant of) yet it may confirme that, which otherwise your Honor doubted; or make it cleerer by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering the circumstances in more particular termes. Onely thus much (vnder leaue of a better iudgement) I dare say, that there is no booke extant touching the same argument, which can aequalize it, either for soundnes in iudicially censuring; truth in sincerely relating; or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiousnes in briefing such varietie of matter to so small a volume. And here although I could according to the vsuall forme of epistles indeuor a draught of your most honorable praises; yet knowing, that it is but tediousnes, where vertue is loued for the onely inner contentment, I put a period to these lines, and most humbly crauing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don take leaue.</p>
