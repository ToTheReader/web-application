But he did purposly omit it there, because it was an Argument too Scholasticall, for a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Auditory, but he having finished this in the Ʋniversitie in an exercise ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the trayning up of the sons of the Prophets, I thought it fit not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
<pb facs="3"/>it, but to insert it in this place, that so the treatise might be the more comple at: If it doe in some things exceed the capacity of the ordinary Reader, he must remember that the Argument it self is more Scholasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call then popular, yet much of it may be usefull to most, and all of it delightfull and profitable to the ingenious Scholar, to whom it will be the more profitable if he do peruse the rest of the Treatises: Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is a practicall Art, not only specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and so the end of it is operation: He is the best Schollar, and best understands what Divinity is, that hath learned to know and worship <hi>God</hi> so, that he may live well here and happily hereafter: If in this Treatise or those other Sermons, to which this is annexed, things doe not fall out to thy mind, divide the blame betwixt the Printer and Transcriber, and rather lay it upon the publisher then the Author: So I rest,</p>
