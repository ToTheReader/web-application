      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Gentlemen, I hope Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breeches shall finde your gentle Censors of this homely Apologie of his antient prerogatiues sithe though he speakes againste Veluet breeches which you were, yet hee twits not the weede but the vice, not the apparell when tis worthily worne, but the vnworthie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that weares it, who sprang of a Peasant will vse any sinister meanes to clime to preferment, beeing then so proude as the foppe forgets like the Asse that a mule was his father. For auntient Gentility and yeomanrie, Cloth breeches attempteth this quarrell, and hopes of their fauour: for vpstarts he is halfe careles, and the more, bicause hee knowes whatsoeuer some thinke priuately, they will be no publike carpers: least by kicking where they are toucht, they bewray their gald backs to the world, and by starting vppe to find fault, proue themselues vpstarts and fooles. So then poor Cloth breeches sets downe his rest on the courtesie of gentle gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and bold Yeomen, that they will suffer him to take no wrong. But suppose the worst, that hee

should be fround at, and that such occupations as he hath vpon conscience discarded from the Iury, should commence an action of vnkindnesse against him, heele proue it not to hold plea, because al the debate was but a dreame. And so hoping all men will merrilie take it, he standes sollemnlie leaning on his pike staffe, till he heere what you conceaue of him for being so peremtorie. If well, he swears to cracke his hose at the knees to quite your cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie. If hardly, he hath vowed that whatsoeuer he dreames neuer to blabbe it againe, and so he wisheth me humbly to bid you farewell.</p>
