   <p>HAuing considered the careles regard of many concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the
health of themselues, and others, and the great necessitie in this
greiuous visitation: I could not but inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to counsell, and to releeue
by this poore pamphlet, poore in regard of plainenesse, respecting the
plainer sort, whose welcome shall admonish wearinesse to be
wanting, when I shall heareafter in better sort be busied, in finishing
this slender and short labour, posted forward to helpe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not to
finish such a needfull worke, which I leaue to the long deuised, and
learned lines of others, extant, or to come, whome I neuer minded to rob of any
rightes, neither purposed to preuent by publishing of this: but as all
could not be free masons, goldsmithes, and principall workmen at the
building of the temple, for then few of them should haue liued, to haue
finished their worke, or haue seene the vse thereof, and for that the
commaundement, necessitie, and the godly end thereof, did mooue the meaner
sort, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they brought timber, stone, morter, rubbish, and
neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie matter for the workemen, to make choise of: So in my well
wishing to helpe, I could not combine with content, to take ease, and be
absent from building, hauing no more gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous meanes, or curious matter, but
against feare to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Zoilus, Theon, and the curious crew, haue posted
this pamphlet, to passe for a welcome, to so many, as shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
feele themselues better mooued, or any waies amended. In hope whereof I
commend thee with my prayers to the physitian of soule and body.</p>
