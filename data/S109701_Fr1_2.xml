   <head>Fyrst here foloweth an Epistole vnto the reder by the same byshop.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>y dere brother or syster in our sauiour Christe Jesu / who so euer ye be / y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> shall fortune to rede this queare our lorde for his great mercy graunt you his grace / that the redyng therof some what may proffit your soule.</p>
   <p>Fyrst I shall beseche you nat to misconstrue myn entēt / in puttyng forthe this queare to be printed / but that ye take it to the best. For verily my wyll and mynde is / that some frute myght ryse by the same vnto the christē people / whiche be the spouse of Christe. Unto whom (though vnworthy) I am ordeyned a minister for my lytell porcion. My du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to endeuer me after my poure power / to resist these heretickes / the whiche seasse nat to subuett the churche of Christe. If we shall syt styll and let them in euery place sowe theyr vngratious here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies / and euery where distroye the soulis / whiche were so derely bought with that moste precious blode of our sauiour Christe Jesu / howe terribly shall he lay this vntyll our charge / whan we shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be called vntyll a rekenynge for this matter? It shalbe moche rebukefull and moche worthy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishement / if we for our party shall nat gyue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gēce for the defence of the true christen people / fro these heresies / as these heretickes gyue for the corruption of the same / specially whan we be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne / that our labour shall nat be vnrewarded / 
<pb facs="3"/>
as saint Paule dothe promyse / sayeng / Vnusquis{que} propriam mercedem accipiet secūdū suum laborem: Euery<note place="margin">1. Cor̄. 3.</note> man shall take his owne rewarde accordynge to his labour. And so moche the more diligence we muste gyue / bicause that the wretched nature of man is more prone to euery thynge / that nought is / than it is to that / whiche is of greatter frute. The dry tēder is nat more redy to be kendled with the leaste sparkell of fyre / than we be redy to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed to all euyll. Our hartes by the olde corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of synne / be of that molde / that they withoutē any great diligence of them selfe / brynge for the all maner of vices: but nothynge that vertuous is / withouten a great labour. And assuredly these he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relies be lyke the stynkynge weedes / the whiche ī euery erthe sprynge by them selfe: for as these e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll weedes nede no settynge / no sowynge / no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terynge / no wedynge / nor suche other deligence / as the good herbes require / but sprynge anone withouten all that busines: and where they haue enteres ones in any grounde / it is veray herde to delyuer that grounde from them: euen so it is of these heresies / they nede no plantynge / they nede no wateryng / they nede no lowkyng / nor wedyng / but rankly sprynge by them selfe / of a full lyght occasion. Contrary wyse it is of true doctryne of god / this is lyke vnto the good herbes / whiche wil nat euery where lightly growe / but they must be set or sowen in a chosen erthe / they must be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred / they muste be weded / and haue moche at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendaunce / orels they wyll anone myscary. Ye
<pb facs="3"/>
may se this euidently by the begynnyng of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis churche. Our sauiour whan he hym selfe dyd sowe his doctryne / he complayned of the vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes of mennes hartes / and sayd: Sermo meus<note place="margin">Jo. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

And vpon a tyme a great nombre of his disciples forsoke hym and cast hym vp: For theyr hartes coude nat sauour his doctrine. If this doctrine sowen by this most myghty and counnynge sower / toke none effecte in these persons hartes / ye may se / that the erth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

Doth he nat crye out therfore vpon y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Galathes / bicause that this doctrine / whiche he had sowen amonge them / sone after his deperture from them / dyd wyther in theyr hartes?

If ther were suche perill of heretickes in the tyme of saint Paule / as it dothe appere in all his episto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les: and if y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> heresies thā so lightly toke roote in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hartes of men: And if the sede of the doctryne of Christe with suche difficultie did sprynge &amp; growe in the hartes of the people / whiche were in that maruelous &amp; plentuous tyme of all grace: What wonder is it that lykewyse nowe / in this misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tyme / these heretickes multiply / and theyr he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies do sprede? Whan hit was prophesied before nat onely by our sauiour Christe / but also by saynt Peter in his epistoles / and by saynt Paule in his bothe / and by saynt Jude / that suche heresyes shulde ryse / and specially towarde thende of the worlde. Nowe therfore whan so litell diligence is done about the ministryng of this true doctryne / it is necessary that all tho that haue charge of the flocke of Christe / endeuour them selfe to gayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande these pernitious heresies. Wherin doutles the moost Reuerend father in god my lorde legate hath nowe meritoriously traueiled / and so enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to perseuer and to continue / to the full extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiō of the same. For heresy is a perillous wede / it is the sede of the deuyll / the inspiration of the wicked spirites / the corruption of oux hartes / the
<pb facs="4"/>
blyndyng of our sight / the quenching of our faith / the distruction of all good frute / and fynally the mourder of our soules. And therfore some what to resist this wicked sede / by the mocion of dyuerse persōs / I haue put forth this sermon to be redde / whiche for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> great noyse of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> people within y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che of Paules / whan it was sayde / myght nat be herde.

      </gap>btyll disputations of the schole. Seconde. if it may lyke the same disciple to come vnto me secretely / and breake his mynde at more length / I bynde me by these presentes / bothe to kepe his secreasy / and also to spare a leysoure for hym to here the bottum of his mynde / and he shal here myne agayne / if it so please hym: and I trust in our lorde / that fynally we shall so agre / that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he shal make me a Lutherā / orels I shal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce hym to be a catholyke / and to folowe the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctryne of Christis churche. And one thynge I do acertayne hym / that though his maister Luther dydlyue neuer so well and perfetly / yet for as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che as his doctryne is dyuerse from the doctryne of the churche he is to be fled: for so teacheth vs y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy mertyr Ignacius in his epistole ad Herene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um / sayeng: Omnis igitur qui dixerit preter ea / que tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dita sunt / tametsi fide dignus sit / tametsi ieiunet / tametsi virginitatē seruet / tametsi signa faciat / tametsi prophetet / 
<pb facs="5"/>
supus tivi appareat in grege ouium / corruptionem faciens. That is to say / who so euer affermeth contrary to the traditions and doctrine of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> churche / though he for his lyfe be worthy to be beleued / though he fast neuer so moche / though he kepe his virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te / though he worke miracles though he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of thynges for to come / for all this take hym but as a wolfe / intendynge corruption amonge a flocke of shepe. Wherfore whan Luther hath in hym none of these good conditions aboue reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed / as we shall proue here after / that is to say / he neither is faith worthy / bicause of his repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant doctryne / nor he chastiseth nat his body by fastynge / nor he kepeth nat his virginite / nor he doth no miracles / nor he is no prophet of thynges for to come / and yet neuertheles he techeth clene contrary doctrynes vnto the doctryne of the churche / he is to be reputed as a wolfe corruptyng the flocke of Christe. Thus fare ye well in our lorde Jesu.</p>
