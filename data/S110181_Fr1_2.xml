   <p>and of the yongest, of those of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in that place: and yet as a chicken vnder the wings of your Lordships fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, I rest in hope of defence, frō the scarring practises of such, as (deseruedly or vndeseruedly) make profers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest meanes to bereaue the credite of all and some of those that are or should be, as I (for functions sake) desire to bee: namely, as one able to execute, &amp; with truth to prosecute our vocation, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Attorneis: which office, as it hath and ought to be of credite, so ought it to be executed with honesty and trueth (as it is not vnknowen to too many of vs) is growen into contempt of many. In respect (I thinke) of the ignoraunce that the rudest sort are blinded with, that they see not their owne ease and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, slaundering the honest minded for the misbehauiour of the vnsatiable, and vnhonest dealers sakes. But right hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, omitting that, it resteth to craue humble pardon for my presumptuous andacitie, wherein as a poore Cobler, I presume to shew my selfe as it were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb facs="2"/>
to take a pensell in hand to frame a goodly whole and perfect picture, whē (in deede) I know not how to cast the proportion of the very shooe it selfe: yet (alwayes hoping pardon) hauing by experience, a certaine sparke and feeling of sundry extraordinary and approued errours, manifest, resting and daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing, among the lowest, as (also) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those of higher calling and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce: I presumed vpon my slender learning, to make a shew of the erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and peruerse conceit, that a man of these our dayes, in the time of the cleare light, was so besotted in the miste of the voluptuous cares of this cankered world, that he could not see the way to trueth, but betooke himselfe, to the way of sinfull securitie, a man yet breathing, whose reformatiō I heartily wish: And (to the end) that by his folly, other may learne wisedome, and that by his refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, other may bee reformed: I haue attributed vnto this poore piece of worke (of mine) the Title of, A Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Mans Solace: for that it is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

to all men, and hurtfull to none: I haue contriued it into seuen seuerall dayes conference, betweene Christ and a Sinner: Wherein it may appeare, that as the mindes of men being euill, the dayes dangerous, and good endeuours, rare and seldome: So is our Heauenly Solace, our Mediatour Christ, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, through his grace, to redresse the one, and to stirre vp the other: wherein his willingnes, and care of our saluatiō, his mercy and fauour shewed, and our peruersitie and weakenes, laid open, and Sathan vanquished: Which (right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable) I haue endeuored to set downe (according to the trueth) as well, for mine owne priuate comfort, as for the commoditie that others may reape of the same: Although) perchance) it may be obiected against me, that I am of an other profession, vnlerned, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, a greene head, &amp; of no iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I yeeld me guilty of all: onely, my profession, as a Christian, I stand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: though not a professed Diuine, but a poore Punie, that is willing to be

instructed of the more learned and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diuines: presuming herein, to make trial, whither it wil winne me condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or good liking: praise or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise: fauour, or ill will: But being so resolued of your (good Lordships) good liking of the thing, tending to a good purpose: though not so pithily and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly handled, as beseemed this piece of work: I rest so much the more, in hope, that your fauour, will breed other mens good affection, to this trauaile: tending to the good o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

hardning so our heartes, that we, very seldome, reforme our liues: nor althogh we be (daily) called to vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, like vntamed coltes, too well fed, that know neither master, want, or wo: we run (headlong) after the fleshly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our vnstaied will, worse then the silly birds of the ayre, the beasts or wormes of the earth: who know their times and seasons, and keepe the law of their natural custome, as ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe reporte, that the Storke by the Skyes, knoweth the time and season of the yeare, the Crane, the Turtledoue, and diuers other birdes, beastes, and wormes, by their comming and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doe argue that they haue a certayn knowledg, that it is not alwayes Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer nor alwayes Winter: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the time they laboure, they rest, they come, they goe, they fast and feed: and therfore doth the Ant, as the least among the rest, gather in the Summer, to supply his want in the Winter.

A most miserable blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it is, whiche hath thus darkened the sences of man, that, hauing in this world, so many experiences, of the mercie, loue, and liberalitie of the Lord,, through his Giftes, his creatures and disposition of thinges wonderfull, for the vse of man.

how he turneth them ouer in to a reprobate and darke senee, that they may see, and not perceiue: and heare and not vnderstande, the deepenes of his Iudgementes: For, as he is merciful, so he is iust: as he giueth, so he taketh awaye: he is a mercifull father, but a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueare Iudge: behoulding with angrye countenaunce, the peruers and loose wayes of men: which although he omyt to punysh for a time, he hath a Rod, prouided: an Iron Rod, to beate (euen to powder) those that offend, of malicious wickednes: wherfore, he wylleth vs to be circumspect to walke honestly as in the day tyme: not, in banquetyng, in Chambering and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse: but according to the trueth: So shall our days be long and happy, vp on earth: and after this lyfe, our Ioyes be with out end.
