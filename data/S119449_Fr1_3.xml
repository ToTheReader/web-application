Euer since I practised spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, I haue practised singing; hauing had noe other qualitie to hinder me from the perfect knowledge of this faculty, I haue been incouraged by the warrant of diuers good iudgments, that my paines herein shall at the least procure good liking, if not delight, which yet for mine owne part I must needes feare as much as I desire, especially when I consider the ripenes of this industrious age, wherein all men ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to knowe all thinges, I confesse I was not vnwilling to embrace the conceits of such gentlemen as were earnest to haue me apparel these dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for them; which though they intended for their priuate recreation, neuer meaning they should come into the light, were yet content vpon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty to make the incouragements of this my first adventure, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon I was almost glad to make my small skill knowne to the world: presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that if my cunning failed me in the Musicke: yet the words might speake for themselues, howsoeuer it pleaseth them to account better of that, then of those. Of purpose (as it should seeme) to make me belieue I can do something; my only hope is, that seeing neither my cold ayres, not their idle ditties (as they will needes haue me call them) have hitherto beene sounded in the eares of manie: they maie chance to finde such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, as commonlie newes doth in the world: which if I may be so happie to beare, I will not saie my next shall be better, but I will promise to take more paines to shew more points of musicke, which now I could not do, because my chiefest care was to fit the Note to the Word, till when, I must be as well content with each mans lawfull censure, as I shall be glad of some mens vndeserued favours.</add>
