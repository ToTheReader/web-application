                 <title>The apologie for the conformable ministers of England, for their subscription to the present church gouernement : wherein is handled two things, the first is, that the setting vp of the primitiue church gouernement, vnder a Christian king is not a matter of necessitie, and this is prooued by twentie substantiall reasons : the second is, that the gouernement of the church as now it standeth, differeth not from the primitiue gouernement, but onely in one materiall and necessarie circumstance written by Iohn Freeman, minister of the Gospel</title>

      </gap>nts, is a thing so vsuall with God and men, that euen the heauens and the earth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten haue had experience thereof. For in the heauens hath the Lord set vp a new King to raigne ouer all the powers of heauen: ouer the principalities and the glorious thrones, ouer al the Angels of God, and ouer all the soules of the iust: yea ouer all the Kings and kingdomes of the earth: and ouer all the people of the world. Yea, this King hath the keyes of hell, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>nd of death, and this new King whom God hath set a Lord and king ouer all, is the Lord Iesus, a man taken from among men, yea out of the dust of death, and out of the graue. Him hath God lifted vp (with showting, and the song of the Trumpet, with great honour and exceeding glorie and ioy) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heauen, and set him vpon his right hand, and established him an euerlasting Lord and King: and this is hee whome now all the Angels and powers of heauen do worship, whom all the soules, and spirits of the dead that liue, do worshippe as the King, and prince of God: and this all kings of the earth worship, and fall downe before him, and licke the dust at his feete. And that the Church on earth might haue experience of this changeable estate, Christ that once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ted the Elders of the Church, to gouerne for him that part of his Kingdome on the earth, that wee call the Church, hath in steade of them, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t vp the Kings, and the princes of the earth to rule, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the weale publike, but the Kingdom of Christ on the earth, which is the Church of God. If thou askest when this change was made, and when this ruling power was translated from the Church to the
<pb facs="6"/> King: this booke will answere thee, and tel thee, that when Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Christian, they gained a kingdom on earth, that they lost before euen a kingdom ouer the kingdom of Christ, and besides, a kingdom in heauen, where they that raigne well, being Kings on earth, shall raign also Kings in heauen with Iesus, that Lord and mightie King. If thou askest what word there is to warrant this change: it will shewe thee, that it is warranted by the spirit of Prophecie, that spake in <hi>Esay</hi> the Prophet, that foretold, that <hi>Kings should be nursing Fathers, and Queens nursing mothers</hi> to the Church, to feede vs not onely with the word, but the sword: that is, to rule and gouern prudently, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did the Church of God. If thou askest the reasons of the change this booke will yeelde thee twenty at the least, to resolue thee of this point: it wil let thee plainly see, that the power to rule, that once was in the Church when Kings were not yet Christians, is now, that Kings are become Christians, departed from the Church, &amp; d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>uolued to the Christian King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, as to the proper owners &amp; right heires of so great a power. And here I must tell thee, that this doctrine, as it hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies, that for want of eye-salue, cannot see into the end of the Primitiue gouernment abolished: so it hath many friends, men of a nimbler eye and quicke sight, that dare vphold it with the best member that they haue. And that in one view thou mightest see both the friends and the foes, I will in a word set them before thee. The principall enemy of this doctrine is the Pope, who hauing seazed vpon the Kingdome of Christ, holdeth fast the power, and exerciseth the gouernment of the Church ouer the Kings, and the princes of the earth, and holdeth opinion, that the power that Christ gaue to his Church to gouerne and to rule, is perpetuall, and that it may not be taken away from the Church by any of the kings of the earth. This opinion of his, is seconded by the Brownists, and by our brethren Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, that are silenced, because they claime this power as their right in the name of Iesus, and will not yeeld it to the King: as if Kings in this light of the Gospel could be hooded as they were in the dayes of darkenesse. or if Kings that shooke off but lately the yoke of the Pope, would againe put their neckes vnder the yoke of the Eldership<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> but so
<pb facs="7"/> our brethren beleeue, and so they had, as the Pope that the power to rule that was giuen to <hi>Peter</hi> and to the primitiue Church, is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: and that is may not be taken away the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>nges of the earth without their greate sinne: and this opinion of theirs and of the Pope, is esteemed with the Christian professors of our time as the onely truth of god, as if popery, were the onely true and sound religion, and these are the enemies of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of mine: the friendes of this opinion were <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer,</hi> and the rest of the Martyrs, and the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> in the daies of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, who with one voice did yeeld vnto the King the whole power and rule ouer the Church of <hi>England:</hi> yea the same power ouer the Church that was in <hi>Dauid Salomon,</hi> &amp; the rest of the godly kings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uer the Church of Iuda, &amp; to this they subscribed in the Article of the Kings supremacy, &amp; this opiniō is that which is secōded by our Bish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ps, vpheld by our gratious Prince, subscribed vnto by vs, the peaceable, and orthodox Ministers, and now defended in this my booke: that derogateth the ruling pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from the Pope, that he inioyeth t:hat derogateth the ruling power from the Church, that the Primitiue Church had: that doth not arrogate this power to any of the Ministers of the Church, but ascribeth it wholy vnto the King, as the vicegerent of Christ, for the gouerning of his earthly kingdome. Now Christian Reader whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be better to erre with the Pope, and the abetters and friends of the Pope, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
