      <hi>

(moste deare &amp; gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Reader) the two
Bookes of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Clercke and
auncient father S.
Ambrose, sometime
Byshop of Milleyn, entituled: Of the
vocation and callyng of all Nacions.
A worke surely of no lesse diuine wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and learnyng, then of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
and therefore a Iewell greatly to
be esteemed and had in price of al those
that be Godlye in Christes Churche,
who earnestly desire a right spirite and
iudgement purely to discerne betwene
trueth and errour in these peryllous
dayes: Wherin as our Sauiour Iesus
Christ affirmeth,<note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> that (yf it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible)
the very electe myght be discey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
But chiefly it is to be had in price<note place="margin">Mark. 13.</note>
of all those, who not hauyng the Latin
tongue, are not able to reade the work
to theyr edifying in the tongue wherin
it was firste wrytten and compyled.
To whom the sayde auncient Father
and famous Clercke in this presente
<pb facs="3"/>
treatise, speaketh nowe more famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
then before. The worke it selfe is
such as needeth not my praise: But se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
I can not sufficiently expresse the
woorthynesse thereof, I thynke it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to omitt it with scilence, confessing
my barreynesse, then for lacke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
speache to diminishe the glory
therof. These and suche lyke workes
haue not aforetyme ben so freely offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the vnderstanding of the simple,
nor so easely come by, as (God be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for it) they are in these our dayes.
Receiue them therefore louyngly and
thanckfullye (good Christen Reader)
and vse them godly aud reuerently: for
they are the good instruments &amp; tooles
wherby the eternall God buyldeth the
spirituall Ierusalem his Churche,<note place="margin">1. peter. 2.</note> and
by whom the lyuyng stones therof, his
elect children, are dayly wrought, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
&amp; full fashioned vnto euerlastyng
lyfe.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> Learne also to render vnto God
moste heartye thanckes therfore: who
shewyng more mercye vnto thee, then
vnto manye generations paste. As he
hath caused thee to be borne in these
peryllous dayes: so hath he prepared
armure and weapon for thee, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb facs="3"/>
thou maist defend thy self against
all those enemies that shall aryse vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
thee. The occasion that moued
Saint Ambrose to wryte this woorke
was this. There arose in Britayne in
those dayes a Monke named Pelagius
Byshop of Bangor, that became the
aucthour of a new sect before that time
not heard of. This man with the helpe
of Celestine &amp; Iulian his fautors, drew
many into his errour: He attributed
so much vnto the free will of man, that
he affirmed that a man mought atteine
lyfe euerlastyng by merites only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the grace of Christ. Wherof he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
blamed, gaue place to thadmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in suche sorte, that he dyd not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde
altogether exclude grace: but
sayd, that yf grace were geuen, it was
the easyer to attayne to saluacion, how
beit without it, it mought be obteyned
though with more difficultie. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned
praying in the congregatiō,
aswell for the faythfull as for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faythfull,
as a thing vayne and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable:
because (as he said) that which
they should aske, was already in their
power, which with their diligence eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them myght do &amp; perfourme.
<pb facs="4"/>
But when he feared least he should be
condempned for it by the councell of
Antioche, he recanted, althoughe he
ceassed not afterwardes to teach the
same in his wrytinges. He added fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
that the sinne of Adam hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no man but him that committed it.
Also that all Infantes were borne as
innocent &amp; cleane from sinne, as Adam
was when God first created hym. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
he permitted them to bee
baptized, not to the puttyng awaye of
sinne, whereof he affirmed them to be
voyde: but that they might be honored
with the Sacrament of their adoption.
And when he was publysshed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed
to be an hereticke: he wrote
in the defence of his errour. He was
condempned by Zosimus, and twoo
C.xl. Byshoppes moe in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Carthage: and before that, he
was condempned bi <hi>Innocentius,</hi> whose
errour whē the Affricans with others
(especially this aucthour S. Ambrose,
S. Augustine, and S. Iherome) vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
detested, they tooke in hand by their
seuerall wrytynges to put to scilence
the remnaunte of that secte. Sithens
the which time it hath ben reputed and
<pb facs="4"/>
taken of all the godly learned in Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
Churche, for a cursed prophane &amp;
Phylosophycall errour.</p>
   <p>I haue shewed thee (gentle Reader)
the cause or reason of the first makyng
and compylyng of this worke. Nowe
it standeth me in steede to shewe thee
the cause of this my trauell in reducing
it into the Englyshe tongue. There a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
in Kent in these late dayes, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sithens the preachyng of the Gospel,
a priuate man altogether vnlearned,
named Henry Hart, that reuiued this
errour of Pelagius, and added thereto
certeyne other errours. This man
with the helpe of his adherentes, newe
furbed this olde cancred heresye, and
put it to sale a fresshe in stede of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
veritie, who also vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence
of a sober lyfe and conuersation
vsyng long heare, long bearde, long
garmētes, &amp; often reading of psalmes,
drewe manye into his errour both in
Eastkent, in Essex, Sussex, Surrey, &amp;
in the Citie of London.</p>
   <p>This man, after that his errour was
espyed by the late Tharchbishoppe of
Caunterburye Thomas Cranmer,
was by hym committed to prison, with
<pb facs="5"/>
certeyne of his secte (of whom some
remayne alyue, holdynge that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
some thanked be God are become
newe men, and other some are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this lyfe) and there they remayned
vntyll they reuoked theyr errour, and
colourably subscrybed to the Artycles
agreed vpon in the Synode holden at
London, in the reigne of the late kyng
Edwarde the sixte. Notwithstanding
in hucker mucker he euer taught the
same vnto those only which he knewe
to be trustye, and vnto those that were
brought in by them: who held the said
Harte in such reputacion, as yf he had
ben an holy Prophete. But after the
death of kyng Edwarde, when Quene
Mary began her dominion, &amp; the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Clergie was scattered abrode,
this Hart and his companions began
to shewe them selues in theyr old lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of errour agayne, with much more
errour whiche they in the meane tyme
had practised, forged, and gathered,
with whom (when diuers of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
chaunced to meete in the time of
persecution) we hadde more to do, then
we had with al the rest of our enemies.</p>
   <p>And because (deare Reader) thou
<pb facs="5"/>
shouldest not be ignoraunt of theyr er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
I haue noted some parte of it in
certeyne perticulers here folowyng.</p>
   <p>1. First they holde and affirme, that
the doctrine of predestination and elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as it was taught of the Christen
Clergie of this Realm in the reigne of
kyng Edwarde the syxte, and agreed
vpon in the Synode of London. Anno.
domini. 1552. is not a doctrine meete
or necessary to be taught in the Church
of God.</p>
   <p>2. Secondly, that they that hold the
sayd doctrine, do erre dampnably.</p>
   <p>3. Thirdly, that God hath predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
or elected man none otherwyse
then vpon the condicion of the kepyng
of the lawe: the whiche yf man on his
part do not obserue, he loseth his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination
and election.</p>
   <p>4. Fourth, that no man is so repro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bated
but that he maye escape it, and
become an elect and be saued, nor any
man so elected but that he may lose his
election, become a reprobate and be
dampned, by godly or vngodly lyuyng.</p>
   <p>5. Fyfth, that Esau was no more
reproued then Iacob, nor Iacob anye
<pb facs="6"/>
more elected then Esau, before the one
of them had lyued godly, and the other
vngodly.</p>
   <p>6. Sixth, that all men vniuersallye
are called with one &amp; the same callyng,
the wicked aswell as the godlye, and
Iudas aswell as the Apostles.</p>
   <p>7. Seuenth, that yf Gods predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
&amp; purpose in election were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
and absolute, and God resolued
and immutablye determined what to
do with mankynde his creature, then
shoulde the preachyng of repentaunce
be in vayne, because the elect could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
mysse heauen, nor the reprobates
escape hell: and so a great part of the
Scriptures of the holy Byble (namely
so much as concerned repentaunce and
godly lyuyng) shoulde serue to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
but to fyll vppe the booke with
wordes and leaues.</p>
   <p>8. Eyghth, yf God shoulde prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
some and not other some, electe
one &amp; not another, geue greater grace
to one then to another: that it shoulde
folowe that God were not indifferent
but parciall.</p>
   <p>9. Nynthlie, that all and as many
arose agayne in Adams loynes when
<pb facs="6"/>
Adam beleued the promyse, as fell in
Adams loynes by the transgression,
and that assone as Adam beleued they
were all restored to the former inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie
that Adam had before he sinned,
and that they lost nothyng there by but
the free accesse or commyng to the tree
of lyfe.</p>
   <p>10. Tenth, that the chyldren come
or borne of christen parentes, or of one
chrysten parent at the least, are cleane
borne, that is to saye, voyde of synne,
both original and actuall, and therfore
a superfluous worke to baptize them
in that case, and that they do fyrste re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
sinne by the outwarde sences, as
by hearyng, seeyng, and imitacion of
others.</p>
   <p>11. Eleuenth, that there is but one
onely grace, which is equallye and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
conferred and geuen to all
men in their creation: and that al men
haue naturally the election and choyse
of a free wyll to come to GOD when
they be called, or to refuse, to beleue
or not to beleue, to loue and to chose, or
to hate &amp; refuse, eyther good or euyll.</p>
   <p>12. Twelth, that all men be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
before they be borne, hauyng
<pb facs="7"/>
the spirite of Godde in theyr mothers
wombes, as had Iacob, Ieremye, and
Iohn Baptist: and the regeneration
that foloweth the naturall birth, is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alway or for the moste parte vnto
euyll: Because it is wrytten in the
booke of Psalmes. psal. 58. Assone as
they are borne they goe astray &amp; speake
lyes. The which cannot (saye they) be
vnderstand of Infantes, &amp; of theyr na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
byrth, who assone as they are
borne of their parentes, can neither go
nor speake.</p>
   <p>13. Thirtenth, that it is to be thought
that the yonge chyldren of Turkes and
Infideles, neyther baptized nor profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe
Chryste or Christian religion, yf
they die in theyr infancie, are saued.</p>
   <p>14. Fourtenth, that the luste or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
remayninge in the fleshe of
men regenerate and yonge children, is
not sinne: Because that somtimes men
haue luste to eate and drinke, and also
to do the nedefull offices of the bodye
whiche of themselues cannot bee saide
to be synne.</p>
   <p>15. Fiftenth, that Iesus Christ the
soone of god had also such motions and
temptacions vnto euyll, as other mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb facs="7"/>
men haue, though he consented not,
nor gaue ouer himself vnto them. And
that the temptacions that he hadde in
the deserte, and the conflicte there had
with Sathan, were altogether suche
inwarde motions and temptacions,
and not by any extreme or outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll
as Tom painter fayneth.</p>
   <p>16. Sixtenth, that all Christian men,
hauinge the talent, and feelinge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be moued thereto, maye lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and also ought to vtter the same
by the waye of publique teachinge or
preachyng to others, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loking for admission by man. And
though that the preachinge of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 1. Tim, 3.</note>
and the administracion of the holy
Sacramentes be called an offyce, and
an ordinaunce of god in the scriptures:
Yet that euery man indifferently may
attēpt to do the same, so that he thinke
hymselfe to bee moued thereto of God,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.</note>
and haue a mouth to speake.</p>
   <p>17. Seuententh, that mens workes,
commentaries, and iudgementes vpon
the Scriptures ought not to bee recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
read nor alleged in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but to be vtterly refused, because
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hat menne maye, haue, and doe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="8"/>
erre.</p>
   <p>18. Eightenth, that men godly geuen
may and do lyue in this world without
sinne, because it is wrytten: He that
sinneth is of the deuill.<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.</note> &amp;c. but all men
are not of the deuill, for many there are
that are borne of GOD, ergo there are
many that sinne not. And though they
haue sinne in them, yet committe they
none: like as a man may haue weapon
about hym though he fighte not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
   <p>19. Nintenth, though the orthodoxe
faith according to the diuine scriptures
doth confesse God to be a spirite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
partes, passions or mutabilitie, yet
say thei that God is verely angry, doth
repente, doth sometymes alter and
change his purpose, hath a very hand,
a bosome, a sword, a scabberd, a whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
bowe and arrowes, and suche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lyke members and instrumentes.</p>
   <p>These present Articles (yf thou
compare them to the aforesayde Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Pelagius) as they bee moe in
number, so are thei more abhominable
and diabolicall.</p>
   <p>But these and such other like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
errours doe they holde (good
<pb facs="8"/>
Christen reader) whereof I receyued
the more part at the said Hartes hand,
wrytten with hys owne fyngers at
Caunterbury. The residue were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
of theyr owne assertions, that
were of that secte, with whom, when
in the late tyme of persecution, we dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
and sundry tymes did meete, had
conference and communication thone
partie with thother, &amp; could not agree:
because that on the one part, we might
geue no place to erroure, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parte they woulde not allowe no
mannes iudgement in the matter, but
their owne, rackinge the Scriptures to
theyr owne purpose: I for my part saw
no nerer remedy, then to vse the same
artillerie and weapons that thys lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and auncient father had prepared
to our handes already, and that he vsed
to the ouerthrowynge of theyr prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours,
the olde Pelagians nowe
1200. yeres past or therabout. Nowe
haue I shewed thee gentle reader, the
occasion of thys my present trauayle
and enterpryse, whiche I beseche thee
to take in good part, wherein GOD I
take to witnesse, I seeke nothynge but
that the sincere trueth may hereby bee
<pb facs="9"/>
knowen from errour and falshed, that
God thereby may be glorified, and the
godly reader hereof, be edified. And as
for those men agaynste whose folly and
errour this worke is attempted, I har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
desyre of GOD the father of oure
Lorde Iesus Chryste, that it woulde
please hym of his infinite goodnes, to
haue mercy vppon them, and once to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the eyes of their vnderstandynge,
so that they maye see theyr errour and
faute, and acknowledge the same: and
that they may nowe at the laste be won
vnto the pure and sincere trueth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
they so longe time haue bene vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enemyes, that we altogether maye
be gathered into one shepefolde, vnder
one onely sheepeheard Iesus Chryste,
whose holy spirite bee thy leader and
guyde (gentle reader) in the readynge
hereof. Amen.</p>
   <p>Marueyle not gentle reader I desyre thee,
that I haue put dovvne their articles, and
haue not aunsvvered the same. For the
vvorke it selfe folovvinge doth sufficiently
aunsvvere them, or the most part of them,
as thou shalt vvell perceiue in the
readinge of the same.</p>
