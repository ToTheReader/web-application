   <head>To the godly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Lord, the searcher of all heartes (Christian Reader) doth know, that when these Sermons were first preached, there was no purpose at all that they should come (at any time) vnto the Presse. And therefore were the seuerall Doctrines applyed, according to the occasion and necessity of the time, as might best fit the capacity, and tend to the good of those that heard them. Notwithstanding (for the reasons which in the Dedicatory Epistle are expressed) it hath since beene thought most conuenient and necessary, that they should be published. And howsoeuer vpon a second viewe and meditation, many thinges might haue beene added, or changed to the better: yet (for the same reasons and considerations
<pb facs="264"/> also) it was not iudged either fit or safe. But that all and euery part (as neere as was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible without addition or detraction) should come abroade and discouer it selfe (euen at noone day) in matter and forme, in the very same wordes and Phrases, wherein at the first it was deliuered. Nothing doubting but the godly, learned, and iudicious Reader, wil thereupon be induced charitably to interpret all thinges, to beare with such defectes as hee may discerne and iudge the best. Now if that which was intended thus for the good of a fewe (and tended to the offence and hurt of some) doe by this meanes redound to the profit and comfort of many: (for one and the same Doctrine of Christs Gospell becomes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (as it is well knowne) a sauour of life to some, and a sauour of death to others:) Let such as feele and find this profit and comfort, praise God for his mercifull prouidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them in this behalfe, and pray for the ioy and comfort of him, who in this hath laboured for the same vnto them. And who in a greater measure (through Gods as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance) shall expresse the desire of his heart heerein hereafter, if God vouchsafe life and peace: and if this already done, haue (as there is hope they will haue) the wished effect.
<pb facs="264"/> In the meane season, let all true Christians beare this Lesson in minde (as which by woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full experience) is found most necessary and profitable for them. That they take dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent heede (as they tender the glory of God and their owne saluation) that they doe not so much respect the persons of such as are set ouer them in the Lorde, as the wholesome Doctrines of Gods word, which they teach and deliuer, least through a dislike which they haue of the men, they lose the grace that is offered vnto them. It being most sure and certaine, not onely by the examples and testimonies of the Scripture, but by lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble experience, that where the people are ill conceited of the Minister, though he Preach the word of God neuer so soundly and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, yet is the profit that they reape there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by but very small. Not without great cause therefore, to the end the Iewes might beleeue in him as in the true Sonne of God, sent of God for their good and saluation: doth our Lord Iesus Christ. Iohn <hi>10.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ioh. 10, 37, 38.</note> require at their hands a due consideration of his workes. As knowing well, that vntill they had a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of him, and by his workes became per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that he was of God, whatsoeuer hee should teach and Preach, would bee but in
<pb facs="265"/> vaine, and without effect. And surely this is a point of great importance. Few among many duly considering, what great hurt they doe to themselues, and how much they hinder the saluation of their owne Soules, in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing their hearts and affections from the Minister, and in nourishing strife and contention with him, whom God hath sent to breake vnto them the Bread of life. If the Minister for his part be not in truth and sincerity of heart, very willing and desirous to liue in loue and peace with those that hear him. If he be guilty in himselfe of bearing enuy or mallice towards any of them, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not withall but be guilty of his owne Soule of vnfaithfulnesse in his calling, and that he hath great want of true loue, both towardes Christ and towards his Church. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so long too, it is vnpossible that he should performe the duties of his calling, with such cheerefulnesse, zeale, and power, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he might. And therefore howsoeuer such a one doth worthily deserue to be sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly censured and reprooued, yet must the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple take heede, that (if it be for no other spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall matter in him yet) in regard of their owne good and saluation, they settle their affections vpon him in as kinde and louing a
<pb facs="265"/> manner as is possible for them. Assuring themselues, that the maine &amp; especiall hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t that can ensue (by quarrelling and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him with, by making him the obiect of their mallice, and by scoffing, reproaching, and traducing him) is to themselues. They hereby hindring their encrease in knowledge, in faith, and repentance; and wilfully debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themselues of all other graces of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. For so long as they like not the Minister, they come to the hearing of his Preaching with no sincere affections, but with preiudicate opinions, take few admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or reproofes in any good part, are apt to wrest and peruert euery thing they heare. And so whereas the Doctrine taught is in it selfe, and vnto others the sauour of life; it becomes vnto them the sauour of Death. As if it shall please God to open their eyes, and to touch their harts, with griefe of hart, and with remorse of conscience, they will be constrained to acknowledge. Thus wishing to euery faithfull one, as vnto mine owne Soule, I cease any further to hold their eyes from the worke it selfe, which now at length comes to the view, as siluer, no lesse tryed then seauen times in the Fire.</p>
   <pb facs="266"/>
   <p>Notwithstanding, of this yet further I must desire the Christian Reader to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised, that whereas I comprehended the whole ensuing matter of these seauen verses into eight Sermons, and so deliuered it to be printed: it is nowe (but by what meanes I know not) distinguished into twelue. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which new deuision, diuers of them haue neither orderly beginning nor conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The which, as it nothing pleaseth mee to behold: so could I not but cause the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Reader (for mine owne discharge) to vnderstand it. It lying not in my power to preuent this change, many of them beeing printed before I had any sufficient notice thereof at all. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
