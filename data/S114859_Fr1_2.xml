      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is nothing vnto which the minde of mā doth more aspire thā to renown &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality: therfore it is, that no time hath bene so barbarous, no countries so vnciuile, but they haue had a care to preserue wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie actions from the iniurie of obliuion, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured that the names of these that were ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, while they liued, should not perish with their breath. And amongst all the strange and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse fashions of remembring the dead, no record hath bene found to bee compared to that of bookes, and amongst all bookes none so lasting as these in verse, which how so euer rudely done, yet seeme to haue striuen with dayes, and euen to compasse time, beeing the first remembrances that either <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> haue, and apparantly shall be the last.</p>
   <p>Howe curious our Antecessours in this Isle haue bene to extend their memorie to after ages▪ many olde monuments yet to be seene, can beare witnesse, but more than any, that fame of which
<pb facs="3"/>
many yeers since was amongst forrainers of their ancient Poets the <hi>Bardes,</hi> who wrote in verse the deedes of their most valiant men, and song them in the wilde Forrests and mountaines, with which (though long time after) the manie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords wee haue of the ancient defenders of our Countrie, may bee brought forth: and amongst all the rest, this storie of the valiant BRVCE is not the least: it speaketh the language of that time, if it spake ours, it would not bee it selfe: yet as an antique it is venerable.</p>
   <p>To speake somewhat of the occasion of those warres, that the Historie may the better appeare. <hi>Alexander</hi> the third of that name, King of SCOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND departed this life suddenlie without suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the crowne, except <hi>Margaret</hi> his Neece, daughter to the King of <hi>Norway,</hi> who beeing left the vndoubted heire to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, King <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England</hi> desired her in mariage to his sonne Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> whereunto our Scottish Nobilitie easilie condescended, but shee beeing dead, before the ambassadors arriued, they returned with sorrowfull hearts: wherevpon arose great t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oubles and contention amongst the Nobilitie, who should succeed to the Crowne: and albeit there were manie contendents: yet at lēgth, came onely betwixt the <hi>Bruce</hi> &amp; <hi>Baliol.</hi> The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to auoide further strife, conueened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, to decide who should haue the vndoubted right: but because they could not agree, both the parties being so great, that their power could not make the parties stand to their arbitrement, they with one voyce referred the deciding thereof to <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Englād,</hi> supponing, that he should deale
<pb facs="3"/>
most sincerely therein, considering how willingly they had condescended to the marriage of his sonne with <hi>Margaret</hi> the Neece of King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> who accepting very gladly of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hoping to atchieue by craft, that which hee and his predecessours could neuer obtaine by force, left off his Iourney to the Holie LAND, hoping to speede better at home for the enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of his Dominions, beeing a man greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined that way, called the parties before him at <hi>Barwike,</hi> protesting heere withall that hee called them not vpon any presumption, that he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ouer them, but as they had chosen him to be arbiter in the cause: so hee called them to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of the matter, and to collour his purpose, hee had conueened a number of learned Lawyers out of <hi>France,</hi> and other Countries, pretending that he would doe nothing without law and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: yet the moste parte of the Doctours there conueened, as namely, <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Siluius, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Rainerius, Decius, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Severius de Florentia,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Pluscadin</hi> Chronicle, and in <hi>Scotichronicon</hi> conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, that <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> had the best right, <hi>quòd propinquior in gradu debet succedere</hi>: and therefore <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> in respect hee was <hi>uno gradu stipiti pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquior,</hi> and was also the first Male, albeit begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the younger sister. But King <hi>Edward</hi> had his owne decinct, not regarding their arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, called first secretly the <hi>Bruce</hi> vnto him, to whome he was well inclined, promising to decide in his fauours, if he would hold his Kingdome in homage of him. But <hi>Bruce</hi> being a man of Heroik spirit, refused absolutely to subject a free Realme to the seruitude of any forraine Prince whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
<pb facs="4"/>
The King highly offended, turned himselfe frowardly in great anger frō the <hi>Bruce,</hi> called <hi>Iohn Ballioll</hi> also secretly, &amp; promised him the same cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: the man being blinded with ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to reigne, not regarding what hee did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, so hee might haue Soueraignitie, condis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended easily to whatsumeuer <hi>Edward</hi> required, and so by him was nominate King, &amp; sent home to <hi>Scotland,</hi> where hee was conueyed to <hi>Scone,</hi> and there crowned, and all, except <hi>Bruce,</hi> swore to him obedience. Shortly after, there fell out a slaughter of <hi>Makdulffe</hi> Erle of <hi>Fife,</hi> by the <hi>Abirnethies</hi> men at that time in great authoritie and wealth, and because <hi>Makdulffe</hi> his brother suspected the King to bee partiall in judging, summond him to bee judged before King <hi>Edward.</hi> The <hi>Ballioll</hi> being there present, and sitting beside King <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dward</hi> in the conuention of Estates, and being called, thoght to answere by a Procutour, was compelled to arise and defend his cause at the Barre, wherewith being sorely grieued, albeit hee durst not peepe for the time, yet returning home in a maruelous chaufe, reuoluing in his minde, how hee might cast off this yoke and bondage, whereunto foolishly hee had subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted himselfe, and as hee did meditate vpon this, a profitable dissention for his purpose, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terueened betweene <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> which immediatly brast foorth in warre: so that at a Conuention in <hi>Scotland</hi> both the Kings Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours were present. The French to renue their olde league with the new King, the English by the recent surrender of the Realme, desired assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in that warre. Both the Ambassadours
<pb facs="4"/>
were referred to the Parliament, the Nobilitie prone to cast off the late yoke of <hi>England</hi> decer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the French petition just, and the English vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, for that league with <hi>France,</hi> was made fiue hundreth yeeres agoe, by the consent of the whole Realme, inviolably obserued to that day, but that surrender was but new throwen out of the King against his will, which albeit hee had beene willing to doe, yet neither was the King, nor the Realme bound to bide at it, seeing it was done without the consent of the Estates in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, without whose consent, the King could doe nothing. These Newes comming to King <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwards</hi> eares, hauing taken some Moneths truce with <hi>France,</hi> hee sent his Nauie that was bowne to <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> thinking to ouerthrowe the Scots, before they were prouided, and to keep <hi>Barwike</hi> vnvittalled. The Scots encountring this Nauie at the Riuer mouth of <hi>Tweed,</hi> wanne eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene shippes, and chased the rest. King <hi>Edwards</hi> wrath was by this losse more vehemently prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to reuenge, summond the <hi>Ballioll</hi> thrise to compeare before him at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and because he compeared not at all, hee sent for <hi>Bruce,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him the Kingdome, if hee would write to his friendes, either to leaue their King, or to flee in battell. The King with all diligence past tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard <hi>Barwike,</hi> where finding the towne strongly garnished with men: and comming small speed in his pursute, hee fained a retreat, and caused some of the <hi>Bruces</hi> faction sparse brutes that the <hi>Ballioll</hi> with a great Oast was euen there at hand, whereupon the most notable men of the towne, supponing themselues to bee free of the
<pb facs="5"/>
common enemie, ran foorth for to receiue their King honourably: and so both horse and foote went out of the towne confusedlie. But <hi>Edward</hi> had appointed a number of horsemen to wait vpō that turne, who cutted them off easilie from their companies, beeing vshed so confusedly, and out of order, and comming to the next Port, entred in the towne, the King with his foot-hoste fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, made miserable slaughter vpon all sorts of people, &amp; increasing in multitude, sent a part of his armie to besiege <hi>Dumbar,</hi> himselfe within few dayes receiued the Castell of <hi>Barwike,</hi> which the keepers randred, despairing of reliefe: then joyning all his forces together at <hi>Dumbar,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with the Scots hoste which came hither with a great battell to raise the siege: the victorie enclined to the English side. The chiefe men of the Nobilitie fledde to the Castell, but the Captaine not hauing Viuers sufficient to sustaine such a multitude randered, and all kinde of crueltie exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute vppon the captiues. But when the <hi>Bruce</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Kingdome in recompense of his trauell, and according to promise. <hi>Edward</hi> answered him in French, haue we nothing ado, but to purchase Kingdomes for you. <hi>Dumbar,</hi> and some other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles vppon the Border beeing randred, <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Striuiling</hi> were deliuered also: from <hi>Striuiling Edward</hi> passed <hi>Forth,</hi> and marched towards <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,</hi> where the <hi>Ballioll</hi> was, when without impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment hee came to <hi>Monrosse</hi>: The <hi>Ballioll</hi> by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of <hi>Iohn Cummine</hi> of <hi>Strabogie</hi> randred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, &amp; the Kingdome into King <hi>Edwards</hi> hands, whom he shipped, &amp; sent into <hi>England. Edward</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Barwike,</hi> &amp; by sharpe edict summond all
<pb facs="5"/>
the Scottish Nobilitie to come thither, such as came were compelled to sweare obedience vnto him. <hi>William Dowglas</hi> a man of Noble blood, and valiant, refusing to sweare, was cast in prison, where within few yeeres he died. Thus all things succeeding to his wish, hee appointed <hi>Iohn Warre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>
      </hi> Erle of <hi>Surrey</hi> Viceroy, <hi>Hew Cressingham</hi> Thesaurer, and leauing them behind him, hee returned to <hi>London,</hi> where hee warded <hi>Iohn Ballioll,</hi> when hee had reigned 4. yeeres. But hee within a short space at the request of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was sent to <hi>France,</hi> leauing his sonne <hi>Edward</hi> in pledge for him. Afterward <hi>Edward</hi> with a great army, tooke shipping to passe in <hi>France.</hi> The Scots in esperance of liberty (hee being absent) chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed twelue Regents, and by all their aduises, <hi>Iohn Cummine</hi> Erle of <hi>Buchan</hi> with a sufficient armie was sent in <hi>England.</hi> The English Garrisons left in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> dispersed heere and there, durst not stirre: so hee without impediment spoyled <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland.</hi> Albeit this voyage somewhat incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Scots, yet did it but small help to the whole warre, for all strong holds were fortified by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies garrisons. But while as Noblemen lacked both strength and sufficient courage to enterprise greater matters, <hi>VVilliam VVallace</hi> a man of Noble and ancient Family, who did Actes, in those Warres not only aboue all mens exspectatiō, but also incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, being a man of great bodily strenght, &amp; high courage: He hardened his body against injuries of Fortune, and confirmed his courage by perillous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to enterprise higher and greater, euen with danger: he gathered vnto him some companie of Men, and herewith not only slew any <hi>Englishmen</hi> he met with, but often times a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>so with few foght with
<pb facs="6"/>
great numbers in sundrie places where he met with them, &amp; slew them. In short space his fam filled both the Realms: so they that had lik causes as he had, &amp; not vnlike loue to their Countrey, gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther swarmed to him from all parts, and within few moneths he amassed an indifferent Army: Noblemen for feare or lashnes lying still, <hi>Wallace</hi> was proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Gouernour, and as Lieutenant for <hi>Ballioll,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as lawfull Magistrate. Hee tooke not this name of pride or of desire to Empire, but only (like another <hi>Sampson</hi>) vpon compassion, and loue of his Countrey-people. After this, he essayed with open force, tooke many Castells, (either not sufficiently furnished or not weill guarded, or negligently kept) and razed them. His Men of Warres minds were so confirmed, that vnder his conduct they feared no perrill, for that his hardiment lacked neuer wisdom, nor his wisdome the wished euent. So in short space he wan all the Forts that <hi>Englishmen</hi> possessed beyond <hi>Forth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> hearing these rumours, and hauing all his Army with him in <hi>France,</hi> he wrote to <hi>Henrie Pearsie</hi> Lord of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> &amp; to <hi>William Latimer,</hi> to raise quickly Forces out of the next adjacent Countrey, and joyne themselues with <hi>Cressinghame,</hi> to suppres the <hi>Scots. Wallace</hi> in this time besieged the Castle of <hi>Cowper</hi> in <hi>Fyfe,</hi> to the end his men of warre should not be idle, attending the coming of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> army: his enimies now cuming neare, marched directly to <hi>Striuiling, (The Riuer of Forth hath no foords at Striuiling)</hi> Yet there was a vvoodden bridge, ouer the vvhich <hi>Cressinghame</hi> past, vvith the great part of his a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>: the rest following so thick, (the bridge being ouerburthened vvith so hudge a weght) brak
<pb facs="6"/>
in pieces. The <hi>Scots</hi> charged these that vvere past, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could be Arayed, slew their leader, droue backe the rest in the water, with so huge a slaughter, that almost the whole were either slain by the <hi>Scots,</hi> or drownd in the riuer. <hi>Wallace</hi> after this so followed his fortune, that he left not an <hi>Englishman in Scotland,</hi> except prisoners. This victory was obtained vpō the <hi>Ides of Septemb. 1297.</hi> Hereafter followed great Famine for not manuring of the ground: and Pest followed Hunger: wherof greater destruction was feared than of the Warre. <hi>Wallace</hi> to remedy this aswell as he might, charged al sensible men, to come vnto him at a certain day, &amp; caried them with him into <hi>England</hi>: vvhere liuing in vvinter in their enemies lands, they spared <hi>Viuers</hi> at home; vvhere he remained from the <hi>kalends</hi> of <hi>Nouember,</hi> vnto the <hi>kal.</hi> of <hi>Febr.</hi> and no man durst match him, And then hauing inriched thēselfs vvith their enemies spoyls, returned with great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As this journey augmented <hi>Wallaces</hi> fame and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority among the people, so it increased the Noble mens enuy against him: vvhereof <hi>Edw.</hi> being priuy, setting things in <hi>France</hi> in order, as time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, leauing his old souldiers beyond sea, amassing a very great army vpon the sudden, of nouices, he mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched toward <hi>Scotland</hi>: but whē in the plain of <hi>Stane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure</hi> both armies stood in order of battel, about half a mile from other: <hi>Edw.</hi> viewing <hi>Wall.</hi> hoste, his skil and order of battell: albeit he had a greater number of people, yet durst he not hazard; returning his stan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derds, softly retired: but <hi>Wallace</hi> for feare of ambush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment durst not follow. This victory obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood, against a most potent King. The enemies of <hi>Wall.</hi> more sharply assaulted him, raising brutes through the countrey, that he openly shot at the
<pb facs="7"/>
Kingdom. So they conclude, by all means to subuert <hi>Wall.</hi> authority. These deuises not vnknown to King <hi>Edw.</hi> he raised a great army of <hi>English</hi> &amp; <hi>Scots,</hi> vvho had remained constāt in their promise made to him the next Sōmer came vnto <hi>Faw-kirk</hi>: vvhich village is builded vpon the very ruins of <hi>Seuerus Wall,</hi> distant from <hi>Striuiling</hi> 6 myles. The <hi>Scottish</hi> host abade not far from thence, strong enough indeed, for they were 30 thousand, if the Rulers had agreed amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. The Rulers were <hi>Iohn Cumming, Iohn Stewart,</hi> &amp; <hi>Will. Wallace.</hi> the former two in blood, &amp; puissance, the last in Marshall glory, most flourishing of al <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> While as the 3 battels stood in redines to fight, a new contention was added to the former enuy, <hi>Who should lead the Vanguard</hi>: &amp; neither of them giuing place to the other: the <hi>Englishmen</hi> ended the strife vvho in order of battell, vvith displayed Banners, came vpon them with expedition: <hi>Cummine</hi> with his company fled vvithout stroke: <hi>Steward</hi> enuironed both behind and before, vvas slaine with his hoste. <hi>Wallace</hi> being sore set vpon in front, and <hi>Bruce</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming about a Knowle, to charge him on the backe, contained his men together in such order, as in such state he best could, and returned backe ouer CARROVN Water, vvhere he defended himself, hauing gathered together those that were fled, and <hi>Bruce</hi> desiring to speak with him, he refused not: whē these two alone stood right ouer against other, at a deep &amp; narrow part of the Riuer, <hi>Bruce</hi> first said, he wondred at him, that being caried with the facile fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the people, would hazard himself in so many perils againe a King, most puissant of that age: assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted also with great support of <hi>Scots,</hi> &amp; that without any hope of recompence of his pains? For albeit he
<pb facs="7"/>
vanquisht <hi>Edward,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> would neuer allow of him to be King: and if he were ouerthrowne he had no refuge, but in the mercy of his enemy. To whom <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> answered: I (said he) neuer tooke these paines to purchase to my self a Kingdom, for that is vnagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with my condition, and my mind couets it not, but seeing my Countrey-men through your cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, to whom the Realme rightly appertains, desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Rulers, &amp; hereby casten into their most cruel enemies hands: not only in bondage and slauery, but euen to the shambles, I pittied their case, &amp; haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprised the defence of their cause, forsaken by you, whose liberty I shall not forsake, bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>e my life for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake me. And so the conferēce ended: either of both returning to their owne. After this vnhappy Battell <hi>Wallace</hi> returned to <hi>Perth,</hi> and there skailed his army giuing place to the enuy born against him: and after that day enterprised nothing for the Realm: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the name of Magistrat: albeit he left not off the inuading of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, wheresoeuer he could be their master. <hi>Edward,</hi> after this wasted by all warlike calamities, the Lands beyond <hi>Forth</hi> euen to <hi>Perth</hi>: subduing those that in respect of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent misery durst not stir: &amp; so retired with his army into <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> that were carefull for the liberty of their Realme, a little refreshed after the enemies departure, made <hi>Iohn Cumming</hi> younger, Regent: who by the aduise of the Counsell sent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours to <hi>Philip Valloys</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> to trauell with him that by Mediation of his Sister, who was then affianced to <hi>Edward,</hi> they might at least obtaine Truce. By her trauels they obtained Truce for seuen Moneths, but not obserued (<hi>bona fide:</hi>) for <hi>Englishmen</hi> tooke the Ambassadours that were directed to <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facius</hi> the eight, and imprisoned them. The <hi>Scots</hi> in

the meane time who could not abide the tyranny of <hi>Englishmen,</hi> nor culd by no punishment satiat <hi>Edwards</hi> cruell mind, neither yet obtaine peace vpon just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, prepared themselues with obstinat minds to fight it out, without all hope of pardon. First they droue all <hi>Edwards</hi> Captains foorth of all Towns, and Fortresses, and vexed the <hi>Scots,</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> factiō, vvith all the force they might: vvhile as the stat of matters thus cōtinued almost two years. <hi>Edward</hi> sent <hi>Rodolph Confrey,</hi> with a puissant Army, to suppresse this rebellion of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and to put an end to those Warres. This Army without impediment wasted all to <hi>Rosling,</hi> a place in <hi>Louthian,</hi> foure miles distant from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> &amp; to destroy farther within the Countrey diuided their Army in three, <hi>Iohn Cummine,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Fraser,</hi> the most wealthy men in <hi>Tweed-dale,</hi> gathering to the number of 8000 men, marched towards the enemy, of purpose either to keep in the enemy, that he should not run at randon to spoyl the Country, or if they found better occasion, to follow Fortun. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occasion was offered then they looked for: For <hi>Englishmen</hi> fearing nothing lesse than the comming of their enemies, so often ouerthrowne, behauing themselues more losely than was expedient, in their enemies ground, by sudden comming of the <hi>Scots</hi> vpō the first of their Camps, were ouerthrown with a great slaughter: they that escaped raised great tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult in the secōd camp, where th'alarm was fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raised, euery man exhorting his Mate to support their own, they prepared thēselues for reuenge. The conflict was terrible, as betwixt these that were fiers, throgh victory, &amp; these that were enraged by thirst of reuenge: in end, th'<hi>Englishmen</hi> discomfist &amp; chased, victory, albeit not vnbloody, yeelded to the <hi>Scots</hi>: the
<pb facs="8"/>
third host, which had bin furder off, affraid the <hi>Scots,</hi> for many being wounded, &amp; most part wearied with trauels in 2 late battels foresaw manifest danger to ensue by fighting, &amp; assured destruction by flight, at length the Heads commanded to slay al captiues: left while they were occupied with th'enemy, they shuld come vpon their backs: they armed their seruants vvith slain mens armor▪ &amp; so made shew of a greater army to their enemies: the battel begun vvas keenly foghten on both sides: the fight being doutfull for a while, the <hi>scots</hi> by exhortatiō of their leaders, &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind their late doble victory, renewing their strēgth: ran so fiercely vpō their enemies that their aray broken, they gaue backs, It was foghten at <hi>Ros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, the 6 of the kal. of March, 1320.</hi> The more notable that this victory was, 3 hosts in one day ouerthrown by one, the more sharply <hi>Edw.</hi> set his mind to deface this ignominy, and once to put an end to their long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Warre. He amasseth a greater army than euer he did before, &amp; persued <hi>Scotland</hi> both by land &amp; sea, to the vtter most borders of <hi>Ros.</hi> No man in warfare durst hazard him self against so puissant an army, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept <hi>Wallace,</hi> with his few folks, somtimes behind, &amp; somtims before, &amp; somtims vpon their wings, chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at such as had rashly run forth frō the host. <hi>Edw.</hi> preast by great promises to mak him his own, but in vain: his answer was ay to all men, <hi>that hee had auo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed his life to his Countrey.</hi> Thus things atchieued: <hi>Edw.</hi> adjoyned himself to his son <hi>Edward,</hi> whom he had left at <hi>Perth,</hi> took in sundry Strengths &amp; Forts &amp; <hi>Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiling,</hi> after 3 moneths siege, the rest rendred for fear <hi>Edward</hi> held a Parliamēt in <hi>Sainct-Andrews,</hi> vvher he made most part of the Nobility for fear to swear to be his true subjects; <hi>Wall,</hi> always excepted; who for
<pb facs="9"/>
fear to be betrayed of the nobility, withdrue himself to his old lurking places. <hi>Edw.</hi> appointed Lieutenāts and Magistrats throughout <hi>Scotland,</hi> past home to <hi>England,</hi> and left no Monuments, Histories, Books, Lawes, nor learned men, vndestroyed, or transported with him: thinking therby to exterminate the name of that Natiō. He left <hi>Odomare Valentine, Vice-Roy,</hi> to extinguish all innouations, if any begin to peepe. But now Wars arose, where he least meaned. Among the rest of <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation with <hi>Edward</hi> was <hi>Robert Bruces</hi> son, who contēded with <hi>Ballioll</hi> for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and <hi>Iohn Cummine,</hi> cousen german to <hi>Iohn Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioll,</hi> late King of <hi>Scots. Edw.</hi> had spoken often times seuerally, &amp; long time holden them in the hals, vpō vain hope of the Kingdom, and so used their means in the conquest of the same, being both mē of great power and friendship: but the deceitfull mockage at length manifested: there was nothing more desired of either of them, than occasion to be reuēged vpon <hi>Edw.</hi> falset against promise &amp; trust to both: but emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation whereby the one suspected the other, was the stay, that neither durst cōmunicat his counsell to the other. Now <hi>Cum.</hi> perceiued these doings miscōtēted <hi>Bruce,</hi> vehemently deplored vnto him the misery of their Countrey, beginning from the ground thereof and inueighing greatly against the King of <hi>Englands</hi> persidie, accused first himself, &amp; then <hi>Bruce,</hi> by whose assistance and trauels their people were brought to this misery proceeding further from this beginning of speach, euery of them promising secrecy to other vpon their Faith and honesty. They agreed betwixt themselues thus: <hi>That Bruce should bee King and</hi> Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>should resigne his Right in his fauours</hi>: &amp; Cummine <hi>should haue all Lands that</hi> Bruce <hi>possessed in</hi> Scotland (he
<pb facs="9"/>
had many faire and fruitfull Lands) <hi>and</hi> Cummine <hi>should be second in honour next vnto the King.</hi> These things sworn, writtē, &amp; sealed, <hi>Bruce</hi> vvaiting opportunity of change, past to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> leauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him in <hi>Scotland</hi> his wife and brethren. After his departure, <hi>Cummine</hi> either repenting his former ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, or els he thought by craft to cut away <hi>Bruce,</hi> that therby he might more easily come by the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. He bevvrayed these secrets to <hi>Edward</hi>: and to purchase credite herein, he sent him the Contract signed by both. <hi>Bruce</hi> was summōd to a day for trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son, charged not to depart from Court, &amp; quiet kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers appointed vnto him, commanded to spy both his vvords and deeds. The cause why the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted time in this so manifest a turne, was, that his brethren might be apprehended before the brute of his execution should arise. <hi>Bruce</hi> in the meane time was informed of the suddē danger, by his old freind the Earle of <hi>Gomera</hi>: vvho durst not counsell him by letter to flee, but warning by example, sent a pair of guilt spurs with som pieces of gold, as if he had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed them the day preceeding. <hi>Robert,</hi> as men in danger are most tenty, not ignorāt what was meant by the propine called for a Smith in the night, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed shoo three Horses backward, lest the print of the Horse feet in the snow might bewray their flight, &amp; that same night might be espied: accompanied with other two, took journey vpon the 7 day thereafter: themselues and their horses weary, came to a Castle of his own standing beside <hi>Lochmabene</hi>: there finding his brother <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; <hi>Robert Fleming</hi>: and taking them with him, scarcely opening vnto them the cause of his flight, chanced vpon a Messenger, carying letters from <hi>Cummine</hi> to <hi>Edward,</hi> bearing, <hi>That Robert should
<pb facs="10"/>
be executed with diligence: for delay brought danger, lest a Noble man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>auoured of the people, and therewith also wise &amp; stout should raise new troubles, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Cummines</hi> treason also by this testimony tried, <hi>Robert</hi> inflamed with rage of ire, past directly to <hi>Drumfreise,</hi> wher he vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stood his enemy was: &amp; finding <hi>Iohn Cummine</hi> in the <hi>Gray-Friers</hi> Kirke: produced his letters, &amp; reproued him bitterly, while as he impudently stood to the deniall therof: but he impatient, in wrath strak him in the belly with his Dagger, and left him for dead. When he was horsing again, <hi>Iames Lindesay</hi> his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, and <hi>Roger Kirk-Patricke,</hi> his friend, perceiuing his countena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

He told them in a word, <hi>He belieued Cummine was dead.</hi> What? said LINDESAY, <hi>Hast thou left so dangerous a deed in doubt</hi>? &amp; therwith he entred into the Kirk, &amp; not only slew him but also <hi>Robert Cummine,</hi> his kinsman, preassing to support him. This murther was committed the 4 of the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1305. about this time <hi>William Wallace</hi> was taken, and betrayed by <hi>Iohn Menteith,</hi> his familiar companion, corrupted by <hi>Edwards</hi> Mony in the bounds of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> where he lurked for the time: sent to <hi>London,</hi> where by <hi>Edwards</hi> command he was vnhonestly beheaded and quartered: his members t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="10"/>
being inuincible, to his enemie he was betrayed by his Familiar, that in no cace should haue done so.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Bruce</hi> staying only till he had obtained par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the murther commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in holy Church. In the next month of Aprile, 1306. passing to <hi>Scone,</hi> hee was crowned King. First knowing well the great puissance of his enemie, hee amasseth all the forces he could, from all parts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the whole clan of <hi>Cummines,</hi> the greatest in <hi>Scotland</hi> that euer was before them, or since in puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance withstoode him, and his assisting of <hi>Edward,</hi> offended many, and the greater part of the Realme beside, lay quiet for feare of English force, hee, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of his few number, hazarded against <hi>Odomar</hi> at <hi>Meibwen,</hi> with the losse of a few was put to the worst. The like bad successe hee had in passing from <hi>Atholl</hi> to <hi>Argyle</hi>▪ where the <hi>Cummines</hi> beset him, and forced him to fight at <hi>Dalry,</hi> his men fleeing to saue themselues in places of greatest suretie. From this time with one or two in companie, thinking himselfe in that state more sure with few than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Hee wandred in the wildernes like a wilde man: and albeit hee would haue assayed Fortoun, hee saw no appearance of force in anie part: for the common people vpon the construing of the two former losses caused him bee forsaken of all: two onely of his old friends stood constantly by him, <hi>Micolum Leuin</hi> Erle of <hi>Lennox,</hi> and <hi>Gilbert Hay,</hi> Englishmen not saciate sufficiently with his miseries, sent, and apprehended his kinsemen throughout all the Countrie, his wife token by <hi>William</hi> Erle of <hi>Rosse,</hi> was sent into <hi>England,</hi> his brother <hi>Nigell,</hi> the Castle of <hi>Kildrummie</hi> betrayed by the Captaine thereof, with his wife, and children, were randred to the enemie, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi>
      <pb facs="11"/>
his brethren also passing from <hi>Galloway</hi> to <hi>Carrik</hi> were taken at <hi>Lochrien,</hi> and sent into <hi>England.</hi> These three in sundrie places were beheaded, the remnant of the <hi>Bruces</hi> faction were sought also and slaine, &amp; their goods confiscate. The King himself most often with one in companie in this time kept the vnhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mountaines, euery day and houre changing lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king holes, and while as hee thought not himselfe sure that way, neither from treason of the people, nor crueltie of his enemies, past to the Iles, to an old friend of his called <hi>Angus,</hi> and lurking there certaine moneths, he was supposed to bee dead, and so the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie ceased searching. This brute as it was not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable for his securitie, so if it had any while cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, it appeared to his frends, to cut away all hope of recouering the Realme: thinking therefore to attempt some what, getting a smal company from his friend, with whome hee lurked: he sailed to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rik,</hi> where hee tooke a Castle of his owne inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, at vnawares kept by a strong garison of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen, and slew them all, least hee might bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed by force of the enemie, and crossing the Firth of <hi>Clyde,</hi> with the like felicitie tooke the Castle of <hi>Innernesse</hi> far distant from there and so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from place to place, taking in townes, Castles, and strengths. The Countrie-people (beeing heauily opprest by the enemy) flocking to him from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, hee gathered a reasonable armie: and albeit hee had not onely the common enemy to withstand, but also a number of mightie intestine enemies at home, especially the <hi>Cummines</hi> faction, yet from this time forth, whatsoeuer hee attempted succeeded prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, till he had expelled the enemie vtterly out of the Realme, and subdued the whole Countrie to his
<pb facs="11"/>
obedience: but leauing the History of his further progresse, because it will appeare more particularly it selfe, I remit the Reader to the perusing thereof. This is he of whom it may be said, that was said of that <hi>Roman Scipio, unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem.</hi> Into what bondage found he his Nation? To what liberty did he restore it? Since the times of the old <hi>Heroes</hi> none hath more excelled in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Who more couragious in warre? Who more temperate in peace? Who euer had a fortun more hard? Who euer did more hardly lead Fortun cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and lesse regarded her frownes? a constant course of victorie still enabling all his enterprises, whose mind would not bin broken, much more bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vnder such heaps of miseries? whose eonstancy would not be queld to haue his wife taken captiue, his foure brethren slaine, his friends with all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes opprest: to haue himselfe not only barred of his patrimony and estat, but of a Kingdome? and all done against faith, by a Prince the mightiest of that age. Beside all these calamities, thralled, and brought to the extreamest of wāt: he neither doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      </hi> recouery of his Crown, nor was at any tim sene, to cōmit any thing vnworthy of a kingly mind. Let <hi>Rome</hi> boast of <hi>Camillus</hi> and <hi>Scipio, France</hi> of her <hi>Charles, Epirus</hi> of great <hi>Scandeberge, Scotland</hi> shall not forget this Prince, for she cannot. And if hee be not so renoumed as these, it is not for that he is not as worthy: but for that he hath not had so braue trumpeters of his fame, being born in so vnpolished an age: which time the destroyer and restorer of euery thing may perhaps hereafter in these more learned dayes amend. There be some who hold the opinion that the publishing of those books is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb facs="12"/>
as embers of consumed discord, but it is not the publishing of the simplicity of our predecessours that can diuide vs, or cause any discord, but rather our owne too great subtilty, ambition and auarice, and the turning the pages of <hi>Tacitus</hi> and of Secretar <hi>Machiauell</hi> that cā breed an ague in our state. Can the reading of the warres betwixt <hi>Longcaster</hi> and <hi>Yorke</hi> separate the red and white Roses? I thinke no. But I am perswaded that al men of sound minds will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abhor discord in reading of these books, seeing what miseries and horrible calamities these warres, bring foorth and what great occasion we of both Nations haue to magnifie Gods goodnes, <hi>y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      </hi> in our dayes since the Gospell hath bene in sincerity pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished amongst vs, hath turned all these bloody broyles into a peaceable Calme, especially now in the person of our dread Soueraigne: So that now, as the Prophet sayeth, <hi>Our swords are brokē into mattocks, and our speares into siths.</hi> But if we would consider what meanes haue bene vsed, what paines taken, and plots laide by the wisest of both Nations, to knit vp this vnion, and yet could neuer effectate the same, vntill it pleased GOD to cut downe this partitiō wall of long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, in the person of our most gracious SOVERAIGNE. GOD giue vs grace to bee thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for it. AMEN.</p>
