   <head>THE PREFACE to the READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F that bee true which the Oratour writes in his first Booke, <hi>De Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus,</hi> saying, that those who use liberality, get themselues good will: and (which is most important to live in quiet, Loue: I hope, yea am confident (courteous Reader) that both these will not bee wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ting to this worthy Author, both in regard of the goodnesse of his cause, and the wisedome of thy Iudgement. For if you turne over all the writings both of ancient and moderne in this kinde, you will not finde any who communicates his knowledge more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally
<pb facs="7"/>
and bountifully, I adde more willingly and courteously; onely desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to deserue well of such as shall please to make use of these his usefull labours. Well in this case hath <hi>Ennius</hi> counselled, That what good may be done without our owne de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>riment and losse, must not bee denyed euen to strangers, and such as are vnknowne to us. Nor are the gates of the Muses unlike to those of <hi>Hecale,</hi> which ever open made <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, An ever open house of bounty, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Callimachus,</hi> their breasts as free from envy at others good, as full of desire to promote any thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for their progresse. And let thy breast (good Reader) bee open in receiving what is here laid downe, thy minde courteous and well opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and thy iudgement and candid censure voide of all malice. Be alike lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to him, whom the love of thy commodity hath drawne to these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb facs="7"/>
and the apprehension of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine way and meanes wholly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For although the Author here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is rather desirous to instruct such as desire it, then blame any other, yet must hee needs confesse, what with others hee cannot but acknowledge, that of so many, very few have either so farre as is requisite delivered the knowledge hereof, or with such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, as that the over tediousnesse of it hath proved too oft the utter dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and confusion of the learner. Well saith the Arabian, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> The lustre of speech consisteth in brevity. And the same being true in the deliverie of any art, being done without obscurity: it may well bee esteemed and iudged, how much the Author hereof (<hi>absit verbis invidia)</hi> hath excelled all in this kinde, as being not onely briefe in deliverie of rules, but also by the same having quite cut off and solved all
<pb facs="8"/>
grammaticall figures, so great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the quicke progresse of the learner, and the causes of so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and ambiguity, either in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding or writing. And verily if we take a view of other languages, wherein the Authors of grammer nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble themselues nor their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in like manner, we shall finde as hard constructions as may be found in Latine, solved by genericke rules. As what reason have we to say that this <hi>Saucis frontem</hi> is necessarily by Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necd. more then that of <hi>Homer, Il. a. <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap> Iratus cor,</hi> for <hi>corde</hi>: or of <hi>Nazianz. <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap> Deus quidnam sit naturam &amp; rem,</hi> for <hi>natura &amp; re?</hi> Or not to solve this, <hi>Omnes laudare, &amp;c.</hi> by a common rule, as well as the Hebrewes doe the like: <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>&amp; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malia ire &amp; redire,</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: that is as if one would
<pb facs="8"/>
say, <hi>Currebant &amp; redibāt, sive [erant] currentes &amp; redeuntes,</hi> or by a subin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellection of an Indicative to the Infi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitive: <hi>Currendo currebant, redeundo redibant.</hi> Or that this <hi>Sic ore locuta est,</hi> is a greater redundancie then that which is common to the Syrians, and in particular used, <hi>Luke.</hi> 2.4. <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>Ex domo eius &amp; familia eius Davidis: i. Ex domo &amp; familia Davidis.</hi> Or the use of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iective for the adverbe, more figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive then of the meere adiective for a Substantive usuall in Arabique, as <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>Vniversitas hominis, id est, omnes homines.</hi> But if we should speake of the discordance (yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance) of the Nominative case and the Verbe, in number and gender common to the Hebrewes and Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans, the putting of the Future for the Participle, often used by the Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Arabians, with many other kindes of speech no lesse usuall, wee
<pb facs="9"/>
may very well conclude, that as by generall rule such constructions no lesse difficult then in Latine are solved, and supplied; so in Latine with more brevitie by the like meanes may they well be satisfied.</p>
   <p n="2">2. Whereas in delivery of any Art, not onely truth, but a certaine <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, or congruitie of the precepts, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Art is required. For an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity it were in Geometry, to teach Arithmetike; or in Grammar, Logicke. Surely they erre, who in Grammar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Prolepsis, Epanalepsis, Hyperba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and many other, being (as to one well considering may easily appeare) figures proper to Rhetorique.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Whereas all precepts ought to be proper, that is things generall to be spoken generally and once, things par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and speciall more oft and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as to make it plaine by this simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude. Sleepe is a naturall affect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to a man and a beast. If the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="9"/>
Philosopher therefore should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate this affect in a man and a beast, specially taken, he should doe amisse, because hee should repeate a thing which generally might be said and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. The cause of error in this kind, <hi>Cicero</hi> 2. <hi>de Legib.</hi> under the person of Lawyers thus expresseth. Lawyers, saith he, either to breede a mistake in their Auditours, whereby they may seeme to know things more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and more hard, and difficult, or (which is more likely) through the ignorance of teaching, often infinitely dissipate that which consisteth in one notion. Against this some Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have offended in delivering a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction by rule, and after making the same figurative, as in <hi>Pars abiere,</hi> in one place by rule, in another by <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi>: In <hi>criminibus terrere novis,</hi> by rule of subintellection, and <hi>Enallage,</hi> &amp;c. In which act (me thinkes) they imitate that <hi>Medea,</hi> whom the Poets
<pb facs="10"/>
say in her flight out of <hi>Pontus</hi> to have scattered the limbes of her Brother in those places, by which her Father fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her, so forcing pittie out of an impious act, and by the enforced col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of them foreslowing his iust and desired revenge: so have the parts of this Art beene dissipated, so have the <hi>species</hi> beene placed without their <hi>Genera,</hi> and both confounded, that what by some things was meant, whereto others did appertaine, could hardly bee discerned. Whereby all speed in attaining any perfection in these kindes of studies was not onely hindered, but even all hope was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken away.</p>
   <p>Whereas to know aright according to that great light of knowledge (even <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe) is <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, to know the first grounds, or primary causes; this in regard of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions expressed, or with other parts together understood, hath beene qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>te
<pb facs="10"/>
left untoucht by other Grammarians, being here without comparison excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently expressed: to the great benefit &amp; assurance of the Learner. And so well laid downe, that whether I seeke bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, proprietie both in the matter and manner of the deliverie, certaintie, (things being examined according to their first grounds and causes) or in a word whatsoeuer is requisite to this usefull and necessarie Art: I am enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to say of this, what the <hi>Ithacan</hi> feared not to pronounce of his assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pallas. <hi>Hom. Odyss.</hi>
      <q>
         <l>
            <gap reason="foreign">
               <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
            </gap>

         <l>
            <gap reason="foreign">
               <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
            </gap>.</l>
      </q>
So is whatsoever may bee required fully satisfied, so doth fulnesse of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter seeme to contend with right order. So is brevitie ioyned with perspicuity, that I may well say of the Authour, what is commended by an ancient Father, <hi>He knew, to the end to edifie and profit others.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="11"/>Now if we should a litle consider the learned Languages, I meane the Latin, Greeke, Hebrew, Chaldaie, Syriaque, and Arabique together, as we shal find some Idioms and proprieties of every one in particular; so shall we find them in most points of construction (for of Etymologie I say nothing) to agree together. That of all these the Hebrew was most ancient, besides Christians, <hi>Targum Hiersol. Gen.</hi> 11.1. averreth in these words: <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> that is, And all men of the earth were of one language, and one speech, for they spake in the holy or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew tongue. And the Iewes <hi>Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud, Tract. Sanhedrin, cap.</hi> 23. In the beginning was the Law given to Israel in the Hebrew tongue. But when they were in banishment in the time of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras,</hi> they tooke the Assyrian Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, and Language, and left to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritanes
<pb facs="11"/>
the Hebrew. From the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew corrupted proceeded the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daie, Syriaque, and Arabique. Now as man was first created in the East, and therein the Church first planted; so from hence were letters first derived, &amp; the use of them brought into other Nations (as if a man say <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, &amp;c. hee speakes Chaldaie) Reade the learned Tractates, <hi>De dijs Syris,</hi> and <hi>Sacer Aristarchus,</hi> you will confesse, that even the religious of the Greekes and Latines (to say nothing of other) came out of the East, and that so much as the names of the gods cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be understood, then by the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne tongues. And as from these Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages are derived into the Latine, and Greeke, divers words, some of which you may finde noted by the learned <hi>Caninius,</hi> So doth the construction of all these for the most part agree. Let these therefore learne
<q>—Risu cognoscere matrem.</q>
      <pb facs="12"/>
To imitate the other, and without such abundance of figures, creeping in by constructions lesse usuall, but in the other Languages no lesse usuall, as well as the other to be taught.</p>
   <p>It is recorded in the Iewes <hi>Thalmud Tract. Bava bathra</hi> (or acording to them <hi>Basra) cap.</hi> 2. that there were two Schoolemasters, whereof one taught many things, but had no care of his Schollers how and how much they learned: The other taught few things, but was exceeding carefull of their progresse, which they explicate briefly and sententiously thus: <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. The one read and tooke no care: the other tooke care and read not. The same, me thinkes, I see here imitated. Other Grammarians not regarding the time in learning, or the difficulty in retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have delivered multiplicity of rules, and added unnecessarie matter, which our Authour attending the
<pb facs="12"/>
commodity of the learner, hath more wisely, and with better reason quite cut off. And desiring indeed rather to profit then to arrogate any thing to himselfe, hee cert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>fies the Reader that the Regimen herein contained is translated (for the most part) out of Spanish, written therin by one <hi>Aelius Antonius</hi> of <hi>Nehrissa,</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Philip</hi> the third. The notes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nferring the more learned Languages added by one who hath vowed and dedicated his seruice to so worthy a Gentleman. The Concordance for the better perfecting of the whole with the supplying of figures, adioyned by himselfe.</p>
   <p>For these reasons (gentle Reader) kindly interprete this excellent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of this worthy Authour, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for thy better progresse, which if he finde willingly, and gratefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, you shall not onely move, but oblige and binde him to labour in
<pb facs="13"/>
other things necessarie to the same. Farewell, and to speake with <hi>Virgil</hi>:
<q>Et nos, &amp; tua dexter adi pede sacra se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundo.</q>
