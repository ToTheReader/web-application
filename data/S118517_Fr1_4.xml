   <head>THE
INDVCTION.</head>
   <p>BEloved Sonne, the many
religious and morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
inherent in your
matchlesse Mother, under the
wings of whose prudent and
Godly government, your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
hath beene trayned and
guided up, together with your
Education, under so zealous
and Learned a Tutor, put mee
rather in assurance then hope
(as <hi>Tullie</hi> sometime exacted
<pb facs="5"/>
from his Sonne, from the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hearing of <hi>Cratippus</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster)
that you are not ignorant
of that summary bond, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you stand obliged to your
Creator and Redeemer, which
is onely able to make you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
both here and hereafter, in
life and death: In mentioning
whereof, I meane not onely a
bare and Historicall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but with a reall and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall
use adjoyned, without
which, though with a seemely
assumption, you could expresse
to the world in a former habite
and living portrayture, all <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi>
Morall vertues, and
walke that whole booke in <hi>Life</hi>
and <hi>Action:</hi> yet are you but a
<pb facs="5"/>
vaine and wretched creature,
the fairest out-side of the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablest
inside, that ever was
concealed by Toombe, or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing:
And although I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
doubt, your youth being
guided, and your green vessell
seasoned by such wholesome
documents and instructions,
derived from so all-sufficient
Teachers, that you are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnished
of such needfull
helpes, as may be furtherers to
your life and conversation: yet
that I may the better retaine
and expresse the zealous affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
beseeming a Father to
his Sonne, or that you should
be forced to derive your stay
and advice, rather from the
<pb facs="6"/>
rule of strangers, then from
him from whom you are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and brought forth.</p>
   <p>Out of these fore-going
considerations therefore, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it not unmeet, I have essay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the affection of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to give you such good
advertisements and rules for
the fitting and squaring of your
life, as are gayned rather by
my long experience and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
than by much reading
or Studie, being such (in my
hope) with that good assistance,
that shall <hi>season your Youth like
the deaw of Age:</hi> to the end that
you entring into this exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
and intangling World,
may be the better furnished to
<pb facs="6"/>
avoid those harmelesse courses;
whereinto these dangerous
times, and your experience
may easily insnare you: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I would not confound
your memory, I have reduced
them into tenne Precepts,
which if next to <hi>Moses</hi> Tables,
you imprint in your minde,
you shall reape the benefit, and
I the end of my expectation
and content. And thus they
follow.</p>
