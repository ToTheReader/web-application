   <head>TO THE RIGHT
HONOVRABLE,
the Lord Ar: Baron.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honourable,</hi>
(whom, for honour
sake, in an Epistle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive,
I have not
named in full sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles)
I had no sooner
heard that your Lordship had exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
against my Booke, concerning the
<hi>Masse,</hi> but I laboured both by my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of letters unto you, and solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation
of an Honourable friend, to
be acquainted therewith, having first
<pb facs="3"/>
understood, that you had objected thē to
some Protestants, by way of Traduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and then imparted them to a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
tongue, which you knew to be as
shrill and loud as <hi>Bow-bell,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
it into the eares of others round
about, in the vilest termes of <hi>Falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi>
and <hi>Impostor.</hi> A pestilent
ayre, which presently after was heard
blustering at the Court: Whereunto
I addressed my Answer, <hi>Satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
as I thought. And about five
weekes after I received a Replie from
your Lordship closely sealed up, with
divers seales, for secrefie sake: But,
behold a Miracle! the same Replie
flyeth out amain, the <hi>Seales</hi> (as it were
the <hi>Doores) being shut,</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
abrod by the wings of Report,
preoccupateth the eares and mindes of
the most of your Profession, within the
<pb facs="3"/>
County of <hi>Hampshire,</hi> to my great
ignominie and reproach. All which
your Obliquity of dealing I received
from the intelligence of Persons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Exception: Whereby I learne
that your Ayme was not your owne
<hi>Satisfaction</hi> (then pretended) but my
defamation. So that your Lordship
may not now bee offended, to see your
owne private letters present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
againe unto you in publique
Print, and attended with this my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
and Answere unto them. For
you were not to thinke, that when as
you had placed the <hi>Candle</hi> upon the
<hi>top of the Table,</hi> I should hide it
<hi>under a bushell:</hi> but seeing that you
would not pinion your <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, that
is, flying words and voices, I have
also given this my Answere liberty, to
meet with them upon the same stage.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
Your Lordships Exceptions are
partly against my <hi>Allegations,</hi> and
partly against my <hi>Style of writing;</hi>
and you will bee knowne to bee the sole
Author of both: but your Lordship
will con me thankes, if for your credit-sake
I attribute the Objections against
my <hi>Allegations</hi> rather to some <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Suggester</hi> than to your selfe;
when you shall perceive the manifold
falsities of the Objections, from point
to point. Nor will your knowne wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
permit mee to beleeve, that you
would offer to challenge a <hi>Bishop,</hi> in
matters of his owne profession (unto
whom you are pleased to ascribe more
than ordinary Attributes of learning)
and to impute such errors unto him
with that Confidence, as to wish that
<hi>another Bishop</hi> of the same professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
might bee <hi>Umpier</hi> betweene us;
<pb facs="4"/>
except you had first consulted with
some <hi>Romish Priest;</hi> especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in your Replie you judge your
owne <hi>Romish writers</hi> not to be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
enough, which come forth
without the Licence and <hi>Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Superiors.</hi> Howsoever,
as well for your <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> as for
mine owne <hi>Iustification,</hi> I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
unto your Lordship such a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
and Conscionable an Answere,
which I dare permit to the <hi>Umpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi>
of any Romish Doctor, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
were it your <hi>Bishop of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
the <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe. Yet shall
not either Popeship, Doctorship, or so
much almost as any Schollership be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
in this case, wherein, as when
any felon is brought before a Iudge, or
a Iustice, that was <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in the manner, they need
<pb facs="5"/>
not be troubled with any further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
then the view of the stolne
stuffe, which was taken upon him. In
like manner (were the Author either
your selfe, or any other) your falshood
in objecting of Falsities will be so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant,
that the reader shall not need
to busie his braines with any further
Disquisition than the view and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usall
of the words excepted against. In
a word; These and all other like Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations,
used by <hi>M. Parsons,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
other, have beene shewen hitherto
to have beene as causelesse, as if it had
befallen spiritually to my Adversaries,
as it hapned corporally to the enemies
of <hi>Lot,</hi> when they sought to assaile
him, but <hi>could not find the doore.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The other point of your Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
touching the <hi>Bitternesse</hi> of the
<hi>Style,</hi> being a subject of humane <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
rather than of <hi>Theologicall</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
judgment, I shall not gainsay, although
you shall challenge it to your selfe; who
hearing me, upon good proofes, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Romish Masse</hi> of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
Sacriledge,</hi> and <hi>Idolatrie;</hi>
passe by this in silence, &amp; only quarrel
the Denominations, in calling your
<hi>Masse Superstitious, Sacrilegious,</hi>
and <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> Now forsooth, ô the
Bitternes of the Style! But ô violent
Cavillation, may I say. Much like as if
I had frendly admonished your Lo: for
your safety sake, to avoid such a By-way,
because it is haūted with theeves;
or to forbeare to tast of such a Cup,
which is infected with poyson; or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine
the next house, wherein is the
pestilence; all this should bee received
without regret: notwithstanding you
should take offēce, that I should call the
<hi>way Theevish,</hi> the <hi>Cup poysōable</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
and the <hi>house Pestilent.</hi> All the rest
of your Instances of <hi>Bitternes</hi> labour
of one and the same fault, which is
<hi>Impatience,</hi> not to suffer <hi>Errors</hi> and
<hi>Vices</hi> to be arrayed with their sutable
Attributes of <hi>Erroneousnesse</hi> and
<hi>Vitiousnesse;</hi> as if you would deny
the child his proper name. But Hony
and any sweet thing seemeth <hi>Bitter</hi> to
one in an ague, yet the cause is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
of the Party. Others spit out,
as loathsome, that, which is <hi>Bitter</hi> in
their mouthes, although it would bee
never so Cordiall at their hearts; and
this disease is somewhat a-kin to a
Phrenzie. And that your Lordship
should blame me for confuting Errors,
and condemning faults in such bitter
names, without which they could not
bee so much as named, much lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
or condemned; is a fault in it self,
<pb facs="6"/>
which I will not name, for feare you
should accuse mee of <hi>Bitternesse.</hi> He
that would indeed busie his pen in blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out the <hi>Bitter Styles</hi> of outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Raylers,</hi> may spend his life time
in expunging whole Bookes of your
owne <hi>Romish</hi> writers; but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Gretzer</hi> the Iesuite his defence of
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Stapleton</hi> his
<hi>Counter-blast,</hi> both which have been
studied by some, only to furnish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with store of salt, vinegar, and
gall, for personall Invectives.</p>
   <p>As for my selfe, none ever more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
that <hi>Caninam eloquentiam,</hi>
that is, <hi>Doggish eloquence;</hi> never
did any (be it spoken without arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance)
insult lesse upon so great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages;
witnesse the same Booke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
throughout; nor shall any unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
Reader find in any of the Places,
<pb facs="7"/>
which your Lordship hath noted of
<hi>Bitternesse,</hi> any one Terme, which
may not bee held medicinable, and
which the matter it selfe did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
me unto, who have had this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie
from a Royall mouth,<note place="margin">K. J.</note> that I
used not to <hi>Flite:</hi> else should I not in
my younger yeares have plaid the Asse,
as it became mee, when I sustained
whole loads of reproachfull and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
termes of <hi>Grashopper,
Leud Lad,</hi> and <hi>very Asse,</hi> cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me by the old man <hi>M. Parsons,</hi>
without any retaliation on my part,
but rather glorying that I might bee
thought worthy the name <hi>of Asse,</hi> in
that cause, wherein I did carry my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Christ, by supporting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
his Truth.</p>
   <p>So little cause had your Lordship,
in any reason, to threaten me, with any
<pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>unruly pen.</hi> But let come that <hi>Pen,</hi>
when it will, and though it bee dren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in bitterest waters of <hi>Mara,</hi> I am
ready for it, and sure I am, that I shall
be avenged of the <hi>Pen-man.</hi> But
how? <hi>Didicit quis maledicere? &amp;
ego contemnere,</hi> as it is in <hi>Tacitus;</hi>
yet only <hi>Contemning</hi> it, is but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish;
I shall encounter a rough and
reviling speech with a <hi>Soft An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,</hi>
imitating Physitians, whose
Aphorisme it is, <hi>Calida curantur
frigidis.</hi> Yet may this be but only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
I will be a Christian, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
the lesson of our Lord, &amp; Master,
who teacheth us to revenge others
<hi>Cursings</hi> of us with our <hi>Blessings</hi>
of them: even as I now doe with
your Lordship, notwithstanding the
Malignancie, which I have found,
I desire of God to blesse this my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
<pb facs="8"/>
unto you, that as it must bee for
Conviction, so it may bee for your
Conversion, that you with us may at
length learne to serve <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Spirit</hi>
and <hi>Truth,</hi> by Iesus Christ. Amen.</p>
