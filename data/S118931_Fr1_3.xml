      <hi>TO THE CHRIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Reader Richard Turnbull</hi> vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth grace, peace, with faith and zeale <hi>from God the father, &amp; from our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not ignorant (right deare and christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) how many men, sound of iudgement, ripe in yeares, profounde in learning: haue written vpon euerie part and par cell of holy Scripture: Whose authoritie might terrifie, and feare me from adding any thing thereunto. Notwithstanding, seeing what one man hath omitted, another may remember: and what one hath shortened, another may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large and amplifie: what one hath vttered ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurelie, another may speake and write perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouslie: And in as much as the later may adde
<pb facs="8"/> to the former, though otherwise most exellent. These and the like considerations mouing mee thereunto, I haue aduentured, and vndertaken after so many, to write something vpon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle Saint Iames his canonicall Epistle.</p>
   <p>Wherein, if I can promise nothing els: yet this one thing may I assure thee, that thou hast it now both more amplie, and also more orderly then by any heretofore: and that in such a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, as (to my knowledge) none hath labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, eitber in this, or other like places of the holy Scripture: hauing drawen first the generall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalysis, or resolution of the whole Epistle: then the particular of euery chapter, with the like prefixed before euerie Lecture or sermon, in this exposition. So that who so is but of simple capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, by the very tables, may see and search out, the very meaning of the holy Apostle.</p>
   <p>And to the end that greater profite might redound to the ignorant; I haue affected no cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tearmes: I haue not hindered the course of my speach by sentences or sayings in vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen languages: But I haue set downe all things in our natiue, naturall, and mother tongue, (some three or foure wordes onely excepted:) whether they be testimonies of holy Scriptures, or sentences of heathen Phylosophers, or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
<pb facs="8"/> of learned Fathers, that in no wise the Reader might be interrupted.</p>
   <p>Take (gentle Reader) this my first trauell in good part, geue it the reading to the end, and I doubt not but thy labour shall reape &amp; receiue answearable profite. And if euery place doe not satisfie or content thee, (as all that are learned know doeth neuer come to passe alike) yet passe through, and there shalbe some thing found, (I trust) to quit thy trauell. But as for such as haue a kinde of felicitie and happines, in carping at other mens doings: whom nothing pleaseth, but chickens of their owne hatching: I charge them before the Lord, and in the name of Iesus Christ that they slanderously backbite me not, but bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly admonish me, if there shal herein appeare any thing displeasant vnto them: that so the profit of the church, and the glory of God in all things may be sought, and not mens persons vn charitablic condemned.</p>
   <p>And in so curious reprouing, and sharp cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring, as wherunto I know beforehand I shalbe subiect; this is my only comfort, that no man pleaseth alparties, &amp; those in al faculties, which haue been most excellent, haue by some been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so condemned. Seeking therefore the profite of many, I contemne the carping reproof of some:
<pb facs="9"/> and applying my selfe to please the godlie, I am not much afraide of the censure of the wicked. Wherefore (Christian Reader) I desire thee to reade with patience, accept with fauour; and iudge with charitie: So shalt thou stirre and prick forwarde, not me alone, but other also, to vndertake greater matters for thy comfort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, and profite.</p>
   <p>Now gentle Reader, I heartely desire thee, to beare with such faults, as in the printing here of are committed: as with setting downe one place for another; one Epistle for another; with the pointing, and such like: Wherein, albeit I haue laboured to my power, in deliuering all things according to trueth: yet some faultes are committed, which thou thy selfe shalt both easily espie, and readily amend by thy owne diligence. And as for matters of greater obseruation, thou shalt finde them corrected by themselues; the leafe, page, section, and line of the section being set downe: whereby, if any errour shal cause any doubt, thou maist in the noting the errata, be resolued. Thus fare thou most hartely wel in the Lord.</p>
