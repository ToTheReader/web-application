      <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ouchsafe, good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
in a word or two
to vnderstand the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of bringing this
<hi>MEDITATION</hi> to the
Presse, that was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
onely for the Pulpit: the rather
for that it commeth not from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
owne hand, who would no doubt
more exactly haue polished it, could
hee haue beene perswaded to publish
it himselfe. But hee, out of his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
(as hee deliuered it, not like a
<pb facs="4"/>
Scholler his Lesson learned without
Booke, nor brought with him any
intent to haue it further made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e,
so) could not be induced (though
instantly laboured both by my selfe
and many others, desiring further
fruit of so learned and religious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
Labour) eyther to publish it himselfe,
or to haue any hand at all in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of it.</p>
   <p>Howbeit at length, vpon extreame
importunitie (rather to preuent the
wrong that by imperfect Copies prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
he might otherwise sustaine, then
to satisfie such as were earnest sutors
to him for the same) hee was with
much adoe drawne before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the Citie, to deliuer his
Notes to a friend, (with reference of
the whole businesse, to the iudgement
and discretion of others, to deale in,
and dispose of as they should deeme
sit,) who being present at the speaking
of it, with the Authors Notes, and
<pb facs="4"/>
his owne helpes, hath done his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to penne it as neare as he could,
to that which by the Author himselfe
was then deliuered. Which though it
be not altogether <hi>verbatim</hi> the same,
yet it is hoped that there is not any
thing materiall wanting, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
hearer shall desire: besides that
hee shall finde some things ouer and
aboue, that straits of Time, and default
of Memory were then a meanes to
keepe backe.</p>
   <p>If any aske, what needed such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
in this businesse, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already so many Sermons abroad,
that euen Printers themselues com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
that the Presse is oppressed
with them? I answere: True it is,
that there are Sermons indeede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
by some more then enough;
but yet not enough (I dare say it)
such as this is, that deale so pit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ily,
so effectually, in points of practise
so necessary, so ordinary, as this
<pb facs="5"/>
doth; wherein Learning and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
delightfull manner of handling,
together with profitable and vsefull
matter, so concurre, that if it please
not any, they are those alone, whose
prophane palates can relish nothing
that sauoureth of grace, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>er
so delightfull otherwise: if it
profit not any, it is to be feared
they are such, whose corrupt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
are growne wel-neare irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerable,
if not wholy incurable.</p>
   <p>But I am lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>th to be long, where
the worke it selfe is not. This lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
be spoken rather in way of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie
for my selfe and such others
as vrged the publishing of it, then
in commendation of the Worke, which
in the very reading of it, to any iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious,
ingenious, and religious,
will sufficiently commend it selfe.
For my selfe, considering the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
approbation giuen it by all sorts
that heard it, together with the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb facs="5"/>
suites of many others, so in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desiring it vpon their reports,
and finding vpon view and serueigh
the thing it selfe fully to answere
both the reports of the one, and the
desires of the other, I was right
willing and ready (as hee speaketh
in <hi>Plato)</hi> though one barren hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
in this kinde my selfe,<note place="margin">Socrates apud Plat. in Theaet.</note> to performe
some Midwiue-like office to another,
for the further enlargement of so
generally blessed, and so deseruedly
desired a birth. Wherein if thou shalt
chance to finde any defects, consider
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ut (I pray thee) how hard a thing
it is for another (though not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull)
to perfect a worke that some
curious Artist hath left vnfinished.</p>
   <p>And so wishing onely, that it may
through Gods gracious assistance, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worke into, or increase in thee
a good Conscience, and the comfort
thereof; I leaue the Worke to thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsall,
and it to his blessing, whose
<pb facs="6"/>
gift a good Conscience is, and with
whom, beside the present comfort of
it heere, is a plentifull reward reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for it else-where.</p>
