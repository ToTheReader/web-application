   <head>TO THE RIGHT Reuerend Father in God, <hi>Iames,</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Winton,</hi> Deane of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Chappell-Royall, and one of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties most Honourable Priuie Counsaile.</head>

      <salute>MY LORD:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Hortly after his Maiesties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Drumfreis,</hi> to <hi>Carleel,</hi> I posted away these two little Sermons, vnder hope they might serue for witnesses of my willing affection to haue attended his Maiestie in the rest of the iourney, if the condition, either of my person, which is infirme, or of the place, which was no longer pertinent to me, could so haue permitted. How they were miscarried, I know not, belike they haue taken in the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne</hi> way, wherein their father and <hi>fellowes</hi> had not been accustomed to walke before them:
<pb facs="3"/>
alway, after long wandring, they returned backe againe vnto me, but not without good tydings; for the one of them told me, he was certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, to find fauour with my Lord Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> his Grace, who still kept in mind that <hi>Welcome,</hi> giuen to his Maiesty in the Royall Chappell of the Palace of <hi>Holy-roode-house,</hi> at his Maiesties comming in. The other seemed to mee no lesse confident that he would be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by my Lord Marques of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who did likewise remember the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on giuen to the worthy Nobles of <hi>England</hi>; as also, that hearty <hi>Acclamation</hi> of the people, who seemed to powre out their hearts with their voices, and cryes, for his Maiesties preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church of <hi>Drumfreis,</hi> at his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties going out.</p>
   <p>Both these I easily beleeued, when I called to mind the continual, and constant kindnesse, which through long experience I had found of the one, and that rare humanity of the other, euident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all, and whereof it pleased his Lordship when he was here, to giue me a speciall proofe. Yet could I not presume to present such base, and vnapparelled Pilgrimes to so Noble, and high Personages.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>Sure I am, if they could haue ouertaken that Reuerend, Graue, &amp; most Learned Prelate, my Lord Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> they had not wanted a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone; for I knew from himselfe, that nothing comming from the B. of <hi>Candida Casa,</hi> would be v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>welcome to his Lordship for <hi>Amphibalus</hi> sake, harbored in <hi>Mona,</hi> by <hi>Crathlint</hi> King of Scots, and protected there, with the Christians that fled with him from the bloudy persecution of <hi>Dioclesian.</hi> But when I had considered all, I thought it most kindly, since they come from the Deane of his Maiesties Chappell here, they should take their course directly to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Deane of his Highnesse Royall Chappell there. My Lord, they are Strangers; I trust your Lordship will vse them kindly; all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour I craue, is, that your Lordship would once bring them vnder his Maiesties eye, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their sentence, whether they shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Presse, that they wander no more; or then returned home againe, vntill they gather further strength, to doe for themselues. So rests,</p>
