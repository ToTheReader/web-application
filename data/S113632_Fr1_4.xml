   <head>THE EPISTLE DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatorie of Hieronimus Osorius, <hi>written to the most noble and vertuous</hi> Prince Lewis, sonne to Emanuell king of Portugale.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had obtayned throughe your good meanes, &amp; fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble helpe (Lewes moste renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Prīce) to haue recourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, vnto my accustomed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of studie, I employed my selfe more dilligētlye then I did before in the searche of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wysedome. For in my first entrie being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued onelye wyth the instincte of nature, I moderately folowed my studies, wherby reaping at the length some fruite, I might imparte parte thereof, to the profite &amp; commoditie of my natiue country. But now whereas I haue alreadie proued sufficientlye your bountefull harte and clemencie, and therefore am alwayes mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of your honour and worthines: it lyeth mee vppon, to bend therunto all the force &amp; vehemēt intentiō of my minde, that I may in some case seeme worthy to be reckoned of &amp; esteemed, for knowledge &amp; learning. Neither do I seeke herein the praise of mine own wit, but that I may if not rēder due thanks, yet declare my greate good will, and dutifull hart, ready alwayes and glad to accōplish your good desire. VVherfore I wil in no

         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap> to set forth in this kinde of wryting the full meaninge of my good disposition, and will bring to passe, that my obseruaunce towards you, shalbe knowen in all places. And I am fully perswaded, that whatsoeuer I do in she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynge my singular loue towards you, wherewith I am maruelyously inflamed, it is notwithstanding in it self but smally to be accompted of. But it behoueth them not to bee squemish in geuinge a small &amp; simple gift, who may not, throughe vvante of abilitie bestowe of greater valewe and estimation: and they which in matters of greater importaunce cānot stand their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignes in steede, should not therfore by not geuing a trifle, slacke their dutye towards such, whom they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other honour and reuerence: especially where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in euery kinde of duty and curtesie, not so much the valewe of the rewarde, as the bountifulnes of a true meaning minde is generally allowed of, and accepted. VVhereas therefore the rather to discharge my dutie towards you (most noble &amp; renowmed Prince) I haue taken in hand for exercise of my stile, after the maner and fashion of Aristotle to dispute of many questions, I thought principally to entreate of true Nobilitie. And because that so high &amp; stately an argument, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto mee most meete for a worthy &amp; noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, and for that these my discourses, and treatises of Nobilitie, were more curiously compyled, and wyth more laboured studie, I determined to present thē vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your maiestie. And so muche the more readily was I induced so to do, by how much the more eminētly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in you, the glistering gleames of true, and aū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

If renowme be obteyned by vertue, who is more vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt then you, who more bountefull, who more endued wyth wysedome and pollicie? I omitte to speake of the great loue and amity betwixt your brother, and you, a king endued wyth much honour &amp; Nobilitie, a iust Prince and louer of his country: againe of your great curtesie towards all men, &amp; lastly (which is principall) of the rest, of your feruent and most earnest desire to set forth and aduaunce Christian relligion. But I will here stay my selfe. For I thincke it not at this present meete, the goodly giftes and indumēts of your minde to set forth and describe wyth due prayse and commē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Now therefore I am to beseech you (most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt and renowmed Prince) that you will vouchsafe to take these my trauayles curteously, and most grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously bestow some leysure &amp; time in readīg my doings (such as they are) accordinge to your accustomed gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes and clemencie.
