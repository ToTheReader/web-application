   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>E not astonisht to see this
Collection come out in
print, hee that hath tane
the paines, to make it had
reason to thinke that after
you had read the letters of
so many ingenious men, you would take it
well to see these offers of women. There
is no colour to say it will becomes their
sexe: for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ke a complement, you must not
thinke it strange that they can write one.
Tis the principall subject of these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which are not confused nor shufled
together, as many others which the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
esteeme good. They are not treatises,
nor orations; they are no deepe discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
wherein there is nothing smels of a
Letter, but Sir your servant. But it is not
needfull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> to witnesse these good, that I
make others appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>re ill. I will onely say
that if the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>nvy, for by one of
these names I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> call the cause of their
error, which I would farther oppose if
these Ladies had need of my Apology, but
they defend themselves better by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
than those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> deserve. And
I will content my selfe to say, that if this
age hath seene many that write with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of all the world upon the most
important matters Religion, and morality,
wee need not make it such a marvell that
they can endite good letters, seeing they
can make good bookes. But it is time to
finish this advertisement; and I vow I am
to blame to detaine the reader from the
booke it selfe, where he shall receive much
more satisfaction, than I am able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
