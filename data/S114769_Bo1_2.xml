   <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>BEcause this Catechisme is verye short, I thought it needfull to adde and adioyne vnto the ende thereof (good Reader) certeine duties requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God at the handes of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be performed vnder payne of damnation, and the testimonies of Scripture which proue the same. For surely this naughtye age in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of dutie is verie remisse &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward, perswaded, as it seemeth, that a meere profession of Religion with the lippe is Christianity inough. And what is the speeches of the most part of men in these dayes when they are blamed for their vngodly life, but these &amp; such like? VVhy, God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, men cannot be saints and angels, you are ouer precise &amp; pure.<note place="margin">Luke 1, ℣se 74, 75.</note> As if it were not written that we are therfore deliuered by Christ from our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Hell, Death, and Damnation, that wee shoulde serue God without feare all the daies of our life in holines
<pb facs="23"/>and righteousnes before him, and in another place that wee should liue so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,<note place="margin">Tim. 2, ℣se 12.</note> righteously, and godlye in this presente worlde. And in another place: That if anye bee in Christ, hee must be a new creature.<note place="margin">2, Cor, 5.</note> And againe: Follow peace with all men,<note place="margin">Heb, 12.</note> and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, without the which no man shal see the Lorde. And to the same effecte there are infinite testimonies of holie Scripture. But I would suche mocke-gods were once mindfull of their wofull state, which maye rather bee tearmed incarnate Diuels then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian mē, or members of the holy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, so long as they continue so desperately nought. I would (good reader) either thine or mine admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might doe some of them good. Farewell in Christ, and let vs pray in the spirit, for the peace and prosperity of Zion, &amp; our gratious Souereigne.</p>
