      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E that liue now at this time, Gentle Reader, doe both see and feele, that very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and troublesome are our dayes by meanes of certaine questions, that within these fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers haue moued in religion. Whereby although the most part of Christian men do sticke still to that religion, which was the only religion of all Christian men, and of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> himselfe before his breach: yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others are carried quite away vvith the chaūge, &amp; many also stand in doubt betweene God and Baal, not knowing, or not determined, vvhich of them to folow. Of al these sorts, innumerable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are since the garboyle departed out of this life: where they finde euery one of them, who here was right, &amp; who was wrong. And wee must also follow: it is the way that all flesh passeth. An heauie
<pb facs="4"/> and a miserable case when a man hath passed ouer this life (as he thoght) in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, then in a moment, for his wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, negligence, or ignorance, to be plunged into euerlasting fire, where hee shall finde no end, no comfort, no ease, no hope, but continuall weeping, and gnashing of teeth.</p>
   <p>The like troubles, and soule-daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, haue bin (as wee know) very often in the world before: no age almost these sixteene hundred yeares, without such miserie: yea, most ages with many kinds and great heapes of such calamitie pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously afflicted, and grieuously oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.<note place="margin">

Finallie in this sixtienth hundred, Luther, Zwingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Melanchthon, Caluin, and an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number more. Besides verie manie moe, that in euerie one of these ages I haue omitted. In so much, that skarce any piece or article there is of our whole Faith, but by one or other, first or last, it hath bin called in question. And that with such likeing for the time, that they haue all in a manner drawen after them great heardes of followers, and brought many others also to doubt and wauer.</p>
   <p>I say not here, which sort did well,
<pb facs="5"/> nor which did ill. But gone they all are, &amp; haue receiued, as they deserued, both they that with the seuerall blastes would not be moued, and they that remoued. And now are wee vppon the stage, our course also very nere at hād to be called of, and to giue accompt how we played our partes: yea euery day and houre some of vs serued with such citations. And no sooner any man appeareth, but by and by he heareth his iudgement, full grieuous (God knoweth) and importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if such were his desertes. Then to repent, too late: and to seek our wonted solace of wordly things, in vaine. No man then, that can make himselfe a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine to leane vpon to ease hys elbowes. Neither vaine glorie, that then can serue the turne, nor braue apparaile, nor great liuings, nor carnall pleasure, nor sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous buildings, nor successiō in lands or states: finallie, no other earthly thing, that any foole here imagineth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, &amp; for the transitory shadow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of letteth goe his handfast of eternitie.</p>
   <p>Which well and deepely considered are not they now happie who in those
<pb facs="6"/> former like perilous times did know the right way, and for to winne nothing, nor to leese nothing, would forsake it? And they againe now most miserable wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that for such shadowes, contemned the right, or embraced the wrong? We then also at this present standing in like perill, and euerlasting daunger of our soules, haue we not neede to awake, to shake off our slouth, and to looke about vs? I deale not now with them, which say in their foolish heartes, that there is no God, no Christ, no soule, no heauen, no hell, no right way, nor no wrong: of whome (God help) the world is too too full. Neither with them do I deale, which thinke no way at all so wrong, but that it may serue well enough to heauen. All which sorts of vaine men, how vvise so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer that they seeme in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, haue most certainely all good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, all true wisedome, and (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Christian men is most irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) all Diuine Scripture, cleane against them, For wheresoeuer the said Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures speake of Nicolaites and such like, who is there, that findeth left for such
<pb facs="6"/> any hope of saluation?</p>
   <p>Therefore to leaue these, vanishing away in their foolish fansies, and to talke with others that beleeue the Scriptures, and therefore thinke well that some in those forsaid ages found the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp; that other some by walking by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies are fallen into damnation: of these I demaund (if at least wise they care for themselues, more thē for their pelfe that soone will forsake them) whether they would not be glad to know these waies, to walke the one, and to auoid the other? the matter is past with those aforetime: it is we that are in daunger, that stand of making, or els of marring. If happely we could light in the steppes of them that are in Heauen, wee were made foreuer. But if we walke on the same pathes that lead others to hel, then are wee marred and vndonne foreuer.</p>
   <p>Here therefore it would be known, what way they that now are safe, did then take when they were in perill. In their seuerall times very many and verie great questions (as I haue said) vvere mooued by new deuisers: and some all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb facs="7"/> there vvere, that could, and did trie the matters with them by learning: but these very few, if we compare them with the multitude, besides that the said triall is very long: and many, before it can be made, passe out of this world, to their certaine damnation, if they go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine. What other remedy, what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way is there than for such? Is there any, or is there none? If there be none, let vs eate and drinke, and make good cheare: for we shall die to morrow. But (thankes be to God) there is good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, there are also other waies inough and not only for the vnlearned and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull multitude, but also for them that are of greatest learning, of deepest knowledge. Onely needefull here it is, that a mā be willing to be set in the right way, and to hold him in it. Who better learned than <hi>S. Augustine?</hi> Who more surely now in heauen? He then, besides learning, what other waies had hee to hold him right? To the Manichees, of whose sect once he was, thus he saith.</p>

      <hi>In Catholica Ecclesia, vt omittam sincerissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam Sapientiam, ad cuius cognitionem pauci
<pb facs="7"/> spiritales in hac vita perueniunt, vt eam ex mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nima quidem parte, quia homines sunt, sed ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men sine dubitatione cognoscant: (caeterā quip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe turbam non intelligendi viuacitas, sed cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi simplicitas tutissimā facit) vt ergo hanc omittam Sapientiam, quam in Ecclesia esse Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholica non creditis, multa sunt alia quae in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius gremio me iustissime teneant. Tenet consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio populorum atque gentium: Tenet authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas miraculis inchoata, spe nutrita, charitate aucta, vetustate firmata: Tenet ab ipsa Sede Petri Apostoli, cui pascendas oues suas post re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrectionem Dominus commendauit, vsque ad praesentem Episcopatum Successio Sacerdotum: Tenet postremo ipsum Catholicae nomen, quod non sine causa inter tam multas Haereses sic ista Ecclesia sola obtinuit, &amp;c.</hi> In the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church: to let passe most pure wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge, to the percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing whereof, a few spiritual men in this life doe attaine, so that they perceaue it in a very litle peece pardie, because they are but men: but yet without all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: (for as touching the other multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, it is not quicknesse of vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but simplicitie of beleeuing, that maketh thē most safe) that I omit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="8"/> this wisedome, which in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church to be you (Manichees and other Heretikes) doe not beleeue: many other things there are, which in her lap most worthily do keep me. There keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mee consent of peoples and nations: There keepeth me authority, by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles begonne, nourished by hope, by Charity increased, by Antiquity made firme and sure: There keepeth me Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Priestes from the very See of Peter the Apostle (to whome our Lord after his resurrectiō committed the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his sheepe) euen to the Bishop that now is: There keepeth me finallie the very name of Catholike, which not without cause amongst so many he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies this Church alone hath obteined, &amp;c. And in an other place to the same he retiks he saith againe: <hi>Christo esse credēdum, credidi famae, celebritate, consensione, vetustate roboratae. Vos autem &amp; tam pauci, &amp; tam tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulenti, &amp; tam noui, nemini dubium est, quin nihil dignum authoritate praeferatis.</hi> That Christ must be beleeued, I beleued fame (or authority) fortified with vniuersali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, consent, and antiquity. But you (He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes)
<pb facs="8"/> being both so few, and so diss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious, and so new risen, no man doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but that you shew nothing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth authority.</p>
   <p>Here (as wee see) this most learned, most holy, most renoumed Father alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth many most worthy reasons (as hee tearmeth them) to hold him still a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike. As indeed vpon that matter he wrote his whole said booke <hi>De vtilitate credendi,</hi> Concerning the vtility of bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. So did Tertullian of the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter write his book <hi>De praescriptionibus Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticorum,</hi> Of exceptions against Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes. And also Vincentius Lyrinensis, his booke <hi>Contra prophanas omnium haereseon nouationes.</hi> Against the prophane inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations of al Heresies. These their books they wrote of the most iust and worthy reasons, which there are to mooue anie man to forsake al Heresies, and to liue &amp; die a catholike▪ which bookes I wish all such my deare Countrimen to read, as will know the truth, and specially the holy Scripture of the actes of the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, with Saint Beedes Ecclesiastical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of our own Nation.</p>
   <pb facs="9"/>
   <p>What such reasons may to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose be gathered out of those Authors, and their like, grounded all vpon most certaine and diuine authoritie, I in this Treatise haue in part declared: shewing particularly, in euery one of them, some vndoubted cause to moue any man to beleeue vs, and not the Protestants, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritants, nor other Heretikes: &amp; in all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that nothing there is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of a Christian man, but vvith vs it maketh plainely, and against them plainely: no such thing against vs, no such thing with thē. What those things are, <hi>S. Augustine</hi> a litle before did partly vtter: and by reading ouer this Treatise thou shalt more fullie know. Which whosoeuer will vouchsafe to doe vvith any crumme of the feare of God, I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile much, but hee will confesse in his mouth or heart, that the truth of Christ is on our side. So plainely shall he here perceaue, that our religion it is, vvhich was deliuered to the world by Christ our Lord and his Apostles, vvhich also euer since hath still continued, &amp; which is also most sure hereafter to continue
<pb facs="9"/> alwaies to the end: no might nor ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> downe. Whereas all other Religions, which before in part I rehearsed out of all Ages, as they had their beginning, so haue they had also their ending: except only these present Sectes brought in by Luther: whose end also yet, no doubt, shalbe seene, as hath bin seene their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, &amp; that as it were but yesterday, they neuer being so much as one Age, yeare, day, or houre, in any part of the world before.</p>
   <p>Al this, and much more of like impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tāce, shal he find here most clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. That and if they also, which please themselues in thinking that there is no God nor Christ, will read the same: I hope, that therby with the grace of God they shall see, how fowly they deceaue themselues. Howbeit vnto them I ment not this small labour of mine. For that which should haue bin prepared for thē directly, should haue bin (I know) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of another sort. which hereafter might peraduenture be done, but that it is a shame of all shames, only to heare,
<pb facs="10"/> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>pes so out of kinde. Yet because the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>atholike faith and the faith of Christ stand both vpon one and the selfe-same groundes (as in deed they be all one but only that Heretikes forsaking the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, thinke yet that they haue hot forsaken Christ his faith) such a one shall in pervsing these groundes of the Catholike faith, vnderstand withal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny groundes of Christ his faith: as, that he is now come not to beleeue in Christ, hee came thither by forsaking first the Catholike faith. And therfore (as I haue said) if it will please him to know these groundes, and to consider wel vpon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of them, he shall (with the helpe of Christ) return again both to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith, and to the faith of Christ. And so I trust, that by the grace of god it shal do good to al sorts of men, confirme Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, reclaime Heretikes, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en euen the Atheistes themselues.</p>
   <p>But and if any man will needes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue wilful and obstinate, as (no doubt) very many wil: <hi>Non enim omnium est fides,</hi> for faith is not for all men: yet because
<pb facs="10"/>
      <hi>Nemo perit, nisi filius perditionis,</hi> let others in the name of God looke vp, and no more take darkenes for light, night for daie, poyson for medicine, death for saluation. Let no man, nor nothing make Christian men to go from Christ. Let none keepe the Children of the Church out of the Church. They that needes wil perish let them perish by themselues alone. Let thē remaine alone without the Church, that will not returne vnto the Church. Let them alone pay the price of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines &amp; rebellion, who for nothing that Moises saith or doth, wilbe brought to yeld, vntill God doth shew his might vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as he did on Pharao. They that will not be drowned with them in Hell, come out of Egypt in the name of God with the children of Israel. Christ hath sent vs this time, to make the proued knowen and manifest, to see who loueth him, or the world, better: denouncing plainly to vs al, that <hi>Whosoeuer loueth Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or mother, more then me, is not worthy of me: &amp; whosoeuer loueth son or daughter aboue me, is not worthy of me, &amp; whosoeuer taketh not his Crosse, &amp; foloweth me, is not worthy of me.</hi>
      <pb facs="11"/> Let vs therefore both for his feare, &amp; or his loue, take affliction for his sake. What auaileth it a man, to saue or gett, say not a few akers of Land, a house or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>wo, yea a Kingdome or Empire, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the very whole vniuersall world: and then a litle after not only to forgo al that againe, but also to leese irreparably him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his own soule? If therefore it chaunce any man, to leese for his cause either house, or brethen, or sisters, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands and liuings: let such a one remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his fidelity &amp; omnipotencie, &amp; that he hath saied, <hi>Hee shal receaue an hundred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold as much, and inherite euerlasting life.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If some mighty &amp; trustie petson, king or Queen, should say vnto any one of his subiectes, forgoe for my sake to day thy liuing, &amp; to morow I will giue thee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as good or better: who would not, only to haue his fauour, accord to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire? what is it thē els but lacke of faith, or rather plain infidelity, that for Christs word, whose might, and trustines, and reward is incomparably greater, hys loue infinitly better, we wil do nothing?
<pb facs="11"/> doubtlesse either his promises, or his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, or both, we doe not beleeue.</p>
   <p>Verily, if wee haue but one graine of faith, then will wee doe not only with those our exteriours, but also with our life it selfe as he requireth.<note place="margin">

And againe wil he not say in his generall Iudgement
<pb facs="12"/> at the last day: <hi>Quamdiu fecistis vni ex his fratribus meis minimis, mihi fecistis. Quamdiu non fecistis vni de minoribus his, nec mihi fecistis?</hi> For as much as you did it to one of these my brethren the lowest, you did it to me: &amp; for as much as you did it not to one of these the lowest, neyther to me you did it? therefore thinke we not, but that there be diuers and sundry waies both of confessing, and also of denying him. If we haue but common wit vvith vs, we may consider, that it is extreame folly: the things which very quickly wee must forgoe, whether we will or no, not to forgoe them a little sooner for Gods sake, who gaue them vnto vs, and vvho will restore them againe, yea, and that so much more and better, as wee haue not seene, nor heard, nor cannot think. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be god our most merciful father, that daily giueth into the hearts of many for to suffer, &amp; encrease he, and multiplie his gift vnspeakable. By that may we hope, that al shalbe wel: &amp; that the sooner, the moe that he will stir to suffer. Which is so litle to be abhored either of the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers themselues, or of their brethrē, that
<pb facs="12"/> in respect thereof we rather may, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

She was in the workes of our brethren white before: but now she is become in the blood of Martyrs of purple colour. Neither lillies nor roses are wanting to her flowers.</p>
   <p>And so vvith his wordes in the same place I conclude this Preface: <hi>Certent nunc singuli ad vtriusque honoris amplissimam dignitatē, vt accipiant coronas vel de opere candidas, vel de pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione purpureas. In coelestibus castris &amp; pax &amp; acies habent flores suos, quibus miles Christi ob gloriam co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronetur.</hi> Let each man now labour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the most noble dignity of both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: to get Garlandes, either white by working: or purple by suffering. In the heauenly camps both peace &amp; the field haue their flowers, whereof to make for Christ his souldiars garlands of glory.</p>
