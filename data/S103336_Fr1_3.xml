   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL, AND MINE HONOVRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friend, <hi>Sir</hi> ISACK SYDLEY, <hi>Knight Baronet,</hi> Grace, Mercy, <hi>and</hi> Peace, <hi>be multiplied.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orthy Sir, I can truly say, my greatest, and (in effect) on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joy, in this world, is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be preaching, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for it; fishing, or mending my net. That which to many is a great paine and wearisomnesse, is to me greatest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and content. I finde that saying of <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> most true; <hi>Wherein a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth there is no labour;</hi> or, <hi>that labour is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>

         </gap>; aut labor ipse amatur. August.</note>. It is a true saying, that Printing is a kinde of Preaching <note n="*" place="margin">

(wanting the habit and gesture of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving man, the life of Oratorie <note n="*" place="margin">Solet acceptior es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se sermo vivus, quā scriptus. Bern.</note>) yet is it both of larger extent, (seeing a man may preach to moe with his penne, than he can with his tongue, and be further heard out of the Presse, than the Pulpit) the matter delivered more memorable, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording greater leave to pause and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) and also of longer continuance; for a dead man may live in his bookes, and by them preach to the living, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, when he dieth. I would account it a double happinesse, if I could doe good both waies, and could truly say with that blessed and prime Apostle, <hi>I thinke it meet, as long as I am in this Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to stir you up: Moreover I will endevour, that you may be able, after my decease, to have these things alwaies in remembrance</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 13.</note>. Oh, now is the time (if ever) for Ministers of the Gospell <hi>instantly to preach the Word</hi>

As I am bound by mine office to preach the word, <hi>(and woe be to me if I doe it not</hi>
      <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 16.</note>) so hath my loving master (whom I have now served, in foure full apprentiships) well deserved, that I should faithfully lay out, and trade with such gifts, as he hath <hi>committed to my trust</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 11.</note>; as may be for his greatest advantage <note n="g" place="margin">Matth. 25. 27.</note>.</p>
   <p>The desire of my soule, is (the evening of my life drawing on, <hi>and the shadowes thereof stretching out</hi>
      <note n="h" place="margin">Ierem. 6. 4.</note>) not only to be found <hi>well doing</hi>
