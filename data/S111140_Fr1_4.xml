Sure, he shall beare his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. These two lawes haue enforced me, first publikely to preach; then secondly to publish the sequell in print. And so much the more, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer two decrees of mount Sion, they concerne neerer then many.</p>
   <p>In my first looking after religion,<note place="margin">A ground of the Authors aberration.</note> my lot was to associate such onely, as onely tasted and affected another kind of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, which (as they said) yet we had not in England. And that they tearmed the ministerie of Pastor, Doctor, Elders, Deacons, Widowes, due to euerie particular Church. Those words I soone learned: as also, that the Pastor was to exhort, the Doctor to teach or deliuer doctrine, the Elders to gouerne and exercise the disciplinall cens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>res in common with Pastor and Doctor, the Deacons onely to attend poore and loue-feastes, the widowes to wait on the sicke.</p>
   <p>That platforme once swallowed, I then was easily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that our Bishops, their Ordinations and all ministerie stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnder them, it was Antichristian, and an Image of the beast. And looke how many corruptions, so many markes of the beast, which whosoeuer receiued in forehead or hand,
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
euen all such should drinke of the cup of the wine of God his wrath.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">The authors voyages, yet he could be resolued.</note>All this so hanging togither, except I would practise contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to my perswasion, (as many deceitfully haue done) out of the land I must, as I loued my libertie. I did so. First into the Low-countries I went, Afterwards into Scotland. After that againe into the Low-countries. Then again into Scotland: And once againe into Netherland, &amp;c. Sometimes haled by this faction, sometimes pulled by that faction. But (the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercifull vnto me) howsoeuer I was notablie distract a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout externall Church-gouernment, yet (as all my printed bookes will testifie) I kept me euer fast vnto the maine point, that is,<note place="margin">The time when, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop by whom he was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral function.</note> vnto the foundation of the Gospell, I had before here receiued: and had in Lancashire for some two yeares pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely ministred, being before (now some nine yeares since) ordained fully thereto by Bishop <hi>Wicham</hi> then Bishop of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne.</p>
   <p>About some fiue years since, it pleased God to giue me an earnest desire to search antiquitie,<note place="margin">A meanes for his setling and reducement.</note> if happily that way I might find any assured footing of scriptures sence, touching exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Church orders. Togither with this desire, the Lord affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me plentie of bookes, first in Scotland, after in Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The more I read those writers that liued in the first 400 years, the more I perceiued the former scales to fall from mine eies. And as the light of the faithfull increaseth till it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect day; so, togither with my last returne for England, the fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie mist was risen and fled, the Sunne of righteousnesse shined vpon me: and that (to the praise of God be it spoken) in such euidence of scripture, as I hope my selfe enabled to draw (as on a table) an euident <hi>Idea</hi> and shape of that miscarying way, if so men will waigh it in simplicitie of spirit. Yet this must here be done but briefly according to the nature of an epistle.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Pastors and Doctors, their late descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of offices, too to fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical and new.</note>Pastor and Doctor are distinguished by them (from <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7.8.) by exhortation and doctrine. The Doctor is to be first exercised in doctrine, the Pastor in the second place is to exhort from that doctrine. From hence then must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: first, that the Doctor is aboue the Pastor; seeing the Pastor
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>
but buildeth vpon the doctrine of his Doctor: Euen as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles laying the foundation, then were in an higher office then the Euangelistes or Pastors that but builded on the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles ground. And for this consideration, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> would not worke vpon others building. The order then must be thus; <hi>Doctor, Pastor.</hi> And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7. Doctrine indeed is put before exhortation. Secondly, if doctrine and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion distinguish them, then it shall be as verily sinne for the Doctor in his exercise to meddle with exhortation, or for the Pastor to meddle with doctrine, as it was for <hi>Vzzah</hi> an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Leuit to touch the Arke of God (though in a danger to fal) which medling with the Arke distinguished <hi>Aarons</hi> family, from the other two Leuits. Thirdly, then it skilleth not though the Pastor be a man of no learning (for all the learning to speake of, lieth in a deliuerie of the scriptures naturall sense, with a drawing out of his proper doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ines) and to exhort, is so farre inferiour to doctrine, as the application of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine (to a seen sore) doth vtter no such knowledge, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision and composition of the medicine. If they say, the Pastor is to exhort, but not <hi>onely,</hi> he may <hi>also</hi> teach: the like (say I) with as good reason may be spoken of the Doctor, not onely to teach, but principally. Which toyish order of teaching &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting, as no reformed Church abroad is acquainted with it (for they acknowledge no sole Doctor, but of the schooles) so their distinction of <hi>Not onely,</hi> but <hi>principally,</hi> as it may be vsed likewise in the following offices, so let vs see how much it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for them.</p>
   <p>The Elders they distinguish by <hi>Ruling</hi> (from 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.) as the Pastor and Doctor,<note place="margin">Their Lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as fond.</note> by the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>doctrine.</hi> Here say they, are both sorts of Elders: Rulers in the first place, teachers in the second. First, touching the term<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s (<hi>word</hi> and <hi>doctrine</hi>) doctrine being onely that which is drawne from the word, here so is no speech of the Pastor and his exhortation: and so no double honour for the Pastor. Secondly, if by <hi>Ruling</hi> in the first place, be meant <hi>onely</hi> a gouerning of the Church without doctrine, then the deliuerer of the word and doctrine last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, he must be debarred Rule▪ rule appertaining to the
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>
first; doctrine, to the second. If it be replied, that the Pastor and Doctor also are to rule though not principally: so others may aswell reply, the Elders are not onely (though principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to be exercised in Ruledome, for they also may teach. That the Elders might onely rule, not teach; though they make him a Bishop (in english Ouerseer) yet they will vnderstand him vnder the word Deacon: for thus it is in the demonstration of discipline.</p>

   <p>Marke well, how first he maketh two sorts of Bishops (Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Doctors) then two sorts of Deatons; Ouerseers and distributors. First, a right plaine man may obserue, that to make an Ouerseer (or gouerning Elder) to be a Church-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, it is verie ridiculous. Secondly, to make Bishops one in the first diuision, &amp; Ouerseers another in the second diuision: it is to make a difference between <hi>I</hi> and <hi>I</hi>: that is, a difference where none is. For Bishops and Ouerseers are all one: Bishops being the Greeke word, and Ouerseers the English. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision so of the offices, not onely void of diuinitie and art, but also of verie common sense. Yet a correction due to the sons of God, when they seeke to bring in their owne inuentions. But to what purpose haue they thrust the word Ouerseer vnder the word Deacon? Because forsooth in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. they would not vnderstand the office of Elders in the word Bishop: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is there required, that euerie Bishop (or Church ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer) he should be <hi>Apt to teach:</hi> and they would haue Elders of another stampe. Whereas that in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1.2. (together with <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17. where Elders are by vers. 28. expounded O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerseers or Bishops, on all which the Apostle enioyneth teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he before had) it plainly euinceth, that all Ouerseers are to be exercised in teaching. By both which plaine places, that more obscure place in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. (<hi>They that rule well are worthie double honour, specially they that tyre themselues in the word and doctrine</hi>) it must be vnderstood, either of one and
<pb n="9" facs="5"/>
the same sort of Elders in the Church; whereof all deseruing well, some (by reason of more trauaile) deserue better: or else (whereto I rather condescend) the first is spoken of Ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers to a particular Church: the latter (for <hi>Kopiontes</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth we ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>omenes by trauelling to and fro, as in <hi>Iohn, Ch.</hi> 4. <hi>vers.</hi> 6.) it implieth such Elders as <hi>Paul, Iohn, Peter,</hi> &amp; others that trauelled from place to place, hauing care ouer many churches.</p>
   <p>Touching the Deacons (who are to be employed <hi>onely</hi> in and about the poore and tables) I take that <hi>onely</hi> were better (as before) turned into principally:<note place="margin">Their Deac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap> mutilation.</note> and that by reason of more sufficient teachers present, as also such occasion about the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and poore, as was in Ierusalem at the time of their first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. But that there is no time nor place for the Deacon to preach and baptize, the scripture affordeth not that. The contrarie appeareth in <hi>Philip,</hi> preaching and baptizing in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, before the Apostles came thither to promoue him into an Euangelists place: or yet the Angell had called him to any busines with the Eunuch. Besides, seeing the scripture requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth such a one to hold the mysterie of faith, to be full of the holy ghost, and of wisedome, it plainly argueth, it is, because he may assist in that busines. And seeing (by all probability) those seuen Deacons were of the 70 disciples (for then they were in that Church; and be sure that the people would choose the best) it cannot be auoided, but Deacons must be fitted that way: that so ministring well, they may be preferred in time to a greater degree.</p>
   <p>For the Widowes in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">Widowes too childishly c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Rom. 12.8.</note> there is no controuersie: but that they should be concluded from <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. (<hi>he that is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull</hi>) that is, worse then childish. For euerie child knows that <hi>He</hi> is not a <hi>She.</hi> The Brownists to couer this foppery, they say not <hi>Widowes,</hi> but <hi>Relieuers</hi>: that so vnder this new word they may steale into y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Church, <hi>Widowers:</hi> so well as Widowes. Yet, where it is said, they should attend on sicke, as scripture speaketh of no such matter; so, if we remember that she must not be vnder 60. years aged, as also one that hath no helpe from her kindred, it should seeme to me, that she is rather receiued to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred vnto, then to minister.</p>
   <p>

Yet because first abroad, and now at home I resist those nouelties according to knowledge: the Brownists abroad sparse notable vntruthes against me (witnes those, to whom my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the sinne against the holy ghost is dedicate) and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious at home quickly sup vp the euomitings of the Brownist, that so thereby they may defile me and my ministery.

Common do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of ordinarie course I here haue omitted, holding me (for the most part) vnto certaine grounds of controuersie, by the which disquieted soules may be setled. I choose this Parable before other scriptures, because it is a ground of grounds for direction vnto Churches state and condition: the verie scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which many peruert to their owne ruine: and yet (<hi>ni malè memini</hi>) the first scripture whereby I recouered my stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Pray in humilitie yet thou read. Read without preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate affection. Ponder what thou readest: But giue no defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiue sentence, before thou haue read the whole. What here may be deliuered too succinctly, that (if God will) may once be deliuered more largely. Meane time, be thankefull vnto God for this, and helpe me with thy prayers.</p>
