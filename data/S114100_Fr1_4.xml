      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader: In this Treatise, Truth and zeale of Gods glory which were aymed at, I trust, will appeare. But I should hardly haue deliuered store of reading, though I had beene furnished therewith. For neither doth the quality of the Message controwled, require it: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it fitting for him in whose name it is answered, to make shew of it. The Person answering is our blessed Sauiour himselfe, whose word is a proofe inuincible. In whose name a popish Priest hath audaciously praesumed to deliuer an Embassage which he neuer receaued. The Message it selfe is full of rayling, lyes, and blasphemies; but no learning at all. I cannot find that scarcely once he attempteth to prooue any of those idolatrous and Popish opinions, which he euery where scattereth. As he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downe false principles of Popish doctrine without proofes: so it may be found in this <hi>Countermand,</hi> that they are crossed and checked with the Positiue Truth, supported with some chiefe &amp; fundamentall arguments thereof. Of this I thought good to aduertise thee, because this Answere intendeth onely to discouer the praesump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a false Embassadour, the impudent calumniations of a notable Rayler, and the erroneous doctrines of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
<pb facs="4"/> Priest: to the end, to controwle the malapert saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of the Embassadour, to retort the iniurious crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Railer, to oppose the Truth of God to the Romish profession; that wisedome may be iustified of all her children; and they that run well may run so still, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the light of God do shine full in their hearts: and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till vnremooueable grace bee with all them that loue the Lord Iesus Christ in syncerity.</p>
