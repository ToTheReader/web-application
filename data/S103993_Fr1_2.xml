   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a double Tie upon my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards you, that bindes me to the largest acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest by my best abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:

Your generall eminence both in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and, the worthiest meanes to it, Desert (which duly chalenge the generall observance of all men) and your particular noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to me, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire from me a never sufficient gratitude. But as Presents derive their value as well from the esteeme of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
<pb facs="3"/>
as from their owne inherent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; so will you make this rich by your acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance, that is without all worth as it is my poore Donative, though it containe in it selfe many secret and mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vertues, being an Enchiridion of many rare subjects, both Morall and Divine, fit for the most serious

The only end for which I beg your Noble disposition to entertaine it, is that it may be understood a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
<pb facs="4"/>
of his due thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, whose only ambition is to be knowne and stiled,</p>
