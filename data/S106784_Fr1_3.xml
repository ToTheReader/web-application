   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath alwaies beene held a matter worth note (gentle Reader) euen to the best Diuines, to haue the Typographicall descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the townes and places, as they are mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and so much the rather, because by comparing the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men with the beginnings and endings of Cities, they might the better vnderstand the Prophets, and perceiue the wonderfull prouidence of God; who by his omnipotencie so disposeth of Estates, that such Cities and Nations which haue beene mightie and ruled vpon the earth, with great power, notwithstanding on a sudden, and by vnexpected euents, haue beene vtterly subuerted and ouerthrowne. Now that these things might be more apparant, I haue in as good and briefe a method as I can, gathered out of sundry Authors, the particular description of the Cities, Townes, and places, as they are mentioned in the Scriptures; where they stood, vnder whose command, at what time they grew mightie, and how lost and decayed.</p>
   <p>To this also I haue added a particular narration of the Trauels of all the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, Princes, Iudges, Kings, Emperours, our blessed Sauiour, and his Apostles: to what townes they trauelled, what memorable actions they did in those places; with a short Chronologie of the times: that so by comparing this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with any text of Scripture, you may perceiue the time when those accidents happened. All which things (I am perswaded) will proue no lesse pleasant than profitable, and will giue a great light to the vnderstanding of the Bible. But if you question with me, How it is possible that I should come to the knowledge of those things, considering that Babylon, Niniuey, Ierusalem, and most of the Cities of the Holy Land, are long since wasted and decaied? to this I answer; therein consists the greatnesse of the Trauell, because I haue beene constrained to vse the helpe of many Authors, who amongst other long and learned discourses, haue here and there glanced at the actions that were done in the land of Iudaea: amongst which are <hi>Strabo, Ierome, de Locis Hebraicis, Plinie, Liuie, Plutarch,</hi> and many others, who haue described in the actions of the Persians, Chaldaeans, Graecians, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, the state of the Iewes as it stood in those times, with the Description of the Cities, and townes. And Saint
<hi>Ierome,</hi> who liued in that countrie, tooke a great
<pb facs="4"/> deale of paines to rectifie these imperfect discourses which more obscure authors haue laboured in, and left to future ages; that so those which would, might by their dilligence, and care make them vsefull to informe their vnderstanding, both concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the state of the Iewes, and the obscure meaning of some of the prophesies.</p>
   <p>Also the scituation and destruction of Ierusalem, a thing pleasant and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know, and no whit vnworthie your consideration. How all or the most part of the Townes, Cities, Countries, Nations, Islands, Seas, Desarts, Mountaines, and most memorable places, are scituated from it; how many miles English they stand distant, what memorable actions haue beene done in them, and for the most part where they stood, and how they are at this day.</p>
   <p>Besides (to make this a perfect worke) you shall finde after the end the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and before the beglnning of the new; a discourse concerning the weights, measures, and monies which are mentioned in the Scriptures, reduced vnto our valuation, how they were currant among the Iewes, how with other people, nations, and countries: by which meanes that necessitie of commutatiue Iustice, for which monies were principally inuented, will be apparent; and by this meanes you shall perceiue what equalitie there is and hath beene vsed amongst Nations, for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of measures and monies: by which you may perceiue, that this vniuerse being compared together, seemeth but one large and spacious Empire, howsoeuer vnder diuers gouernments.</p>
   <p>Againe, the perigrination of our Sauiour, the manner of his wonderfull natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, his long and tedious journies, the condition of his estate whiles he was vpon the earth, and (as neere as can be guest) at what time he did most of his miracles; how he behaued himselfe when he was betraied, with a description of the manner of his death: and the Trauels of <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and many other of his Apostles after his death. All which things I haue with much labour compiled together for your profit, and expect nothing in recompence for my paines, but your loue. And so I commit you to God</p>
