         </gap>iers of the maine grounds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in doctrine, and practise, are the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and the present Romish Church.</hi> The necessarie consequent whereof is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly prooued, namely, <hi>That we may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ioyne with them in their religion: but for euer contend against them for the faith once giuen to the Saints:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Vers. 3.</note> which wee can neuer doe if wee auoide not their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, as the rockes on which wee shall necessarily suffer shipwracke, or death it selfe, vnto which they cannot but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the professors. The antecedent or former part seemeth (by the way) to be a direct and naturall answere vnto a Popish pamphlet, alreadie by three learned men sufficientlie confuted; wherein <hi>H.T.</hi> by twelue triuiall articles (in comparison) goeth about the bush to prooue, that Protestants haue neither faith nor pietie, religion nor good life. To whom our Author in the exposition of the third verse reioyndeth, and (dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the number of those articles with aduantage) in the same order prooueth the Romish faith to be aduersary in sixe and twentie seuerall, solid and maine grounds vnto Christian faith and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise. I will no longer stand on this part than I haue shewed who these Papists be, meant by the Author from whom wee must depart; and that for this end, that the sequell of our separation from them may bee acknowledged most iust and necessarie. By such a Papist wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not euery one who in some things may bee Popishly affected, for true faith may stand with some errors, and the end of that faith be the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mens soules: so bee the partie aberring be framed to these two rules: First, <hi>he must of necessitie h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>ld the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> namely, that in Iesus Christ alone, and in no other name, either Angell or man, himselfe or others, saluation is to be sought for. If a man vpon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation build some wood, nay, stubble,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> or chaffe, though these shall be burned, yet himselfe shal be saued, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it were through fire. Secondly, <hi>those errors must not be ioyned with either a willing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">

The Ruler is said to beleeue (and that was by a iustifying faith) when as yet he was onely ouercome by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of Christ;<note place="margin">Ioh. 4.53.</note> appearing in the miracle of raising his sonne, to assent vnto and acknowledge y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> maine truth that Christ was the Messiah: but so, as himselfe and his household depended on his mouth for further instruction, and became his disciples. Yea euen the Disciples them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues were long after their calling and conuersion very ignorant in no small points of Christianitie. <hi>Philip,</hi> of the first person in Trinitie: <hi>Lord shew vs the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

And secondly this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (the mother of their errors) was accompanied with a desire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: for they were euer questioning with him, desiring him to open vnto them his parables, and resolue their doubts, instantly listning vnto the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious words of his mouth, and in a word were blessed <hi>euen in hungring and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting after righteousnesse.</hi> The persons then here aimed at are absolute &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Papists,<note place="margin">Note well. <hi>Perk.

   <p>The second point is our consequent dutie, standing in our standing out with these aduersaries of Gods grace and Gospell: neuer offering to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with them in their cup of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; nor once bethink vs of leaguing such abhorring natures as are light and darknes: and truth (which is of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained nature) with most foule and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed falsehood. <hi>For we cannot drinke of the cup of the Lord &amp; of Diuels.</hi>

   <p>Thirdly, their cautelous circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, lest by any meanes the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our doctrine might perhaps bee scattered among them, argueth an vtter auersation in them for euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging it, which appeareth in sundry their practises: 1. In that they bind the consciences of all Catholikes, to a perpetuall separation from all our Ecclesiasticall assemblies in religious publike duties; which is the ground of all Recusancie: to which purpose they teach it to bee a sinne to heare our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, for that were a <note n="f" place="margin">

      </note> participation with blasphemies: and for prayer with vs so straite laced are they, as they may not say Amen in publike or priuate, (suppose at their tables) if any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant bee present. 2. In that they cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure most seuerely al their subiects that trauell or traffike into Protestant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, blasting them with excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. 3. In that they haue erected in their Cities an Inquisition to examine vpon oath any forreiner or stranger, whereby they ransake not onely all his carriages, but euen his conscience also, lest he should bring any opinion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him; or instrument without him▪ that standeth not with their minds and liking: wherein not onely some little escape, but euen suspition it selfe proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth often capitall. 4. In their warines, lest any of our books, especially of our translations of the Bible should be had, or read among them: whence it is that no bookes, which passe not the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may bee sold in Italy: to which purpose also studiously they teach it to be a sinne against the first Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reade any of their prohibited bookes, of which they haue a large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex very common, and consequently being such a mortall sinne, it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be confessed at time of shrift: yea as men euery way foreseeing what way our doctrines might bee induced among them, to shut vp surely euery crany and entrance, they scarsely suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to see, or bee seene in the light their owne greatest Writers, such as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>gory de Valencia,</hi> &amp;c. that our positions, allegations, and answeres (though answered by themselues) in those books may not be made known; lest perhaps it should befall others of them as it did <hi>Pighius,</hi> who reading o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Caluins Institutions,</hi> with purpose of refuting it, was (ere he was aware) won to the defence of the doctrine of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by free imputation according to the Apostle. So as <hi>Spaine</hi> maketh not a more diligent annuall search that the <hi>Iewes</hi> among them haue no armes in their houses, than both <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> vigilantly secure themselues in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: and no marueile if our books be so auoided, seeing that they inhibite men from reading the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, lest they should become here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes: condemning it, and <note n="g" place="margin">
         <hi>Fox,</hi> Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> bringing men in daunger of their liues for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, as for an hereticall practise. In a word, at this day such a night doe these Owles delight to liue in, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues euen their Regulars (much lesse their Laicks) may not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out licence from the Pope, or their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, reade the Bible, no not in the Catholike translation.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, consider their irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liable hatred against ours, farre aboue all other (although most hereticall and damnable) religions; for why else can they content themselues with so stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious preuention of the Protestants profession onely; whereas both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> euen in <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe the Popes Sea, are suffered with their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, Synagogues, Seruices, yea &amp; Circumcision it self administred to the dead as well as to the liuing? which lowdly proclaimeth, that farre they are frō iudging, &amp; deeming so indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our differences, as some among our selues seeme to doe: and that they would sooner be wone to the <hi>Iewes</hi> or <hi>Turkes</hi> in profession then the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants: which <note n="h" place="margin">
         <hi>Renal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi>
      </note> one of them saith is in nothing better then that of the Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron; and in many things far worse and more detestable. And good reason (me thinkes) they haue of suffering among them the forenamed Sectes and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, as from whom together with the heathen, the whole body of Poperie is peecemeale patched together, and yet the name of a Protestant bee as much detested of them, as the Iewish names were of the heathen Kings. For which
<pb n="162" facs="86"/>
cause <hi>Daniel</hi> &amp; his fellowes must haue all their names changed before they may bee brought into the presence of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> whēce their ordinary practise proceedeth, that in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, their bitternes and disdaine suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them not to name, but in most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull tearmes, the first reformers and restorers of our Religion: calling them vsually, <hi>Caluinists, Puritans, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uators,</hi> and <hi>Heretikes</hi>; neither doth this inbredde malice of Papists against our Religion stay it self heere, but hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out into most barbarous butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and most cruell bloodsheddings, which yet they could neuer account sufficiently sauage: not of their owne subiects only, and within their owne Territories: but within other domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: not of priuate only, but of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like persons: not of meaner, but of most noble, yea Royall discent: and not of persons only, but of Cities, States, Kingdomes, and Countries. But where should I begin, or if I should, where should I make an end of instācing their most matchlesse, and endlesse tyranny?

Againe, in case a seruant Iew would marry a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into his Masters house, he was not at his departure to carrie his wife and children, for they were to bee his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: but if hee would abide still with her, hee was then shamefully to come before the Magistrate, and for euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his libertie, vntil the Iubily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased him: by which straite lawes the Lord would restraine euen slaues and seruāts (who for the most part are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected) from matching themselues with strangers. Such another law to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is recorded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.10. that if an Israelite in warre, should see a bewtifull woman taken captiue, whom he did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for his wife, it was ordered by God, that first all meanes should bee vsed for the alienating of his affection, as that hee must haue her home a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth before, and not marrie vpon any sudden motion. Secondly shee must shaue her head to make her as ill fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his eies as might be. Thirdly she must nourish her nailes, to make her yet more sordid. Fourthly she must put off the garment wherin she was taken, and put on base, and neglected garments fit for a pensiue captiue. Fifthly shee must bewaile her father and mother a whole moneth, to shew how hardly, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully she was brought from her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, into the power of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: and then if by al these meanes the man could not be drawn frō her loue, it was permitted to him to marrie her for his wife: which law letteth vs see how hardly the Lord endureth, &amp; is drawne to admitte the least liberty in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. How many ciuill things might I instance in, wherein the Lord straitened his people, that they might bee vtterlie vnlike the Gentiles in habit, manner of liuing, behauiour, and other like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, otherwise in themselues very indifferent? which I had heere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, but that I must consider that I write an addition, not a booke; an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, &amp; not an exposition: &amp; if yet these ordinances of God himself, seeme in some mens opinions too straite, and not to be imitated of vs in regard of the Papists, towards whom wee are not to be so seuere, as so far to seuer our selues; that is but the seeking of a knot in a rush, and to be acute in distinguishing, where God hath not distinguished; and in effect to affirme, either that the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the Romish Church is not so vile and grosse, as is that of other Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: or else (seeing our people conuerse with them more then any Idolaters) that to communicate with their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, is nothing so dangerous now, as it was for Gods people, to participate with the Idolatry of the heathē against Gods expresse Commandement. But if with any such the testimony of man, be greater then the testimony of God (as it is commonly with the Popish min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who flie from the Scriptures vnto men, because their doctrine is from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) let them looke vnto those most auncient Councels, which were the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, for sixe hundred yeares after Christ; and they shall finde that the Church would haue her children diametrally opposed euen on lawfull things, to the Iewes, and heathen of whom they were in danger to be corrupted.

      <hi>Beware of the leauen of the Pharisies</hi>; so let euery man beware of the leauen of the Papists: for what is Popish doctrine else, but a Pharisaicall leauen, alwaies to bee purged out of Churches, and states; as the Iewes vpon some occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were to purge al leauen out of their howses.
