Maister Gilbert Gerrard, the Queenes
Maiesties Attourney Generall, Thomas
Churchyard Gent. sendeth this signe
of good will, and wisheth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of worthy fame.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
(right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
to continue in
youre fauour and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
I deuised sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
ways to giue you
some cause of recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
amid the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of youre graue studies, and weightie
affayres, and knowing that no one thing is
more welcome to a worthy witte, than the
vnderstanding of matter, wherein the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of good subiectes is expressed, and the
greatnesse of good minds is made manifest,
<pb facs="3"/>
I haue presented you with a little Booke,
that makes not only report of the noble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
of the Queenes Maiestie into
<hi>Suffolke</hi> and <hi>Norffolke,</hi> but also of the
good order, great cheere, and charges that
hir highnesse subiectes were at, during hir
abode in those parties. And bycause I sawe
most of it, or heard it so credibly rehearsed,
as I know it to be true, I meane to make it a
mirror and shining glasse, that al the whole
land may loke into, or vse it for an example
in all places (where the Prince commeth)
to our posteritie heereafter for euer. For
in very deede, if the dutifull vsage of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi>
and <hi>Norffolke</hi> had not surmoūted
in greatnesse &amp; goodnesse any fiue Sheeres
in England, for hospitalitie, brauerie, and
franke dealing, I had not made mention of
these causes, nor writtē so large a discourse
of their behauioures, and bountifull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of dutie: but finding these two Sheeres
so well furnished of Gentlemē, and so flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing,
<pb facs="3"/>
and ready to attend in time of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
on hir that is oure triumph and
earthly felicitie, I can do no lesse, but with
immortall fame, sounde their prayses, and
vse my penne to their greate glorye and
thankes, as a guerdon due for their worthy
&amp; honest dezerts, hoping that euery other
Sheere, where the Queenes highnesse hath
not bin, will rather striue to follow this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
when occasion is offered, than any
way thinke me affectionate, or that I haue
partially proceeded in this exercise of pen.
And nowe righte Worshipfull, if you muse
why I do enterlard this discourse with some
suche wordes or sentences, as may seeme to
degresse frō my purposed cause, I pray you
conceyue, both for varietie, and the vertue
of the matter, that my iudgemēt is carried
by circumstances, to treate at large those
things, that shortnesse of speeche will not
suffer, and that my cunning can not aptly
place euery thing in his order: but yet as I
<pb facs="4"/>
may (vnder your correction) I will boldly
hold on my matter which I haue penned, for
those people that dwell farre off the Court,
that they may see with what maiestie a
Prince raigneth, and with what obedience
and loue good Subiectes do receiue hir: not
that I thinke, but al the Sheeres of Englād
are most willing to do their duties to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
of their powers: but that in deede
the like of this entertaynemēt hath not bin
seene: I haue presumed to sette out these
things, and namely, bycause at <hi>Norwich</hi>
I was employed to sette forth some shewes,
which heere I haue imprinted, as well those
that hir Highnesse sawe not, by meanes of
euill weather, as those she sawe and heard,
and gaue gratious thankes for. And as I
mind to wrighte what truely happeneth in
my memorie, so meane I to touche a little,
the manner and inclination of the common
people, whose ciuill sorte and curtesie is
greatly to be commended. Withall, I haue
<pb facs="4"/>
placed at the end of this discourse, a feawe
verses, in the honoring of good mindes, and
trauelling bodyes, meaning thereby Sir
<hi>Humfrey Gilbert,</hi> Maister <hi>Henry
Knolles,</hi> and others, right worthy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Gentlemen, presently passed towards
a happy voyage as I hope. These paynes
and purposes of myne, proceede onely on
the good will I beare to al vertuous actions,
and so I trust you will take them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
my small Booke a little countenance
(if it so stande with youre pleasure) I shall
find my selfe greatly bound vnto you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and among the rest that speaketh well
(which are not a few) of your vprighte go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernemente
of life, I will not bee the last
shall yeeld you deserued laude, as knoweth
God, who encrease his grace and good
giftes in you, and make your end as
honorable, as your dayes
haue bin blessed.</p>
