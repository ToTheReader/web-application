      </gap>ncerning the worthinesse of the Author, or woorth of the worke, my testimony would rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract then adde. Onely thus much, that as amongst all humane sciences Physicke is the most excellent; and in Physicke, Chirurgerie is the most Authenticke and ancient; so this operation is of Chirurgery the most vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and necessary, or rather an Abstract of the whole Art of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie.</p>
   <p>Against Obiection, I haue your Lordshippes patronage for my defence, and therein I shall thinke my selfe as safe as in an Armour of proofe; knowing that it is a point of Greatnesse, as well to defend the weake, as to resist the strong.</p>
