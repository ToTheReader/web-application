      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable; If it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare presumption in me to shew my love, my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie betraies me to it. The advantage I have gleaned from idle houres, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing this Indian Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story from Spanish to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, is commended to your Honors Patronage, whose first father <hi>Ioseph Acosta,</hi> hath with great observation made worthie the over-looking. A greater motive then that you are your selfe, needed not to excite me to this dedication. I beseech you my good Lord, take it into shelter, and receive that which is not, for that which I would it were. Let my insufficiencie be measured by my good will. So shall my poore abilities thrive vnder your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and happily leade me on to some stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vndertaking; wherein I shall bee bound to thanke you for mine owne paines, and for ever remaine</p>
