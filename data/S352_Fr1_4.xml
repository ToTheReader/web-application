   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst manie excellent precepts which Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
gaue vnto the Church, this is to be considered; <hi>Let al
things be done vnto edifying.</hi> If this had been of
all men well considered, manie things which now flie
abroad, might well haue been spared. That my one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
purpose in collecting &amp; framing this worke, was to
edifie, comfort and stirre vp the godlie mindes vnto
care, watchfulnesse, Zeale, &amp; feruentnesse in the cause of Gods truth; you
shall easilie perceiue by the chusing and ordering of these singular exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
which hereafter insue. In which these speciall circumstances are to be
considered. <hi>First,</hi> The great furie and rage of Sathan likelie to bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
from his Kingdome of error and blindnes; the franticke madnes of
the ignorant possessed people, delighting in darkenesse, and striuing to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
the Kingdome of their Master; and the prompt facilitie and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of Sathans ministers to put in execution anie kinde of wickednesse: al
which is to be seene both in the first example of <hi>The winning of Saint
Iames his Streete,</hi> &amp; in all the rest of the booke. <hi>Secondlie,</hi> The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
maiestie, &amp; dignitie of the Diuell, possessing the chiefest States of the
earth, &amp; seeming to the outward appearance to weild the Truth vnto his
obedience, in suppressing the strongest that dared openly to withstand him:
in the Storie of <hi>Annas Burgaeus. Thirdlie,</hi> The policie and crafte of
Sathan and his members in deuising by subtiltie to circumuent the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie;
vnder the shadow of trust, to exercise tyrannie; vnder the colour of
courtesie to practise crueltie; and vnder the vaile of a sacred oath, to couer
most shamefull villanie. This is to be seene in the third example, of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
Massacre at the bloodie marriage. We had need therefore to be
watchfull, strong, and wise: watchful in praier, that we be not taken slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping;
strong in faith, that we be not ouerthrowen by Sathans might; wise
as serpents, that we be not deceaued by the diuels allurements. We are to
learn also, what trust we ought to repose in the promises and oaths of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Papists, what shewe so euer they make of loue and frendship. Here
as in a glasse, you shall plainlie see the picture of all the morall vertues most
liuelie described, in the strange patience, the godlie perseuerance, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb facs="4"/>
orations, sweete speeches, and the constant and famous endings of
these sacred Martires. Wheresoeuer thou shalt finde the Diuel brought
in Poëticallie to make any oration to the King and States of <hi>France,</hi> as in
manie places he is: then vnderstand, that vnder those speeches are expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all the subtilties, villanies, cruelties and policies that were deuised, and
by diuelish meanes put in practise against the godly, more liuely to set them
down in their colors, as if it came from the diuels owne mouth, as no doubt
it came from his spirite. Againe, in all the orations of the Martirs, &amp;
of the King, the Queene, the Guise, and all other that haue speaches in
this booke, marke that of purpose the nature both of the person that speaks
and also of the matter that is spoken, are liuely set downe: so that here are
not bare examples of vertue and vice, but also the nature and qualities of
those vertues or villanies are manifestly depainted to them that will seeke
for it. The noble Martirs of <hi>England</hi> are knowen sufficientlie almost to
all; these excellent French Histories were seene but of few, being in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
nothing inferior vnto the other.</p>
   <p>The causes why I haue described it in verse are 3. First for mine owne
exercise, being a learner in that facultie; Secondlie, to restore againe some
credit if I can vnto Poëtrie, hauing been defaced of late so many waies by
wanton vanities. Thirdlie, for the more noueltie of the thing, and apt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie
in disposing the matter framed to the better liking of some mēs fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies,
because the same Storie in effect is alreadie translated into English
prose. Many of these orations that are here fully &amp; amplie expressed, were
in the French Commentaries but onely in substance lightly touched, and
the summe set downe without amplifying the circumstance, and yet heere
is no more set downe, than there is signified. I haue also, for the more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
vnto the wicked, diligentlie collected the great plagues and iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God shewed against the persecutors in euery seuerall History, &amp;
haue set them downe so in order, and amplified them by the like iudgments
against sinners out of the word and other histories, that euerie proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor
may plainly see what punishment remaineth due vnto their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
tyrannie. To speake trulie without vaine glorie, I thinke assuredlie,
that there is not in this forme anie thing extant which is more forceable
to procure comfort to the afflicted, strength to the weake, courage to the
faint hearted, and patience vnto them that are persecuted, than this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
worke, if it be diligentlie read and well considered. So wishing that all
the excellent and rare wits that now flourish in <hi>England,</hi> and shew them
selues manie times in vaine deuises, would all learne to consecrate their
<pb facs="5"/>
singular giftes to the glorie of God, the edifying of his Church, and the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of the soules of Gods chosen. Then would the Lord still blesse their
labours, and giue their names a perpetuall memorie.</p>
   <p>So I commit thee to Gods protection, and commend this my pleasant
exercise to thy good liking: which, if I perceiue to be accepted, thou shalt
incourage mee to proceede, to make thee acquainted with more excellent
actions. <hi>Honiton</hi> in <hi>Deuon,</hi> this xxv. of <hi>Iuly.</hi> 1589.</p>
