      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not the greatnesse of an Oblation, but the sincerity
which the gods are delighted with: from this hope, and out of an ambitious
zeale, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your adorers, the <hi>Muses</hi> amidst so many, and
rich presents, have prepared this slender offering, and are themselves
both the Priests, and the Sacrifice: Their devotion is cloath'd with purity,
and their affections, are both earnest and powerful; for their wishes of
your <pb facs="3"/>happinesse are no lesse than assurance, and their
desires prophesies: For this <hi>Poem,</hi> it was yours e're conceived;
and the hope of being so, was both the efficient &amp; finall cause of its
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; for the Dedication was elder than the birth of it: And however in
the outward barke and title thereof, it appeare painted with vanity, yet is
that, but as a light gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to cover more deepe and weighty my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.</p>
   <p>The dignity of the Subiect thus calculated, the season of the
yeare partly warrants an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, but chiefly those royall and fresh
springing ornaments of Candor and ignenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which are so conspicuous
through your greatnesse: It has ever beene the priviledge of
<hi>Poesie;</hi> to claime accesse to the best and, most noble
persons; and if this worke shall be so happy, as to beare the
impresse of your Princely approbation, it shall then passe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
