   <head>A PREFACE TO THE GODLY READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR AS MVCH (DEERELY</hi> beloued in oure sauiour Iesu) as faith (which is the gift of god without the which we canne not please god) cometh by hearing of the worde of god, it is expedient,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2. Heb. 11. Rom. 12</note> and more then necessary, that we earnestly embrace the same woorde of god, least the Lorde be wrathe with vs,<note place="margin">Psal. 1.</note> and wee perishe from the righte waye.</p>
   <p>We may not at our pleasure (as the world doth) trifle with it, neglecte it and contemne it, which is the lyuely foode of the sowle, as Christe himselfe by the same beareth winesse, saynge:<note place="margin">Mat. 4</note>
      <hi>A man shall not lyue by breade only, but by euery worde that procedeth out of the mouthe of God.</hi> What manne neglecteth the foode and norishmente of his bodye, whiche is mortall, vyle earth, and wormes meate? Nay, howe do all men diligently awayte the tyme, season and oportunitye to prepare the foode and noryshmente for the body?</p>
   <p>The husband man ploweth, soweth, barroweth, weedeth, reapeth, moweth, dryeth his corne, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth it into his barne in season.</p>
   <p>The marchaunte marketh the oportunitye, and taketh the winde that serueth for his vyage in due tyme.</p>
   <p>The Passinger leeseth not the tyde, but taketh it
<pb facs="3"/> whē it is offered. The lawyer obserueth the term. Euerye man in his science, occupacion and crafte, applyeth the tyme and season when it serueth them beste for their purpose: but (Lorde) how dulle, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligente and carelesse be we of this tyme, that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des woorde speaketh of,<note place="margin">2. Co. 6</note> sayinge: <hi>Beholde, nowe is the accepted tyme, beholde, now is the daye of saluacion.</hi> Ful truely therefore is this saying of Christ verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vppon vs.<note place="margin">Luc. 16</note>
      <hi>The chyldren of this worlde are in their nacion, wiser than the children of lyfe.</hi> Almyghtye god hath nowe vysyted vs with his holye woorde, but yet wee prouoke him to lamente oure miserable state no lesse then the Iewes did, vppon whome, he saithe by his prophete Esai.<note place="margin">Esay. 1.</note>
      <hi>I haue nourished and brought vppe children, but they haue doone wyckedly against me. The oxe hath knowen his owner, and the asse his maisters cribbe, but Israel hath receiued no know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge, my people hath no vnderstandinge. Alas for thys synfull nacion, a people of greate iniquitye, a frowarde generation, vnnaturall chyldren.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Nowe least any manne flattering him selfe, wold apply this lamentable prophecy only vnto the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, let him note this sentence which toucheth the cause of our blyndenesse to be twise rehersed, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Israel hath receiued no knowledg, my people hath no vnderstandinge.</hi> If it had beene spoken only of the Iewes, yt had beene ynough to haue saide, <hi>Israell hathe receiued no knowledge,</hi> But bicause it shulde be truely applyed vnto vs also, god saith: <hi>My peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hath no vnderstanding.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luc. 10</note> Whye? Verely <hi>CHRIST</hi> him selfe sheweth the cause, sayinge: <hi>The haruest is great, but the labourers are fewe.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>Wherfore (christē reader) it hath been thought good, to commend this small volume of godlye and sincere doctrine, into our mother and English tong that it mighte be a spurre vnto the dull shepherds, and helpe vnto the simple and godlye mynded cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and comforte to the fathers of the houshold, parents, and gouernoures of youth. Truly it must needes be a spurre vnto the ydle, dul and negligent curates, bicause the doctrine hereof is so brief, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and plaine, that a cyllye woman or poore pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyse, occupyinge theim selues the whole weeke in their vocacion, onlye with the studyinge and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of this booke vpon the sondaye and hollye daye, shall within one yeare be better able to teach hereafter their own housholdes, then many curats do now instructe their congregacion committed to their cure and charg. At whose hand, without fayl,<note place="margin">Ezec. 3. and .33.</note> the Lorde wyll requyre the bloude of euerye one of their flock that perisheth for lack of godly teching.</p>
   <p>Also the profite that the godlye mynded curates (although they be but meanly learned) shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obtaine their flocke and congregacion in shorte tyme (by the grace of God) shall better declare in their lyfe by good frutes, than here can be expressed with woordes.</p>
   <p>Finally, the honest housholders, (for whose sake principally this booke is putte forth,) whiche wyll take paines to practise the doctrine herof vpon the sondayes and holy dayes in teachinge their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, and lookinge to them so on the working daies with discipline, that they exercyse the same in their lyfe, shall fynde more faithfulnes, quietenesse, and
<pb facs="4"/> obedience in their families, then their policie and worldely wysedome otherwyse is able to bryng to passe with all that they can do.</p>
   <p>Let not parentes and maysters hereafter fynde faulte with the pryde, stubburnesse, slouthe, and falshed of their youthes &amp; seruauntes, if they theim selues be styffe necked and slowe to learne the word of the Lord, and negligent in teachyng their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to serue God. But let them knowe, that the vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>towardnesse of their youth &amp; seruauntes is the iust plague of god vnto them, because they teache them not to knowe, feare and serue God.</p>
   <p>What meane they that murmure? would they haue their children and seruantes obedient, fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diligente to serue theim? Yea verely, it is mete they should so be. Then lette they them selues begynne fyrst to be diligent in learnyng the worde of God, faythful in teachyng it, and obediēt in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng it.<note place="margin">Tit. 2.</note> For S. Paul sayth: <hi>Speake the thinges that be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>come wholsome learnyng, that the elder men bee sober, sage, discrete, sound in the fayth, in loue, and in pacience.</hi> When they haue learned this, than let them be dili<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gent to shewe the same by example, and to teache their cure, that whiche foloweth.</p>
   <p>Fyrst, <hi>that their wyues be in suche apparel as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth holynes, not geuen to muche wyne, sobre minded, discrete, chast, howsewyfly, good, obedyent to their own husbandes, dilygent in teaching their chyldren, that the worde of God be not euel spoken of.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Secondarily, <hi>that yonge men be sobre mynded.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thyrdly, <hi>that seruantes be obedient vnto their own maisters, and please them in all thinges, not answeringe
<pb facs="4"/> againe, neither pickers, but they must shew al faithfulnes, that they may do worship to the doctrine of God our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in all thinges.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thus dyd Adam (after hee was called to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce) teache his children, fyrste to knowe theyr sauiour and to serue god in true faith: as witnesseth the oblation of his obedient sonne Abell.<note place="margin">Gene. 4</note>
   </p>
   <p>Also Seth and Enos did the same, and therfore it is written of them, that they began to make inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion in the name of the Lord.<note place="margin">Gene. 5</note> Lykewise Henoch of whom it is written, that hee walked with God.</p>
   <p>Noe thereby was not onely saued frō drownyng,<note place="margin">Gen. 7.</note> but also hath obtained this godly title, euen to bee called, <hi>The preacher of righteousnes.</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Pe. 2. A nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tytle.</note>
   </p>
   <p>What neede I to speake of Abraham, Loth, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac, Iacob, Ioseph, &amp;c. which in steed of preachers retained the true faith, suerly grounded vpon god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des woorde, and by good exāple and doctrine haue taughte the same to their families and posterytie? A noble example to all gouernoures, parentes and maysters is set forth in Tobie,<note place="margin">Tob. 1.</note> which (as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) taught his sonne from his youthe vp, to feare god, and to refraine from euell. And to the end that no manne should wante the godly lessons that hee taught, lo here they folow.<note place="margin">Tobi. 4.</note>
      <hi>Haue god in thy thought all the dayes of thy lyfe, and beware at any tyme thow cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent not vnto synne, and lest thou lette slyppe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of the Lord our God. Gyue almes of thy goodes, and turne neuer thy face from the poore, and so shal it come to passe, that the face of the Lorde shall not be turned away from the. Be mercifull after thy power. Yf thow haue muche, gyue plenteousely. Yf thou haue
<pb facs="5"/> lytle, do thy diligence gladly to geue of that lytle. For so gatherest thou thy selfe a good rewarde in the day of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitee.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Laste of all, hee departed this lyfe in peace, but yet before he should depart, he called vnto him his sonne, &amp; his sonnes vii. children, saiyng: <hi>My children,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Tob. 14</note>
      <hi>heare your father. Serue the Lord in truth, seeke after his wyll, and doo the thynge that pleseth him. Commaunde your children that they do right, gyue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, be mindeful of God, and euer to be thankefull vnto him in truthe, and with all their power.</hi> Prynt this god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly example in your hartes, and for want of a curate, let this booke be your teacher, if you can not reade, lette your childe, seruaunt, or prentyse reade. And hear you and learn to entre in at this straight gate, and to walke in the narrow way that leadeth vnto life, whiche these godly fathers entred and walked in. So doyng, you shalbe suer (as Toby departed in peace) to haue a quiet houshold, obedient chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and faythfull seruauntes, yea and that which is great deale better, the quietnes &amp; peace of conscience, through our Lord Iesus Christ, to whom with God the father and the holy gost, be al thanke, prayse, and glory. Amen.</p>
   <p>Pray ye the Lord of the haruest to send furth labourers into his haruest. So be it.</p>
