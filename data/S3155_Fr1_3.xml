   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the burthen of the Ministry is this, To pluck Men out of the Kingdome of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and to bring them to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God: surely then it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all those that haue taken vpon them this holy calling to helpe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this worthy worke. And to this end I entertained my spare houres in the time of my long sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (when I was not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme my duty in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my charge) in publishing this short exposition of the <hi>51</hi> Psalme, to the view of the world: not for vaine-glory, or for any good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb facs="8"/>or opinion that I haue of the same, or of my selfe, as he knoweth that knowes all things; but chiefly for the honour of God, that if it please the Lord to giue a blessing, sinners, euen such as sit in darknes, and in the shadow of death, might be moued to repentance. It is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of carnall men, who remaine vnder Sathan and his dominion (as all men do by nature) that when sin is committed, done and past, they shall neuer be called to account for the same. But (alas) no length of time can we are sin away, if it bee not taken away by true and vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Repentance. Yea the sinnes of our youth, which many yeares agoe wee haue committed (if now in time we do not repent, and stop the mouth of the same) shall stand vp as new and fresh against vs, as the first houre we committed them. Oh that we could be wise to thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="8"/>these things! Our selues waxe old, our bodies are declining to the graue: and will we take no paines to weare away our sinnes, but to let them stand in their strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs? This weare a great folly. Let men therfore thinke of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: there is no going to Heauen with dry eyes, or beds of downe. Now if this poore worke of mine may finde entertainment with thee (I shall so much the more be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to take paines in this kinde, vpon other places of Scripture, as vpon the first Psalme, which thou maist shortly expect.) And withall may helpe thee forward to this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary duty of Repentance, I haue thē my desire: giue the praise to him from whom all good commeth, who worketh in vs both the will &amp; the deed, to whom be praise and honour for euer and euer. <hi>AMEN.</hi>
