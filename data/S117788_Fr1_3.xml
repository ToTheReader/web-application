   <head>TO M. ROBERT HORNE, THOMAS STAPLETON VVISHETH Grace from God, and true repentance of al Heresies.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the natural wisedome and foresight, M. Horne, described of our Sauiour in the Gospel by a parable, had bene in you, at what tyme you first set penne to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to treate of the Othe of Supremacy: you would not, I suppose, so rashly haue attempted an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise of such importance. The Parable saith.<note place="margin">Luc. <hi>14.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>VVho is it amonge you, that minding to build a Castle, sitteth not doune first and reckoneth vvith him self the charges requisit thereunto, to see if he be able to bring it to passe, lest that hauing layed the foundation, and then not able to make an ende, al that see him, begin to laugh him to scorne, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beholde: this man beganne to builde, but he hath not bene able to make an ende</hi>? The matter you haue taken in hande to proue, is of such and so greate importaunce, as no matter more nowe in Controuersie.</p>
   <p>It is the Castle of your profession. The keye of your doctrine. The principal forte of all your Religion. It is the piller of your Authority. The fountaine of your Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction. The Ankerholde of all your proceedinges.
<pb facs="3"/>
Without the right of this Supreme Gouernement by you here defended, your cause is betrayed, your doctrine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solueth, your whole Religion goeth to wracke. The wante of this Right shaketh your Authoritye, stoppeth your Iurisdiction, and is the vtter shipwracke of all your Procedings.</p>
   <p>Againe, it toucheth (you say) the prerogatiue of the Prince. It is the only matter which Catholikes stand in, by parliamēt enacted, by booke Othe required, vpō greate penalty refused. Other matters in cōtrouersy whatsoeuer, are not so pressed.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, you haue takē vpon you to persuade so great a matter, first to a right lerned and reuerēt Father, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat cōferēce: and next to al the realme of Englād, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing this your Answer, as you cal it. The weightier the matter is, and the more confidently you haue taken it vpō you, the more is it looked for, and reason would, that you did it substantially, lernedly, ād truly: and before you had entred to so great a worke, to haue made your reckoning, how you might bring it to perfection.</p>
   <p>But now what haue you don? Haue you not so wrought, that all your faire building being cleane ouerthrowen, mē beginne (as the Ghospell saieth) to laughe you to scorne, saying: Beholde, this man beganne a great matter, but beinge not able to finishe it, he is fayne to breake of?</p>
   <p>You will say: These be but woordes of course, and a
<pb facs="3"/>
certain triumphe before the Victory. Haue I not groūded this work of myne vpō the foundatiō of holy Scriptures? Haue I not posted it vp with the mighty stronge pillers, of the most learned Fathers? Haue I not furnished it with a ioyly variety of Stories deducted from al the most Christian Emperours, Kinges and Princes of more then these .xij. hundred yeares? Haue I not fensed it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicible rampars of most holy Councels both general and national? And last of al, haue I not remoued all such scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and stayes of conscience, as though it were, brambles and briers out of the waye, to make the passage to so fayre a Forte, pleasant, easy, and commodious?</p>
   <p>You haue in dede M. Horne, in owtwarde shewe, and countenance sette a gay gloriouse and glistering face vppon the matter: A face I say, of holy Scriptures, of Fathers, of the Canon, the Ciuill, and the lawe of the Realme, of manye Emperours, Kinges and Princes (for proufe of a continuall practise of the like Supremacye nowe by Othe to the Q. Highnes attributed) in the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Churches of England, Fraunce, Germany, Spayne, Italy, Grece, Armenia, Moscouia, Aethyopia:<note place="margin">Aug. de ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uit. Dei li. <hi>21.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi> Iul. Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ca. <hi>48.</hi> Cornel. Tacit. li. <hi>8.</hi> Aegesipp{us} lib. <hi>4.</hi>
      </note> But all is but a Face in dede, and a naked shewe, without Substāce of Truth and matter.</p>
   <p>It is like, to the Aples and grapes and other fruits of the countrey of Sodome and Gomorre, which growing to a full rypenes and quantitye in sight, seeme to the eye very faire and pleasant: but when a man cometh to plucke
<pb facs="4"/>
of them and to tast, he shal finde them vnnaturall and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilente, and to smoder and smoke away, and to resolue into ashes. Such is the effect of your whole booke: It bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a countenance of truth, of reason, of learning. But coming to the trial and examination of it, I finde a pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ranke of most shamefull Vntruths, an vnsauery and vaine kinde of reasoning, and last of al, the whole to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue into grosse Ignorance. For proufe hereof, I wil short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay forth, an abridgement of your whole demeanour.</p>

I neede not descend to the particulars, your perpetuall maner of writing being suche, as your whole discourse seemeth nothing els but a mishapen lumpe of lewde and loose argumentes.

   <p>But nowe so it is, as I haue in this Replie more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye declared, that the woordes by Maister Fekenham alleaged, are the true wordes of <hi>S.</hi> Augustin according to
<pb facs="11"/>
foure seueral prints that I haue sene: two of Paris, one of Basil, an other of Lyōs. And the words as you would haue them read Maister Horne, are in none of those printes at all in the text of S.

Fekenham avouched stande in the text, as they doe in all other printes beside, for the true text of S. Augustin. And who seeth not nowe, that all this was but a quarel picked, without desert? And you M. Horne to haue shewed your selfe a most ridiculous wrangler?</p>
   <p>But Gods name be blissed. The dealing of Catholike writers is so vpright, that such smal occasiōs must be pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and vpō such trifles your Rhetorike must be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: els against their dealing you haue nothing to say.</p>
   <p>With the like felicity your brother Iewel in his late Sermon the <hi>.15.</hi> of Iune last at Paules Crosse, layed ful stoutely and confidently to D.
