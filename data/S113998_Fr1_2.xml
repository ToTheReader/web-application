   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath bene long since obserued, that England whilest it was in captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and bondage vnder the Bishop of Rome, was of all other Countreys most oppressed with his intolerable exactions, and most heauy impositions. In so much as this our most noble Countrey was termed by the Frenchmen <hi>the Popes Asse;</hi> and one of the Popes owne Cardinals, in the dayes of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius</hi> 4. vnderstanding of the polling and pillage which the Romane Collectors and ministers did vse in this Countrey, to the great griefe of the inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb facs="3"/>of, did in compassion vse these wordes to the said Pope, <hi>Anglia nostrís iniurijs mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toties laesa, quasi Asina Balaam, calcaribus &amp; fustibus caesa, tandem loquitur &amp; oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur, &amp; se nimis &amp; intolerabiliter conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur fatigatam, &amp; instaurabiliter damnifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam;</hi> England many times wounded with our iniuries, and beaten as it had bene Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams asse, with spurres and clubs, at the last doeth speake and repine at it, and doeth complaine, that she was too much and intolerably wearied, and irrecoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably damnified. Into which blockish thraldome this kingdome was brought, through the lewdnesse, false practises, and impostures of the Priests, who by their counterfait miracles, and Reuelations, touching the seuerall paines and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of soules in Purgatorie, so terrified the mindes of men and women (brought vp in ignorance and more then Aegyptia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call darkenes) as they led them hither and thither like brute beasts, for the compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of their owne designes, that they, and the Pope their master might tyrannize as
<pb facs="3"/>they list. And although the iuggling and fraud of the Bishop of Rome, and his traiterous brood, is now more publiquely knowen to all the world, and especially to vs here in England, then it was in former times: Yet as if we meant to be Asses stil, it is incredible, how many are dayly seduced with toyes and bables by such lewd Priests and Iesuites, as hauing bene traiterously brought vp in the Seminaries beyond the Seas, and learned all the false sleights and iuggling trickes that those places can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, doe lurke, vpon their stealth into England, in many corners within this Realme, studying with all their skill, not onely to imitate their Predecessors in all their wicked and lewd practises, but to goe therein farre beyond them; as being Vipers of a more detestable generation, then we euer heard of in this Countrey, or in any other Christian Kingdome or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the dayes and times of our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And as it is obserued by <hi>Philo</hi> the Iew, of the old Scribes and Pharises before the comming of our Sauiour CHRIST,
<pb facs="4"/>how mightily they preuailed and were followed by women; so now it hapneth and falleth out in this Kingdome with that sexe, that these new Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises, the Iesuites and Priests that adhere vnto them, doe strangely bewitch them, hauing more secret conuersation with them, vnder pretence of Confession, then in some politicke considerations perhaps is conuenient. It is too well knowen to this false brood of Romish Priests and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, how easily, and by what light sleights women may be seduced: neither are they ignorant, when they haue so done, what mischiefe doeth thereby (for the most part) happen, in those families, where such seduced women doe liue and beare rule, they being commonly very passionate and violent in their affections and opinions. But it were lesse hurt, if these new Scribes and Pharises did limit their false practises to the inueygling and seducing of women, and that they did not in like sort seeke with al their Engines and deuilish stratagems to infect with their
<pb facs="4"/>poyson young Gentlemen, and such others of the Laitie, as they can by any meanes induce to giue eare vnto them; most men (not well grounded) being soone weary of the present estate wherein they liue, and euer desirous of Nouelties, (especially we in England,) if they tend to superstition and Idolatry: Whereby it falleth out, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of pestilent corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and poison, which worketh very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently when it is taken, that the late sort of Recusants in England, men and women of all sorts (which haue bene peruerted and poysoned by the said new Iesuiticall brood, and other Impostors of their straine) are growen into great fury, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with no patience at all, to be in any wise impugned. For the more violent the poysoned opinions are, wherewith they are peruerted, the more desperate and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious they are become, to vphold and defend them. The <hi>Powder-Treason</hi> in England had many abetters; and that lewd Iesuite <hi>Garnet,</hi> drawen and hanged for his Treason, is now become a Martyr,
<pb facs="5"/>and wanteth not the confirmation of his Martyrdome by a strange miracle in a straw, deuised and published by two lewd Recusants in London, one <hi>Griffin</hi> a tailor, and <hi>Wilkinson</hi> a yong silke man▪ And it is not to be doubted, a Iesuite very lately hauing written an <hi>Apologie</hi> in the behalfe of the said lewd Traitor, (the same being approued by the <hi>Generall</hi> of the Iesuites in Rome, after it was allowed by three other Iesuites) but that our Recusants in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of the furious stampe, will hereafter, as they dare, iustifie the said villainous Traitour. When the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <hi>Anno</hi> 3. <hi>Regis Iacobi</hi> was made and confirmed by Act of Parliament, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably supposed, that all the Recusants in England would willingly haue taken it, as sundry of them began, had not the Iesuits opposed themselues, and procured the Pope to commaund the contrary. Since which time it is euident, how many haue refused, (as being bewitched and cast into a reprobate sense) to receiue the said Oath, diuers euen of the more moderate
<pb n="7" facs="5"/>sort, as well Priests as other persons, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that they cannot in conscience receiue it, because the trayterous positions concerning the deposing or murthering of Princes by their Subiects (there being little difference betwixt them, in that it hath bene seldome seene, that such tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Subiects as were able to depose their Soueraignes, did euer thinke it poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to suffer them to liue) are there termed to be <hi>Haereticall.</hi> False and diabolicall assuredly they are, and directly contrary to the two first Commandements of the second Table, <hi>Honour thy father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and <hi>Thou shalt doe no murther;</hi> And then, if they haue bene wilfully and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely defended by any, why they should not be acknowledged for damnable Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, I for my part cannot discerne. For I agree in iudgement herein with <hi>Grost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> Bishop of Lincolne (in the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. King of this Realme) where he defineth Haeresie in these words; <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resis est sententia humano sensu electa, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae sacrae contraria, palam edocta, pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer
<pb facs="6"/>defensa:</hi> Haeresie is an opinion cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by humane sense, contrary to the Scripture, publiquely taught, and wilfully defended. How these false lewd and traiterous opinions haue bene published to the world, and shamefully mainteined, it doeth appeare by diuers bookes and Treatises, printed and diuulged, to the perpetuall shame of the Authors and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouers of them: As by the booke intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>De iustâ abdicatione Hen.</hi> 3. and by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other not long since, Viz. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 13. <hi>An.</hi> 1598. allowed to be Printed <hi>In Coenobio Madriti,</hi> at <hi>Madrill</hi> in Spaine, by Friar <hi>Peter de Onna</hi> the Principall of that Order, and compiled by <hi>Iohn Mariana,</hi> a Spanish Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite, at that time Scholemaster to the now King. This second booke is thus intituled, <hi>Iohannis Marianae Hispani è societate Iesu, De Rege &amp; Regis institutione libri tres ad</hi> Philippum 3. <hi>Hispaniae Regem Catholicum;</hi> Three books of <hi>Iohn Mariana,</hi> a Spaniard, of the societie of <hi>Iesu,</hi> Of a King, &amp; Of the instruction, or bringing vp of a King, to <hi>Philip</hi> the 3. the Catholick king of Spaine.
<pb facs="6"/>And the Author of it hath the now Kings License, that none within his dominions vnder a certaine penaltie, shall print it, <hi>nisi de Authoris voluntate,</hi> without the Authors consent. In this booke the murthering of Princes by priuate persons, is in direct termes fully approued, and particularly the butcherous and traiterous slaughter of the French King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. by <hi>Iames Clement</hi> a <hi>Dominicane.</hi> Against which traiterous, deuilish and hęretical doctrine, diuers learned men haue opposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and lately the Vniuersitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> vpon the barbarous murther of their late renowmed King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. who besides their detestation of that fact, do fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the said new conceit of murthering of Kings and Soueraigne Princes, to be a very lewd and haereticall opinion. The Act of whose proceedings comming to my friends hands, together with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, drawing through the streets, and burning of the said booke of <hi>Iohn Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi> he hath thought it fit to offer to
<pb facs="7"/>the Presse to be published in Print, if so it might seeme good to some in Authority: to the end that thereby, if it were possible, not onely the malignant humours of the more furious sort of our Popish Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants, might be abated, when they shall finde their treacherous and traiterous schoolemasters, the Iesuites, with their adherents, to bee condemned for Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; but that also the milder and more moderate sort of Priests, and other Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants, might be induced not to refuse the said Oath of Allegiance, because the said conceits of murthering of Princes (a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent in effect of deposing them) is therein termed an <hi>Haereticall</hi> opinion. And so I referre you to the Actes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as they were copied out of the Register of the Parliament of <hi>Paris.</hi>
