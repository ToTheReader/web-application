      </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man receaued the with glad harte / (my moost dere yonge frende Gerolde) and dyuers willed to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure the with giftes. I thought I shul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de be vtterly voide of al ciuilite if I shuld not present the wyth some manner of gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te specially seyng this custume to vse to honour those that baine thēselues is co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monely vsed amongest frendes / amōgest whome / for two causes I accounte the. The one is / because thou doest fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employ thy dyligence to learning / and the other / because thou art in wages <abbr>vnd</abbr> the standard of my frende Glareane. And when I sought longe with my selfe / what thīg might be mooste acceptable vnto the / at length / I found that it must be / eyther holy or learned / or both / that shulde serue vnto thy pleasure. For lyke as of nature
<pb facs="4"/> thou apperest to be borne vnto godlines and vertue / so euen nowe of thyne owne accorde thou doest shewe forth the frutes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rbanite and elegantie the which truly are somewhat ripe before tyme / and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they the more plesaunt. Wherfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re albeit that searching ouer with dylygē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce all my learned stuffe / when by no waye I coulde parforme the thinge / it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned / that I shuld buy your fauoure / with certeyne Godly thinges / apparteining as well to the health of the body as of the sou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le / ād cōducing vnto vertue. Where ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in times past / I had / vppon counsell taken with my selfe / begonne to make a booke howe the ingenious youth ought to be instructed / ād diuers disturbaūt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes had delaied my purpose (as the case ād state is of thinges present nowe a dayes) yet as I thought of the forenamed gifte / laying watche carefully to chose a thinge conuenient / the memory of my olde taken coūsell came into my minde. Ande albeit that I see the moost parte of men to be carefull / howe they maye dedicate their labour being finisshed / vnto some worthie
<pb facs="4"/> patrone / to me it fortuned contrarie / for he is present ād redie / vnto whome the thī<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge ought to be dedicate. But I lacke leasu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re and those ix yeres vntill the which time this worke ought to be suppressed. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore betwixt these two incomodities / that vtterly some thinge must be sent vnto the / and that my busynes doth not permitte the same to be done worthelie / I haue foū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de howe presently / it maie be satisfied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs both / I my selfe haue stolen so moch tyme / that without great aduysement I haue gathered to gether a fewe preceptes.

      </gap>o moch copie shuld make lothsomenes. For so almoost it commeth to passe / that thinges that are with a sparing hand drawen forth are ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken in with the more gredy stomake. The which thynges thou shalt not este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me after the place from whence they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue their fyrst originall / but according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the meaning and intent of him from whence they procede. For Godly thinges / we maye without dissimulation promis / if in oure selues we are not voide of grace / 
<pb facs="5"/> But to promise learned thinges / it is a shame / although thou thy selfe be neuer so well learned. The fyrst preceptes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne in them / howe the tender and yonge minde of an Ingenious strippling is to be adorned / in those thinges that appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne vnto God. The seconde / howe in those thynges that apparteine vnto hym selfe. The thirde / howe in those thinges that apparteine vnto other. And here / it is not oure purpose to beginne from the swadlingbanddes / nor yet from the first rudimentes / but from that age the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che beginneth to haue the vse of discretion and witte / and beginneth to swimme (as the prouerbe saith) without a barke / in the which age euen nowe thou thy selfe arte. These (as I trust) thou wilt reade dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently / and wilt transforme thy selfe into them / that vnto other also / thou maiest exhibyt a liuely example and token of the same. The which Christ the mightie lorde graunt vnto the. So be it. At Straesburch the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendes of Auguste 15. 32.</p>
