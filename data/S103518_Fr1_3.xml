      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, hauing gotten the sighte so these two discourses by meanes of a good friend that did lend me the same in three Lā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, the Latin, Italian &amp; French, imprinted at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil:</hi> I thought it a good labor to put them into Engish for the matter contained in the same, &amp; especially in the larger of them, wherein you shall find a notable discourse of anexcellent Author, written long since, and setting foorth very liuely how the Sea of Rome did enlarge their iurisdiction and Territories, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers subtile means, as also by the supposed donation of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great to pope <hi>Siluester.</hi> And bicause they are left out in al the printed books of <hi>Fr. Guicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardin</hi> his storye, some scruple did stay me a while to publishe the same least they might bee supposed to bee of some other authour. Wherein I haue sithence byn vndoubtedly resolued, by som persons of honor and good calling, who both haue seene the same in the <hi>Original</hi> at <hi>Florence</hi> written of the authors own hand, &amp; yet in the custody of <hi>Laurence Guicciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> and haue had copies of the same from the <hi>Guicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardines.</hi> So as I dare affirm on my credit, that the sam were of the authors, and left out of purpose, because they discouer such matter against the popes vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as in the reading of them thou maist perceiue. I desire but thy fauourable acceptance of my labour, wishing thee al happinesse.</p>
