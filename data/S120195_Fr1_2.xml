      </gap>e private surmise of some tacite censurer: I will
<pb facs="3"/>
shew vnto thee, among many, two only of their curiosities, and those in the front of the worke.</p>
   <p>The first is about the word <hi>Prolui,</hi> which some would haue to be heere vsed, to signifie that the Poet had modestly wet his lippes in <hi>Hippocrene,</hi> but never endrench'd them, or dranke deep ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I graunt that the word in the originall Can beare that sense; but that it doth in This place, I confidently denie. And stand confirmed by this reason: because the Poet satirically Derideth those, that attributed the faculty of poetric to so insufficient and vaine a cause, as the drinking of that Well was. (He himselfe afterwards confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, ironically, his Owne skill to be Constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: howsoever, not proceeding from so Fond a cause;) and therefore in the like sort presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he saith (if the Critiques had observed it) tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> he never slept on <hi>Parnassus:</hi> which was also held as another cause of the poetique faculty. Where with reason, as good as theirs, one might say, H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> never slept Soundly or Snorted on that hill, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> had lightly taken a gentle nap. The parts of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> similitude hold an equall proportion: and then referre the ridiculous curiosity to the secret smile of the Iudicious.</p>
   <p>The second is about the next word <hi>Caballino</hi> with which, according to Their exposition, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="5"/>
epithet which in my translation I giue to <hi>Pega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> may seeme somewhat to straine curtesie: inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it implyeth the swiftnesse (and so by cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent the praise) of the horse, to which it is (iustly) applyed: when as They would haue it to be vsed in the disgrace of the vaine Poets, which are heere derided. Deriving so the ignominie of the word <hi>Caballus</hi> from the Well to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: implying Them to be base packe-horse po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. A pretty, but imposed meaning, if farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into. For if the poet vse this word especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for that reason, it might seeme (me thinkes) that he did forget what horse he himselfe meant: there being as great difference betweene <hi>Pegasus</hi> a winged horse, and <hi>Caballus</hi> a packe-horse, as well-nigh could bee betweene two creatures of one kind. But if they once come to Coniectures, I may assume the like libertie to interpose Mine also; And then I Could thinke (which, I wonder, the Critiques did not see) that the Poet vsed this word before others, for a most naturall &amp; strong reason drawne from the <hi>Etymologie</hi> of the word <hi>Caballus;</hi> which, as <hi>Isidore</hi> in his <hi>Originals</hi> hath it, <hi>Lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. is deriued, <hi>à cavando: propter quòd gradiens vngulâ impressâ terram concavet, quod re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liqua animalia non habent;</hi> And then who seeth not how excellently the history of <hi>Pegasus</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
<pb facs="6"/>
in this word? This <hi>Etymologie</hi> is much strengthened by the letter v changed into b. For in the Moderne languages which haue drawne their originall from the <hi>Latine,</hi> we see the v still retained, as in the Italian and Spanish <hi>Cavallo,</hi> and in the French <hi>Cheval;</hi> and which may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, These words in none of these Moderne languages imply any disgrace, but are generally attributed to all horses; Nay, from these words are drawne Titles of dignity, as <hi>Cavaliero,</hi> in the Italian, <hi>Chevalier</hi> in the French, and <hi>Cavallero</hi> in the Spanish.</p>
   <p>But (that I may follow thē no farther in these their wandring speculations) to speake freely: I thinke the Poet neither thought as They thinke, nor as I shew how I Could thinke, and thinke as well as They. I am perswaded that more is pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of these Poets, then they themselues ever meant. For indeed when a Satirist, through the heat of his loue to vertue, is set on fire to see the desperate securitie of prophanesse: the fury of his passion doth so transport him: that there is no time left for the placing or displacing, choosing or reiecting of some particular word: but as most commonly their passions are vneven, rough, and furious: so is that also which they write being in this poeticall perturbation.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>The difficulties which I haue heere set downe, were by my peculiar affection to This Author, at last all ouercome. I haue not herein bound my selfe with a ferulary superstition to the letter: but with the ancient libertie of a Translator, haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a moderate paraphrase, where the obscuritie did more require it: yet so, that with all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient possibilitie, I sticke vnto his Words. To haue added Large annotations, had beene but to transcribe a Commentarie or a Dictionary. Such briefe ones notwithstanding, as without which, the sense could not be sufficiently explicate, yet could not bee well inserted into the text; with all compendious perspicuitie I haue adiected in the margin: prefixing Arguments to euery Satire.</p>
   <p>From the affected obscuritie, wherewith this Author hath hitherto laboured, I cannot altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quitte him, yet doubtlesse, it in part, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the want of Libertie, which in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate times, was altogether lost; though, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, He durst say Somewhat.</p>
   <p>As for My labours: I much abhorre so sickly an impotencie, as to ouerweane my selfe with a conceit of mine owne worke; though, if my best friends tell me truth, It may beare a Iudge. But howsoeuer; If the truly Iudicious (who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb facs="7"/>
attended with Perspicacitie, &amp; a milde cē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that true exciter of promising ingenuities) shall courteously accept it: I am Crown'd: and hauing thus finished this worke of an Others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, I may be excited to a second and more liberall attempt of mine owne.</p>
   <p>But if any Left-handed <hi>Pythagorians</hi> (who enforce Writers now adaies as the Ancients did their Comoedians, to vse insteed of Prologues expressing their arguments, Apologies against the malicious) shal sinisterly accept, what is cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously offered: I only wish them the other good qualitie of the <hi>Pythagorians, Silēce.</hi> For the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights which I may bee perchance convinced of (as the purest eie seeth not its owne blemishes, but by reflection) I wil, being shewed them, with free ingenuity confesse: &amp; doubt not of pardon; hauing two so good solliciters in the eie of any, but moderately courteous; Mine Owne Infancy (in respect of any Maturity of iudgement) &amp; the vnacquainted Difficulty of my attempt. To haue committed No faults in my Translation, had bin to Translate My Selfe, and put off Man.</p>
   <p>What other faults Detracters woulde Make (by their Owne Reading, or Interpretation) let them knowe, they are committed not out of Ignorance, but Election, after a iust consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="7"/>
with more then a <note n="*">Cornutus. Author vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Glossarū. Murmellius. Vinetus. Pithoeus. Marcilius. Foquelinus. Tornorupaeus. Lubinus. Casaubonus. Frischlinus. Bondus.

But why doe I in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion of Too-much humilitie prostrate my endeavors to the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Ignorant: who stand Herein so Many degrees below the faculty of Iudging cēsurers? If any in the procacity of baser ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice (raised commonly from a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of Imitation) shall proceede farther vnto contumelies: I shall not need, as some doe (though I approue Their course also) to arme my selfe with a confidence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; I will not put it to the stresse: nor against the stroake of so leaden a sword, vse the protection of so golden a shield. A little as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd Stoicisme shall serue the turne; and with a Secure Contempt, I'le let them Scoule alowd Vnheard. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
