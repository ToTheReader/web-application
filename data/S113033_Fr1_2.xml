   <head>TO THE RIGHT VER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous as Honourable Ladie, the <hi>Ladie M. C. A. health and encrease of Honour.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <hi>RAchell,</hi>
      <note n="a." place="margin">Gen. 30.35.</note> the wife of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,</hi> had two sonnes, <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and <hi>Beniamin,</hi>
      <note n="b." place="margin">Iohn. 19.</note>
      <hi>Mary</hi> the spouse, not of <hi>Israell,</hi> that is of one which see God, but of God himselfe had likewise two Sons, <hi>Iesus</hi> and <hi>Iohn:</hi> the Mother of the first was a figure of the last Mother, and their Children not vnfitly to bee compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Rachell</hi> signifieth a sheepe, and <hi>Marie</hi>
      <note n="c." place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note> broght a Lamb into the world, a Lambe which tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the sinnes of the world.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ioseph</hi> the first begotten of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell,</hi> because of his dreames, which signified a superiority hee
<pb facs="3"/>should haue ouer all his brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, grew so odious vnto them, that they sought opportunitie to kill him, and in the end was sold to the <hi>Egiptians</hi> for thirty pence by <hi>Iudas.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Iesus the first begotten of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> because the Iewes feared hee should be King ouer them, being mightie not in dreames,
<note n="a." place="margin">Luk. 24</note> but in worke and worde, became so much hated amongst them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were a Iew borne, &amp; one of their brethren, that they thought it long vntil they crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him: but he was first sold
<note n="b." place="margin">Mat. 26</note> by a <hi>Iudas</hi> also for 30 pence, yet did they no more preuaile in preuē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what they feared in him, thē did <hi>Ioseph</hi> his brethren,
<note n="c." place="margin">Gen. 44.</note> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward were forced to bow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, for hee had as glorious a name, &amp; did more worthely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue it, than did <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
      <note n="d." place="margin">Gen. 41</note> who
<pb facs="3"/>was accounted and so called by the <hi>Egiptians:. The Sauiour of the world.</hi>
      <note n="a." place="margin">Gen. 35.</note>
      <hi>Beniamin</hi> the sccond sonne of <hi>Rachell,</hi> when his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to be deliuered of him came with such defficulty into the world, that it was thought neyther shee coulde haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to haue beene disburdned, nor hee likelier to bee borne to breath, than to bee buried, in so much that beeing in the middest of her panges of death, shee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his name <hi>Benoin,</hi> which is as much to say, as the son of my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. But with what great sorow our.
<note n="b." place="margin">Mark. 1.</note> bless. Lady trauailed whē she was to be deliuered of <hi>Ioh.</hi> it shall appeare in the discourse fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, where the danger was not onely of the life of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; a sonne, but of life it selfe, which liuing as gratiously gaue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one their life, as dying rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="4"/>gloriously each one from death, that had not <hi>Iohn</hi> been verie filty named before his birth, his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might haue rightly called him <hi>Benoin,</hi> and vppon greater cause then <hi>Rachell</hi> called hers.</p>
   <p>His name was <hi>Iohn,</hi> and so it remaineth still. <hi>Iohn</hi> that is to say, to whom is giuen, &amp; nothing named what is giuen: we are to vnderstande some excellent gift, the like whereof was neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nor since giuen to any man.
<note n="a." place="margin">Iohn. 19.</note> God gaue himselfe to our blessed Lady, and then gaue her to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and by this gift of her to him, &amp; him againe to her by the sonne of God, is he borne a new into this world, and made our Lady her sonne.</p>
   <p>This birth of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his breeding I present vnto you, and rather this than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb facs="4"/>other thing of his life, because it seemeth a matter touching most his honour, and a dignitie much passing all his titles, to bee the sonne of her, who only was thought meete and was the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God.</p>
   <p>His conception I suppose was at his mariage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galile,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iohn. 2</note> and
<note n="a." place="margin">Iohn. 19</note> his birth at Christ his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vppon the mount <hi>Caluarie,</hi> the best of both which places, were an homely presence for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Honourable personage, but since that GOD himselfe made his choice of
<note n="b." place="margin">Luk. 1.</note> a Carpenters spouse, to set vp the frame of his owne most blessed body, right well may it beseeme one of what dignitie soeuer to bee present at the labour of a poore Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
   <p>Presuming therefore of your
<pb facs="5"/>vsuall fauoring good endeuours, whose outward actions, as well as inward intentions neuer sauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any other. I will vse no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perswations to forward a gratious acceptance of a slender trauaile in so worthy a labor, and forbeare to hold you with anie longer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>
