      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord, amongst all the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> whiche maye be viewed vnder the coape of heauen, there is nothyng to be séene, which more stirreth the spirite of man, whiche rauisheth more his senses, whiche doth more amaze hym, or ingendreth a greater terror or admiration in al creatures, than the mōsters, wonders and abhominations, wherein we see the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of Nature, not only turned arsiuersie, misseshapen and deformed, but (which is more) they do for the most part discouer vnto vs the secret iudgemēt and scourge of the ire of God, by the things that they present, which maketh vs to féele his maruellous iustice so sharpe, that we be constrained to enter into oure selues, to knocke with the hammer of our conscience, to examin our offē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and haue in horrour our misdéedes, specially when we reade in Histories sacred and prophane, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the elementes haue bene harolds, trumpetters, ministers and executioners of the Iustice of God. As when we see the waters ouerflowe their chanells, and that the vaines of heauen open by suche outrage, that they surpasse .xv. cubites, the highest mountaines of the earth. And the fire in like manner, obeying the cōmaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of his Creator, consumed fiue famous Cities, committing them presently into cinders. The ayre al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hath bene founde so corrupt, venomous and infectiue in diuers prouinces, that piercing from one to an other it hath in effect smoothered and choked the most part of humain kind, leauing the earth inhabitable. The earth likewise opening hir throte, hath swalowed vp an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite nūber of proude Cities, with their citizens. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit these wōders he but smal, yet if we cōsider, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> whē the furor of God is enflamed against our sinnes, he doth not so much respect vs, as to chastise vs by his elemēts,

But the better to bridle and correcte vs, he maketh the most weake and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore like as we haue shewed you before these fearfull and straunge chastisements, euen so we could bring to memorie others no lesse maruellous, thā wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be noted of those specially which haue felt some apprehension of the iudgements of God: as when we s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e liuing creatures borne amongst vs, who haue had two heades knit and fastned togither in one only bodie, like two bowes in the trunke of a trée. Others so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned and glued the one to the other, that by no Art of mā they were to be seperated. Others be so abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deformed, that they séeme to be brought into the world as wel in contempt of nature, as to the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all infamie and grief of their parents. These things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very liuely apprehended by the Prophet <hi>Oseas</hi> in his .ix. Chapiter: where he writes, these be the déedes of their abhominable loues, and when they haue norished their children, I wil destroy them in such sort that they neuer shal become men. I will giue them an ouer time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly birth, and their pappes shall be drie, and their roote withered, so that they shall be barren: but if they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to engender, I will then destroy the fruit of their body. The like is confirmed by the Prophet <hi>Esdras</hi> the .v. Chapiter, where amongst other cruell cursings, wherewith <hi>Babylon</hi> was threatned by the Angell, it is expresly said, that women defiled with bloud, shal bring forth monsters. But for y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the misterie of these secretes is somewhat to hard, and therefore requireth a further leisure, I wil leaue the rest to the discourse that I haue made in my Histories, which be enterlarded wyth no other things, than these straunge accidents and wōder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

chaunces, wherwith all the prouinces of the world haue ben astonied sithens the natiuitie of Iesus Christ, vnto this our time. But now (my Lord) hauing fought wyth Labour, and in myne opinion become therof vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, there resteth in me none other thing for the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall accomplishement of the same, than to tender, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate and giue the fruite sprong of my <hi>Muses</hi> and iuste tribute of my paines, being drawne thervnto not onely by sundry particular bondes, which I wyll kéepe secrete for this present, but also for the merite of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Heroicall vertues, whyche maketh you so maruellous, that you deserue to be celebrated of all those whiche haue written. For besides the Noble bloud of the auncient house <hi>de Rieux,</hi> where you toke your first beginning, you are endued with such excellēt giftes of the mynde and of Nature, a singular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in diuers artes and disciplines, bearyng an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest frendshyp to such as maketh those their profession, yet haue you besides these, so noble a desire to martiall affaires, such affection and deuotion to the seruice of your Prince, as there hath bene no assemblie made or addressed in your tyme to any assaulte of towne or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, skirmish or other Saile into <hi>Italy,</hi> or else where, where you haue not bene found the first in ranck wyth such assurance and little regarde of your life, that those which knewe you, expected no lesse in you, than of that greate Marshall <hi>de Rieux,</hi> your graundfather, to whose fame the Chroniclers and writers haue sowned so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayses. Neither ought I in this place to passe ouer with silence the worthy exploites and valiant actes of <hi>Monsieur de Gue de Lisle</hi> your brother, who hath accom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panied you in all your perils and trauailes of Fortune, and euen in this his yong age, hath gyuen such suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent witnesse of the same, by so often sheadyng of hys bloud in the seruice of his prince, that for his magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie

and vertue he meriteth neuer to be buried in the graue of obliuion: Albeit hauyng reserued to make a more ample description therof in an other work which I haue prepared, so this (my Lorde) may suffise for the present, beséeching you not only to take this worke in good parte which I offer vnto you, but also serue to the same as a defence and safe conduct: To the ende that it being fortified by the shadowe and brightnesse of your noblenesse and vertue, it may the rather passe assured thorough the perillous straightes of oure Countreye of <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
