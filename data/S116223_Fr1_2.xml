      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, in many things God hath been pleased to linke vs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as in nature, in nation, and in honest familiaritie or Christian acquaintance, and sundrie such like: yet in none of these, hath this great grace of his, more plainely and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully appeared, then in the band of the holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which we professe. As the thing it selfe hath been, is, and I trust shall for euer be, the greatest glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and best comfort, that God hath affoorded vs in this world: so we cannot but make much of the meanes, and thinke well of the men, by which this and many other graces, haue been offered vnto vs, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

      </gap> meanes are the Word, Sacraments, and Prayers of the Church, together with many other
<pb facs="3"/>
good helpes and aides, both publike and priuate which are good, not onely because they proceede from God, <hi>From whom alone floweth euery good and perfect gift, and is all onely goodnes himselfe:</hi> but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they tend, to our spirituall benefit in generall, and in speciall are, the strictest band, to tye vs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one with another, and to hold vs fast in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed fellowship of the saints.

   <p>Amongst others, whom God in this last age hath vouchsafed vnto vs, who may we? or who mould we more continually remember, or more reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regard, then that worthie Country man of ours, Maister ROBERT ROLLOK, who, what hee was in himselfe (I meane for his life and conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) I suppose verilie, you of any man liuing best know, and can and will most truely relate, as time and occasion shall be offered, because you were not onely the longest, but most inwardly acquainted with all his cariages.

But not by any more then this, that hitherto enuie it selfe, hath not opened her mouth, neither euer shall be able so to doe, his conuersation was so Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and his iudgement so sincere. This worthie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of his glorie; God graciouslie offered, nay liberally lent a long while to our Church: but we <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

      </gap>refullie profiting by him, as in deede we ought, God in great mercie towards him doubtles, though in no small iudgement to vs ward, hath been pleased to retraite him to himselfe, out of this wretched world, and to bring him to, yea to place him in cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall &amp; heauenlie ioyes. Which whatsoeuer he was doing, he did hunger and thirst after, yea <hi>groane and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

      <hi>with God, and innumerable Saints and Angels,</hi> in the heauenlie places, where is the fruition <hi>and fulnes of ioy for euermore,</hi> but euen with men, yea holy men vpon earth, and speaketh to them, though not in a bodily voyce, yet in the sound of his Lectures, and fame of many excellent things of his, prouoking the good euerie day to be better, and admonishing the wicked, <hi>euery where to turne from dead workes, vnto the liuing God, that so they might repent, and be saued.</hi> And this he doth amongst others, euen in these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons or Lectures, which now I present vnto you, as a posthume birth, after the Fathers decease, or as an Orphane destitute of earthly parents, not onely to receiue, as it were breath and being from you, for that it hath done alreadie, as without whose good meanes in deed, it could neuer haue beheld this light, but all good supportation beside, it lying in you, not onely for your selfe, but with sundrie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by reason of the good credit you haue among all, speciallie with the godlie, to giue it voge, and passage.</p>
   <p>Take it therefore I pray you into your good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage and protection, and receiue it, as it is in deed yours: yea, yours I say, if not in many good and gracious respects besides, yet in a double regarde at the least. One in consideration of the author, whose things whilest he liued, yea and after life and death also, were yours, as yours again his, but all in Christ. Another, in that it is produced to the view of all, by your meanes, without which it should haue been, as bed-reden, notable to moue hand or foote, nor to see or speake, or should haue perished <hi>inter blattas &amp;</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>tineas,</hi> as we say; but now commeth forth into the world, cloathed as it were with your countenance, and to be vpheld by your credit.</p>
   <p>In this holy loue of yours, hold on I beseech you, and <hi>increase with the increasings of God,</hi> and shew it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuallie, not onely to his, which yet remaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, as you haue bountifullie done, and yet doe, that so that may be verified in you, in the daies of your pilgrimage, which was auerred of a right worthie person in former time, <hi>he ceaseth not to doe good to the liuing, and to the dead:</hi> but euen to all the Saints and Seruants of God in this world, you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting it, to these especiallie, by sending abroad o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruitfull labours of his, for the blessed building of them vp in sound knowledge, stedfast faith, and all vnfeined obedience of truth. Assure your selfe (good Sir) that <hi>this labour of loue</hi> in you towards them, shall not be left vnrequited, neither of God himselfe, nor of his deare people: for besides that God, <hi>who leaueth not a cuppe of colde water vnrecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed, giuen in his name to one of the little ones that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him,</hi> will render it seuen folde into your bosome, euen in this life, as hee shall see good, but speciallie in the resurrection of the righteous, his Saints vpon earth, will more and more pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue you, with all holy loue, and as a sure pledge thereof, vouchsafe you their dailie prayers, and performe all other fauours and furtherances that they can. Nay I will say more, the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and particularlie our ROLLOK shall abound, not onely in right and sound, but in perfect affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you: and good reason, because if when
<pb facs="5"/>
the Saints that dwell here amongst vs, doe vnfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedlie loue one another, they cannot but in Heauen perfectlie loue all that are there, and their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruants on earth, as well because Heauen freeth vs from all corruption bodilie and spirituall, as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the place to and in which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>fulnes of all ioy,</hi> and perfection of all graces. But whither am I caried? It is time to end, special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie sith I doubt not but the wisdome of the Word will teach you, and the power of the blessed spirit will inable you to performe these and all other good things, to the glorie of God, the good of his people, and the comfort of your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science thorough Christ. In whom I rest assuredlie yours, now and for euer.</p>
