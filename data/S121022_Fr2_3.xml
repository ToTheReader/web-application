   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough I am not ignorant (good
Christian Reader) how vnpleasing
this Sermon will be to some, who
are forestalled with preiudicate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
(whom I could wish, I were
as sure to perswade, as I hope by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of truth to conuince:) notwithstanding, if I
may intreat thee, to reade it without preiudice, and to
iudge of it without partialitie; I doubt not, but thou
wilt acknowledge with mee, that the doctrine therein
contained, is not onely true, but also a profitable and
necessarie truth. And the rather doe I conceiue this
hope, because the time hath beene, when mine affection
enclined by the reuerent opinion, which I had worthily
conceiued not onely of Master <hi>Caluin,</hi> the author, but
also of Master <hi>Beza,</hi> and many other godly and learned
men, patrones and fautors of the pretended discipline,
made me suspend my iudgement in this cause; vntill I
had seriously entred into the studie thereof. The which
for a long time I did forbear: partly because I did right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suppose, that my paines might bee more profitably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
in other partes of diuinitie, and I had heard a
<pb facs="60"/>
zealous preacher reproue young Diuines in a Sermon at
<hi>Cambridge,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Master Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note> who, before they had studied the grounds
of theologie, would ouer-busie themselues in matters
of discipline, and as hee said, before they had laide the
foundation of their studie, would bee setting vp as it
were the roofe: and partly because in my slender iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I could not then see, what good would come either
to my selfe or to the Church of God, by my paines taken
in that controuersie. For I conceiued the issue of my stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
would bee, either the disgrace of my ministerie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the forwarder sort▪ if I resolued, as now I knowe
I should haue done; or the ouerthrowe of my ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
if I should stand for that discipline. Thus was I cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to remaine in suspense, whiles I tooke it to bee the
best course, both for my selfe and for the Church, to bee
no medler on either side. But when of late yeares the
case was so altered with the time, that a necessitie was
imposed, not onely to resolue, but also to professe my
resolution on the one part; and it was now expected,
that I should informe not onely my self, but some others
also what way to take: I did then seriously enter into
the studie of these things; Perhaps with another minde
then some others haue done, and therefore with other
successe. I considered with my selfe, that this Church of
<hi>England,</hi> wherein I was called to be a minister, did hold
and professe all substantial points of diuinity, as sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as any Church in the world, none excepted neither in
this age, nor in the primitiue times of the Church. And
secondly, that it hath the testimonie of all other true
Churches. Thirdly, that in it the means of saluation are
ordinarily and plentifully to be had. And therefore to
make separation from it, I tooke to be schismaticall and
<pb facs="60"/>
damanable presumption. And as touching my selfe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
that being in the ministerie, <hi>necessitie is laide
vpon me, and woe bee vnto mee, if I preach not the
Gospell.</hi> Wherefore I must confesse, I studied the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies
wherein the policie of our Church is called into
question, as one who meant if hee were not conuicted
with euidence of truth, to bee as it were the respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
or defendant, resoluing not to leaue my standing
wherein God had placed mee, vnlesse by force of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I were remooued: Whereas others, hauing (as it
seemeth) beene out of loue with our Church-discipline
before, and in affection wholly alienated from our
Church-gouernours, haue studied these things as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
and plaintiffes. And therefore hauing sought a
knot as it were in euerie bulrush, and strained at euerie
gnatte, they haue picked so many quarels against the
Church, and by consequent, against their owne ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
as that by their oppos<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ion, the Church is depriued
of their ministerie, &amp; themselues of the imployment of
their gifts; They suffering the Land to swarme (euen in
their owne opinion) with Papists and Atheistes, and
their places either to be destitute, or to be occupied with
such as they account vnprofitable ministers, rather thē
they wil embrace, nay rather then they wil without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
and partiality read, what is truly said for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of our Church. But to returne to my selfe: when
with this resolution (which I am perswaded ought to be
in the like case) I had studied som, which are supposed to
bee the chiefe treatises on both sides: I found on the one
side, certaine places of Scripture drawne as it were by
the necke to that side, a fewe stragling sentences quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of the Fathers, and as it were with oares wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by these men (looking as one would thinke the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="61"/>
waie) against the full streame of Antiquitie; some
pretie speeches and wittie proofes, which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
were (as before I had obserued in the question of
vsurie) meere colours, rather then sound arguments. On
the other side, I found full and plentiful proofes, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
writinges, so namely in the learned treatise of the
perpetuall gouernemant of the Church, from which I
receiued good satisfaction. Now, the arguments which
perswaded me, I haue here set downe, as the shortnesse
of a Sermon (though somewhat enlarged) would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte;
hoping (because I knowe nothing to the contrarie,
setting not the iudgement of men, otherwise minded,
but their preiudice aside) that the same argumentes
which haue perswaded me, wil also preuaile with others
to embrace this, which at the first I called a profitable
and necessarie trueth. The which if it shall please God
according to my hearts desire to effect, I would hope
through Gods goodnesse qu<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>kly to see an ende of this
pernicious diuision which is among vs. For though some
other particulars be cōtrouerted; yet this, of the church-gouernment,
is the chiefe &amp; principal: and so chiefe, as
that somtimes I haue thought the rest to be but contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies
in pretēce to auoyd the enuie of this. Neither doe
I doubt, but that if men sincerely affected were rightly
perswaded of the gouernmēt, that either they wold not
so stand vpon matters of ceremony, &amp; such like of small
importance, as that for them they would maintain this
rent in the bodie of Christ or suffer either themselues to
be depriued of the imployments of their talents, or the
Church of their ministerie: or if anie out of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of conscience should make scruple of these things,
that they would fauourably be respected. So that by the
acknowledgment of this one truth our differences would
be compounded, our breaches healed, our diuided minds
<pb facs="61"/>
reunited, with one heart and voice to glorifie God in
the edification of his Church, propagation of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
confusion of Poperie and Atheisme. Whereas now
this opposition, whiles it is continued, greatly dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
God and his true religion which we professe, hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the proceedings of the Gospel, aduantageth Poperie
&amp; Atheisme scandalizeth the people whom we ought to
edifie, and not onely the backwarder sort; who hereby take occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be of no religion, but also the forwarder sort, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
waies, as I wil particularly shew. For they (I speak not
of all) are hereby occasioned, 1. To despise the solemn wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship
&amp; seruice of God, and whatsoeuer good thing else is
set forth by Authoritie: and 2 Wheras they would seeme
aboue all things to esteeme the ministery of the word, as
that precious treasure for which they would (with him
in the Gospell) forgoe all things; they not onely vilifie
and disgrace the ministerie, which is to bee had (I mean
of those who are conformable, though no way inferiour,
but in many graces, by many degrees superiour to many
of those whom they admire:) but also encourage by all
meanes their admired ministers to stand out, as though
they had rather want the foode of their soules, and that
which they acknowledge to be the power of god to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thē not to enioy their fācies, for which they haue no
ground. 3. To place the height of religion in disconformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
turning zeal into faction, godly conferēces to bitter
inuectiues against Bishops, &amp; odious censures of such as
they cal formalists; the study of the scriptures &amp; the sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stance
of diuinity, to disputatiō of discipline &amp; ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
&amp; being ignorant in the Catechisme to professe skil
in those things: Combining themselues in a diuided bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
hood, as though none were to be accounted Christiās or bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in Christ, but such as stand for the pretended discipline; to
whom also they cōfine their charitie. 4. To be dāgerously
<pb facs="62"/>
vnthankfull vnto God for the continuance of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
together with outward peace and prosperitie vnder
the happie gouernment of our gratious and dread soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.
For whereas before the end of the blessed raigne
of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> all good Christians would haue
acknowledged thēselues infinitely bound to Almightie
God in al duties of thankfulnes, if they might haue been
assured of the continuance of these things after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease
(which was the time that we feared &amp; our enemies
expected:) yet now when the Lord hath granted what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
almost we could desire, we take on, as if we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and like weyward children when we haue what is
fit for vs, if we cannot also haue what we fancy besides,
we are ready to cast away that, which, through Gods vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
goodnes, we may to our soules health enioy. Yea
so strangely doe some dote vpon their owne deuises, that
they protest to all the world,<note place="margin">Christian &amp; modest offer of disput.</note> vnlesse their assertions (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
euen the principall whereof were neuer heard of
in the Church of God within 1600. and some odde
yeares after Christ) bee graunted, they see not how our
separation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can bee iustified.
Nay they protest, that if they be in an errour and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
haue the truth, the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> haue
had great wrong and indignitie offered vnto them, in
that they are reiected: and that all the protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are schismaticall in forsaking vnity and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with them; And therfore in their wisdoms make this
offer to the Priests and Iesuites, that if from them they
can receiue satisfaction concerning their propositions,
they will be reconciled to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that now
it must be thought that we separated from the church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> not for their abominable idolatries &amp; heathenish
superstitiōs, nor for their capital heresies subuerting the
<pb facs="62"/>
foundation of religiō, nor because the church of Rome is
the whore of Babylon, the See of Antichrist, the mother
of all fornications and abominations, being also embru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and as it were died red with the blood of the Saints,
&amp; of the Martyrs of Iesu; frō which we are cōmanded to
separate in these respects: but because forsooth among
them, euery particular parish is not held to be an entire
body by it selfe, furnished with sufficient power &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
for the gouernment of it selfe in all causes eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall;
because euery parish among thē hath not power
immediatly vnder Christ, to elect and ordaine, depriue
and depose their Ministers, and to execute all other ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiast▪
censures: because the Pastor of euery particular
cōgregation, is not among thē the highest ordinary eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
officer, but aboue him they haue diocesan and
provinciall church-officers, &amp; such like; for it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to haue mentioned those, which as they concerne the
cause in hand, so they are the principal. In respect wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
seeing they holde separation is to be made from the
church of Rome, they plainly bewray themselues what
manner of persons they be, who for the same causes may
separate not onely from our Church, but those of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and <hi>Geneua,</hi> and all others, where these vndige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
deuises were neuer heard of. Fiftly, to growe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
in religion through a kinde of spirituall pride, not
caring for the heauenly food of their soules, vnlesse they
may haue their own sawee, &amp; preferring the circūstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of religiō &amp; ceremonies, before the substance. We wil
not heare a sermon forsooth made at a funerall, bee it
neuer so profitable, and by our good wil we would heare
none that is conformable, be hee neuer so learned and
godly a preacher: of if we doe, (we hearing with preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice,
<pb facs="63"/>
&amp; making the word vneffectual vnto vs) we say
his gifts be decayed, &amp; his preaching to be without pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
we heare &amp; not heare with admirable acceptation of
persons, as if we had neuer learned to acknowledge Gods
ordinance, or to look higher then to the speaker. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
if lawe did not compell vs, wee had rather be at no
publique prayers, then at those which by authoritie are
appointed; or if we be present, we will behaue our selues
as absent, not vouchsafing to ioyne with the congregatiō.
We had rather not haue our child baptized (if we might
choose) then that the crosse in baptisme should be vsed.
We had rather not receiue the Communion, then receiue
kneeling &amp;c. Which things, when I consider how fewe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the people (in comparison) de care for religion, &amp;
of those few, how many are (I am sory to speake it) schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically
disposed, doe make my heart to sorow, and my
bowels to yearne in commiseration so thē. Neither can I
choose, but in an earnest desire of the peace of our church
(whereby these inconveniences might be remedied) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
&amp; euen in the bowles of Christ, to beseech my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of the Ministery, that as they tender the glorie of
God, in the propagation of the Gospel, or the salvation of
the people which Christ hath redeemed with his precious
blood: or if these considerations wil not preuaile, as they
hope to answer these thinges at the day of the Lord, they
would at length seeke the peace of Sion, &amp; be as desirous
to find arguments to revntie themselues vnto vs, as they
haue bin ouer-busie in seeking reasons to disioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
frō vs. Or if they will not be at so much paines, yet
at the least, that they would weigh in the ballance of an
vpright &amp; vnpartiall iudgement, those proofes which
heere are briefely set downe. And if they finde them to
<pb facs="63"/>
ouer-weigh the reasons of the contrary part, they wold giue
glory to God, by acknowledging ingenuously so profitable, &amp;
as these times are, so necessary a truth. Neither shall they
need to feare discredit, if vpon better information they shal
reforme their iudgements. Wherein all moderate men will
hold them excused: remembring first, the common condition
of humane frailty, which is subiect to ouer sight; frō which
the most zealous men are so far frō being exempted, as that
many times they are more subiect there-vnto then others of
milder temper; men of greatest zeale being not alwaies, nor
for the most part, of soundest iudgement. Secondly, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent
opinion which worthily they haue conceiued of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
&amp; <hi>Beza,</hi> &amp; other worthy Diuines, whom they hauing
found so admirably sound &amp; orthodoxal in the substantiall
points of religion; it is no maruel, though without any great
search they relied vpon their credit for matters of lesse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.
Thirdly, the good effects which (as they haue beene
enformed) the new discipline hath brought forth, and the
manifold corruptions which they haue taken notice of in the
gouernmēt of our church, being the personal defaults not so
much of the Bb. themselues, as of their officers. And yet what
are these to those horible cōfusions, which if the discipline of
the newest edition should be established, wold inevitably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?
Namely, if euery parish Bishop should, as they teach, bee
the supreme or highest ecclesiasticall officer: that euery parish (where
plurality of voices must cary all things, &amp; the greater part ouersway
the better) should within it selfe haue authority immediatly deriued
from Christ, to elect, ordaine, depose and depriue their Minister, and
to exercise all other ecclesiasticall censures; that euery parish should
be an entire body within it selfe, hauing neither subordinatiō, nor (for
ought that I see in the new plotforme) consociation with others.</p>
   <p>And is it possible, that these things should not onelie bee
broached of godly learned Ministers, but also with such vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
be vrged, that separation is to be made frō all those
<pb facs="64"/>
churches which admit not these new &amp; vndigested fancies?
Or shal we not rather think, that <hi>Brownists,</hi> or some not far
from <hi>Brownisme,</hi> haue abused their names? which if it bee
so, why do not the rest disavow these new-found assertions,
&amp; protest against such schismaticall nouelties? Why are the
people suffered to receiue thē as oracles? why is this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
giuen to Papists as though the ministers among vs, who
would be thought to seeke reformation, did acknowledge no
greater cause of separation from the church of Rome, then
these matters of the new-found parish-discipline, which no
reformed Church in the world doth obserue?</p>
   <p>But if in the partial ballance of their forestalled iudgmēt
these argumēts shal seem light in cōparison of their own; my
desire is, that their answers may be distinctly applied to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
argumēt in order, &amp; that their proofs may be produced:
which (they must remember) had need to be very pregnant
&amp; demonstratiue, which are to perswade, both the abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that gouernment which euen from th' apostles times
hath been perpetually obserued in the church, &amp; setting vp
of another which was neuer heard of till now of late. And if
for ought that I haue heere said, or can say, the newest things
wil proue the truest, (which yet neuer hapned) I will then
acknowledge my error. Onely I desire christian and modest
dealing: not as in that which is called the christian and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
offer, which notwithstanding that title, is ful of odious
censures, proud &amp; scornful speeches, vnchristian &amp; vnmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
provocations, with great bitternes galling those whom
they haue made their opposites. In expectation whereof, I
commend thee to the Grace of God, vnfainedly protesting,
that what I haue heere either in this Praeface or in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
deliuered, is that which in my conscience I am verilie
perswaded to be the truth.</p>
