                 <title>The nevv couenant, or A treatise of the sacraments : Whereby the last testament of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, through the shedding of his pure and precious blood, is ratified and applyed vnto the conscience of euery true beleeuer. Diuided into three bookes 1. Of the sacraments in generall. 2. Of baptisme. 3. Of the Lords Supper. Verie necessarie and profitable for these times: wherein we may behold the truth it selfe plainly prooued, [the] doctrine of the Reformed Churches clearely maintained, [the] errors of the Church of Rome soundly conuinced, [the] right maner of the receiuing of the [m] comfortably declared and sundry doubts and difficult questions decided.
