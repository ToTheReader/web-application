HIS SINGVLAR
GOOD LORD AND MAISTER, SIR
Iohn Puckering Knight, Lord keeper of the great seale
of England, and of her Maiesties most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
Priuie Counsell.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST Honorable, all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
haue euer fauored
those, who with their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and industrie, and
the aduenture of their
liues, haue from other
coūtreys, brought those
things, which haue bene of vse, and for the
good, and profite, of the Common-wealth.
VVith like trauell, and paine, I haue transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the ancient Grecians and Romains,
into England, the most precious of their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.
And albeit the danger hath bene lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the same being first by LIPSIVS, set to
the viewe of all the world in Germanie: yet
haue I hazarded my credit (more deere then
<pb facs="4"/>
life) in fetching them from thence. VVhich I
most humbly beseech your good Lordship to
protect and to accept of them, as a pledge of
that loue, and most bounden dutie I do owe,
and will be alwayes most readie to performe
with my most humble seruice. And although
in regard of your Lordships wisedome, these
treasors may seeme (as they are in deed) but
borrowed: yet in comparing them together
with your own, your Lordship may the better
discerne, in the ballance of your Honourable
iudgement, and by the touchstone of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
which of them deserue, the greatest
price, and praise. For others, who are to reape
profit, &amp; commoditie by them, they are in all
humblenesse to acknowledge the benefit, to
proceed from your Lordship, &amp; to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to your Honor therfore, for whom especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
they were brought to light. For my selfe,
I wil euer pray, that your yeares may increase
your Honour, to the glorie of God, and the
good of her Maiestie, and this Estate. At
Newington Buts the first of Ianuarie, 1594.</p>
