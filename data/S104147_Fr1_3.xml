                 <title>The Christian exercise of fasting, priuate and publike : plainly set forth by testimonies of holy Scriptures, and also of old and late writers: wherein is shewed how religious families priuatly, and the congregations publikely, haue humbled themselues before almightie God making vse of iudgements past, auoyding euils present, and preuenting future calamities, &amp;c. Together with sundrie abuses of fasting in three generations of hypocrites: the first in the dayes of the prophets: the second in the dayes of Christ: the third in the dayes of Antichrist. Hereunto also ar added some meditations on the 1. and 2. chapters of Iob, to comfort and instruct all such as be afflicted with any crosse, either inwardly in minde, or outwardly in bodie. By H. Holland, minister and preacher of Gods word</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He pure worship &amp; ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God (right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull) hath two dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous extremes, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition is the one, impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is the other. The people of this age seeming wise, to auoide the vnsauerie leauen of popish corruption, are fallen asleepe in carnall securitie &amp; prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. If the prince of darknes had not so blinded men, that they can not see the beautie of Gods house, nor reape any comfort by his seruice, this exercise of fasting should little need any letters of commendation. For the booke of God so commendeth it in the practise of the
<pb facs="3"/> Saints, Patriarches, Kings, Prophets, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and Church stories in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and seruaunts of God in all ages: that I can thinke a man but meanely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Gods worshippe, which doth not otherwhiles exercise himselfe herein. This wil good Bucer testifie with me in these very words:<note place="margin">Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

I must look for many aduersaries, for the greatest part hath euer declined from pietie to superstition and prophanenes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (right worshipfull) I come vnto you for protection of Gods trueth: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more bolde to aske this fauour,
<pb facs="3"/> because I am so well assured of your loue thereunto, and full resolution to defend the same with al your might du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life. Againe, I haue nowe for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares knowen your Christian loue towards me for the truths sake, I desire to testifie my hearts affection towardes you in the best manner that I can. The most blessed spirit of Iesus Christ guide and gouerne your spirit, keepe and comfort you and all yours. Februarie. 12. 1596.</p>
