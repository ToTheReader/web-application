   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>THe Authour of this small discourse, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (giue mee leaue so to call him) the Swan that, before his death, sung this divine song, is now thear, whear he neither needs the praise, nor feares the envy of any: whose life, as it deserued all, so it was cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of no mans commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; himselfe beeing as farre from pride, as his desert was neere it. Yet because it was his griefe, that hee should die before hee was fit to doe God the service hee desired; and his freinds desire, that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so fit as hee was for his seruice, hee might (if it had been possible) neuer haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="5"/>
at all: thearfore his booke was bould to thrust it selfe into that world, which the Authour of it had lately left, therby to satisfie both his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers desire, in doing the church of God some seruice; and his friends griefe in not suffering him altogether to lie dead.</p>
   <p>And truely what better ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice can it doe, then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade with reason, since Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie forces not, our young Neophytes to abide awhile in the schooles of the Prophets, at <hi>Bethel,</hi> before they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to enter the Temple at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and if reason can doe little with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause happily they want it, yet let his <hi>Example</hi> (an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="5"/>
that prevailes much with the common People, of whome such Prophets are the tayle) make them at least see, and confesse, though they know not how to amend their fault. Ten yeares had hee liued in the Vniversitie, eight lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages had hee learnt, and taught his tongue so many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall waies by which to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse a good heart; watching often, daily excercising, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way studying, in a word, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an ende of himselfe in an ouer-feruent desire to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit others; and yet, after hee had, as it wear out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, sweat out all this oyle for his lampe, after hee had with the Sunne ran so many
<pb facs="6"/>
heauenly races, and, when the Sunne was laied abed by his labours, after hee had burnt out so many candles to giue his minde light (hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies S <hi>Pauls</hi> querie in his minde, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>;) hee neuer durst adventure to doe that, after all these stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies done, and ended, which our young Novices, doeing nothing, coumpt nothing to doe: but still thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as vnfit, as hee kniew all men weare vnworthy of so high an honour, as to be the Angells of God.</p>
   <p>I could wish that he had left behinde him, if not all his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet some of his modesty to be deuided among these empty
<pb facs="6"/>
sounding vessels, that want both: but since in him so great examples of piety, knowledge, industrie, and vnaffected mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie are all fallen so deepely a sleep, as I am afraid we shall hardly find in any of his age the like, (which I speake not to deny iust praise to the liuing, but who wil not affoard a fiew flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to strowe the cophine of the dead?) thear was no way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken them, and in them him, but by layeing them vp, not with him in his graue, but in these immortal monuments of the presse, the liuing Tombes proper to dead learning, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these flowers may liue, though their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oote be withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and though the trunke be
<pb facs="7"/>
dead, the branches flowrish.</p>
   <p>Let rich men therefore, in the guilded sepulchres, and proud monuments of their death, beg for the memorie of their liues: <hi>the righteous shall be had in euerlasting remembrance,</hi> without any such proud beggary: nor shall he euer be behoulding to a dead stone for the matter: and good reason. Righteousnes beeing a shadow of that diuine substāce, which hath in it no shadowe of change, much lesse of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on▪ only I could wish that their liues wear as long as their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories; that so this crooked age might haue as great store, as it hath need of them.</p>
