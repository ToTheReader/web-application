      <l>Yea soule confounding sinne so far hath crept,</l>
      <l>Repentant sighes are reckoned for toies,</l>
      <l>And <hi>Maries</hi> teares contemned, long have slept,</l>
      <l>As jems unpriz'd, which corrupt age destroies:</l>
      <l>Save that her Lord, because they still should last,</l>
      <l>In surest caske hath them invessel'd fast.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>For wretched soules let loose to libertie,</l>
      <l>So wanton like are weaned to each wrong,</l>
      <l>So licensed to worke impietie,</l>
      <l>And free to fleshly wils have liv'd so long:</l>
      <l>That those fresh springs, whence penitent tears should flow,</l>
      <l>Presumption hath so stopt, that none will know.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And sencelesse hearts, obdurat to all good,</l>
      <l>Have so perverted their perfixed end,</l>
      <l>That now (O greefe) their sighs and dearest bloud,</l>
      <l>To feed fond fancie they doe vainely spend:</l>
      <l>But for their sins one teare for to let fall,</l>
      <l>They have (alas) nor eye nor heart at all.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Ah could they see what sinne from sence hath shut,</l>
      <l>How sweet it were to summon deeds misdone,</l>
      <l>To have their lives in equall ballance put,</l>
      <l>To waigh each worke ere that the judge doe come:</l>
      <l>Ah then their teares would trickle like the raine,</l>
      <l>And their eye-flouds would helpe to fill the maine.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="2"/>
      <l>They would with <hi>Marie</hi> send forth bitter cries,</l>
      <l>To get the ioies of their soule-saving love,</l>
      <l>They would gush forth fresh fountaines from their eies,</l>
      <l>To win his favour, and his mercie prove:</l>
      <l>Eyes, hart, and tongue, should poure, breath out, &amp; send,</l>
      <l>Teares, sighs, and plaints, untill their love they find.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>No idle houres ill spent in fond delight,</l>
      <l>No teares distil'd for momentarie losses,</l>
      <l>No sighs for missing absent lovers sight,</l>
      <l>No care contriv'd of common worldly crosses,</l>
      <l>Should then be us'd; but all consum'd in this,</l>
      <l>To beg amendment and bewaile their misse.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Yea all too little to an humble soule</l>
      <l>(That inly sees her ill misgovern'd life)</l>
      <l>Would it appeare, to spend whole yeares in dole,</l>
      <l>Yea many ages to declare her strife</l>
      <l>Would passe as minuts, wishing time would stand,</l>
      <l>While she with feare her endlesse faults had scand.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But farre from this lives sinners (too secure)</l>
      <l>Who giving bridle to their selfe-desires,</l>
      <l>Cannot alas one scanted houre indure</l>
      <l>In sacred service, but their mind aspires</l>
      <l>In following pleasures height, whose froward will</l>
      <l>In doing good, doth make them carelesse still.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <l>Which seene with pitie on our gracelesse minds,</l>
      <l>This blessed sinner, whose so precious teares,</l>
      <l>Once bath'd his feet, that heaven and earth in binds,</l>
      <l>And made a towell of her trayling haires,</l>
      <l>To wipe the drops, which for her sins were shed,</l>
      <l>Now deignes to tell how our soules should be fed.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And <hi>Marie</hi> shewes to maids and matrones both,</l>
      <l>How they should weepe and decke their rose-like cheekes</l>
      <l>With showers of greefe, whereto hard hearts are loth,</l>
      <l>And who it is her matchlesse mourning seekes:</l>
      <l>And when we ought to send our reeking sighs,</l>
      <l>To thicke the passage of the purest lights.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And <hi>Marie</hi> showes us when we ought to beat</l>
      <l>Our brasen breasts, and let our robes be rent,</l>
      <l>How prostrating, to creepe unto the seat</l>
      <l>Of that sweet lambe, whose bloud for us was spent:</l>
      <l>And that we should give way unto our woes,</l>
      <l>When the excesse no fault or errour showes.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>If you will deigne with favour to peruse</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Maries</hi> memoriall of her sad lament,</l>
      <l>Exciting <hi>Collin</hi> in his graver Muse,</l>
      <l>To tell the manner of her hearts repent:</l>
      <l>My gaine is great, my guerdon granted is,</l>
      <l>Let <hi>Maries</hi> plaints plead pardon for amisse.</l>
