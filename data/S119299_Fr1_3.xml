   <head>To the right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
Henry Earle of Huntingdon,
Lord Hastings, Hungerford, Botre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,
Molines and Moiles, my

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue studied (right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable)
what way I
might manifest my thāk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
minde, for the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
fauours, wherewith
I and mine are bound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your house for euer. I finde none more
likely, then if I might adde somewhat (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the faithfull and happy trauels of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
to your present and immortall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Considering therefore, that the God
of heauen, hath set you in so high a place,
not onely in his owne eye, but also in the
view of your countrey, to be beholden of
all, as a marke, for the saluation or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of very many, and that little faults
in your Honour, must needs much blemish



<pb facs="3"/>
you, as a vertuous life shall make you glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
I haue indeuored for my part to
put into your handes a true glasse and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
mappe:<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 25.</note>, a glasse which will not flatter
you in shewing your spotts, because it is the
Lordes, a mappe which will not deceiue
you, for the narrow way of life, because it
is bounded by the Lord himselfe, troden
by our Sauiour, with all his holy Saintes,
which haue gone before you; yet so small
as you may euer carrie in your bosome.
My humble suite at the hāds of the Lord
and your honour is this, that when you
haue tried them to bee such, (where the
superstitious Papists spend some houres in
blind deuotions) you would bind your selfe
by a constant vow before the Lord, to spēd
but one houre weekely, besides other your
holy exercises, in vewing your selfe in
this Christal glasse,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 23. 24. 25.</note> desirous to clense your
spotts hereby; and to consider your waies
according to this map,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 59.</note> labouring so to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

with resolute purpose of heart<note place="margin">Acts. 11. 23.</note> to walke

of his glorious Angels for your safetie,<note place="margin">Psa. 91. 11. 12. and 34. 7.</note> to
beare you in their handes in the day time,

to pitch their tents about you: your

pray for the encrease of this honour, manie
times ten thousands shall euer praise the

you shall liue with them immortallie; but
if you should turne to the broad waie of all
