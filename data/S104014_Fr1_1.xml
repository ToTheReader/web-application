   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONGST the severall commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Charitie</hi> by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> we find these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vaunteth not it selfe; is not
<pb facs="2"/>
puffed up; doth not behave it selfe unseemely; seeketh not her own; is not easily provoked: thinketh no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi>: Which if they be the certaine marks of <hi>Charitie,</hi> as no doubt they are; we may affirm it of too many in these later daies, that whatsoever <hi>Faith</hi> they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto, they have little <hi>Charitie.</hi> Such boasters are they of themselves, so arrogant, so unadvised in all their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, so greedie either after lucre or vaine applause, so peevish and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in their speech and writings, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally so jealous and distrustfull of all those who concurre not with them in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: That <hi>though they had all Faith, so that they could remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.23.</note> which I thinke they have not; or should they <hi>give their bodies to be burned,</hi> as I thinke they will not; it
<pb facs="2"/>
would profit nothing. Of such, as these it was that S. <hi>Peter</hi> tell's us, that they are <hi>Presumptuous, selfe-willed,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.10.</note>
      <hi>and are not afraid to speake evill of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities:</hi> of whom S. <hi>Jude</hi> relates,<note place="margin">Jude 16.</note> that they were <hi>murmurers, complainers, walkers after their owne lusts, and that their mouth speaketh great swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling words.</hi> Would you a further cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of them? <hi>As naturall bruit beasts</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>made to be taken and destroyed,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.12.</note>
      <hi>they speake evill of the things they understand not, and shall utterly perish in their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi> These are the <hi>mockers</hi> of whom the Apostles have foretold us,<note place="margin">Jude 17.18.</note> that they should <hi>come in the last times,</hi> and being come; we must accordingly expect they should play their parts, and doe the will of him that sent them: And so they
<pb facs="3"/>
doe. The <hi>Church</hi> continually traducea, as if she were unsound in her intentions towards <hi>Christ;</hi> as if there were a day at hand, in which <hi>the Saints</hi> i. e. them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, must be tryed and sifted. The <hi>Prelates</hi> generally condemned, their cause un-heard, as factors for the Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call strumpet in S. <hi>John's Apocalypse,</hi> to make men drunken with the <hi>Cup of her abhominations.</hi> And as for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour <hi>Clergie,</hi> which know no better sacrifice then obedience, and willingly submitte themselves unto the just com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their <hi>Superiors,</hi> what are they but the common markes whereat each fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Malecontent</hi> doth shoot out his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, even bitter words.</hi> Nor hath the supreame Majesty, the Lords <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed</hi> escaped so cleere,<note place="margin">Jude 15.</note> but that they also have had part of those <hi>hard spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
which these <hi>ungodly sinners have spoken against them,</hi> in Saint <hi>Judes</hi> language. <hi>Antonij epistolae, Bruti{que} conciones, falsa quidem in</hi> Augustum <hi>probra, sed multa, cum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbitate habent,</hi> as he in <hi>Tacitus.</hi> No times more full of odious <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> no Pamphlets more applauded, nor more deerely bought; then such as doe most deeply wound those powers, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to which the Lord hath made us subject. <hi>Egregiam vero laudem, et spolia ampla.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Not to goe higher then the Reigne of our now dread Soveraigne, how have both Church and State beene exercised by those factious Spirits, <hi>Layton,</hi> and <hi>Prynne,</hi> and <hi>Bastwick,</hi> the <hi>Triumviri</hi>▪ with <hi>H. Burton</hi> the <hi>Dictator,</hi> what noise and clamours have they raised;
<pb facs="4"/>
what odious scandalls have they fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on their Reverend Mother? what jealousies &amp; feares (that I say no worse) have they seditiously infused into peoples mindes? And thereby turned those wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons on their Mothers Children, which might have beene employed more fitly on the common Enemie.</p>
   <p>But when those of the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> had received their judgement, <hi>Layton</hi> and <hi>Prynne</hi> in the <hi>Starre-chamber,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bastwick</hi> in the <hi>high Commission,</hi> the greatest comfort of the cause, did seeme to be intrusted to <hi>Dictator Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>: <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, a man in whom the Element of fire had the most predominancie, which made that which is <hi>zeale</hi> in others, to be in him a <hi>zealous furie.</hi> The rather since he had deceived himselfe in his expectations, and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb facs="4"/>
down those hopes, he could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest. That which hath heretofore made so many <hi>Hereticks,</hi> occasioned his first dislike of the holy <hi>Hierarchy.</hi> When once <hi>Aerius</hi> lost his hopes of being made a Bishop, as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> tells us;<note place="margin">De hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. c. 23.</note> he set on foot this peevish doctrine, <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ab Episcopo nulla ratione debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re discerni,</hi> that by no meanes there was a difference to be made, betweene <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Bishops.</hi> And that once broached, there followed next, <hi>non celebranda esse jejunia statuta, sed cum quisque voluerit jejunandum?</hi> that no set fasts were to be kept, but every man might fast when he would himselfe. This was the very Case of our Grand <hi>Dictator.</hi> He had beene a servant in the Closet to His Sacred Majestie, then <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi>: and questionlesse being in the
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Ascendent,</hi> he thought to <hi>Culminate.</hi> But when he saw those hopes had failed him, and that by reason of his violent and factious carriage, he was commanded to depart the Court, he thought it then high time to <hi>Court</hi> the people; that he might get in the hundreds, what he lost in the Countie. This pincheth him it seemes, to this very day; and he is so ingenious, (which I wonder at) as to let us know it. For in the Epistle to His Majestie before his Sermon (if at the least a ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and seditious declamation may be called a Sermon) he stiles himselfe His <hi>Majesties old and faithfull servant:</hi> and in the other to His Majestie before the <hi>Apologie</hi> he bemoanes himselfe, as an <hi>old out-cast Courtier, worne out of all favour and friends there. Hinc illae lachrymae;</hi> Hence the opinion of
<pb facs="5"/>
these quarrells. Here he declares most plainly where his griefe doth lye; what made him first flie out, and bend his thoughts, to foster and foment a faction: Such is the humour of most men, whom the <hi>Court casts out;</hi> that they doe labour what they can, to <hi>out-cast the Court.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Being thus entred and ingaged, hee found it necessary to acquaint himselfe with such as were affected like himselfe, and in their severall professions might best aide and helpe him: this made him picke out Master <hi>Prynne,</hi> an <hi>utter Barrister of Lincolns Inne,</hi> for his <hi>learned Counsaile: Layton</hi> and <hi>Bast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke,</hi> two that had the name of Doctors, to be <hi>Physitians</hi> to his person: His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors finding by some <hi>Symptomes,</hi> which they had observed, that he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="6"/>
fretfull, and full of Choller, perswaded with him, either by preaching, or by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to vent that humour: which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for want of vent, would soone burne him up: his <hi>learned Counsaile</hi> stan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding by, and promising that whatsoever he should write or say, hee would finde <hi>Law</hi> for it. On this encouragement he beganne to cast abroad his wilde-fire, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring nothing more than <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
to raise combustions in the state: and like <hi>Erostratus</hi> of old, seeing hee could grow famous by no other meanes, to burn downe the <hi>Temple.</hi> The <hi>Pulpit,</hi> first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected onely for <hi>preaching of the word of God,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cann. 83.</note> was by him made a Sanctuary, or privileged place, from whence to raile against the times, to cry downe all the orders of holy Church, and to distract the people with needlesse controversies, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
<pb facs="6"/>
of his Maiesties <hi>Declaration,</hi> w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> he cared not for, or would interprete for his purpose: And had this happinesse withall, that whatsoever he said there, did instantly become <hi>Gods truth;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be <hi>suppressed</hi> by Prince, or Prelate. The <hi>Presse,</hi> which was devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at first for the advancement and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of learning; was by him made a meanes to disperse his <hi>pasquills,</hi> that they might flye abroad with the swifter wing, and poyson mens affections, whom he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw. And howsoever some of his unlicenced Babels, were guilty of sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tended to incense the Commons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King; yet, being dedicated to the Parliament, As himselfe relates it, P. <hi>45.</hi> he came off bravely, and brought his adversaries to a <hi>non-plus.</hi> Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate man, one of the sonnes, no question, of
<pb facs="7"/>
the young white henne; to whom, both Presse &amp; Pulpit prostitute themselves, and yet account it as an honour that hee hath abused them. Too fortunate indeed, had it so beene carried. But not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this brave man of Armes, that dares encounter with <hi>Goliah,</hi> as hee boasts himselfe, received the foile, being first su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended for his preaching, and afterward imprisoned, and brought into the High Commission for his printing, as hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the story. p. <hi>52.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Oh, but by <hi>Gods</hi> great <hi>blessing,</hi> and the Kings good Lawes he was <hi>fetch't off those shelves</hi> (where else as he complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <hi>he had suffered shipwracke</hi>) by a Prohibition. P. <hi>53.</hi> for that hee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to his friend <hi>Mast. Prynne</hi> who both aduised him to it, &amp; had led the way; and having <hi>Layton's</hi> valour in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb facs="7"/>
thought it a farre more Noble suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, to lose one eare or two by sentence in the <hi>Starre-Chamber,</hi> then lend an eare to the censure of the <hi>High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> so fared it with his <hi>learned Counsaile,</hi> whose punishment might have perswaded him to more moderate courses, but that he had a strong desire to fill up the <hi>measure of his iniquities:</hi> and having beene a stickler in the same cause with him, conceived it most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the rule of fellowship, that he must suffer with him also.<note place="margin">Orat. pro M. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Tully</hi> indeed did so resolve it. <hi>Ut qui in eadem causa fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt, in eadem item essent fortuna:</hi> and certainly it was very fit that it should be so: nor was it possible to stay him being once resolved: only he wanted opportunity for the accomplishment of his designes, which the last Gun-powder day did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb facs="8"/>
unto him; that day being by him thought most proper for their execution, whom he had long before condemn'd, and meant to blow up now without helpe of Powder. In that more mercifull indeed, than <hi>Faux</hi> or <hi>Catisby</hi>; they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing to blow up the three estates toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he but at once. The place desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for this dispatch, that which he had so long abused, the <hi>Pulpit;</hi> the way of brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it about, that which hath alwaies ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his turne on the like occasions, a <hi>sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Sermon</hi>: wherein he had drawn up together, what ever spirit of malice he had found dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>rsed in al or any of those scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and pestilent <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> which had bin published to the world since <hi>Martins</hi> time, of purpose to defame the Clergy, and inflame the people; his own store being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it: Nor did he thinke it was enough
<pb facs="8"/>
thus to disgorge his stomacke, of purpose to excite his audience against their superiors, and startle them with dreadfull feares, as if hoth <hi>tyranny</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> were likely in short time to be thrust upon them: that was an undertaking fit for private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whose gifts might be confined to one place or <hi>Parish</hi>: For his part, he was now the generall <hi>Superintendent</hi> of all the Churches, the forlorne hope, the <hi>Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell perdue</hi> of the whole brother-hood: and therefore the most choyce and materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all poynts of the Declamation, (like the <hi>Enclyclicall</hi> Epistles of the elder times) must briefely be summed up, and scattered all abroad the Kingdome, as <hi>Newes from Ipswich</hi>: Nay, lest one title of his word should fall to ground, the <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> presently must become a Libell,<note place="margin">Ep. to the King.</note> and was by him thought fit <hi>to have been
<pb facs="9"/>
printed</hi> (as soone as spoken) <hi>for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall god</hi> (as he assures us) <hi>of all his Majesties loving Subjects through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdome:</hi> and printed at the last it was, and with a monstrous impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence dedicated to his Maiesty, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the same given forth, (as he saith himselfe) in hope that it might come at last to his Maiesties hands.</p>
   <p>Two things there were especially which did embolden him thus to preach and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish his owne personall quarrells, as the <hi>truth of God</hi>: First an opinion of some <hi>extraordinary calling</hi> from above, the same perhaps that <hi>Hacket</hi> was possessed with in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reigne: This he avoweth in his Epistle to the King.
<q>I heartily thanke my Lord Jesus Christ, who hath accounted mee faithful, &amp; called me forth to stand
<pb facs="9"/>
in his case, and to witnesse it before the World, by publishing my said Sermons in Print, &amp;c.</q>
And in that directed to the <hi>true-hearted Nobility,</hi> where he speaks more plainly
<q>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am one of the watch-men of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> (though the meanest) yet one that hath obtained mercy to bee faithful. Nor have I inconsiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or rashly rushed upon this businesse, but have been by a strong hand drawn into it. Yea my Lords, know assuredly that Christ himselfe my great Lord &amp; Master, hath called me forth, to be a publike witnesse of this great cause, who will certainly maintaine both it and me, against all the Adversaries of God and the King.</q>
The second was a confidence, that no man durst to
<pb facs="10"/>
question so great a <hi>prophet,</hi> greater then which, was never raised up from the dead, to <hi>preach to Dives</hi> and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And this he lets us know in his <hi>Apologie, p. 7.</hi>
      <q>I never so much as once dreamed (<hi>saith he</hi>) that impiety and impudencie it selfe, in such a Christian state as this is, and under such a gratious Prince, durst ever thus publikely have called me in question, and that upon the open stage, &amp;c.</q>
No marvell if so strange a calling, seconded by so strong a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, spurred him bravely on; and made him lift up both his voice and hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst what ever <hi>is called God:</hi> and how know wee, but that in some of his spirituall raptures, he might faine an hope, that his dread name should be as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the stories of succeeding times, as
<pb facs="10"/>
      <hi>Muntzers,</hi> or King <hi>John of Leidens.</hi> But these imaginations failed him too, as his Court-hopes did. For contrary to what he dreamt (such <hi>filthy dreamers, S. Jude</hi> speakes of) Ʋpon the Third of <hi>December</hi> next ensuing, a <hi>Pursuivant</hi> (as he tells the storie) served him with letters missive from the <hi>high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> to appeare before Doctor <hi>Duck</hi> at <hi>Cheswick,</hi> then and there to take his oath to answere to such Articles as were laid against him. Bold men, that durst lay hands upon a Prophet of such an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> calling, who if his power had been according to his spirit, would have commanded <hi>fire from heaven,</hi> to have burnt them all, or sent them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off with a <hi>noli me tangere.</hi> But caught or not caught, all was one. For though it was no time to move the Court
<pb facs="11"/>
for a Prohibition, being out of Terme, yet he bethought himselfe of another way to elude his Judges: and that was by a strange <hi>Appeale,</hi> being neither <hi>a grava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> nor <hi>a sententia,</hi> to decline that Court; and put the cause immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Majesties hands, where he might be, he thought, both a <hi>defendant</hi> and <hi>complainant,</hi> as he saith himselfe. <hi>p. 1.</hi> of the <hi>Apologie.</hi> A fine invention doubtlesse, but more sine then fortunate. For on a new Contempt, as himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes us, he was suspended by the <hi>high-Commissioners,</hi> both from his <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> and <hi>Office,</hi> and the suspension pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished (as he now complaines) in his own Parish Church, to his intolerable disgrace and scandall. <hi>Indignum facinus.</hi> Therfore that all the World might know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="11"/>
and on what suspended, <hi>Lo a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> (so he saith) <hi>is laid upon him,</hi> as formerly to Preach, now to Print his Sermon (for Sermon he will have it called, whosoever saith nay.) And prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the last it was, as before was said, and therewithall was printed also an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie</hi> for the said <hi>Appeale,</hi> with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall addresses to the Kings most Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majestie, to <hi>all the true-hearted Nobilitie</hi> of His Majesties most hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Privie Counsell; and to the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Learned Judges</hi>: the Copies of them both being spread abroad, for the greater consolation of the Brethren, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, here and there dispersed, like <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> brethren in <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi> in the tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This is the substance of the storie, which I have here laid downe together
<pb facs="12"/>
by way of <hi>preface,</hi> that with lesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption I might ply the Argument presented to us, both in the <hi>Sermon</hi> and <hi>Apologie.</hi> For howsoever neither of them be considerable in regard of the Author, who since his being thrust out of the Court, hath beene an open and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed enemie of the Publicke Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet in relation to the Church and Rulers of it, whom he endeavoureth to expose to the common hatred; and next in reference to the people, whom he hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to possesse with false and sinister conceits of the present state; it hath beene thought convenient by <hi>authority,</hi> that an Answer should be made unto them. The preservation of Religion is a thing so Sacred, that we cannot prize it to the height: and therefore they that labour to preserve it, are of
<pb facs="12"/>
all men, the most to be esteemed and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. <hi>Proximus diis habetur, per quem deorum majestas vindicatur,</hi> as the Historian rightly noted. So that wee cannot blame poore men, if they are start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and affrighted at those scandalous ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which are diffused and spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, to make them think that Religion is in no small danger: or if they hold a Reverend esteeme of those, who seeme to them to have a principall care thereof, and the safety of it. Onely they are to be admonished, not to be too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in matters of so high a nature, till they are throughly certified of the trueth thereof: that they conceive not ill of the Church, their mother, upon the light and false reports of every male contented spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; or thinke them Champions of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who are indeed the bane, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbers
<pb facs="13"/>
of it: That Faction in the <hi>Church,</hi> which Mast. <hi>Burton,</hi> and his Copesmates, have so much laboured to promote: hath since the <hi>first</hi> beginning of it accused the Church of <hi>England</hi> of the selfe same <hi>crimes,</hi> whereof they now pronounce her guilty: nor haue they found any new matter wherewithall to <hi>charge</hi> her, than that which <hi>their</hi> fore-fathers had beene hammering on in the times before them: yet they <hi>cry</hi> out with no lesse violence but <hi>farre more</hi> malice, than <hi>their</hi> fathers did; and fill the minds of iealous and distrustfull people with doubts and <hi>feares</hi> of innovations, of and in the <hi>worship</hi> of God, &amp; the whole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Religion; as if the bankes were broken downe, and <hi>Popery</hi> were breaking in a maine upon us; onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they can no longer be permitted to
<pb facs="13"/>
violate all the orders of Gods Church, here by Law established. The <hi>Papists</hi> and these men, how different soever they may seeme to bee in other matters, have, as it were by joynt consent, agreed in this, to charge this Church with <hi>novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and innovations: the one especially in the poynts of Doctrine; the other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in matters of exteriour order, &amp; the service of God. But as we say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the one, that in the reformation of this Church, we introduced no <hi>novelties</hi> into the same, but onely laboured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce her to that estate and quality, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in she was in her originall beauty, and the Primitive times: so may we say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other, that all those <hi>Innovations</hi> which they have charged upon the Church in their scandalous Pamphlets, are but a restitution of those ancient
<pb facs="14"/>
orders, which were established heere at that Reformation. This that the world might see, and see how scandalously and seditiously they traduce the Church; I was <hi>commanded</hi> by <hi>authority</hi> to returne an Answer to all the challenges and charges, in the said two <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Apology</hi> of Master <hi>Burton.</hi> For being it was the leading Libell, in respect of time, (the principall matters in the <hi>Newes from Ipswich,</hi> being bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from Master <hi>Burtons</hi> Sermon) and that those many which have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are but a repetition of, and a dilating on those poynts which are there contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: it was conceived, that bee being answered, the rest would perish of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. On this <hi>command</hi> I set my selfe unto the Work; and though I knew no credit could bee gotten from such an
<pb facs="14"/>
Adversary, <hi>Vbi &amp; vincere inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um est, &amp; atteri sordidum;</hi> and that there are a sort of men, <hi>who hate to be reformed</hi> in the Psalmists Language: yet being so commanded, I obeyed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, &amp; cannot but account it an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall honour to mee, to bee <hi>commanded</hi> any thing in the <hi>Churches</hi> service. Besides J could not but be grieved, to see my dearest Mother traduced so fowly in things whereof I knew her guiltlesse; and it had argued in mee a great want of Piety, not to have undertaken her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence herein, being called unto it. From which two great and grievous crimes, defect of piety, and true affection to the Church our mother; and disobedience to the commands and orders of the higher powers; no lesse than from the <hi>Plague and Pestilence, good Lord deliver
<pb facs="15"/>
us.</hi> Having thus rendred an account, both of the reasons why the <hi>Sermon</hi> and <hi>Apology</hi> of Master <hi>Burton,</hi> have been thought worthy of an Answer; and why, for my part, J have undertaken a Reply unto him: I must now settle close unto the businesse, beginning first with the <hi>Apology,</hi> so farre forth as it justifieth his said <hi>Appeale;</hi> and leaving those particulars, which he doth charge upon the <hi>Prelates,</hi> to be considered of more fully in due place and time.</p>
