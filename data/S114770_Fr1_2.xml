      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing heretofore (Right Reuerend) preaehed this Sermon at your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships appointment, and since enlarged it (by your aduice) with some necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie additions; I haue now also accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your directions, and by <hi>publike authoritie</hi> committed it to the presse, but not without your Lordships name; entreating you to vndertake the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of it, which had not <hi>beene,</hi> much lesse <hi>beene prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,</hi> if it had not receiued encouragement, and life from you. And I the more willingly publish it vnder your name, because it is <hi>a doctrine of the ancient, primitiue, and Apostolicke Church,</hi> whereof you haue beene a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant defender for many yeares; I doubt not therefore, but you will be now as readie and willing to auouch, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this holy and authenticke doctrine, as you were at first to enioyne the Text.
