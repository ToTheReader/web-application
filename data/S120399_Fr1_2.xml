   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing in this last
and most dead age
of the world (most
noble Ladie) there
be not a few, liuing not onely
vnder the blinding darknesse
and corrupting superstition of
abhominable Poperie: but also
vnder the shining Lanterne of
that sauing Gospell, which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb facs="3"/>
men directly towards that
bright morning Starre Christ
Iesus, blessed for euermore,
who holding this earth for
their home do neuer dreame
that they must be remoued frō
it: &amp; so who cannot be moued
so much as to begin to thinke
vpon another habitation; but
passe by to fit themselues for
it. Notwithstanding that none<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparing
sword of death killing
daily, without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
men of all rankes, in euery
place may sensibly cleare vnto
them the truth of that golden
sentence:<note place="margin">Heb 13. 14.</note>
      <hi>Here we haue no conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
citie.</hi> I the meanest in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
my Lord and Maister
hath imployed about the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="3"/>
of his tabernacle, longing
now to be dissolued and to be
with him whom my soule lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth;
haue out of the affection
which I carrie to all such as call
vpon his name, bene bold (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercomming
at length manie
difficulties) to offer these few
lines vnto the view of others;
that if it were possible some one
simple soule or two might be
moued by them (God being
happily with them) to loose
their affections from things
here beneath, and to set them
on things which are aboue. I
haue dedicated them vnto
your Honor whom God hath
so happily weaned from the
deceitfull milke of all things
<pb facs="4"/>
earthly, and so graciously mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
vnto his blessed Sonne;
that now your Honor can wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
account of nothing but in so
far as it leadeth vnto him, who
out of loue gaue himselfe for
you. Accept these lines Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
as a testimonie of that
loue &amp; reuerence which I must
carrie to that speciall grace of
God bestowed happily vpon
you, and vpon your religious
worthy Lord, set among many
yong Noble men, and shining
as a most bright light aboue so
many, if pietie, prudence, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
may make a yong Lord
shine. For the continuance and
encrease whereof, I shall neuer
<pb facs="4"/>
ceasse to put vp my simple
prayers vnto that God who is
readie to heare all men, who
call to him in truth, and able to
keepe your Honor with your
truly honorable Lord vnto his
euerlasting kingdome.</p>
