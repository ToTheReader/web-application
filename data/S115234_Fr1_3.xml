   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough, right courteous Reader, my former writings haue not so imbouldned me, as that I should againe aduenture to bring my selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so miserable a punishment, as the third time to indure the presse: yet choosing rather to dy, then not to manifest my loue vnto an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deceased Earle, I haue, out of the affectiō of an honest mind, desired to set before your eyes the fame of honor, in his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph riding: and doe hope, that for his sake, whose liuing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues I labour to commende, this worke of mine shall bring it selfe into your kinde acceptance. And as you desire that the plants of honor, now established, shoulde florish with a glorious dignity, doe not choose out any one particular, whose fame and prayse you will desire to follow, with the generality of a popular estimation: nor inuolue the person of a noble man in the aye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie cloudes of your intemperate <hi>Aue:</hi> least the honour, which you most desire to preserue, bee vntimely poysoned by your breath: of which euent, this after following briefe description contaynes a mournefull spectacle. Reade therefore with re▪ spectiue diligence, and haue greate regarde, you do no iniurie, by setting any imposition in his wrong place: which you shall directly doe, if you beare my wordes against any, which doe now continue in place of honour, honorablye deseruing: for vnto them the Authour doth ascribe all honourable estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus the good opinion of eache well affected reader he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth, whose hearte preferreth theyr content before his owne, whose life is readie in a souldiers place, vnto the last article of death, to manifest the vnfayned loue he beareth vnto his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries publick benefite. <hi>Vale.</hi>
