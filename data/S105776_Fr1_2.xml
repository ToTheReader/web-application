VVherfore (O grafte of noble stocke) hauing the like desire (if so I might say) as these haue had to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, my desire and not my skill, my good vvill and not my penne is to be accepted, as the simple Raddish roote vvrapped in a peece of greene Sarcenet vvas better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted at the Prince his handes, than vvas a goodly fayre Horse gorgeously trapped giuen him of his marchaunt, for that in deede he knevv their vvilles vvere not alike: the

Thus preacing (more boldly than vvisely) vpō your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours curtesie, I haue brought vnto your Lordshippe a handfull of fragrant floures (though not gathered in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donis</hi> garden). the chiefe vvhereof are Primeroses and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettes.

but vvhy seeme I (vvho as yet neuer receyued one poynt of discourtesie of any veneriall Dame) to display vvith penne and inke vpō the imbecillitie of their natures? God graunt (say I) <hi>Euripides</hi> may vvell vvithstand their boyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous blasts, vvho in his Tragedie intituled <hi>Medea,</hi> affirmeth that vvomens vvittes are vnapte to goodnesse, but very vvell inclined to vnhappinesse, bicause (sayde he) vvomen are creatures vnperfect, and vvhere perfectiō is not, there can nothing rest that is good. It seemeth the nebbe of my penne is long, and that I lesse do feare the stubbing therof. Such surmises (beleue me) assent to veritie, my yōg yeres say, I speake not by experience, but rather by heare say: and vvhat of this? riper yeares &amp; mellovver vvittes knovv I fayne not herein, for many of them vnvvillingly haue the proofe thereof.

         </gap>ee kicketh not.</hi> I vvill not say but that Dame Nature hath played hir part in deuiding and distributing hir gifts equally, as vvell to the one as to the other. For vve see, as vve haue <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Mercurie</hi> for Goddes, so <hi>Pallas</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerua</hi> for Goddesses of vvisdome as <hi>Mars</hi> so <hi>Bellona</hi> for vvar: as <hi>Cupide</hi> so <hi>Venus</hi> for loue: as <hi>Pan</hi> so <hi>Ceres</hi> for inuention of husbandrie: yea, as <hi>Morpheus</hi> so <hi>Murcas</hi> for sleepe. Thus (to be shorte) God hath appointed the pleasure of vvomen to conteruayle the toyle of man. Neither are the deedes of men more valiant than the mindes of vvomē, vvhose cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage abateth no not vvith the fiercenesse of Tygres, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by the vviues and matrones of <hi>Persia,</hi> vvho thorovv their valiant hartes, noble courage and impudencie, being ashamed of the flight of their husbandes, prouoked them

to returne againe vnto battel, and not onely to ouercome them of vvhome sometimes not onely they, but <hi>Cyrus</hi> him selfe stood in dread, but also in the same battell to take king <hi>Astyages</hi> prisoner. Moreouer, vvho hath not redde of the valiantnesse of Queene <hi>Thomyris?</hi> vvho hearing of the death of hir onely sonne, began not to reuenge the same vvith teares, sobbes, sighes, and pensiuenesse, as vvomen vse to do (<hi>Tullie</hi> testifying the same in his seconde boke of <hi>Tusculanes questions,</hi> vvho inferring vpon this proposition <hi>De tolerando dolore,</hi> afirmeth that <hi>Fletus muliebr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Also vvho knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that the <hi>Amazones</hi> ruled their realme betvveene themselues of a long time vvithout the ayde of any man, cutting off their right dugges for hindring the casting of their dartes, vvherof they tooke this name <hi>Amazones</hi> (that is) vvanting their right dugges? But softe here I checke, least some sticke not to say behinde my backe, a blasing starre vvil shoote.

But yet vvhat so euer they say, the blinde man may see in this glasse, vvhat apishe vvittes vvomen haue to inuestigate by interrogatiue similitudes the perfect mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the sure grounde of their louers harte: and those vvhiche haue their cleare sight to looke stedfastly herein, shall see perchaunce an Ape vvhipped, vvhich somvvhat may delight him. VVherevpon certen yong Gentlemen and those of my professed friendes (vvell vievving this vvorke) requested me earnestly to haue intituled it <hi>A nettle for an Ape,</hi> but yet (being somvvhat vvedded as most fooles are) to mine ovvne opinion, vvho vvould hardly forgoe their bable for the Tovver of London) I thought it good (somvvhat to stop a zoilous mouth) to sette a more clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name vpon it, that is, <hi>Golden Aphroditis.</hi> For if the other had stoode, vvho most had bene bitten herevvith perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture vvould haue sought all the meanes they could to haue turned this vvhippe for mine ovvne tale. But stay here a little, I loue not to be coūted a ranger, least thorovv my appearing aboue the vvater, I seeme to prognosticate thereby (as doth the Dolphin) that some storme or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest approcheth at hande. I trust though my penne dothe seeme to paint at large, yet not to lauishe. For vvhereas it seemeth to blase or painte the incineration of Veneriall dames and ruffling Nymphes, it proceedeth not of any spite, malice, hatred, melancholy, or euil vvill that I beare vnto the chaste Matrones, or vnto any one that may iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chalenge vnto themselues one little sparke of the spice thereof. Therefore vvho are vvilling to vnderstande, I

vvishe them to shunne the fountaine <hi>Chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

If any one see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be touched herevvith to the quicke, let them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde their <hi>Quare,</hi> and I vvill alvvaies be at hande <hi>Reddere rationem</hi> therevnto. Yet on vvhome so euer it chaunceth to sounde forth this interrogation (vvhat outvvard coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce so euer she beare) yet can it not be sounded, but as it vvere <hi>Tragico boatu,</hi> therefore vvho listeth so to do, to ayde them in their enterprise, I thinke it best they cal vpō the dolefull Muse <hi>Melp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p>For this I dare auouch, that oftentimes vyho seemeth most of al to blaze their chastitie vvith the Tergate of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusa,</hi> they play more legerdemaynes vnder this cleane kind of conueyance, or at the least as many, as do those vvho neuer vvoore the necklace of Iasper, neither knevve so much as the cheyne of Diamantes and Topazes, vvhiche are counted the instrumentes of chastitie.
