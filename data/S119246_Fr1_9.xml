   <l>And where doth knowledge fauour finde, but where some vertues budde.</l>
   <l>Hir fountaine runnes with gushing streames, and flowes like <hi>Nilus</hi> floudde.</l>
   <l>Hir foes are frowarde minded men, whose blindnes cannot see,</l>
   <l>The blasinge beames and skilfull artes, of those that learned bee.</l>

   <l>An other king whose greedye minde, like glutton gapte for goulde,</l>
   <l>To make good scholes and scholers both, great treasure giue hee woulde.</l>
   <l>To euerye maister that did teache, lo howe a sparinge hande</l>
   <l>Did flinge forth fruite, in hope thereby, to frame a learned lande.</l>
   <l>A kinge whose conquest claymde renowne, for one bare worke did yeilde,</l>
