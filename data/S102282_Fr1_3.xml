   <head type="sub">AND To the most vertuous and godlie <hi>minded Ladie, the Ladie</hi> ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH his wife, long life, and happie daies.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OT VNADVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedlie (Right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) but vpon singular circumspection did the ancient Greekes call Hercules by the name of Musagetes. It is also recorded, as a thing memorable, that Fuluius, Nobilior, at the great spoiles of Ambratia, preserued harmeles and vndamnified the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the nine Muses, and conueieng them into Hercules Temple, kept them there verie carefullie.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>Now (right worshipfull) vpon what consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration those worthie Seniours did this, I scarselie vnderstand, vnlesse this might be the reason, because they perceiued and sawe, that betweene the affaires of learning, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploites of valiantnes, there is a certaine inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of dutifulnes, and a necessarie kinde of seruice interchangeablie required.</p>
   <p>For they (wiselie no doubt) foresawe, and preciselie noted this as a warranted principle, that the liberall sciences stood no lesse in neede of the fauorable patronage of Great men for their supportation and maintenance: than the strategemes and noble actes of Great men, of the liberall sciences, for the reuiuing of their renowme, and the continuing of their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
   <p>For Bookes are dedicated vnto such as be of Worship and Honour, that vnder their tutele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and protection, as vnder the couert of Mineruas shield, they might lodge in safetie, and be sufficientlie defended against the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous teeth of malicious mouthes: and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable vertues and valiant actes of woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Gentlemen, are registred and sealed vp in the monuments of the Muses, that by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant vtterance, and perpetuall speech, they might be exempted and set free from the enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous shot of consuming time.</p>
   <p>Plinie presented his naturall Histories vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Vespasian: Lucane his historicall poētrie
<pb facs="3"/>
vnto Nero: Oppian his golden Booke of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes vnto Antonine: and Iulius Pollux his volume of the names and termes of things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Commodus: of whome they were so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, that they do at this instant, and shall for euer heereafter, remaine euen to the end of the last generation.</p>
   <p>The example of which aged writers, and the vsuall manner of our moderne Polygraphers, both strangers-borne, &amp; home-bread, as heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore I haue bene induced, so presentlie I am persuaded to folowe, for two alowable reasons.</p>
   <p>First, because the hypothesis or argument of this Booke, is generallie appliable to euerie pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate person, and will (I hope) requite the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell of the vnderstanding Reader, with reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable profit and aduantage.</p>
   <p>Secondlie, for that your Worship hath the common name and report to be indued with sundrie singular gifts of minde, as vtterance of foraigne tongues, varietie of knowledge in the Artes of greatest difficultie, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in affaires of policie: beside the gifts of bodie and fortune, which if I might deseruedlie decipher (though I spake the truth, yet should I incurre suspicion of Gnatonisme) time would first faile me, before I could make an end.</p>
   <p>But aboue all, (which is the foundation of my hope and confidence) for that your Worship is so noblie minded, as with rare courtesie to fauour and incline vnto such as professe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb facs="4"/>
learned: or not professing, are so reputed: or not reputed, appeare so to be, by some extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secall testimonie exhibited to the open world.</p>
   <p>But desirous to knit vp that breeflie, which, were it not for the abusing of your Woorship with vanitie of words, would be written at large, I beseech you fauourablie to accept this my trauell, being a mixt treatise, partlie theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall, and partlie morall, and to vouchsafe it your Woorships protection.</p>
   <p>Which I craue so much the more instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, because the patronage of such, so worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, so learned, so deuout, and studious, will be meanes to prefer this booke, and to bring it the more in vse and exercise, being (to speake alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricallie) a Ship of safegard, wherein euerie Christian, high and lowe, rich and poore, yong and old, may saile through all seas and streights of this troublesome and wicked world, without running vpon the rocke of repentance, and come at last by a direct current, to the port of endles peace and happines, euen the kingdome of Heauen, whereof the Lord God make you, and all your Worships affinitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinitie partakers, for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Sonne Iesus Christ,</p>
   <closer>Amen.</closer>
