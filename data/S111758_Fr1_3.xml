      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, when I first penned this discourse, I intended it chiefly for the satisfaction of my priuate friends, but since that time haue beene perswaded to publish the same: And the rather, because of a disorderly Colony that are disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and most of them returned, to the great preiudice and dammage of him that set them forth; who as they were a staine to old <hi>England</hi> that bred them, in respect of their liues and manners amongst the <hi>Indians</hi>: So it is to be feared, will bee no lesse to <hi>New-England</hi> in their vile and clamorous reports, because shee would not foster them in their desired idle courses. I would not bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to thinke there were no wel-deseruing persons amongst them: for of mine owne knowledge it was a griefe to some that they were so yoaked; whose deserts as they were then sutable to their honest protestations, so I desire still may be, in respect of their iust and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
   <p>Peraduenture thou wilt rather maruell that I deale so plainely, then any way doubt of the truth of this my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, yea it may be tax me therewith, as seeming rather to discourage men, then any way to further so noble an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If any honest minde be discouraged, I am sorry,
<pb facs="5"/>
sure I am, I haue giuen no iust cause; and am so farre from being discouraged my selfe, as I purpose to returne forthwith. And for other light and vaine persons, if they stumble hereat I haue my desire, accounting it better for them and vs that they keepe where they are, as being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and vnable to performe so great a taske.</p>
   <p>Some faults haue escaped because I could not attend on the Presse, which I pray thee correct as thou findest, and I shall account it as a fauour vnto me.</p>
