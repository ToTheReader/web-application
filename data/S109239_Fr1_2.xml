      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He following, and voluntary Labours of my Friends, prefixt to my Booke, haue releiued me in much, whereat (without them) I should necessarilie haue touchd: Now, I will onely vse three or foure short, and needfull Notes, and so rest.</p>
   <p>First, if it be obiected, that what I publish is no true <hi>Poëme;</hi> in the strict Lawes of <hi>Time.</hi> I confesse it: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the want of a proper <hi>Chorus,</hi> whose Habite, and Moodes are such, and so difficult, as not any, whome I haue seene since the <hi>Auntients,</hi> (no not they who haue most presently affected Lawes) haue yet come in the way off. Nor is it needful, or almost possible, in these our Times, and to such Auditors, as commonly Things are presented, to obserue the ould state, and splendour of <hi>Drammatick Poëmes,</hi> with preseruation of any popular delight. But of this I shall take more seasonable cause to speake; in my Obseruations vpon <hi>Horace</hi> his <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Poetry,</hi> which (with the Text translated) I intend, shortly to publish. In the meane time, if in truth of Argument, dignity of Persons, grauity and height of Elocution, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and frequencie of Sentence, I haue discharg'd the other offices of a <hi>Tragick</hi> writer, let not the absence of these <hi>Formes</hi> be imputed to me, wherein I shall giue you occasio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> hereafter (and without my boast) to thinke I could b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ter prescribe, then omit the due vse, for want of a con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>enient knowledge.</p>
   <p>The next is least in some nice nostrill, the <hi>Quotations</hi> might sauour affected, I doe let you know, that I abhor
<pb facs="4"/> nothing more; and haue onely done it to shew my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity in the <hi>Story,</hi> and saue my selfe in those common Torturers, that bring all wit to the Rack: whose Noses are euer like Swine spoyling, and rooting vp the <hi>Muses</hi> Gard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ns, and their whole Bodies, like Moles, as blindly working vnder Earth to cast any, the least, hilles vpon <hi>Vertue.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Whereas, they are in <hi>Latine</hi> and the worke in <hi>English,</hi> it was presupposd, none but the Learned would take the paynes to conferre them, the Authors themselues being all in the learned <hi>Tongues,</hi> saue one, with whose English side I haue had little to doe▪ To which it may be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, since I haue quoted the Page, to name what Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I follow'd. <hi>Tacit. Lips.</hi> in 4<seg rend="sup">o</seg>. <hi>Antuerp. edit. 600. Dio. Folio. Hen. Step</hi> 92. For the rest, as <hi>Sueton. Seneca.</hi> &amp;c. the Chapter doth sufficiently direct, or the Edition is not varied.</p>
   <p>Lastly I would informe you, that this Booke, in all nū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is not the same with that which was acted on the publike Stage, wherein a second Pen had good share: in place of which I haue rather chosen, to put weaker (and no doubt lesse pleasing) of mine own, then to defraud so happy a <hi>Genius</hi> of his right, by my lothed vsurpation.</p>
   <p>Fare you well. And if you read farder of me, and like, I shall not be afraid of it though you praise me out.</p>
   <q>Neque enim mihi cornea fibra est.</q>
   <p>But that I should plant my felicity, in your generall saying <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Well,</hi> &amp;c. were a weaknesse which the better sort of you might worthily coutenme, if not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely hate me for.</p>
