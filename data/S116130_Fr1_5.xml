   <head>The Authors Preface to this Rejoinder.</head>
   <p>IT is no mastery to plucke a dead Lion by the beard. Any cowardlie curre dare doe it: even such as durst not come within a furlong, much lesse looke once in the face of a Lion, while he lived. Nor is it a thing unusuall, for men of little worth, to trample upon the ashes of Gods worthyes deceased. In this kinde one Can, a man hitherto of little note or name, (though the head, it seemeth, now of a Schisme) hath endeavoured to get and gain some better note and name to himselfe by trampling upon, and insulting over some of Gods servants of good name and note, but at rest now with the Lord.</p>
   <p>Among other of those, whome he hath undertaken thus to traduce, is that blessed servant of God M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. VVilliam Bradshaw; a man for his piety, patience, humility, modesty, peacable carriage, unblameable conversation, quicknesse of apprehension, maturity of judgement, cleernesse of resolution, plainenes, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and powerfulnesse in the worke of the ministerie, was much admired of those that knew him. and conversed with him while he lived, and hath left a sweete and savoury remembrance of him, since his decease, in the mindes, not of them alone, but of others also that have beene conversant in his workes.</p>
   <p>Now this hath this Can taken occasion to doe, pretending in way of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Schisme that he and his faction stand in, the refutation of, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unto, an Answere published by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Bradshaw, in his life time, (a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him now, not attempted or undertaken by any) to certain <hi>Reasons</hi> of <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Fr. Iohnson</hi> concerning that argument, Wherein how he hath demeaned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, shall hereafter appeare.</p>
   <p>To vindicate therefore both the trueth of God by him maintained, and the credite of this his servant unjustly appeached against the frivolous oppositions and false calumniations of this Can; (which he himselfe, were he living, had beene, not fittest onely, but best able of any that I know; to have performed) out of the entire affection &amp; reverent respect, that I bare to him while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, &amp; doe still deservedly to the memory of him now deceased, I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken this taske: though not intending to engage my selfe further in these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, wherein too much paper to little purpose hath beene wasted already, save as this my chiefe intendemet shall necessarily require.</p>
   <p>Now here before I come to examine M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Cans refutation of the worke it selfe; I can not but take notice of some personall aspersions cast by him upon the Author of it, to the end that those remooved, we may the more clearely,
<pb n="3" facs="6"/> without by-lets, proceede in the maine businesse.</p>
   <p>First therefore, by occasion of some speech of D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Ames, the publisher of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. booke, that <hi>it was not the Authors meaning to gather proofes,</hi> he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth occasion p. 210. to taxe him for <hi>not alledging of Scripture,</hi> and <hi>bringing proofe thence,</hi> for that he speakes: that which he oft repeateth afterwards againe and againe, as hereafter shall bee shewed.</p>
   <p>But had M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Can beene pleased but to reade, or to adde, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. very next words: <hi>but to point at the weakenesse of such as these men have gathered:</hi> he might have had a faire &amp; full answere to this his exceptiō. It was a sufficient ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. I<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. to shew that the proofes produced by him were impertinent, which might well bee performed without any further allegations.</p>
   <p>To this might be added, first, that the one moity of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. I<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. booke consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth of <hi>Reasons</hi> professedly drawn from <hi>humane testimonies;</hi> which needed not therefore, nor were indeed, by any such course to bee answered; but either by rejection of the witnesses authority; or by shewing, that his assertions make not for M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. I<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. purpose, or the proofe of his conclusion. And secondly, that in the other moity of <hi>Reasons</hi> pretended to be taken from <hi>Scripture,</hi> howsoever for the <hi>proposition</hi> indeed of his <hi>arguments,</hi> being either apparent &amp; undeniable, or lesse questionable at least, many Scriptures are packt together many times to litle purpose, as being either needlesly or incongruously alledged: yet the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,</hi> which is generally the more questionable part, being matter of fact also for the most part, is by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. I<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. himselfe very seldome backt with any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at all, save in that one place, p. 11. the Assumption of the second argument in the first Reason: where Scriptures, the trueth is, are mustered up, more then enough, but so palpablely abused, as hereafter we shall shew, that some of his owne followers have beene sometime ashamed of it.</p>
   <p>Nor can M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Can tax M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Bradshaw herein without censuring of himselfe; who throughout his whole intended refutation of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Bradshaw is very spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in this kinde; having very few proofes of Scripture for any, not any at all for many, yea for the most, points therein controverted: though for things not questioned, after his brother Iohnsons fashion, or matter of meere illustration, he paint his margine some time with them.</p>
   <p>Howbeit renewing his charge of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. with a brazen brow, he most falsly averreth, p, 217. that <hi>his proofs are allwaies beggarly I says, or Ifs, and may be soe.</hi> And that <hi>he doth not in all his writing either directly or by sound consequence from the Scriptures, confirme any one thing whereof he speaketh,</hi> &amp; p. 225. <hi>He delivers his opinion upon his owne word: &amp; if we wil not take that, we
<pb n="4" facs="7"/> must have nothing. For</hi> p. 235. <hi>He never brings either Scriptures, examples Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or humane testimonies, to confirme any one thing whereof he writes.</hi> And againe, abusing the name of God withall p. 239. <hi>The wisdome of God is marve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lously here to be seen, which suffred not this man to countenance his corrupt spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with any weight or shew of Argument,</hi> And yet again, p. 240. <hi>He hath not from the beginning to the end of his booke, brought one proofe from the word of God; to make good any one thing, whereof he speaketh, but, as if he were one of the illuminate Fathers of the Familist, delivereth his yea &amp; nay allwayes upon his owne bare word.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>All which Exceptions are no lesse fals then frivolous, &amp; frivolous then false, for may not Mr. B<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. discover M. I<seg rend="sup">s</seg> ignorance, unles he quote Scripture for it; as Mr. Can doth p. 257. 1. Tim. 1.7. &amp; Jude 10? nor detect the faultinesse of his Arguments, unles, as Mr. Can doth. p. 235. he quote Hierome for it, saying of some (if he say so at least, for M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Can credit is none of the best) that <hi>they have theire Arguments neither in moode nor figure,</hi> &amp;c. nor tax him in his owne tearms, unles he cite Salomon, prov. 26.5? nor referre to Scripture, unles he quote chapter &amp; verse; for example; to proove that the <hi>Scribes &amp; Pharisees</hi> were, <hi>not onely, as Mr. I<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. minceth it, a speciall sect among the Iewes, that pretended a more strict observation of the law then others; but joyned also many humane traditions &amp; wil-worships to the worship &amp; service of God;</hi> was it not sufficient for him to say as he doth, p. 28. <hi>They are said by Christ himselfe to make the commandements of God of none effect,</hi> &amp;c. unles forsooth he quot Math. 15.6.—9. a place that every one allmost wel enough knoweth, or to prove, that <hi>the Iewish Synagogues in Christ time were not free from all kinde of false worship, taking false worship in a large sense, for all such as failes either in matter or forme, more or lesse,</hi> to say as he doth, p. 70. that <hi>Scripture witnesseth the same,</hi> unles he muster up all those places, where our Saviour displayeth the erroneous doctrine &amp; practise of the chiefe and principall teachers of those times? or, was it not enough for him to say, concerning <hi>The Ministers maintainance,</hi> p 9. <hi>It is the wil of Christ, that the ministers of the Gospel should live by the gospel;</hi> unles he quote 1. Cor. 9.14. though he give you Paules very words? &amp; againe, p. 104. <hi>Christ hath set down no more in his Testament, then this in effect, that the Labourer is worthy of his hire: And that for the ministration of Spirituall things, the Churches, that enjoy theire Labours, ought to minister unto them of theire temporalls.</hi> And againe, p. 108. <hi>That our Churches fulfill the Testament of Christ, in giving theire temporall things for Spirituall, in giving hire to the
<pb n="5" facs="7"/> Labourers,</hi> unles withall he quote Math. 10.10. &amp; 1. Cor. 9.11. though he deliver the very words in expresse tearms of the one in the one place, &amp; the just &amp; ful summe &amp; substance of both of them in the other? Belike our Saviour, &amp; his Apostles never alleadged Scripture for ought that ever they taught, when either they named not the booke or cited not the particular psalme or chapter, that I say not, verse too, for any testimony thence produced. Neither yet relate I these M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. allegations, as acknowledging any necessity at all of allegation of Scripture in an Answere of this nature: which for the reasons before rendred was not needfull, nor could justly be required; but to shew this mans vanity and falshood, not regarding what he saith, though never so untrue, nor so easy to be evinced.</p>
   <p>For to passe by what he saith of <hi>no example</hi> brought by him, wherein the examples of Luther, Husse, Wicklif, &amp;c. alledged by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B. pag. 31. in answere to the 1. argument of the 2. Reason; directly give M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. C. the lie. And as for humane testimonys, which, also he requireth, to omit, that they convince not the conscience; a man may as wel alleadge Scripture to a professed Atheist; as humane testimonies to those of his faction. for what weight can any humane testimony have with them, who in the pride of theire hearts condemne all writers allmost of any note, as well ancient, as moderne (a few of theire owne faction onelie excepted) those blessed martyrs, that have suffered so many of them for Christs cause not exemted form this theire arrogant Censure; as either false ministers, or members of false Churches, &amp; such as were therefore to be separated from? And is not this a wise mans part, thincke wee then, to require testimonies in this cause, wherein he knoweth we are able to produce twenty, if not 100. for one: and when he knoweth, that if we should produce them, (suppose Cyprian &amp; Cornelius, against Novatus: Optatus &amp; Augustine against Donatus: D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Junius to the Separatists at Amsterdam: D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Ames against Robinson; M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Cartwright against Harrison; M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Gifford against Barrow &amp; Greenwood: Mr. Paget against Ainsworth, &amp;c.) we should be but laughed at by them for our labour; as alledging those against them, whom they condemne as well as they doe us? yea their unequall cariage in this kinde M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B. justly taxeth, p. 16. Answere to the fifth argument of the second Reason: that will presse us with opinions, as M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Can here doth, of some of our writers, when <hi>themselves refuse</hi> the whilest <hi>to be bound unto, what theire predecessors, Brown, Barrow, and Greenwood have held before them.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But whether M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> B. as he here chargeth him, never annex any reason for the proofe of ought he saith (though it belonged not to him, being defendant or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent,
<pb n="6" facs="8"/> but to the plaintiffe or accuser by course of Law, to the opponent by rule of dispute to proove) let this booke it selfe speake: wherein it will be found, that M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B. very seldome denies any proposition, but he giveth some reason or other of his deniall: which indeed, true it is, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Can seldome or never taketh notice of; but his usuall manner is in stead thereof, having framed answeres, arguments, &amp; inferences of his owne, (absurd ones, you may be sure, like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) to father them upon him; and then having shewed his skill in shooting at men of straw of his owne making, to triumph and shoute, as if he had hit and sped Maister Bradshaw.</p>
   <p>And this may suffice for the wiping away of this first calumney; the detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Maister Cans vanity &amp; untrueth therein uttered.</p>
   <p>In the next place, because Maister B<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. discovereth sometimes M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Iohnsons defaults in Logick; and speaketh somewhat quick now and then upon just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, but without such gall and bitternesse, as with these men is too usuall; Maister Can chargeth him, pag. 212. with <hi>intemperate speeches:</hi> but saith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that he waiveth <hi>the recitall of them▪</hi> or <hi>the repaying of them with the like: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, it is</hi> (he saith) <hi>no Christian mans part to render rebuke for rebuke;</hi> and he deemeth it <hi>a</hi> 1000. <hi>times better, to sustain even a Legion of reproches, then for a man by returning, though but one, to give cause of suspition, that evill hath got some part of conquest over him.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Where, for what is said concerning Maister I<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. Logick, and Maister B. tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, we shall consider of it, as occasion shall be hereafter.</p>
   <p>But for <hi>intemperate speeches,</hi> neither is the charge juste nor doth it well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeme him, who, as throughout his whole booke he doth so cary himselfe, that I I am verily perswaded, there is scarce any man that shall have the patience to reade it out, but taking notice how full it is fraught with vile, virulent, base, broade, scurrilous, unseemly and unsavoury language, he will easily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with me, if he be not a bird of his owne feather, that he never met with a more down-right railer. So in his dealing here with Maister B. though having before protested against such courses, yet he cannot forbeare to cast out, if not some bitter taunts, and satyricall squibs &amp; scofs, (which are so over rife here, that they may well seene to be but as words of course with him) yet some lavish language or other at least, almost in every page of his ensuing discourse: and that not returning the same onely, where he pretendeth some such given, but there jerking it out, where no shew or shadow of such is before affoarded ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Maister Iohnson or to the cause he maintaines.</p>
   <p>Among much other stuf of this kinde, let the Reader be pleased to take these
<pb n="7" facs="8"/> few passages for a tast; that he may see the mans modesty, &amp; how well he performeth what before he professed, pag. 215. <hi>No man could passe Maister B. in absurdnesse here.</hi> pag. 221. <hi>Any one may see by his worke, that he meant not to thy his conscience short: but would make a litle bolde with it for the present. and, so he might fetch over a sore blow upon us he cared not, though with every stroake he made wounds through the sides of his bretheren.</hi> Pag. 235. <hi>Hierome speaketh of some who have th ir Syllogismes and argumentations, not in moode and figure, but in theire heels: Maister B. is not much unlike those, for wanting all proofe to make good the points that he boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi mes, he layeth about him with his heeles.</hi> Pag. 229. <hi>I desire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to compare with this base stuf their former principles, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether there be not probable reasons to thinke, that he sinned here in fearefully against his knowledge and conscience.</hi> I bid. <hi>If he had not meant meere gulling and mocking of the world he would not have taught men to holde this thing, and that what they would, without any reason or ground.</hi> Pag 227. <hi>The boldenesse of this man is notorious; that he dares in this manner still daub up the vile things which his brethren pull downe with both hands.</hi> Pag. 223. <hi>I professe in all good conscience, I never saw to my remembrance such daubing in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists: and to say trueth it is a great deale worse.</hi> Pag. 245. <hi>If this be not unreasonable daubing, I know not what is.</hi> pag. 235. <hi>If the non-conformists had seene but halfe such rot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>en stuf in any Conformists writings, they would have cryed out and that justly, daubing, daubing.</hi> Pag. 223 <hi>If M. A. had not boasted of this mans booke, I would not have touched it: because I knew the bowells of it could not possibly be opened, but it would cause an ill savour to some, in regard it contains most vile and uncleane matter.</hi> Pag. 220. <hi>How much better had it beene, if this misshapen thing had had its mothers wombe for the grave or being brought out had been kept in some hole, or darke place, where it should never have seene any light, nor any mans eye should ever have looked upon it then to serve in this sort, as it doth, namely to strenghten the hands of the wicked, grieve the hearts of the righteous,
<pb n="8" facs="9"/> and to discover their owne vile hating and double dealing.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thus of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. &amp; his writing he pratles, &amp; railes upon him at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. For as for those ordinary flowers of his Rhetorick, that <hi>our minister, are bastardly ministers,</hi> and <hi>our ministery a bastard &amp; the childe of a whore,</hi> p. 219. <hi>our ministers the most of them, loitering idle bellied Epicures, and sensles ignorant Asses,</hi> p. 214. &amp; p. 248. <hi>our service idolatrous, our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Antichristian, our discipline divelish: a power taken every part of it from Antichrist &amp; the devil,</hi> p. 272. 220. 249. 256. these &amp; the like I let passe, because they are every where obvious, &amp; I doubt not but he deemeth his worke exceedingly graced with them; having to that purpose raked together a many of them from the writings of some intemperate spirits like himselfe; and added thereunto no small store of his owne invention: and they are indeed the principall ornaments wherewith his booke is throughout embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, among other particulars he chargeth him more specialy &amp; most spightfully, with <hi>much hypocrisy, in maintaining of points contrary to his owne judgement.</hi> And this the more to inforce he repeateth the charge thrice in one page, diduced to 3 heads, as 3. distinct enditements, though in effect speaking nothing but one &amp; the same thing. p. 217. for,</p>
   <p n="1">1. <hi>Although in the course of his life</hi> (saith he) <hi>he made shew to be a great enemy to the Bishops, &amp; their traditions; yet now against us he stands to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the vilest abominations in theire Churches.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="2">2. <hi>Such corruptions as the Non-conformists generaly have condemned, he basely here justifieth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="3">3. <hi>He sheweth greate hypocrisy in pleading for such evils, as some which knew him do wel know, that his judgement of them, at least of many of them, was otherwise.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And againe elswhere p. 230. To <hi>hypocrisy</hi> adding <hi>impudency:</hi> so that M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. hypocrisy, belike, is spun with no very fine thred, when it carieth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency with in the forehead.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>None of the non Conformists have more effectually condemned theire popish ceremonies, then this man▪ for he hath by many Arguments prooved, that the use of them is very sinful▪ notwithstanding behold his forehead, how in his writing here against us, he seeks by flattering speeches to justify the verie practise, wich he professeth in his writing against the Hierarchy to be unlawfull, idolatrous, Antichristian▪ we abhorre this Hypocrisy.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb n="9" facs="9"/>
   <p>In a charge of <hi>Heresie,</hi> saith Hierome, of <hi>hypocrisy,</hi> may I wel say,<note place="margin">Nol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This imputation therefore well deserved to be singled, and to be cleered by it selfe. The charge you have heard; take the defence along with it.</p>
   <p>First therefore, true it is indeed, that Maister B. <hi>pleades</hi> here for sundry things, that Maister Can and his schisme condemne as <hi>evils, the substance of our Liturgy, the trueth of our ministery, the lawfullnesse and warrantablenesse of joyning with our Church-assemblies,</hi> and the like, these be the <hi>evils</hi> that Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster B. <hi>pleads for,</hi> But that M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B. was ever of a contrarie judgement, in these or any of those t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>gs that he pleads for, neither can Maister Can proove, nor doth he offer once <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>prove; save by the report of some, <hi>who,</hi> he saith, <hi>knew him, and doe well know it so to bee</hi> Wherein he that chargeth Maister B. with much hypocrisy, doth evidently evince himselfe guilty of much want of charity, in faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning so foule an imputation upon so reverend and well-deserving a servant of Christ, upon others bare reportes: for how can hee know, that they knew M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. judgement therein to be such, but by their bare relations, onely? and why mentioneth he not in particular those <hi>many things,</hi> or some of them at least, concerning which these men (what ever they bee, if it bee not a meere figment of his owne brain) say, that he was of a clean contrary minde, to that that he hath here written. Such an accusation as this of such an one, ought to have been backt with better proofe, and specified at least in some few particulars: though some few would not suffice to make good the charge: but here is not any one produced of <hi>many.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="2">2. For Maister B<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. dissenting from some other non-conformists in some things, it is not to bee marveiled, if he should so doe, the non-conformists are men, I hope, subject to errour and ignorance, as well as others; and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, notwithstanding their joynt consent in nonconformitie, in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars differ in judgement, as from others, so among themselves. Yea as among theire Separatists there is much variety of opinion, Maister Robinson and his company dissenting from Maister Can, and his crew; Maister Iohnson and his, from Maister Ainsworth and his, after their parting, Maister Smith and his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from them both: So it is well known, that there is and hath beene no small diversity of judgement betweene our non-conformists among themselves; some condemning some rites but allowing others, and some condemning those also which those others allow; some esteeming the things simply evill, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="10" facs="10"/> some onely as inexpedient, and in regard of some consequences: some excepting against some passages in our Liturgy, which some other of them stick not at, and the like. And indeed considering the wants &amp; weakenesses that doe ordinarily attend mens apprehensions, and what variety of opinion by reason thereof men are subject unto, in such things as are not cleerely evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of themselves; for a multitude of men of divers parts, abilitys, dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and indowments, to concurre and agree all in every particular doubt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, question, or controversy, where a multitude of such is mooved, might justly be deemed, rather a conspiracy, then an uniformity of judgement. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard here of therefore, neither is Maister B. nor any non-conformist bound to hold and defend whatsoever some others of that side have supposed or maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, no more then the Separatists will be tyed on their par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap> the like. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit true it is indeed, that if Maister B. should, as Maiste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Can here chargeth him, justify any such course as <hi>the non-conformists have generally condemned for a corruption,</hi> Maister B. being one of that number himselfe, must of necessity contradict himselfe. But setting Maister B. himselfe apart; that in this worke of his, he hath endevoured to justify any one point or act, by all non-conformists befide himselfe censured for such; and much more, that he hath <hi>basely justified such corruptions,</hi> (more then one or two belike, though no one is here instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) as hath beene before said, is more then ever can bee prooved, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a notorious calumny on Maister Cans part.</p>
   <p n="3">3. True it is indeed, that Maister B. refused conformity to some rites &amp; ceremonies imposed upon, and practised usually in our Church assemblies; as esteeming in his judgement the use of them evill and unlawfull, (though not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them such tearms, that I any where finde in his writings, as maister Can here relateth) and had suffered, and did suffer still in some sort, at the very time when he writ this, yea even to his dying day, for his refusall of the same. And is it probable then, that he that suffered then for refusall of those things, &amp; was resolved still so to doe, should yet at the same time write in the defence of thē? Or, that he, that was of so tender a conscience in regard of them, should yet stand to maintaine things more vile and abominable then them, if ought at least in our Churches be more vile and abominable in Maister Cans eyes, then these are? But that Maister B. in this worke of his doth maintaine the use of any of those things as lawfull and warrantable, which in judgement he so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, (howsoever he defend the warrantablenesse of communicating with them that doe use them, in the holy things of God) the booke it selfe will shew it to bee a most shameles lye, and yet againe, though he had therein maintained
<pb n="11" facs="10"/> and justifyed some of them, yet would not that have served Maister Cans turne neither, to free him from guilt of so foule an offence, unles he could make good (for Maister Can will bee sure to lay his charge large enough, how scant soever his proofes are) that he hath therein maintained contrary to his owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>the vilest abominations</hi> (you have his owne tearmes) <hi>that are in our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> This over-reaching lash therefore of Maister Cans lavish tongue deserves to bee refuted with the lash of a whip rather, then with the dash of a pen.</p>
   <p>Fourthly he chargeth him, (therein playing fast and loose with us) and that again upon report, not with <hi>writing</hi> so now, as his former charge was, but with <hi>fathering an others worke, contrarie to his owne judgement, to the maintaining of those most vile abominations</hi> before spoken of. <hi>It is true,</hi> saith he, <hi>that report goes, and it is probable enough, that he was not the proper Author of it, but an other did it and got him to father it. Notwithstanding his evill is not the lesse, if he should suffer any one, as the Asse did Balaam, to ride upon him for to curse the Israel of God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For the better cleering of this, (which yet crosseth the former) it shall not be amisse to insert here a word or two, concerning the occasion of Maister B<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. both writing and publishing the worke, wee have now in hand.</p>
   <p>Maister B. sometime at the request of some friends was induced to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with one Maister Iackson, a man led aside by some Separatists, but yet professing a willingnesse to be informed of the trueth: at which conference myselfe also among others was present. This condescended unto, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Iackson conceiving that no better grounds could bee produced to justify and enforce a Separation, then those of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Iohnson, contained in his booke of <hi>Reasons,</hi> new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then come abroad, referred himselfe to them, and required liberty to presse them, and that answere might be given thereunto, or to what he might further produce in pursuite of them. This was agreed upon, and in part performed, in the presence of diverse others also of either side; &amp; the objections &amp; answeres set downe all in writing, subscribed to by either party. But after the first dayes conference, wherein the weakenesse and lamenesse of some of Maister Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Arguments were discovered, and some palbable abuses of Scriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him evidently evinced, Maister Iackson disswaded by some of that side, refused to have any further conference in such manner, and so the businesse brake of. Howbeit Maister B. considering maister Iohnsons booke was relyed upon, and having, by this occasion, in part detected and laied open the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof, he thought good to goe on in the survey of the whole; &amp; having propounded his paines therein taken to the perusall of others, he was incited
<pb n="12" facs="11"/> by them to make the worke more publick; which by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Ameses meanes was some good space of time after done.</p>
   <p>For the discourse it selfe, though his name bee not to it, (and how is he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged then to father an other mans childe, that doth not so farre agnize his own?) those that have beene versed in other of his workes, and acquainted with his methode and manner of writing, if they be not altogether strangers to that kinde of skill, whereby the writings of Authors are discerned whose they are▪ will easily descrie it io be his owne, and no others.</p>
   <p>As for M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Cans rhetoricall flourish of <hi>Balaam and his Asse.</hi> Balaams Asse was in some sort better then he, for it spake nothing but good reason: whereas he many times talkes as if he had neuer come, where Reason ruled or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not what it meant: that which if I make not evidently to appeare to any intelligent Reader, that hath perfect use of Reason, I will bee content, to take the asse from him to my selfe: and I will joyn issue with him herein, upon some of those passages in the wise <hi>quaeres</hi> propounded by him in examination of the 6 Argument of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Iohnsons first Reason pag. 226. And whether the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>cursing Gods people,</hi> lye more justly and deservedly upon M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B. or M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Can let any unpartiall man judge, that readeth the writings of either. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this kinde he &amp; his are worse not then Balaams asse, but then Balaam him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; for they doe that, that he never did nor durst doe.</p>
   <p>Fiftly, <hi>upon report,</hi> (as he speaketh; for M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Can you see, buildes all still upon reports) he chargeth M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B. for <hi>one that of all the Non-conformists, came nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to the Separation,</hi> pag. 227.</p>
   <p>Whereas indeed the direct contrary rather may with good probability bee avowed, that not any one of them was in likelyhood farther from the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e: that which appeared by his constant and earnest endevour, both to with holde, and to withdraw from it, such as were either upon tearms of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, or already entred thereinto: the same being also manifested, both by his sundry conferences by word of mouth with theire two greatest Rabbies, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Iohnson and M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Ainsworth, and with other forward ones among them, as well in prison, as elswhere; and by his writings, some published, as this against M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Iohnson, and some to be seene yet, though not published, against Smith, Elwise, Cliffon, and others of that faction. Yea so far, was he from any such Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Separation, as these men practise, that he conversed as inwardly &amp; entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with some of those that differed from him for matter of conformity both in judgement and practise, as he did with any of those that concurred with him therein. He had learned Christ better, then for difference of opinion in such
<pb n="13" facs="11"/> points, to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

      </gap>ismes and divisions, as their manner is, with all those that doe not in all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>ings concurre with them, and subscribe to what they say: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ncked so long together.</p>
   <p>And thus much for the personall imputations and aspersions, that this Can hath cast, and endevoured to fasten, on him, whose worke he hath here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to confute: dealing therein, as bad pleaders are wont to doe, who having undertaken the defence of some ill cause, leave the matter, and fall foule on the party, by traducing of him hoping to prejudice his cause, which they cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise well oppose.</p>
   <p>Concerning which practise, heare we M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Cans owne censure. <hi>This is</hi> (saith he, pag. 211. <hi>to be observed generally, that those that stand for bad causes doe after this sort still reproach their adversaries.</hi> And again, 227. <hi>there is a</hi>

   <p>For as for his charge upon M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. manner of writing, wherein he taxeth him as <hi>most absurd,</hi> pag. 215. and <hi>confused, not putting difference betweene things that are to be distinguished,</hi> pag. 236. <hi>Turning his tale so oft foreward &amp; back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that a man knoweth not how to follow, nor where to have him.</hi> pag. 214. &amp; 225. <hi>speaking non-sence,</hi> pag. 226. and <hi>arguing in such silly and childish words, as have in them neither rime nor Reason,</hi> pag. 229. <hi>by shifts and tricks putting quite by the matter in hand, and leaving things more obscure and darke then he found them,</hi> pag. 226. and 262. In discussing of the particulars it will easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, how far he is from such defaults as these are: it being indeed a principall ornament, that God, among many other his excellent vertues, had endowed him withall, that he had a singular faculty in clearing and extricating of points ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and intricate: and reducing each thing to his proper place. And for the acknowledgement of his rare and allmost unmatched dexterity in that kinde, I could produce, if need were, the letters of some of eminent note in foraine parts, wherein they give an ample and extraordinary testimony thereunto.<note place="margin">D.
