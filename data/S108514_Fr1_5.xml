   <head>TO THE MEMORIE OF THE THRICE WORTHY Gentleman, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. IOHN LEVETT deceased: and to the eternity of his <hi>well-taken-labour in this most</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and profitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and History of BEES.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two immortall enemies, which, like Butchers dogges (whose mouthes are ever bloudy) do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually besiege and assault everie good labour, and that is, Curiositie and Envie; the first striving to finde out knots in Rushes or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles beyond mans capacitie: the other devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and gnawing upon all vertuous Actions, till, with the poyson of her corrupt Nature, she have brought all wholsome Intents within the compasse of scandall; with these two enemies, if this excellent and well-taken-labour chance not to encounter, it may passe into the world with infinite applause, and well-liking of all men, being a worke so exact and compendiously done. So plaine and easie for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb facs="6"/>understanding, yet with all so succinct, deepe, and elaborate, that as a Flie may easily wade it, so an Elephant may with difficultie swimme in it, not that there are unresolved <hi>Enigmas</hi> or things fetcht beyond the clouds to adorne it, but because the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments being new, approved, and allyed both to truth and Reason, the collections so manifest, and not to be controlled, the corrections and reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the errours of others former publishings, so modestly handled, cleared, and adorned, and the whole worke so purged from all glosse or flourish of ayrie words, from the folly of amazing Inventions, and from the intricate windings, turnings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnings of a wilde braine, which many times carries the Reader into a new world farre beyond all his acquaintance; That here every good man and good Minde shall finde as much as he can expect, and yet no more then is sufficient. For mine owne part, I have had a singular affection, and an earnest desire in the pursuit of this knowledge, and was once a great Master of these creatures; neither have I spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bestow my pen in the advancement of the Art and knowledge of the Bee; yet not with that felicitie and happinesse which this Gentleman hath attained unto, to whom I cannot chuse but allow all
<pb facs="7"/>possible praise and estimation; confessing ingeniously that I have not read or seene any worke of this Nature more exact and compleat then this is. And howsoever others have, or may adde more words, more quaint devises, and more amazing <hi>Meanders,</hi> yet the substance of the Art, and the excellent things which are meet to inrich and adorne every good mans knowledge, cannot be better or more fully discussed: for here you shall know what the Bee is, his breeding and government, how to order him, house him, and maintaine him, how to remove him, purge him from injuries, and to preserue his health, of swarming, driving, hoysting, and destroying things superfluous. And lastly of their profits, and how those profits are to be disposed, and what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations are necessarie for the support and encrease of so usefull and delicate a commonwealth. And he that in this Art will looke beyond this, let him looke beyond the Moone, I will neither lend him mine eyes nor my commendations.</p>
