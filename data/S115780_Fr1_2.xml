<pb facs="3"/>
the olde and newe testament compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.<note place="margin">Deut. xiij Math. v.ij i.ii.miiij Isai. xxx</note> Theyr tongues and inuenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were agaynst the Lorde. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with dyd they prouoke the eyes of his maiestye to displeasure. Wherfor he visited thē by many fatherly correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and benefytes (lyke as in tymes paste the Israhelites) yf they from su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che theyr vngodly lyues woulde tour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne agayne to hym, to thintent, that it myght go well with them, But they woulde not sette theyr hertes that thei myght amende.<note place="margin">iiij. Re. xxv. Psal. ij.xxxiiij</note> Therfore hath he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Princes and Chiefe Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes of the Assyrians to come vpon them, theyr chosen forgoers, whiche cruelly with cheynes and bondes of mannes wisedome, and good intentes haue bounden &amp; taken them, and spoil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyng them of all Goddes ornamentes of the tempel of the cleare, pure wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of God, haue caryed them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towardes Babylon, in theyr la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes and doctryne of mannes tradici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where, for a great season thei haue serued heuely. In so much that they by reason of the strayght and harde ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyce
<pb facs="3"/>
of the same, were neuer able to serue the true goddes seruyce (althou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe at the laste of great necessyte they woulde gladly haue done) nor yet to know to lyue there after. For the wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter vaynes of the word of God, were stopped vp for thē with earth of mē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes lawes and tradiciōs Esay sayth.<note place="margin">Esa. lvi</note> Theyr wachemen and foregoers we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re all blynde, and knowe not the lawe of God, they are dombe dogges not beyng able to barke, nothynge regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge but mannes doynges, they are sleapye and sluggysshe, and the shame<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les dogges can neuer be satisfyed. The shepeherdes also themselues ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue had none vnderstandynge, so holye hath mannes good thynkynge decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them all. For all suche thynges had God often treathened vnto them before, in case they dyd tourne awaye from hys commaundementes, lyke as by Esay. I wyll geue them children,<note place="margin">Esa xxx</note> to be theyr princes, and the wyuysshe shall ruelle ouer them, he hadde, fyrst warned them for mennys dreames, whan he sayde, My people, Those
<pb facs="4"/>
which vphold thy cause and prayse thy therfore, they deceyue thy, beleue thē not. But for asmuche as they willin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely gaue thē selues into it he suffered them to decaye, to thintent that they myght learne to knowe hym by them selues, as Ezechiel sayth.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Ezechi. xxxiiij.</note>In such anguyshe haue they ackno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weleged them selues as lost shepe, of theyr shepeherdes (whiche haue fed them selues) seduced, haue ben sory, &amp; repented with all theyr hertes for theyr synnes, and haue called vnto God vnfaynedly for grace &amp; succour. The lawe of God was holly aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them, In so muche that they knewe it no more,<note place="margin">iiij. Re, xxij.</note> and toke it for inuē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted newes. Lyke as in the tyme of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia the good kynge at Ierusalem, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias the priest founde the boke of the lawe, in the howse of the Lorde, which had lyen there for a great season.</p>
   <p>When the same was reade before the Kyng, as for an olde antiquite, he rent hys clothes, and cōmaunded the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes to aske counsell of the Lorde tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Prophetes, for hym and the
<pb facs="4"/>
boke, for he feared God, because that his forefathers had not liued thereaf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, and founde fauoure before God, with thys answere. For as moche, as he had humbled hymselfe, feared, and weped before hym, woulde he be mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyfull vnto hym, and to the people.</p>
   <p>After that, dyd the kynge erecte al Goddes honour after the tenoure of the lawe, and made a couenaunt with God for hym selfe and the people to kepe the same from thensfurthe, &amp; the people consented therein. After that dyd he breake down, &amp; destroyed all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolles with al theyr appertenaunces, And god was with thē in al that they dide &amp; left vndone. God sende vs such lyke foregoers. Vvhen now the deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Christianite haue done penaunce in such bōdage the in Babylonysh cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiuite, &amp; cryed to god with al their her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes for delyueraunce, he hath immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly heard thē, &amp; brought again to ligh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te hys holy, cleare, pure lawe, worde &amp; doctryne, thorough meanes according to hys pleasure, And as we dayly see before oure eyes, namely, that such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryseth of a fewe &amp; despysed personnes
<pb facs="5"/>
as also in tymes paste in the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of the churche hath ben done,<note place="margin">i. Re. xiij i. Esd. ij Matth. xxij.

The lyght is come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne into the worlde, God graunte that oure foregoers loue no more the darkenesse, but followe the good kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge Iosia, than shalt, them as the shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdes, the people as the shepe gladly followe,<note place="margin">Ezechi. xxxiij</note> that the prophecye of Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el come not ouer them. Vvoo be vnto the shepeherdes that feede them selues the mylke haue ye eaten, with the wol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le haue ye clothed you, and that which was fatte, haue ye slayne, but my floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, haue ye not norysshed, the weake ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue ye not strengthned, the loste haue ye not brought agayne, but with cruel authorite haue ye rueled ouer them. me shepe haue ben scattered for so mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che as they ware without a shepeherd
<pb facs="5"/>
as truely as I lyue saith the Lord. For so moche as my shepe haue ben robbed &amp; deuoureth of the wylde beastes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they ware withoute shepeherde, for the shepeherdes haue not sought my flocke but thēselues, and haue not fed my shepe. I wyl requyre my floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of theyr handes, and make them to ceasse from feadynge my shepe any more, yea they shall feede them selues no more, and I wyl delyuer my flocke oute of theyr mouthes.</p>
   <p>To be a foregoer is an offyce,<note place="margin">i. tim. iiij</note> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunte, and no Lordeshyp whosoeuer diligently consydereth the same, wyll not couete to charge him selfe with it, nor yet to presse into it. Couetousnes worketh suche, whiche is a roote of all iniquytie. Lyke as loue, is a roote of al goodnes, as Paule sayth.<note place="margin">i. tim. vi. i.

   <p>In Apocalypse writteth S. Ihon thus.<note place="margin">Apoc. iij</note> Christe standeth euen nowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dore of oure hertes &amp; knocketh
<pb facs="6"/>
yf any man heare hys voyce, and opē the dore vnto him, vnto him wil he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre in, and suppe with hym.

Seke in the scripture, for she beareth witnesse of me. And I am the waye, the trueth, and the lyfe. No man cometh to the father, but by me. Item I am the dore: all they that haue entred any other waye,<note place="margin">Iohan. x</note> than by my, be theues and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers. He that entreth in by my shal besafe, and shall goo in and oute, and fynde pasture. The thefe cometh not into the fold, but to steale &amp; to destroy. I am come that they myght haue lyfe, and haue it more aboundantly.<note place="margin">Mat. xi</note> Item, come vnto me all ye that laboure and are ladē, and I shal refresshe you.

and ye shal fynde rest vnto your sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. For my yoke is easy &amp; my burthen is lyght. Of suche lyke sainges be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re and there innumerable many.</p>
   <p>Therfore lette vs ioyfully receyue and with greate diligence thankefully kepe the holy, pure, sincere worde of God, the sustenaūce of the soule, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the Lorde God agayne of newe, mercifully hath manifested vnto vs. For Christ saith,<note place="margin">Luce. xi.
