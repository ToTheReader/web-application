But such an ancient &amp; strong <hi>Charter</hi> hath Custome confirmed to <hi>This Printing age of ours,</hi> (by giuing men authoritie to make choice of what <hi>Patrons</hi> they like,) that some <hi>Writers</hi> do almost nothing contrary to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> custome, and some by vertue of that Priuiledge, dare doe any thing. I am neither of <hi>that first order,</hi> nor of <hi>this last.</hi> The one is too fondly-ceremonious, the other too impudently audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous I walk in the midst (so well as I can) betweene both: with some fruites that haue growne out of my <hi>Bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

If so, then let not a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or a Murderer be publikely arraigned, lest the one laying open to the world, how his plots were wouen to contriue a treason, or the other, what pollicies he was armed with, for <hi>the shedding of blood,</hi> the standers-by (that are honest) be drawn (by their rules) to run head-long into the same mischiefe: no, Our strong phisicke works otherwise. What more makes a man to loath that <hi>Mongrell Madnesse</hi> (that halfe English, halfe Dutch sinne) <hi>Drunkennesse:</hi> then to see a common <hi>Drunkard</hi> acting his <hi>Scaenes</hi> in the open streete? Is any <hi>Gamester</hi> so foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish to play with false <hi>Dice,</hi> when he is assured that al who are about him know him to be a <hi>Sworne Cheator?</hi> The letting ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>Uice</hi> blood in these seuerall <hi>Veines,</hi> which the <hi>Bel-man</hi> hath opend, cannot by any Iudicial rules of phisicke, endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Bodie of the Common-wealth, or make it feeble, but rather restore those parts to perfect strength, which by disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der haue ben diseased.</p>
   <p>Giue mee leaue to lead you by the hand into a <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> (where are none but <hi>Monsters,</hi> whose crueltie you need not feare because I teach the way to tame them: vgly they are in shape and diuelish in conditions: yet to behold them a far off, may delight you, and to know their quallities (if euer you should come neere them (may saue you from much danger.
