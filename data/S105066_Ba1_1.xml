   <p>IN many respects to be reuerenced by me. May it please your Worship to pardon my boldnesse in visiting you with this rude Epistle, to the end that I may shew my thankefulnesse towards you for your great and many benefits bestowed vpon me: As soone as God shal enable me to make a greater progresse in the Latine tongue, you may expect a longer; yea, perhaps a more elegant and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent Letter. In the interim I doubt not but your Worship (in regard of your Clemencie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me) will accept in good part these witnesses of a thankefull mind. The Almightie and all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull God preserue you long in health, that you may be (as you are) a grace and ornament to the Companie of Marchants, that you may attaine to high Honour here on earth, and most ample glorie hereafter in Heauen: <hi>Farewell.</hi>
