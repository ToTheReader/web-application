      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T IS A VSV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thing, whē men haue any worke to be published, to dedicate it vnto some worthy personage, like your selfe, vnder whose patronage it may be sheltered: But although this small volume be not originally my owne, onely the translation
<pb facs="4"/> thereof, yet I present it to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end vnto your worship; not so much to protect, which is a thing as easie as common, as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the matter therein contained; to wit, Faith, Hope, and Charity, as the principall foundation of christian Religion. They are three points which I doubt not but you (as many other) haue often heard of, &amp; therfore are not onelie well acquainted with them, but know how to put them in practise, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that measure of grace, wherewith God (the fountaine of all goodnesse) hath plentifullie endued you. Beseeching your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship not to mistake, for I present it not to instruct you, who (thanks be to God) are well knowne to be
<pb facs="4"/> a dailie exerciser of these ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and therefore haue now no need to learne: But; partly to refresh your memorie, to continue in such blessed practises, the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance wherein (not the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) shall bee crowned with an euerlasting reward, and partlie to manifest my loue and dutie. You may well maruaile at my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, in presenting so small a gift as is this Translation, vnto one that deserueth so much, but the matter being so heauenlie that I hope not onelie your selfe, if you vouchsafe the reading thereof, but many others of Gods children shall receaue comfort thereby. I presume you will not haue so much regard to the breuitie, as to the
<pb facs="5"/> excellencie of it. And, if I find that this my little labour shall prooue acceptable, I shall not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thinke it well bestowed, but be incouraged to goe on in greater of the same quallitie, and to doe your Worshippe any other seruice my best indeauours can extend vnto, so I humbly take my leaue, desiring the Almighty to graunt you in all felicity the scope and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your hearts faire desires.</p>
