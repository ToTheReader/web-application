   <head>TO ALL THAT HAVE <hi>Cause to love</hi> LONDON.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Lie not from <hi>Her,</hi> because she is <hi>falling sicke;</hi> but rather joyne your <hi>hearts in Prayer,</hi> &amp; your <hi>hands in Bounty to</hi> cheere her up. You <hi>love her,</hi> or at least have cause so to doe: for some of you have received <hi>Pleasures,</hi> some <hi>Profits,</hi> some <hi>Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> You have moreover a long time in her enjoy'd a <hi>secure Peace,</hi> that sweetned the other <hi>Benefits. Prague</hi> cannot boast it, nor many other <hi>Cities</hi> beyond the Seas: You walke in <hi>Scarlet,</hi> when others have waded in <hi>Bloud:</hi> You wore Weapons onely for Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when others were armed perforce: You have seene with <hi>Pleasure</hi> glorious <hi>Musters,</hi> when others have with <hi>horror</hi> felt the <hi>Swords furie.</hi> And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the peaceful <hi>Dove</hi> has a few sick feathers on her, will you leave her? Do not. In the last great Visitation I found and saw it, that <hi>want</hi> was a main fewel to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish that infectious flame: It were deep <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to
<pb facs="4"/> let her suffer so any more. Your faire Houses, rich Furniture, delicious Fare, and curious cloathing; yea your full content, and varietie of pleasure will cast it in your teeth, that <hi>London</hi> gaue yee all these. Stay then; you that are Rich, to helpe the Poore; and you that haue true skill in Physicke to helpe the sicke. But <hi>Mountebancks goe quack in the Country among the contemners of Learning:</hi> Though Death can doe enough without you, yet you save her reputation, in often taking her office from her. And O <hi>London,</hi> and you that <hi>love her;</hi> suffer not the stayne of vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnesse to be stucke vpon our <hi>Natives: That you should need the helpe of Strangers,</hi> to whom our constitutions are not so well knowne: A <hi>Spaniard</hi> (as they called him) had such grace given him in the last great Visitation, as if no <hi>Englishman</hi> could so well tell how to save the lives of his owne, <hi>English:</hi> but by his worke, his workemanship was knowne to other worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; And some now live that dare truely say, <hi>many died vnder his hand, that vnder some of ours might (in all likelyhood) have recovered.</hi> I have but my <hi>Mite</hi> to offer, but as much <hi>water</hi> as the <hi>palme of my hand</hi> will hold, to cast into this new-kindled <hi>Fier.</hi> But even this (this little <hi>Booke</hi> I meane) may be so wel vsed, being added to others greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, that it may helpe to quench it, ere it rise to a <hi>Flame,</hi> if the <hi>Heavenly Phisitian</hi> see it so good. It is to that end I publish it. That others that had not like experience of the last great <hi>Sicknesse</hi> (as there are but few living now, that tarried here then) may hereby receive some help, and instruction: especially in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Plague</hi> by his true <hi>Signes;</hi> a thing much sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb facs="4"/> in many that take it vpon thē. And for my <hi>Self,</hi> I will adde my hearty prayers to <hi>Almighty God</hi> to bee mercifull to this City, and (if it be his blessed will) to sheath his <hi>Sword,</hi> and vnbend his <hi>Bow;</hi> that the dreaded afflictions of <hi>Pestilence</hi> and <hi>Famine</hi> may be averted from vs.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Graunt this O mercifull Father, for the bitter Sufferings of thy blessed Sonne IESVS CHRIST our onely Saviour</hi> Amen.</p>
   <p>This shall be the continuall Prayer of <hi>Him,</hi>
