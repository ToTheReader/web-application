O Gregorie, O Augustine, O Hierome, O Chrysostome, O Leo, O Dionise, O Anacletus, O Sistus, O Paule, O Christ. If vve be deceiued herein, ye are they that haue deceiued vs. You haue taught vs those schismes and diuisions, ye haue taught vs these he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies. Thus ye ordred the holy communion in your ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, the same vve receiued at your hand, and haue faithfully delyuered it vnto the people. And that ye maye the more meruel at the vvilfulnes of such men, they stand this daye against so many old fathers, so many Doctoures, so many examples of the primitiue churche, so manifest and so plaine vvordes of the holy scriptures and yet haue they here in, not one father, not one Doctour, not one allovved example of the primitiue churche, to make for them. And vvhen I saye, not one, I speake not this in vehemencie of spirite, or heate of talke, but euen, as before God, by the vvaye of simplicitie and truth: least any of you should happely be deceiued, and thinke, there is more vveight in the other syde, then in conclusion there shall be fovvnde. And therefore once againe I saye, of all the vvordes of the holy scriptures, of all the examples of the primitiue chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, of all the old fathers, of all the auncient Doctoures in these causes they haue not one.</p>
   <p>Here the matter it self, that I haue novv in hand, putteth
