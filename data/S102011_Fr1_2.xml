   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is some time since (good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader) that lying in London, and preaching at Paules Crosse, as the feast of Easter drawing neer did admonish mee, I made choice to speake of the redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde by the death and bloud of Christ Iesus. And because that Citie then had, and yet hath, as manie learned and religious preachers; so some conceited and too much addicted to nouelties, who spared not in their Catechisings and readings, to vrge the suffering of the <hi>verie paines of hell</hi> in the soul of Christ on the crosse, as the chiefest part, and maine ground of our Redemption by Christ: I, finding how fast that opinion had increased, since it was first deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and doubting where it would end, thought it my dutie publikelie to warne them that were forward in defending this fansie, to take heed how farre they wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that late sprong speculation: For as these words of<note n="a" place="margin">Psa. 18. &amp; 116</note>
      <hi>Dauid, The sorrowes of hell besieged me,</hi> and these of<note n="b" place="margin">Ionas. 2.</note>
      <hi>Ionas, Out of the belly of hel I cried, &amp; thou heardest my voice,</hi> may be tolerablie applied to Christ, if they be metaphorically interpreted of Christ, as the scriptures meane them in <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ionas</hi>; so if wee grow from the figuratiue vse of the worde HELL, to the proper signification thereof, and rise from the degrees of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
<pb facs="3"/>
and feares, which pursue the Saints in this life, to the highest sense and suffering of ALL, and THE VE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIE SAME paines and punishments which the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned do and shall endure for euer; freeing Christ from nothing but from the place and continuance of hell: vve make not a curious and superfluous, but an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and daungerous addition to the mysterie of our Saluation.</p>
   <p>The better to slacke their inconsiderate heate, I laboured to prooue these foure pointes vnto them. First that it was no where recorded in the holie Scriptures, nor iustlie to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Scriptures, that Christ suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the true paines of hell; and so the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of the faythfull coulde not iustlie bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the necessarie beleeuing of anie such strange assertion. Secondlie, that as the Scriptures describe to vs the paines of the damned and of hell; there are manie terrors and torments, which, without euident impietie, cannot be ascribed to the Sonne of God, as namely <hi>extreame Darkenesse, Desperation, Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, vtter separation, reiection and exclusion</hi> from the grace, fauour, and kingdome of God; <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> of sinne <hi>gnawing</hi> the conscience, <hi>horrour</hi> of Diuels tormented and tormenting, and <hi>flame</hi> of <hi>fire</hi> intolerablie burning both bodie and soule. Thirdlie, that the death and bloud of Christ Iesus were eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie, frequentlie, constantlie set downe in the writinges of the Apostles as the sufficient price of our Redemption, and true meane of our reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to God; and the verie same proposed in the
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>figures,</hi> resembled in the <hi>sacrifices</hi> of the Lawe, and sealed with the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the new Testament as the verie grounde worke of our saluation by Christ; and so haue beene receaued and beleeued in the Church of God fourteene hundred yeares, before anie man euer made mention of hell paines to bee suffered in the soule of Christ. Lastlie, where the Scriptures are plaine and pregnant, that Christ <note n="c" place="margin">1. Corin. 13.</note> DIED: <hi>for our sinnes,</hi> and by his <note n="d" place="margin">Hebre. 2</note> DEATH, <hi>destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that had power of death, euen the Diuell, and reconciled vs, when we were strangers and enemies,</hi> IN THE<note n="e" place="margin">Colos. 1.</note> BODIE OF HIS FLESH THROVGH DEATH, (for wee are <hi>reconciled to God, by the</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">Rom 5.</note> DEATH <hi>of his sonne, and sanctified by</hi> THE OFFERING OF THE <note n="g" place="margin">Hebr. 10.</note> BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIE <hi>of Iesus Christ</hi> once, who <note n="h" place="margin">1. Pet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</note>
      <hi>himselfe bare our sinnes in his</hi> BODIE <hi>on the Tree</hi>: where hee <hi>was put to death concerning the</hi> FLESH;) Besides that the holie Ghost in these places by expresse wordes nameth the bodilie death of Christ as the meane of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reconciliation to God: no considerate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine might affirme or imagine Christ suffered the Death of the soule; for so much as the Death of the soule must exclude Christ from the <hi>grace, spirit,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of God; and leaue in him neither <hi>faith, hope,</hi> nor <hi>loue, sanctitie,</hi> nor <hi>innocencie</hi>; which God forbid anie Christian man shoulde so much as dreame. Wee shoulde therefore do well to reuerence the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest wordes of Gods Spirit in so high a pointe of Religion, and suffer our selues as schollers to bee taught by the leader into all trueth, what to beleeue and confesse in the mystery of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not to controle or correct the doctrine so
<pb facs="4"/>
cleerelie deliuered in the Scriptures, so consonantlie retained of all learned and vnlearned in the Church of Christ, for so many hundred yeares. And if anie man to maintaine his deuise woulde inuent a newe hell and another death of the soule, then either scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or fathers euer heard or spake of, they shoulde keepe their inuentions to themselues; it sufficed me to beleeue what I read, and consequently not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue what I did not read in the word of God, which is and ought to be the foundation of our faith.</p>
   <p>Thus farre I purposed, when I first entered, by Gods grace to proceede in this cause, according to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> simple vnderstanding wherwith god hath endued me for the good of his Church. The article of the Creed, Christ DESCENDED INTO HELL I meant not to meddle with; choosing rather to leaue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> vntouched, then to presse any sense as a point of faith, for vvhich I had not so full and faire warrant, as for the redemption of man by the death and blood of Christ Iesus; but the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of some contradicting that I taught, and the importunitie of others requesting to knowe what they might safelie beleeue of that article, made mee to alter my minde. For whē some vrged, others doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that if Christ did not suffer the paines of hell whiles he hung on the Crosse, that part of the Creed was added in vaine; and the wordes of <note n="i" place="margin">Psal. 16.</note>
      <hi>Dauid, Thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell,</hi> applied by <note n="k" place="margin">Acts 2.</note>
      <hi>Peter</hi> vnto Christ in the second of the <hi>Acts,</hi> could hardly haue any good construction: (because it seemed farre fet, and altogither repugnant to the proper signification of the wordes, to take the <hi>soule</hi> for the <hi>bodie,</hi> and <hi>hell</hi> for the <hi>graue</hi>; and as for the locall descent of Christ
<pb facs="4"/>
to hell after death, they counted that but a fable:) I was forced to promise that I would openlie deliuer, which I thought was the likeliest and safest sense, as well of that article in the Creede, as of those wordes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> fulfilled in the person of our Sauiour. This occasion drew mee to the next question of Christes descent to hell. Wherin I resolued as by perusing the later part of this treatise will better appeare, that Christs descent to the verie place of hell after his death, did best concord both with the Creede, and with the truth of Christian religion, so we tooke care not to swarue frō the Scriptures, in setting downe the cause why he went thither: which was to ouerthrow &amp; destroy the kingdom &amp; might of Satan in the place of his greatest strength, euen in hel, and as our head to free all his members from daunger and feare of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither: the sorrowes and terrors whereof hee loosed vvith his presence, treading them vnder his feete, and rose againe into a blessed and immortall life, leading captiuitie captiue, and taking from hell and Satan all povver to preuaile against his elect.</p>
   <p>Both these resolutions that Christ suffered <hi>not the true paines of hell in his soule on the crosse</hi>; and that hee <hi>personallie conquered</hi> and disarmed the <hi>powers</hi> and terrours <hi>thereof before his resurrection</hi>; some (as in such cases is common) misremembred, some miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued, and some misliked: vvhereupon I vvas both aduised and intreated by men of greater place then I vvill name, to put the effect of that vvhich I had deliuered in vvriting, that by mine ovvne vvords, and not by other mens conceits or reports, the learned might iudge of the doctrine. Which I did that verie
<pb facs="5"/>
Summer, and had it readie for the presse before Bartle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewtide, but that the Parliament of States appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, wherein men shoulde be otherwise imploied; and a great hurle raised against it by certaine popular preachers in that citie, through whose mouthes the contrarie had often passed to the people as currant, I was desired by the same persons againe to staie, till that time of businesse were ouer past, that heat of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction somewhat alaied, and respite giuen that it might be trāslated into Latin, which also is now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as wel as published in English. To whole coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell I yeelded, referring the time wholy to their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, notwithstanding I were by many traduced in many places as a teacher of strange and false doctrine. But I haue beene and am the more willing to beare the reproches of maligners, because I seeke not my selfe heerein, but that the church of Christ heere in Englande should hold fast that ancient and sure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of faith which hitherto it hath kept; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that doctrine touching our Redemption by Christ, which as wel the publike lawes of this realme, as all the catholike fathers do vphold and allow.</p>
   <p>In setting downe the summe of that which I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, I neither do, nor can promise thee (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) the same words which I then spake; I wrote them not; but I assure thee before him that knoweth all things, that I haue not swarued nor altered anie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall point from the methode, propositions, proofes and conclusions, which I then vsed, nor from the wordes as farre as either my notes, or my memory vpon the fresh foote coulde direct mee; which I haue yet to shew. Manie proofes and authorities I omitted
<pb facs="5"/>
in the pulpit, which the time shut me from; and some obiections I haue answered here more largelie, then the course of Sermons would permit: but here is the selfe same in effect, which then I vttered and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, if the time woulde haue suffered. The manner of handling this question, I alwaies wished might bee temperate and sober, as best became christian profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours and teachers; least by catching aduantages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the cause, wee increased quarrels, and so much regarded our credits that wee neglected the truth. I haue therfore in the Treatise it selfe touched no mans name, oppugned no mans wordes, traduced no mans iudgement; but admitting and retaining as much as I thought might stande with the truth, I haue pared off certaine extremities, and reiected certaine addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the first inuentors did refraine; for that Christ suffered the death of the soule, or all the same tormentes, which the damned do and shall, are posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions lately coined, and deriued from the proportion of Gods iustice as they call it, but as I thinke from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of mans reason intruding into Gods secrets. The doctrine which I defend, that we are sufficientlie redeemed by the death and bloud of Christ Iesus, (without adding of hell paines to bee suffered in the soule of Christ) hath the constant, full, and expresse warrant of the Scriptures, and the like approbation from al the fathers without exception. And therefore howsoeuer some men may despise all ancient writers, and frustrate the scriptures with their figures; al sober and wise christians will, I doubt not, beware how they admit this strange and late found nouelty into their Creede or consciences. The second point I presse nor
<pb facs="6"/>
with like vehemencie, because it hath not like certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. So long as we confesse (which the Scriptures do confirme) that Christs humane nature after his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame humiliation on the Crosse, &amp; before his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, conquered &amp; spoyled not death only, but hell &amp; Satan also, of al their power &amp; right ouer y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> faithful, &amp; ascending on hie <hi>lead captiuitie captiue,</hi> &amp; tooke the <hi>keyes of death and of hell</hi> into his owne hands; with the precise maner and hower I will not burden anie mans conscience, that cannot be perswaded by reading the latter part of this treatise; though I my selfe, after long &amp; diligent search, find no sense so agreeable to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> words of the Creede, so answerable to the rules of the sacred Scriptures, and so fullie followed by all the Fathers, as Christs descent to the verie place of hell for the purposes aforesaid.</p>
   <p>Hauing premonished thee (Christian reader) of thus much, I am not willing to detayne thee anie longer from vewing and examining the booke it selfe, but onelie to tell thee that whiles I stayed the printing hereof, till others did like it, as wel as my self, one more hastie then either aduised or learned, calling himselfe H. I. would needes traduce it and confute it before he saw it, resting belike on such notes, as his angry mind and brickle memorie tooke at the time when I preached of these points. Wherein though others condemne his follie, yet I commend his pollicie, that least hee should trouble himselfe with more thē he could answere, he thought it y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> best way to come into the field alone, and like a stout Champion fighting with his owne shadow, to say no more thē he would be sure to deny or decline with one
<pb facs="6"/>
shift or other. To make the easier conquest of that I preached, hee cleane changeth the state of the first Question, hee offereth to prooue that which I neuer denied, hee confuteth that which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer affirmed, hee runneth at Random no man can tell whither, hee peruerteth my wordes, hee may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth my reasons, hee skippeth all my authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; hee scornefullie reiecteth the iudgement of the Fathers when I alleage them, the Scriptures hee turneth and windeth at his pleasure, he wadeth desperately through thicke and thinne in matters of most importance, his best reason is euerie where his own opinion, outfacing the world with his ignorance; in summe, he sheweth vs by his example what it is for a man in matters of faith to despise both authoritie and antiquity, and trust onely to his own fancie. Such an opponent the wiser sort will thinke I were better neglect then encounter, which resolution I my selfe do retayne; onely lest my silence should augment his boldnes, I thought it not amisse in the conclusion se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the treatise, to giue thee a tast of the rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and weaknes of his enterprise, intreating thee in the meane time to reade aduisedly and iudge indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, for that the cause is weighty and toucheth thee as neere as mee. For if we suffer the mayne foundation of our faith and hope in Christ to be wrenched neuer so little awrie; the whole building is more endangered then wee are ware of. In Gods causes, let Gods booke teach vs what to beleeue, and what to professe. If thou thinke it thy duetie in matters of faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of vnwritten verities, in the greatest point of all, which is our redemption by Christ; take heede
<pb facs="7"/>
thou easilie admit not vnwritten absurdities. This matter began in more generall and more tolerable tearmes, if they might bee rather soberly mitigated, then too vehemently pressed; but as when we runne downe an hill we can hardly staie; so in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion when we fal to inuenting beyond the scriptures we quickly misse and seldome recouer the truth. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well (gentle Reader) and pray that our thoughts and wits may be subiected to the truth of Gods word, and that wee loath not the simplicitie which is in Christ.</p>
