   <p>KNowing (dearly beloued and Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that as there ought to be, so there is, a propensity and Holy inclination, in all who are truly Gods, to haue a respect, generally &amp; vniuersally, vnto all his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to one as well as to an other, without exceptions &amp; reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations: To auoide all superstition and will-worship: and to giue vnto God, his owne worship and seruice, prescribed in his Laws, without baulking and abridging him, of any parte thereof; I iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therfore, that this discourse, in defence of the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> which is one maine thing, prescribed in Gods Commandements,
<pb facs="8"/>and a parte of Gods worship &amp; seruice, could not be vnwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to thee, Calling to minde also, the Parable of our Sauiour, how seuerly he will deale with that seruant, vnto whom he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth but one single Talent, if he hide it vp in secret, so as no proffit come thereof Mat. 25.24. Remembring also, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, made it an essentiall marke, of Peters loue vnto him, to feede his Lambes, Ioh. 21.15. And, that it is giuen in charge vnto all, To exhorte one an other, to admonish one another, &amp; to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy one an other 1. Thes. 5.11.15. These things, laid before myne eyes, I could not for loue, nor durst I for feare, but make knowne my minde in this point.</p>
   <p>How could my Spirit, be but stirred within me, to see my Christian betheren, the Church and Spowse of Christ, to lay in the weekly neglect, of Gods worship, profanation of his Sacred Sabbathes, and transgression of the 4th Commandement; when in the meane time, they zealously &amp; superstitiously, tender vnto God, their will-worship, of the Lords day Sabbath? how could I but discouer these things! especially when but the Alteration and chang of a day, as the sanctification of the Saturday for the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; might helpe all this. In the dayes of <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet, the Church of God, had profaned the Lords <hi>Sabbathe;</hi> Isai. 58.13. and the Lord gaue him in charge, to <hi>Crie aloude, spare not; lifte vp thy voice like a trumpet, &amp; show my people their transgression, &amp; to the house of Iaakob their sinne &amp;c.</hi> Isai. 58, 1. It is the duetie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of Gods Ministers, to tell his people of their sinne; and the people and Church of God, must with patience heare it, &amp; with cheerefulnesse reforme it: for which happy Reformation, I make my prayers vnto God, that when they assemble next in <hi>Parliament,</hi> they may make this one of their maine Consultations; to cause a serch to be made, both into the Scriptures, &amp; into the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Histories &amp; Records of the Church; to see, what grownds can be found, for the Lords day Sabbath; &amp; to make also, a diligent inquiry, after the Lords ancient Sabbathes, to see whats become of them; and when, &amp; vpon what grownds they where first throwne downe; that so, the errours of our Fathers, may be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in vs their children. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s you haue the reasons mouing me to wright.</p>
   <p>As I had many &amp; sufficient reasons mouing me to wright, so I
<pb facs="9"/>mett with many &amp; sondry discouragments; for some, yea Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, who of all others, one would thinke, should iudge most charitablie of their brethren,
<note place="margin">☞</note> they enter into my heart, &amp; say, it is pride and singularity, that sets me on worke &amp;c: And this once broched by a Minister, it runneth also from the mouthes of their people continually: now albeit, I haue professed &amp; protested in priuate, vnto such Ministers, the contrary; &amp; that after a diligent serch of myne hearte, as I have teld them, yet nothing will satisfy them, but pride it must be though. Well, once againe I answer them, &amp; that in the words of S. Paul, <hi>Though I know nothing by my selfe, yet am I not thereby iustified,</hi> Tis true indeed, <hi>The hearte is deceiptfull &amp;c.</hi> Ierem. 17. as soone therfore as I can find this haughtinesse arising, I will labour its mortification, God assisting. But whats this to the purpose, among wise men? say hee be a proude person, &amp; that pride creepeth in, as it will to a mans best actions, too too often; is his cause therfore starke naught? then many a lerned, and elegant sermon should be reiected; and many a zelouse Sermon, of no worth: but thus it is with many of them, that vnlesse a man can so Master his vnderstanding, &amp; captiuate his iudgement, as to say what they say for company; &amp; out of a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their persons &amp; giftes, to affirme with them, that all is Gods Sacred trueth, which they fancy about the Lords day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, though hee can see no such matter, but the cleane contrary, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ee must be branded for a proude person: but with patience, I shall labour to beare them: selfeloue is stronge; and selfedeniall hard.</p>
   <p>Some obiect to me saying, you are but one; and the Lords day Sabbath hath stoode thus a long time; and the most are of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary iudgement to you; neuer think you to reforme it, I neuer looke to see it altered in my dayes &amp;c. To which carnall reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings I answer, should a faithfull Minister in his Charge, be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with such arguings, what Minister might not forbeare the pulpit? let him preach for repentance, almes deedes, chastity, sobriety, or selfedentiall &amp;c: and may not many in his Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tell him, that hee is bat one, and they haue liued otherwise a longe time; and many, yea Ministers will doe as they doe; and therefore neuer let him thinke to reforme them &amp;c? who could think wise men, should argue thus vnwisely? and yet these eares of
<pb facs="9"/>myne, haue heard these arguments vsed by Christians, in other points, of no ordenary vnderstanding. But let these know, that a good cause, hath not at all times, good successe: I <hi>haue laboured in vaine; I haue spent my strength for naught: but my iudgment is with the Lord, and my worke with my God,</hi> saith the Prophete, Isai. 49.4. A Minister therfore, must goe on with courage,
<note place="margin">☜</note> though he seeth no fruite of his labours; for his reward, is <hi>with God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Some mislike the vnceasonablesse of this motion; &amp; they could wish in their hearts (they say) I had tarried longer, &amp; waited for some more ceasonable opportunity, for the diuulging of these points. To whom I answer, Gods truethes, may not waite at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, till men be at leisure to receiue them: and why not now, as well as hereafter? vnlesse these men thinke, these times, so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly euill, as thers no hope left, that they will giue eare vnto wholesome Doctrine. But my feare is, that their season, is whē I am out of season, after my death, and so they hope, the point should dye with mee; but I haue peuented them: I am by the mercy of God, neither so afraid, nor so ashamed of Gods cause, as to deny it my best furtherance &amp; countenance, in my life time: were I asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of God &amp; this, Trueth before men, I might iustly susspect, that God wold be ashamed of such a seruāt, before his Angels in heauē.</p>
   <p>Some say, that there are others in the Church, in many regards more fit then I, for a matter of this weight; and therefore they could wish, that I had neuer stirred in it; for now I haue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the cause quite and cleane, by my meannesse &amp;c. Tis true indeede, &amp; I freely confesse it, there are many much more fit then I; and I hartely wish it, that any of them had taken my place &amp; labour: but this wee know, that the most fit and able men, to doe God seruice they are not euer the most redy and willing to doe it: had it bene a point, the reuealing whereof, might haue wone credit, applause, preferment and the like, I beleeue, you had heard of it long err now: but it being a point, of much and hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures, &amp; the reward, like to be nothing but danger, reproch, and heard censures; and like to meete with greate enemies &amp; many; in such a point, wise men will take leisure, and giue any body leaue to goe before them. What hope could I haue, that others of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, worth, would vndertake this taske, when as before I published my former booke, many men, of greate lerning &amp; conscience, to
<pb facs="10"/>whom I communicated my Notes, for confirmation or confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they did neither; but rather turned my vtter enemies, for this cause sake? wherefore I was not rash, as some men count rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, but after I had waited, as <hi>Elihu</hi> did, vpon the auncient and more lerned, &amp; found no courage in their heartes, nor word in their mouthes, to speake for God; then I spake in my turne, &amp; shewed myne opinion: let no man blame my zeale; it was for God.</p>
   <p>Tis true, the meannesse of my person, will be a greate blocke in the way, to the progresse of this cause; especially in these clym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dayes, wherein the word of God, is so much receiued, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of persons; for men esteeme of the cause, iust as they doe of the person: hence it is, that before many will giue audience to the matter, they will first know of the man; as, whither he be one of their side or no, &amp; approued of by them: and whither learned, witty, eloquent, and well red, or no: or whither honoured with Titles, eminency, and preferment or no: in so much as, if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Amos</hi> were now liuing, and teaching Gods trueth, it is to be feared, his <hi>booke</hi> of prophecy, would not be regarded, being he was a Neat-heard: and if S. Paul, were now to preach the <hi>new</hi> doctrine of the gospell, it may be thought, it would not be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, he being a Tayler or Tentmaker: But where are those No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bereanes,</hi> who serched the Scriptures, and examined the cause, without regard had to Pauls person? where is that Eloquent and lerned <hi>Apollos,</hi> that gaue heed vnto the instructions, and matter which <hi>Aquilla,</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> his wife, taught him; of whom he lerned the way of God more perfectly, without respect vnto their persones? for the one was a woman that taught him; and both, were Taylers of Tentmakers: If therefore A Trueth, fareth the worse, for the meannesse of the Author, it shall be so, but at the hands onely of such persons, as doe not vnfeinedly desire the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milke of the word, that they may growe thereby, as did those Noble Bereanes; and it shall be so, but at the hands onely of such whose lerning is not sanctified, and seasoned with Humility, as <hi>Apollos</hi> his was.</p>
   <p>Some obiect, that the broching of this point, will breed stirres, and distractions in the Church &amp;c. To whom I answer, tis a trueth they say: when euer entred any new Trueth, or was, any
<pb facs="10"/>old Trueth receiued, but it came in with stirres and distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at the first? It fareth in these cases, as it doth with phisicke, which a sikly man takes to recouer his health; at first, it makes him sicker then he was before, it causeth him pains in his belly, head, &amp; heart &amp;c: and albeit the pacient know all this before hand, yet will he take this potion, in hope of a more perfect health afterwards: and so I trust will it be in this case: though for the present, it occationeth stirres, distractions, &amp; distempers; yet, it will be so onely, in the minds of some such, as doe abound with euill humores: neuerthelesse, the conclusion will be good, by the mercy of God; &amp; a more perfect health will be obtained. When <hi>Luther</hi> first stirred, to reforme the second Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there was then greate stirres and distractions in the Church, but by this time, and long agone; there hath bene a sweete ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, &amp; that vpon better conditions then formerly: and why may wee not hope for like successe? I mary say some scoffingly, and we shall haue an other Luther now, shall we? what will you proue an other Luther now? such a disdainfull, enuiouse, &amp; scoffing age we now liue in that, that which shold be a mans greatest honour, as to imitate the most virtuouse; it is wrested, as a matter of his reproch &amp; derision: in other cases, we desire to iustifie our actions, by the like actions, of the godly and wise that haue gone before vs, and to make vse of them for our incouragement, and why should I onely be denied this benefit? I pray tell me, is it not a laudable thing, for any to become followers of <hi>Luther, Caluîne, Zwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius? of Paul, Peter, Christ?</hi> When euer I propound examples to my selfe, they shall euer be the best, and most eminent; let these scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers imitate the worst: for so they doe, they are the sonnes of scoffing <hi>Ishmael.</hi> Were it an infallible note of pride, to imitate the most excellent, Paul would neuer haue exhorted vs, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come followers of <hi>him</hi> as he was of <hi>Christ:</hi> Neither could Christians be accounted humble men, because they doe imitate Christ.</p>
   <p>Some obiect thus, I but you doe not discreetly, to publish this point, whereby it comes to the peoples knowledge; rather should a drope of blood, haue gone from my heart, then such a point as this, vnto common people: you should rather haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted it vnto Diuines in priuate, and discussed it with them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="11"/>&amp;c. Hereto I answer, this obiection of some Diuines, it is no better then a faire flourish, whereby vnder a c lour of discretion, they would haue silenced, and buried this Trueth euerlastingly. For if they could haue tied me, by the rules of this their discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to haue made knowne this point, onely vnto Ministe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s, they then know waies enough, how to smother it, so as it should neuer haue come to light, and so as the people, poore soules, should neuer haue heard of it.</p>
   <p>Indeed. I iudged it discretion, first to make tender of it to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, before I printed, to the viewe of common people; and so I did; for I sent my Notes a broad, to sondry Diuines of the best ranke, both nere and afarr off, expecting their confutation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, but I obtained neither: In case they had answered me, by way of confirmation, then my resolution was, to haue bene further counsailed by them as touching the publishing of it; as whither by my selfe; or rather by some more eminent &amp; able person of their choosing: and touching the time, when? whither presently, or rather hereafter: and for the persones, to whom? whither generally vnto all, or rather vnto some eminent persons of the Kingdome; and the like. But expecting longe their answeres, which diuers of them promised, though they performed not; and waiting 10 or 12 monethes, and finding nothing but delaies, and foording me off still; hereby I suspected, that this their counsaile of discretion, was but a dry morsell to stay my sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make withall for the present, and nothing else but a fained thing; deuised handsomly to make mee beleeue on the one side, that, that they meant seriously and faithfully, to haue taken the matter into their consideration, had not I bene so rash in publishing it, which they neuer meant, as all experience euen to this day shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: for both my Notes then, and my Booke since, haue neuer bene answered by them by way of confutation; nor approued of them, by way of confirmation. And on the other side, to haue kept this Trueth secret, from the peoples knowledge: and this of the twaine indeed, is that they chiefly aime at: it is most grieuouse vnto them, that common people, should espie their errours: as for their owne consciences, many of them are large enough (as I haue experience, to my exceding greate sorrow of heart) to brooke the superstitiouse, and ignorant obseruation, of the Lords day
<pb facs="11"/>Sabbath; and to neglect the worship of God, in the 7th day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: they could digest these things, and set downe with them, good quietly, prouided no body might see this their blind igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp; halting with God; but this is that which toucheth to the quicke with them; that since my publication of this Trueth, and discouery of their errour, now they cannot halt in secret; now common people, see thers no grownds for the Lords day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; now their parishoners &amp; others, can answer their arguments; and see their folly and leu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ty; and how a long time they haue bene carried in a golding dreame. Well, when I saw that Ministers sleited Gods Trueth, then I resolued to turne me, and open my selfe vnto the people, trusting to finde more fidelity &amp; sincerity among them: if therfore it griueth them, that the people know of it sooner then they would, let them thank themselues, for sleiting of it, when tendered vnto them; and for their attempts to smother it &amp;c. For some of them haue said vnto me, when I haue moued them in it most ceriously, what thinke you, wee haue nothing else to doe, but to listen to your toies?</p>
   <p>Others obiect saying, if I would haue wrote in controuercy, I shold haue wrote against Papists, as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> &amp; the like, against a forraine enemy &amp;c. To whom I answer, thers more neede to deale at home, then a broad: euery man flies vpon A Papist: for the controuercy is made easy by the many helpes of our lerned writers; &amp; because it is applauded at all hands, so as a man may be a gainer by the controuercy: But fewe or none will medle, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse things at home: for these are not onely hard &amp; difficult, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring much study &amp; greate labours considering none haue gone before to giue them light; but also, a man may easily foresee it, hee shall be a loser by the bargaine: wherby you may easily gather, that homebred euiles, are more perillouse, and like to stick longe by vs, without reformation: now by how much the fewer will vndertake them, by so much the better seruice he doth vnto God, that will aduenture himselfe in them: for this is that I aime at, not to please men, but him that hath called me, and betrusted me with one of his Talents; my chiefe desire now is, that I may improue it, not which way my selfe may best gaine credit, wealth, and preferment, but that way whereby I may wine most glorie, to my chiefe Lord and Master. Let none thinke me so ignorant, but that I know
<pb facs="12"/>well enough, which is the way to rise in the world, were that the thing I short at; and I know right well, that whilst I am in this argument, I am cleane out of that way: but with <hi>Moses,</hi> I haue a respect vnto the Recompense of reward.</p>
   <p>Some of them obiect vnto me, that by stiring in this point, I shall incense the State, and the Byshopes will molest me &amp;c. To whom I answer, thats the thing indeed would much please them, that the Governement of the Kingdome, would oppose mee, &amp; so much they intimate, by their much wondering, that I am so long suffered in quiet &amp;c: for since they cannot defend the phantasy of the Lords day Sabbath, by the Scriptures, and sword of the Spirit, now they long for the aide of the sword of the Magistrate, wondering it tarrieth so long erre it will aueng them: but had I their cause in hand, I would be ashamed, to desire aide from the sword of the Magistrate, when the word of God, and sword of the Spirit, refuseth to help: first let them soundly answer, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute my booke, and then let them flie to the Magistrat and spare not. I know well, that things tending to changes and alterations, are not pleasing vnto Statsmen, vnlesse in case most weighty, and of vrgent necessity, of which kind, I trust they will Iudge this to be, after they haue once taken it, into their graue and iudiciouse considerations. The soundnesse and cleernesse of this my cause, giueth me good hope, that God will inlighten them with it, &amp; so incline their hearts vnto mercy; but if not, since I verily beleeue and know it to be a Trueth; and my duety, not to smother it, and suffer it to dye with mee, I haue aduentured to publish it, &amp; to defend it, saying with Quene <hi>Aester, If</hi> I <hi>perish,</hi> I <hi>perish:</hi> and with the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> I <hi>passe not at all, neither is my life deare vnto mee, so that</hi> I <hi>may fulfill my course with ioye,</hi> Actor. 20.24. What a corziue would it prove to my conscience, on my deaths bedd, to cale to minde, how I knew these things full well, but would not reueale them; how could I say with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that I had reuealed the <hi>whole</hi> Counsaile of God, and haue kept <hi>nothing</hi> backe, that was proffitable? Act. 20.20.27. what hope could I then conceiue, that God would open his gate of Mercy to mee, who whilst I liued, would not open my mouth for him?</p>
   <p>Thus Gentle Reader, I haue both giuen thee my reasons mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to wright, and also showne thee, the many discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="12"/>opposing me, &amp; how I haue encountered them; now in the last place my request vnto thee, shall be 1. that thou expectest not from me, expressions of greate Schollarship, reading, elegancy of phrase, and the like; but onely soundnesse, plainnesse, and godly simplicity; as this is all you shall find, so is it as much as I desire you should finde. Touching Method, I could wish that here and there, some things were otherwise placed; but considering, that nothing is more tediouse vnto me, then vnnecessary wrighting of one thing twise ouer, whereby such slipes might haue bene amended, I trust I shall obtaine thy patience; and the rather, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that after this worke was first finished, it laying still by mee, I had occation to add too many and sondry things here and there, and not finding roome enough in the margent of my Notes, to inserte them were I would, was forced to thrust them in where I could.</p>
   <p n="2">2. Whereas in some passages, a harsh word or two may fale from my pen, which the temperate Reader may thinke, might better haue bene spared; In this case, I desire him to thinke, that he is not yet so sensible of the foulnesse of the cause, as my selfe, who haue peraduenture better weighed circumstances: for I consider of the foulnes of the matter, seeing it most palpably; of the obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the aduersaries, after sufficient meanes of conviction, tendered long a gone vnto them; and of the dangerouse consequences, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from their greate errours, in a matter of greatest weight and moment, it being about a Morall Law, a parte of Gods worship, and a most Ancient ordinance of Gods; I see their absurd answers, distinctons, and arguments, and how by their subtilty they corrupt, the Scriptures, and abuse the well minded people of the Land: obserue it, and you shall still find some of these things, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going occation of euery tarte speech I vse; now these things, my Reader at first, cannot be possessed of, as I am: &amp; who can speake of such foule things, without some expressions, of a iust indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against them?</p>
   <p>In specialll, I haue often occasion to vse the word <hi>Puritan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>:</hi> Hereat let none be offended; for I vse it not in reproch vnto sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and purity, or the professours thereof, considered as truly such; for I honour purity in my heart, &amp; endeauor after it in my life: I vse the word therfore, but onely as a note of distinction, to point at
<pb facs="13"/>some men with whom I haue to deale, rather then others; &amp; grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued I am at my heart and in my soule, that I must haue to deale against persons so qualified.</p>
   <p>Tis true this cause concerneth all men none excepted, whither Ministers or people: yet in speciall, as cause there is for it, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect my speech chiefly against Ministers; of Ministers there are two sortes, puritanes, and such as are no puritanes; these, as I find them not redy to imbrace things new; so I find them, not redy to condemne a cause, before they haue heard it: wherefore, spareing them, my speech is onely against puritane Ministers: of these also there are two sortes, some who happily neuer so much as haue heard of this question, or if they haue, yet neuer raised slaunders &amp; oppositions against it; but carying it temperatly and discreetly, wish it a due triall, that so the trueth may be boulted out, these mē I reuerence: but there are others, &amp; in speciall those tenn Ministers named in the title lease, at the begining of this booke, these men in speciall I oppose; for these after they haue had my Notes, and also my former booke and conference with me, now fowre yeeres past, yet still doe raise vp all the oppositon, against both my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and my cause; that they can; and that both publikly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly. Salomon telleth vs, there is an appointed time for all things, A time to laugh, and a time to weepe: A time to rend, and a time to sowe: A time of warre, and a time of peace: A Time to keepe silence, and a time to speake Eccl. 3. my former booke was a time of silence: for there I laboured, to couer the spotes &amp; blemishes, of these my brethrens errour, hoping a word had bene enough to the wise; but they abusing it, this booke is a time to speake, and lay them forth in their cullers. My former booke, was a time of peace, for there I handled the matter meekly, mildly, and in all friēdlinesse, hoping these my brethren, would redly haue imbraced Trueth with peace; but they proclaiming open warres against me, &amp; Gods cause in my hand; this booke is a time of warre; &amp; here I take them for Gods enimies and myne: Let me desire my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therfore, to giue me patience, to prosecute these enemies of Gods Trueth rowndly, not sparing them, though they be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</p>
   <p>Happily thou wilt say in their behalfe, oh but these men whom you would so prosecute, they are Ministers, whom we excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb facs="13"/>reuerence, and who doe truly feare God, as your selfe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny &amp;c. Yea, they are your brethren, &amp;c. And so doe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence them too, but with this limitation, in their virtues, and wherin they doe well: And they truly feare God, as I am strongly perswaded, yet they haue not at all times, a respect vnto all Gods Commandements, as the Prophet Dauid speaketh; for they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse the 4th Com. weekly, by prophaning of Gods Sabbathes: I may not vnfitly resemble these 10 Ministers, vnto that clowd which had a light and a darke parte; when I behold their light parte, &amp; see them walking in &amp; teaching the trueth, I cannot loke enough on them, I may truly speake it: but when I looke on their darke parte, and see them in their errours, I abhorre their sight, as one abhorreth the darknesse. The Prophet Dauid was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly reuerenced, yet not in his sinnes of murther &amp; adultery, against the 6th &amp; 7th com. Hee truly feared God, yet at this time, he had not a respect vnto these two Commandements, of murther and adultery. The Apostle Peter, being a Minister, was to be highly reuerenced, yet not in his deniall of Christ: He truly feared God, yet when he forswore his Lord and Master, therein he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraied it not. Let good men therfore, &amp; Holy, be defended, no further, then their goodnesse and holinesse will extend; and suffer them to be prosecuted and discouered, in their erroures &amp; sinnes, that they may reforme them. I confesse they are my brethren, &amp; so I acknowledge them; but what then, may not their erroures therfore be discouered and reproued? Peter was Pauls brother, did Paul therfore cloke Peters errour? no; Paul discouered it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued it to his face, and that publikly before all men Gal. 2.11.14: shall the sinnes of the people be reproued, and not the sinnes of Ministers? shall Ministers, haue a patent to sinne without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profe? our Sauiour, reproued <hi>Peter,</hi> saying, get thee behind me <hi>Satan.</hi> I hold, sinne is lesse to be borne withall in a Minister, then in a priuate person; especially if it be, both in their life and doctrine, as that is, for which I shall reproue them: for when they not onely practise it, but also erroniously teach it, hereby they draw whole multitudes after them; and therefore sinnefull errour, would be snibed in them, as a riuer would be stopped in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
   <p>Perhapes thou wilt further say for them, but what is it you
<pb facs="14"/>haue against them? it seemeth by these words, that you haue some greate matter against them, which we cannot beleeue, since we know them to be men so Holy, so lerned, and euery way so qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, as we cannot say, black is their eye &amp;c. Why amongst others, these things I haue against them; In generall I challeng them, for their false and erroniouse doctrine, where with all they haue now a long time deceiued, and seduced the people of God, &amp; wherein they still stifly persist, he particulars whereof are these; by their vngodly and abhominable reiecting, of that most ancient ordinance, of Gods Sabbath, by name commanded in the Morall Law. 1. They are become companiones to those wicked. <hi>Priests,</hi> who were <hi>partiall</hi> in Gods <hi>Law,</hi> Mal. 2.9: for they deny the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity &amp; perfection of the Law, and teach it onely by halues &amp; by parceles and peeces, and so make Gods Law, a lame and defectiue Law. 2. They deny God, a parte of his holy worship and seruice, prescribed in the first Table of the Decalogue, and this they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and omit weekly. 3. They haue vtterly abolished, and by their doctrine nullified, the whole 4th Commandement, both roote and branch. 4. They haue most shamefully abused the 4th Commandement, by their most grosse, false, and erroniouse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of it; so as I neuer saw, any one portion of scripture, more corruptly and falsly expounded, by any Popish Iesuit. Whereby they worthily deserue the Title, to be called, <hi>The corrupters of Gods Law.</hi> 5. They doe shamefully abuse certaine Textes, and portions of Scripture; and that by setting Scriptures together by the eares: for they wrest certaine Scriptures of the New Testament, to the vnnecessary contradicting and ouerthrowing, of things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Decalogue and 10 Commandements of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 6. They haue and doe, most vnschollarlike, abuse the 4th Com. by applying it, to the Lords day, the which God directed properly vnto the Saturday, or 7th day of the weeke. 7. They teach and maintaine, that the <hi>Lords day</hi> is the Sabbath day, by Christ his institution; and to this purpose, they haue most vnler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly &amp; dishonestly, wrested and abused, diuerse &amp; sondry por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones of sacred Scripture, a thing which one day they must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to God for: and hereby they haue shamefully abused, many of the well affected people of the land, nursing them vp in Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, will worship, and idolatry: If I shall make these 7 things
<pb facs="14"/>good, against these 10 Ministers, as in this booke I shall, then I trust you will pardon me, if now and then, I let fale an harsh word or two, against them; and then I trust you will not blame me, for taking vp the bucklers against them, as Gods enemies, in these cases: I could not haue taken these things so euilly, at the hands of any as of puritans, nor of any puritans as of puritane Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters: for at their hands I looked for better.</p>
   <p>As for them, these 10 Ministers, I require and charge them, as they will answer it before the Tribunall of Almightie God, at the generall day of Iudgement, that they study the 4th Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment better, and other the Scriptures now in controuercy; so that they may deliuer nothing to the people, but the pure word of God, in their exposition; and that they forbeare these erroniouse doctrines, in pulpit and in priuate; yea and reuoke these their foule erroures, making a mends to the people of God, whom they haue wronged, by acknowledging the same vnto them, before either they, or any of their people departe this present life: it is no dallying with mens soules, and Gods matters. Or else, let them answer this my booke, and so honestly acquite themselues, of these things I charge them withall: it is but equall that I demaund, that they should either confirme my booke, or confute it: some of them say they will giue their liues for the Lords day Sabbath, I trust then, they will giue their laboures, which is lesse, to defend it. I doubt not, but you shall heare them make many shiftes, &amp; friuolouse excuses, that they may not answer me, as hitherto they haue done, when moued to answer my former booke; but this is but still to maintaine their credit, among the people, as if they could easily answer all, but they will not wast their time forsooth. Happily the combination of these 10 Ministers, will agree, euery man to preach an invectiue sermon or two, euery man in his owne parish, against this booke, and so raise a greate cry against me; picking partially some fewe things in my booke, to cauill at; as it is no hard matter, for a Rhetoricean, to delude the people with words; and for a Sophister, to beguile them with seeming ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and answers; but my request vnto them is, that they would answer my booke, and that punctually, from point to point; not snaching and catching here and there at things; and that they would print it, as I haue done, and so they shall stand to what they
<pb facs="15"/>say, without alterationes, and after minceings and extenuationes: An Author, may be much wronged and abused in pulpit, as I haue bene alredy by M. <hi>Chappell,</hi> reporting to the people, things out of my former booke, falsly, which I neuer wrote there; &amp; so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing their owne phantasies, in stead of my booke; and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath no remedy, but patience. To auoide the like, I desire them to forbeare pulpit confutations, and come to printed confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that so they may be answered againe.</p>
   <p>What remaineth Christian Reader, but that in the last place, I craue thy single eye and vnpartiall censure; and that you carry a minde, voide of all preiudice, &amp; euill will, either to the person or the cause, whereabouts thou art redy to be imployed in reading: Remember, we are not to receiue the word of God, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of persons; nor yet to stop the eare, and winke with the eye, least we should see and vnderstand: for so thou shalt both wrong thy selfe, and thy Author. Remember, thou art now in the place of a Iudge: for thou must reade the Controuercy of the Lords Sabbathes, pleaded <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> betwixt these 10 Ministers and mee: they against Gods Title, and I for Gods Title; they against Gods Sabbaths, and I for them: and betwixt them and mee, thou must Iudge &amp; passe sentence, now a Iudge must not be carried away with partiality, and respect to persons; nor suffer his minde to be prepossessed, with an ill will to the cause, before he heareth it: these things are but equall and right, which I craue of thee, wherefore I trust I shall obtaine with thee. This onely note, that if thou wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t suffer thy selfe to be swaied, rather on the one side, then on the other, thou oughtest rather to take in with mee, then with them: for the Sabbath day, it being an ancient ordinance of Gods, a long time in vse in his Church, therefore the cause and Title it is Gods; and since I stand in defence of this Sabbath day, therfore I stand in defence of Gods cause, and Gods Title, &amp; so side it with God: but they, setting themselues against Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, set themselues not onely against me, but also against Gods cause, &amp; Gods Title: wherfore iudge thou, whither it were better for thee, to take in with them, or with mee; against Gods cause &amp; Title, or with Gods cause &amp; Title. And so I commend thee to the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>him,</hi> who is able, to build vs vp further in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and loue of his Trueth.</p>
