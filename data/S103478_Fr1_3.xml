   <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, as there haue been diuers bookes set forth for the good of this land, and the great encrease of fruite; As of planting, setting, proy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and grafting, also of preseruing them, after the order of the Apothecary: so amongst the rest, bestowe the Reading of this little worke; wherein you shall finde the true order of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, carrying, and keeping of all sorts of fruites, in their season, and how you shall know what time your seuerall fruites are ready to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered; especially all kinde of pippins, and apples, all kinde of peares, wardens, Quinces, and Medlers, also cherries and other stone fruite whatsoeuer.</p>
   <p>I omit the nominating of all kind of fruites; for they be too many to be seuerally named. And commonly euery fruite country hath their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall names, although one kinde of fruite. As, Iohn-apples be, in some places, called Dewzings or long-lasters: and Gooddings be called old Wiues, &amp;c. Yet although not seuerally named, you shall by this Treatise know the due course how to gather all kindes in their prime and season, and afterwards to carry or conueigh them, either by land or by water, and then how to reserue or keep them, to endure longest. And, afore I proceede to the Treatise it selfe, I thinke meete to acquaint thee from whence our great plentie of fruite, in <hi>England,</hi> came.</p>
   <p>One <hi>Richard Harris</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> borne in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Fruiterer to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, fetched out of <hi>Fraunce</hi> great store of grafies, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pippins: before which time there was no right pippins in <hi>England.</hi> He fetched also, out of the Lowe Countries, Cherrie grafts, &amp; Peare grafts, of diuers sorts: Then tooke a peece of ground belonging to the King, in the parrish of <hi>Tenham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> being about the quantitie of seauen score acres; whereof he made an Orchard, planting therein all those foraigne grafts. Which Orchard is, and hath been from time to time, the chiefe Mother of all other orchards for those kindes
<pb facs="3"/>of fruites in <hi>Kent,</hi> and of diuers other places. And afore that these said grafts were fetched out of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and the Lowe Countries, although that there was some store of fruite in <hi>England,</hi> yet there wanted both rare fruite, and lasting fine fruite. The Dutch &amp; French, finding it to be so scarce, especially in these countries neere <hi>London,</hi> commonly plyed <hi>Billings-gate,</hi> &amp; diuers other places with such kinde of fruite. But now (thankes bee to God) diuers Gentlemen &amp; others, taking delight in grafting (being a matter so necessary and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial in a Cōmon-wealth) haue planted many Orchards; fetching their grafts out of that Orchard, which <hi>Harris</hi> planted called the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garden.</hi> And by reason of the great increase that now is growing in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers parts of this Land, of such fine &amp; seruiceable fruit, there is no need of any foraigne fruite, but we are able to serue other places.</p>
   <p>Now therefore, since it hath pleased Almighty God, to giue encrease &amp; plenty of fruite in this land, and that diuers haue taken paines in the maintenance thereof, of all degrees: (the better sort for their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, &amp; in that they doe delight to see the worke of their owne handes prosper, as also to eate the fruite thereof; the common sort, for profit, and for the better reliefe of their family) In regard, I say, of the great paines that haue been taken, in planting, setting, grafting, &amp; proyning, whereby a great deale of ground hath been taken vp, which might serue for other good purposes; I thought good to shew what course might bee taken, that mens Labours be not lost, nor such great quantity of groūd, wherein fruite doth growe, lye in waste (as it were) and become vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, through ignorance of well handling the fruite, after God hath giuen it.</p>
   <p>For if there be not as great care taken for the well gathering, and good vsage of fruite, as hath been for the planting thereof, I account most of the labour in planting lost, and the grounds wherein they growe to lye partly waste, and better to be vsed for some other good purpose. But, the fruite being well handled &amp; vsed, the ground can bee turned to no better profit. And so (committing both thy endeuours, and these my labours, to the blessing of God) I hasten to the Directions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
