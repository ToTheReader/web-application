<pb facs="6"/>and enstructed of men but of base byrth, thought it no shame liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and frankely to confesse, that they had receaued greater good of their base borne instructors, then of their Noble and royall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes,

To hedge and keepe in your young and tender mindes, within the lystes and boundes of Godlynesse, they deserue honesty. And though it hath beene obiected agaynst me, by some humor feeders, that christian lout is not suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as though Christians should suspect no daunger nor pretient any perill, till it dowst them in the neckes, or pat them on the pates: yet in vrging one propertie of charity yll applyed, dissembling y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rest which are many, and wherof some might be retorted vpon their own heades for their vncharitable interpretation of charitable dralings, they bewray and discouer their partiall and affectionate indgemente, or rather if they speake according to their conscience (as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded they do not) erronious opinion.

And hauing had experience of the carelesnesse of youth, and securitie of wealth, how hard a matter it is for youth and prosperity to keepe them selues within the lystes and limmits of Gods sacred will, and not to transgresse the boundes, nor leape ouer the hedges of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall decrees, statutes, and ordinaunces, onlesse they be clogged with some crosse or other, as I know you are not: I haue not of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, but of carefull circumspection, and charitable affection to preuent daungers that haue heretofore happened to others of good parentage, and well brought vp, through subtill assaultes of the gracelesse. For this cause (I saye) I haue set before your eyes the rewde and filthy practices of the vittous rascall sorte in their owne right colours, that you may see how they are to bee esteemed and see by, that is with entertaynement due to infernall furies or Diuels limmes. And also somewhat shewed vnto you the dreadfull and wonderfull indgements of God which he vseth to execute from time to time agaynst such as wantonly abuse health and wealth, or other the good guistes of God. Finally, though it seeme sharpe &amp; sower, yet refuse it not. Be assured the world is contagious and neuer (I thinke) more infected. And agaynst a strong infection, there must be giuen a strong preseruatiue, or els it will doe no good.
