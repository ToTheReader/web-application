      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>VCHE HATH been the rash and vndiscreet deling of the defendours of the Popishe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and abuses, reprooued in this little treatise, that after the preaching of this Sermō, diuers slanderous reports were giuen forth of me: whereby I am enforced in the defence of my Ministery, to bring to the view of many, that thing which at the firste I deliuered to a fewe, rather yeelding my selfe vnto the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of euery indifferent reader, then to hazard wyth silence the credit of my function to the mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes of slanderous reporters. And herein I am to desire the reader to beare with me, for that I haue not so strictly folowed my text in this place, as the nature of reading &amp; preaching requireth: but taking
<pb facs="4"/> occasiō therof to enter the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a common place, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (I pray you) that extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occasion did leade (yea rather drawe) me thervnto. For where I had begun to read and interprete the reuelation of <hi>S. John,</hi> and had in my last Lecture handled some part of this Text here recited, by reason of a contention begun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, about a remnaunt of a Roodelofte, then standing in the Churche where this Sermon vvas preached, (which Roodelofte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed wanteth nothing of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer state, but only the images and vppermost front. The loft being nine foote in bredth yet standeth, with the beame where the Roode or Idoll did stande, hauing the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles that sometimes stoode vpon the Alters placed from the beame aforesayde, downewarde vnto the loft for a Diuision, and all the neither front downeward, remaining as it did In the time of
<pb facs="4"/> popery.) A monument with small charge and lesse laboure, quicklye repayred for the idolatrie that it was firste appointed vnto. Vpon this occasion (I say) after a shorte recitall of thinges touched in my lecture last before, I tooke matter of the Candlesticks mencioned in the Text to handle the Question then in contention among vs, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the same at large as I haue layde it foorth to the view of all that shall reade it. Wherein I haue neither (as I thinke) shewed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, rashnesse, or yet plaid the part of a mad man, (as it hath pleased some to report of me) but simply and truelye, to the conuincing of popish errors and idolatrie, and to the quieting and strengthning of the weake consciences of the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of mine owne charge, layed foorth the truth for some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my dutie and function in this behalfe. But such is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie of the reedifying &amp; buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="5"/> vp of the Lordes house, as well appeareth both by the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the materiall Temple, in the dayes of <hi>Zorobabell, Iosedech, Nehemias,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Esdra. 4. Agg. 1. Nehem. 4. Ioh. 2.</note> and <hi>Esdras,</hi> where not only the forraine enemies but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so counterfeite <hi>Israëlites,</hi> did so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe and hinder the Builders, that in fortie and sixe yeares, they with much difficultie did hardlye finish the same. And the building of the spirituall house or Temple of the Lorde, but cheefely now in these euill, last, and daungerous dayes, wherein the Deuil and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist rageth extremely (because their time is but shorte) yea euen amongst vs, where the freedom in building of this House vnder a most godly and gracious Prince, (whome the Lord euer preserue) is freelye graunted: by outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as the professed Papistes, <hi>Harding, Saunders, Dorman, Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, Allen. &amp;c.</hi> with the rable of <hi>Jebusites</hi> (no Ihesuits) subuerters,
<pb facs="5"/> no sauers, doe together with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall enemies, as Atheists, Newters, counterfeit Gospellers, and dissembling Papistes, seruing the time, and seeking the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of our common Weale, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily let and hinder this heauenlye building. Wherein they do and will preuaile vntill such time, as al filthie rubbish of popish religion, be vtterly remoued and cast forth, as well from the hartes, of all such as builde and are to be builded, as from churches and all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: which the Lord Iesus▪ spedily accomplish, that we his people of <hi>Englande,</hi> may be framed an holye and acceptable building vnto him selfe, that his glorye maye euer shine among vs, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallye preserued tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the power of the same.</p>
