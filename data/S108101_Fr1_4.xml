   <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince I finished my last Booke, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>De morbo gallico,</hi> the which I presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto all the true professors of Chirurgerie, in Anno 1585. It was giuen me to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that a new Impression of my Booke was presently to passe: then I wayed with my selfe, it would be very hard for me to accomplish all things that mine intent did leade me vnto, for the correcting and enlarging of the same Booke in so short a time, (wherein I knowe are diuers faults escaped) but I promised heereafter, if God did permit me life and health, I would to my power supply all wants. So I willed the Printer to proceede, according to my former collection, for that I did sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the matter sufficient, and the wants tollerable, if it were rightly censured by men of learning and skill in the Arte. But as for the scornefull scanners, their commendations I disdayne, for I knowe they are frosen in the dregs of their owne corrupt iudgements, and therefore whilest they should speake well of me, I might be thought like vnto them: but if it shall please any good man, that is (I say) learned in the Arte, who doth espye the wants and imperfections of my Booke, that he will vouchsafe to publish an other worke of his owne collection or translation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of the same matter, then truely I will my selfe not onely yeeld him his due commendations, but also be thankefull to God that it hath pleased him to make my simple Booke the cause of the publishing of any learned worke. Which will be no doubt a benefite vnto our Countrey and common wealth, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the gaynesaying of some, who continually spit foorth poyson out of their noysome and vnsauorie mouthes, against diuers godly learned, and wel disposed persons, who haue with long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious labours published diuers Bookes of Physick and Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in English. For say these malitious men in derision and scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner, Behold, these be our late London english Writers. In deede it is sayd, that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> himselfe, being a great<note place="margin">Infallible signes of their vild dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> learned man, could not auoyde the snares of those that enuyed his diligence in the writing of his Bookes, which is so much the
<pb facs="5"/>
lesse greefe vnto me. But I answere these our backbiters, I meane, such as are gilty in this case, by desiring, that it will please them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> at their leisures, with a good conscience to walke vprightly heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and to examine most of the Works of our late London English Writers, and then I trust they shall finde no wincking at abuses, nor holding of candles before the eyes of them that are starke blinde, they haue so zealous a care vnto sinceritie, and also that our young plants may be well and sufficiently watered with lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and knowledge in the Arte. And this they haue truely, and faithfully published in English, according vnto that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of knowledge, which God of his great goodnesse hath besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpon them. Thus you may playnely perceiue the goodnesse of the tree by the fruite, but what is that, which enuy hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed, or malice hath not defiled? for enuy and malice is a most mischeuous trap or snare, wherein many heedlesse men do fall. Now followeth another sort of domesticall enemies, and these (I thinke) are leapt out of <hi>Carons</hi> Boate, and haue wilfully <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> drowned themselues in the whirlepoole of slanderous reports. And these paragons will needs treade bypaths, to seeke strange noueltyes. Yet if they were better aduised, it would not be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent vnto their credits, but they do account it odious to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, or to suffer themselues and their abuses to be spoken of: and do most idiotlike behaue themselues against <hi>Hypocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and all Galenists, whose worthy Workes being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to the view of all men, haue purchased to their Authors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the good, eternall prayses and credit for euer. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, you may easily perceiue what spirits they carrie, that thus wound the dead with speeches of defame, and yet themselues in respect, ignorant in the Arte. And some of them are scarce able to write and reade true English, but doe brag without<note place="margin">Too foule or impudent a fault in chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengers or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>auillers</note> measure (vpon a very sudden) of their excellent cunning, which happely they had stolne out of the beggerly budgets, of some counterfeite stale Peracelsian Quack saluer, or Mounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bancke, and yet moreouer do challenge, to be the true Disciples of <hi>Peracelsus,</hi> but God knowes, they are not worthy to serue vnder his regiment for pyonors: for they missinterprete <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus</hi> whome truely they vnderstand not, and condemne <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
and <hi>Galen</hi> whome they neuer read. I would no man should thinke I go heere abouts to speake against the thing that is good, neyther do I seeme to mayntayne the thing that is euill, neyther will I reward any good man with euill reports for bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and knowledge receyued, for truth is truth from whome so euer it come, be it from <hi>Hipocrates, Galen, Paracellus,</hi> or any other learned men. And therefore I say vnto such aforesayd, let not the Paynter goe beyond his pensill, nor the Shoomaker beyond his Shoo, for so his pride may haue a fall, and all his honor lye in the dust.</p>
   <p>And now good Reader, seeing mine intent is not to hold my toong at abuses, I will heere a little farther decipher the rest of these exclaiming aduersaries, which haue most impudent strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets faces, that will I thinke blush at nothing: and heere I will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> farther speake of an old cauelling companyon, and a maister of lyes, one, whome hecretofore I haue deciphered in my Booke <hi>De morbo gallico,</hi> he hath with reprochfull speeches returned agayne to his old humor, and spurned against Incarnatiues. But all those young Students, which are desirous to be satisfyed heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, amongst many other worthy Authors, reade <hi>Vigo, cap. 21. fol. 175.</hi> which Booke, Maister <hi>Baker</hi> hath partly corrected, as himselfe hath there declared, or else reade the old english Booke translated by M. <hi>Traheron,</hi> fol. 111. cap. 21. so he that is but meanely read in the Arte, may by his good indeuour and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, easily finde and knowe the true nature and properties of Incarnatiues of diuers sorts, and therefore Incarnatiues which haue beene diuised by many graue and learned men, from suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of ages, are not to be reiected at the becks of euery such like lame schoolemaister, or ridiculous ringleader, which will needes reach out his hand, and with his Momus pen leade others to seeke a Diamont with a Lincke, which could shew it selfe in the darke: but I maruell that his disciples or followers are not ashamed of so base a champion, or else one of them ashamed of another. It is sayd, that this wisard of late dreamed he was transformed like one of <hi>Acteons</hi> whelps, and that he had coursed a Collyers Cart, onely to seeke for one that had stolne away the King of the Frogs, which <hi>Iupiter</hi> sent downe in a great light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="6"/>
and thunder, which dreame, seemed to be farre more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous vnto him, then the strange Starre which <hi>Doleto</hi> sawe in <hi>Calabria:</hi> neuerthelesse, his naked name, and fayned forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of this base borne birde, I meane not further to touch: let no such bosters be your warrant what soeuer they say, for he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an ill Fisher, that cryeth stincking Fishe.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, a new adopted Chick of this old Cocke, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> very key of his counsell, is dropt out of dores vpon a sudden, and<note place="margin">This fellow is so wise in his owne conceit, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth to follow the method and wayes of eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, after <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> because they were Heathen men. I aunswere with the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the godly, wise, and learned, that he which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> a Christian, will liue as a Christian, and yet may take Physick and Surgery of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ew, if he haue skill.</note> hath plunged himselfe in the bottomlesse sea, or filthy dregs of his aforesayd Grandsires caluish iudgements and opinions: and in the verie pride and glorie of his skill, he setting himselfe as it were in the chair of ignorāce, (a fit Pulpet for such a Prophet:) did there with terrible stearne lookes, and squared speeches af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that indeed it was superstuous to vse Incarnatiues, which inuading mind and attempt did become him as well as a ring of golde in a sowes snoute, whose will wants wit through prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie to accomplish his childish intent and purpose. But now forsooth, this was vrged and brought in by the similes of dogs toongs, and <hi>Momemyasse,</hi> a very deepe wit to vnderstande mysteries, and whose capacitie heerein, he sayth himselfe, farre passeth our reach, for his mysticall knowledge, lyeth secretly hid vnder the shadowe of <hi>Apollos</hi> gorgeous cloake, and bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed in print with <hi>Esculapius</hi> golden bearde, wherein, there is neyther grosenesse, nor impurities, as there is in our Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, &amp;c. But the exalted essences foolosophically extracted by him, out of the egge of an Elephant, the marye of a whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, and the braynes of a Woodcocke, soirculate to digest in his baren head, and this is his <hi>misterium magnum,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with if he anoynt theyr eyes, then ye shall (say they) beholde certayne Spirits that inhabit or dwell in the ayre, called <hi>Nenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sareni,</hi> and <hi>Aerdadi:</hi> a high matter in a lowe house, which sore troubleth the wits of these wandering Pilgrimes, which contrarie to the direct line of equitie wrong ballans the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of good Authors, and so thinke thereby, to patch and cloute vp theyr owne silly credits, by pulling downe and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of others, and thus would they roote vp that which they neuer planted. Therefore I may rightly compare this image of
<pb facs="6"/>
enuy, and such lyke, vnto the malitious man, which desired of <hi>Iupiter</hi> he might lose one of his eyes, so that another whome he hated, might lose both his, &amp;c. but I will now blot paper, or spend time no longer to aunswere any such, for it is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to beate an Asse to death.</p>
   <p>Also, I meane to vnfolde the strange euents that succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> after the taking of a certayne pernitious pill, which pill, as it is sayd, was sprinckled abroade by an odde birde of the same neast afore rehearsed. This Pill of his, was shadowed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the vale or title of <hi>Turbith mineralis,</hi> and it is no such thing.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, it was sayd to be a <hi>Paracelsion</hi> Pill, but I am not of that opinion, for I suppose, no good or godly <hi>Paracelsion</hi> would haue giuen it to a dog. The composition of the same vile Pill Mayster <hi>Reade</hi> hath discouered in his Booke of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus</hi> lately Translated, and by him published, as a caueat for all good people to beware of that Pill. And in my simple iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Such abuse is neuer wincked at, but when idiots ruleth the rost, there the iust may be oppressed, and many a good cause troden vnder soote.</note> no good man ought to countenance, allowe, excuse, smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or conceale so perillous a medicine, sith it hath left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde it so foule and filthy broade scarres, that touched the liues of foure persons, fyrst, <hi>Iohn Butler,</hi> Mayster of a Shippe, a Barbar surgeons seruant of London, a Ropemakers boy in Rowsey, and one Master <hi>Washborne</hi> a Marchant, that dyed also in Rowsey. This cruell Pill was ministred vnto these foure persons by two simple fellowes, who were Surgeons of two Ships, which sayde, they were deluded by this crow brightfast companion, which did write it downe its their booke of secrets, with his owne hand, for a pretious iewell, and there recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to be good for all diseases. a bad pollicie, and verie ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised, but how needfull it is for all good men to beware of this Pill, let euery man iudge which hath care of his owne health, yet I do not malice the person of the man, but his filthy Pill,<note place="margin">There is no friendship to be had with such honest men.</note> although to see to, he is more fitter to be made a turnebroche, or a Scullien of a Kitchen, then to be admitted to be eyther Physition or Surgeon, but it is sayde of a learned man, if such kinde of knaues might be well punished for example sake, by the handes of the Magistrate for such offences, so should the
<pb facs="7"/>
young Students in the Arte be lesse deceyued. I do not heere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse a tale of a tub, which requireth no longer remembrance, than the view, or looking on; but a matter of such moment, which ought to be eternized in thy minde, and although I knowe he dangereth his owne welfare, that reproueth euill mens faults,<note place="margin">Not. 1.</note> and shall lye open to slaunder and reproch, yet I suppose it better to be maligned of such, then to conceale so great a mischiefe, that might otherwise ensue by the farther spreading of so vile a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicin, and therefore I must crane pardon, for I do meane heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in this whole discourse, not to shun any such rotten rootes as they come or chaunce to lye in my way.</p>
   <p>Heere I am I say farther prest and vrged to vnmaske another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of the same neast of young Snakes, or rather old suttle Serpents, who I trust in God, partly by me, and also heereafter, by the helpe of others more learned, they shall be all ferited (which way soeuer they goe) from their wicked buries, mosses, and starting holes: and farther, I would haue followed their abuses at this time, and also the abuses of others vnspoken of, but that I haue beene preuented by some speciall causes, troubles, and lets, but if heereafter they do not amend, I will discouer them to their shame, and their names. And therefore curteous and friendly Reader, note my sayings which I will openly publish, and iudge with discretion. It is not long since that a subtile deluder verie craftely, hauing vpon set purpose his brokers or espials abroade, vsing sundry secret drifts to allure many, as did the Syrens by their sweet Sonets and melody seduce Mariners to make them their pray, so did his brokers or espials deceiue many, in proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and sounding out his same abroade from house to house, as those vse to do which crye Mistresse, haue you any worke for the Tincker, at the length, they heard of one that was tormented with a quartaine, then in all post haste this bad man was brought vnto the sick patient by their craftie meanes, and so forth, without any tariance, he did compound for fifteene pound, to rid him within three fits of his Agew, and to make him as whole as a sish of all diseases: So alittle afore his fit was at hand, he called vnto the Wife of the patient to bring him an apple of the biggest size, and then with a pinne writte in the rinde of the
<pb facs="7"/>
apple <hi>Abracadabra,</hi> and such like, and perswaded him to take it presently in the beginning of his sit, for there was (sayth he) a secret in these words. To be short, the patient being hungry of his health, followed his counsell, and deuoured all and euery peece of the apple. So soone as it was receyued, nature left the disease to digest the apple, which was too hard to do, for at length, he fill to vomiting, then the core kept such a sturre in his throate, that where to fore his Feuer was ill, now much worse, <hi>a malo ad peius,</hi> out of the fryingpan, into the fire: presently there were Physitions sent for vnto the sick patient, or else his fifteene pound had beene gone, with a more pretious Iewell, but this lewde fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is better knowne at Newgate then I will heere declare. Such counterfeite Charmers, with Figures and Caracters, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galtius</hi> doth condemne, as absurd and erronious, which wicked practises he sayth becommeth no honest artist to vse, or to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.</p>
   <p>It is also sayd, that in <hi>Archadia,</hi> a Woman began to cure with wicked Charmes, without the applying of any medicines, which beeing knowne in <hi>Athens,</hi> she was condemned by the Senate to be stoned to death: a iust reward for such vngodly practises.</p>
   <p>I reade likewise of another lewde Woman, which was accused of Witchcraft, the cause was, for that she did commonly take vpon her to cure Men, Women, Children, and Beasts, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Charme, the which, they say, she would do, onely for a penny in money, and a loafe of bread. This thing was misliked of many good men in the Countrey where she did dwell, and for that cause, she was vpon suspition of Sorcery and Witchcraft, brought to the Assises, and there Arrayned for it. The simplicity of the old Woman was somewhat considered of by the whole bench, then the Iudges and the Iustices graunted her this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, that if she would truely declare vnto them What manner of Charme it was she vsed, she should be deliuered: and beeyng in great feare, and doubt of her life, forthwith in the presence of them all, declared it to be as followeth.</p>
   <p>First (sayd she) after I had receyued the penny in money, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the loafe of bread, then my Charme was this.</p>
   <list>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <head>The Charme.</head>
      <item>1. My Lofe in my lappe,</item>
      <item>2. My Penny in my pursse,</item>
      <item>3. Thou art neuer the better,</item>
      <item>4. Nor I am neuer the wurse.</item>
   </list>
   <p>Immediatly after, the Iudges with the rest perceiued it to be meere deceit, &amp; cousenage: then they did straightly charge her, vpon payne of great punishment, to leaue off her delusions, and cosening of the people, &amp; so she was discharged, as it is there said.</p>
   <p>I could speake of many other abusers of Physick and Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but what redresse would be had, I knowe not, and yet I do not meane to speake of the old Woman at Newington, beyond Saint Georges feelds, vnto whome, the people do resort, as vnto an Oracle: neyther will I speake of the Woman on the Bancke side, who is as cunning, as the Horsse at the Crosse keyes, nor yet of the cunning Woman in Seacole Lane, who hath more skill in her Colebasket, then iudgement in Vrine, or knowledge in Phisick or Surgery. But I could discouer many others, which practise Physick and Chirurgery, with the bit in their mouthes, and the raynes in their necks, which do not only thereby deceiue the simple people, but oftentimes the wisest men, and these are as hurtfull, as mothes in cloaths, or cancker rust in Iron.</p>
   <p>There are many other abusers about this City of London lurcking in corners, and sometimes they do raunge and wander <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> astray from towne to towne, from countrey to countrey both farre and neere, by sea and land, and these I suppose to be the very spawne and frye of that Rogish route, which practised Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery at Muttrell, in the time of that famous Prince King <hi>Henry</hi> the eyght, which fraternitie, and brotherhood of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of the Arte, good Maister <hi>Gale</hi> hath discouered in his Booke of the office of a Chirurgion, who sayth, that they were all banished the Campe, and if they had not auoyded with speede, they had been all hanged as theeues and murtherers.</p>
   <p>And what shall be sayd to some, which not long since haue beene commanded to prepare themselues, and with all speede to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> serue her Maiesty in the Warres, then presently with many so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne circumstances, did desire to be excused, protesting, that they had no knowledge in Surgery, but onely, for the drawing,
<pb facs="8"/>
and stopping of a tooth, letting of bloud, or for the cure of the french Rocks, and thus they did playnely throw all their skill in Surgery flat to the ground, which a little before shined most brightly in the eyes of many. But this I say is well knowne, let the seruice be once furnished with sufficient Surgeons, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is very hard to do, then they begin to shake their chaines,<note place="margin">The greatest barkers are not the best biters.</note> and keepe a stirre, that they can cure that which all the best Chirurgions in London or elsewhere do forsake, but what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of curing they vse, I may not speake that I knowe. I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse diuers of this stye, but they would say my Booke were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious: but this may suffice for a caueat. Therefore these to say the troth, may fitly be compared vnto a certaine boasting brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger dwelling beyond the Seas, which did attempt to the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the standers by, to deck on with a ciment for the<note place="margin">Truth can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, as when it is compared with deceite and falsehood.</note> nonce, a mans eare that was cleane cut off from his head, yet his glory was but short, for within two dayes, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

I would no man should heere misconstrue me, or to thinke I vrge any thing in this my whole discourse, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any good or honest artist, for my meaning is not against any such, who haue beene, and are, in the Arte, right diligent and studious for the good of our countrey &amp; common wealth, but against such, as <hi>Vesalius, Tagaltius, Vigo, Arceus,</hi> Maister <hi>Gale,</hi> Maister <hi>Hall,</hi> Maister <hi>Bannester,</hi> and such as these good men, do disalow, who haue in all their whole discourses and writings, neuer sought for vaine glory, promotion, or reward, but only by their vertues, and laudable studies, to make knowne the vndiscret, and vaineglorious brags, friuolous vantings, peeuish practises, and wicked dealings, of a sort of abusers of the arte and good artists. And I suppose no honest man else, which is a true artist, but doth, and will also detest and hate all such caterpillers, which suck the sap and eate the bread out of the mouthes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a good Surgeon, who haue been very much decaied by reason of such ill persons, to the great impouerishment, not only of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but likewise of their poore Wiues and children. Which men are well known, if ability were answerable to their willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and skill, to doo her Maiesty very good seruice in the Arte,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>

   <p>Now time calleth me to an end of this Epistle to the Reader, and of a part of the generall discourses of abuses and abusers of the Arte, and all good artists, and I will conclude with the last and the very worst of all sorts, and they are those, that with<note place="margin">The more ignorant they are, the more bolder they are, and yet hate to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

I perceiue, it was not without great cause, that <hi>Plinie</hi> complayned, and sayd, <hi>Lyke as there is no light without a shadow, no more is vertue without enuy,</hi> but by Gods good grace, I will returne their speeches vpon their owne heads. <hi>Chilo</hi> the learned Philosopher sayd, <hi>That in Bookes you shall finde written the veritie and truth of things secret and vnknowne, the which time can neuer consume, nor fortune destroy,</hi> happy is that man which escapeth such <hi>Ciclops</hi> dens, without danger of the fluxe of their foule mouth, but I say vnto them whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be, that onely their naked experience which they so<note place="margin">The foolish perswasion of naked expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, hath deceyued a great many.</note> brag of, without learning in the Arte, may sitly be compared to a tree without fruite. The first beginners of their sect of bussard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Empricks, I reade was <hi>Philinus Cous. Acro. Agrigenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>Alexandreus,</hi> with others. And farther it is sayd, that their experience is nothing worth, that is not grounded vpon reason, the mother of all Artes and Sciences, and reason and knowledge is gotten and made ripe by reading and weighing the well obserued practises, and meditated rules of the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of learned men, and diligent artists in time, gone before vs, heereunto (I say) ioyning our owne practise, we get vs the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>re prompt and excellent vnderstanding, how to put things in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable execution▪ and thus both reason and experience matched togethers, maketh a perfect artist, and he that denieth this, hath neither wit, arte, good experience, nor honestie▪ and so I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the reading of good Authors, is the schoole of wise men, for learning, and knowledge, is the most rare gift of God, which maketh men become famous vpon earth: for example, as approoued Historyes do report, <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> were well
<pb facs="9"/>
knowne to be two famous Philosophers, though they were the sonnes of two poore Citizens of Athens, for their well occupied minds in learning and knowledge aduanced them to great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, as it may appeare by their great renowme, large volumes, and infinite labours, remayning still vnto posterities, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is as possible for an Owle to encounter with an Eagle, or a Wren with a Faucon, as for such boysterous blockheads, with their wodden practises, grounded onely vpon experience, the schoolemistresse to fooles, who with vnequall comparisons, do challenge men of reason and knowledge in the Arte, with their beaderowles of infamy, folaryes, fables, and old wiues tales, long bred and nousled vp in the storehouse of abuses, but it is a most true saying, and it is in these dayes come to passe, that euery peeuish <hi>Pan</hi> will compare with learned <hi>Apollo,</hi> but with spite and hatred in their harts, euery <hi>Momus</hi> will assayle <hi>Minerua,</hi> with rayling priuely behinde mens backs, and euery <hi>Zoylus</hi> will barke at <hi>Cicero,</hi> with open iniurie in their deedes.</p>
   <p>But</p>
   <lg>
      <l>Ye may not feare such enemyes</l>
      <l>To Arte, and Authors good,</l>
      <l>Who though they fawne in flattery,</l>
      <l>Yet thurst they for your bloud.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>For these haue watcht full priuely,</l>
      <l>Such is their vile desire,</l>
      <l>Care yee not for their courtesey,</l>
      <l>Ne force yee of their yre.</l>

   <lg>
      <l>This warning for a caueat,</l>
      <l>To mee it shall suffice,</l>
      <l>Except to those that will not see.</l>
      <l>A word may serue the wise.</l>

   <p>But our good God, which hath euer defended vs from the raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">Beware of hypocrisie, shadowed vnder the cloke of frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</note> iawes of such dangerous foes, or smiling serpents, which with stealing steps, do sowe the seeds of sedition, with the hands of <hi>Briarious,</hi> will returne all the euils which they do worke

vpon their owne heads. Thus (good Reader,) I will through Gods assistance, proceede to the accomplishing of this small Treatise, notwithstanding their great threatnings to kill with Dagger, Sword, or Battle axe, but I little esteeme of such, sith these my labours seemed in the opinions of men, both godly, wise, and learned, not to be vnprofitable, or vnworthy to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, for the benefit of all yong Students in the Art, whose Readings and practises, I wish most willingly that God may prosper.
