      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not vnknowne to thee, kind Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the last yeare I published in our English t ngue a<note n="*" place="margin">Called the arraignement of vrines.</note> discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this same subiect of Vrines; wherin were contained the manifold abuses committed by diuerse sorts of persons, builded only vpon this rotten foundation of inspection of Vrines, as is ordinarily vsed, there at great length prosecuted, with the originall of this error, and many instances of such errors there at length related, the vnsufficiencie of this signe alone set forth, and prouing the necessitie of the Physitians presence with his patient, if it be possible. Afterwards also were set downe diuerse scopes and indications requisite for the cure of the disease, prescription of remedies vpon the bare inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the vrine onely, reproued, together with diuers other things there at great length to be seene. In the Prefaee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I engaged my selfe for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e publication of a second part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this same subiect, after a more particular manner. And of this I purposed to haue made thee partaker about a twelue moneth ago, according as the catalogue then made mention, but that some rubs haue vntill now robbed me of the effecting my purpose.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Summe and substance of this whole discourse</note>In this therefore I enter into a narrow suruey of all the seuerall parts of vrine, which for this cause I call the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie of vrines.</hi> Now whereas for breuitie I haue passed by the seuerall significations, and vncertaintie of some colours
<pb facs="89"/> of vrines, to wit, such as do decline from any one extreame, what concerneth the same, may easily, by that which hath bene said of the same extreame, be vnderstood. Now if any shall enquire what is the cause I spend so much time about this subiect: I answer, it is by reason of the old inueterate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, or rather errour, which most people haue conceiued concerning this strumpet; whom for this cause I haue here vnmasked, and layed open to the view of euery one that will not shut his eyes in the cleare Sunne-shine; and that to the end that none may be circumuented by the fraud and coze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of such as abuse her for their owne benefit. But lest any should imagine these things to be but fancies fetcht from mine owne braine, therefore not contented to set down mine owne positiue opinion, I haue both backt, fortified and flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it with the bulwarks of the best writers of ancient and later times, whose owne words I haue truly translated, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting thee likewise, learned Reader, to the marginall quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, where for thy recreation and better satisfaction, not the names of the authors onely, and the particular places, but the very words of the originall are often set downe, that so it may more euidently appeare, that this latter iurie finds her guiltie, as the former great enquest after the inditement found <hi>Billa vera.</hi> The condemnation must then of necessitie follow, since the parties offending hauing had these three last assizes allowed them to pleade for themselues, haue said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. This sentence I referre to this<note n="*" place="margin">The hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Court of Parliament.</note> sage assembly, who, as I hope, will take this publicke businesse, as a matter of no small moment, into their serious considerations. But me thinkes I heare some say, what is then the vse of vrines in discerning of diseases? or serueth it for no vse at all? I answer, that so farre am I from abrogating this so ancient and necessarie a signe, receiued by all our ancient and late writers, which I do highly esteeme, and account of the same being rightly
<pb facs="90"/> vsed, howbeit as it is commonly vsed, it is most shamefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused.</p>
   <p>The right vse of vrine<note place="margin">The right vse of vrines.</note> then is, together with all the rest of the signes and seuerall circumstances of the disease (in such diseases I meane where it is of any force or validitie, in some diseases being of no vse at all) to giue vs notice of the nature, together with the changes and alterations, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise what is like to be the issue of the same. The Physitian is therefore first to enquire diligently into the nature of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, together with all the other signes and circumstances thereof: and then, comparing all together, to giue forth his best and most assured iudgement. Most foolish therefore and absurd is the sottish custome of the countrey people<note place="margin">Foolish custom of the countrey people.</note> now a dayes, bringing the vrine to the Physitian, it may be in some old oylie or inkie bottle, and then to demand of him as of some <hi>Delphian oracle,</hi> the whole nature of the disease, the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents age, and diuerse other things wherewith they ought to acquaint vs, as also with all the other signes and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the disease: euen as the client is to lay open his cause to the Lawyer, how learned soeuer, and skilfull in his profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. It is yet not vnworthie the obseruation, that one and the same vrine hath often diuers and seuerall significations, and therefore vnlesse by diuerse other signes and circumstances limited, can neuer affoord vs any certaintie, as hereafter both in the colours and contents the ensuing discourse shall make manifest. And thus may the right vse to the wise and vnderstanding easily appeare; especially to such as haue bene or yet shall hereafter be admitted vnto such mysteries. And therefore ignorant Empiricks, women, and many other such, haue no share or interest in these affaires, as not being able to diue into the depth of the premisses. And as for cleargie men, they cannot be ignorant, that they ought to be employed about businesses of an higher nature. And if they will haue a care
<pb facs="90"/> of the soules entrusted to them, they need not trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with their bodies. Now that one signe, in some disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses onely to be obserued to be of any vse, should with a Papall prerogatiue assume all authoritie vnto it selfe, is both against common sense, daily experience,<note place="margin">The pulse in many diseases to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the vrine.</note> and the authorities of the learned. The pulse will pleade for a preheminence aboue the vrine: and to iudge of this, as of a number of other signes, it will of necessitie require the Physitians presence. Now that the vrines in many diseases, and those of vndoubted danger, do often shew thee no more then the ground thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est on; and that many other signes besides are of necessitie to be obserued, hath bene at great length related in the former tractate, and shall yet more plainly and particularly in this which followeth appeare. And for thy more particular infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I haue set downe the seuerall significations of vrines, and that according to the opinions of such Authors as haue written of them; together with some particulars which haue neuer yet bene published by any English writer that I haue as yet seene, as by the contents of the bookes and chapters may appeare. Some things also which haue bene by others written and auouched for vncontrolled truths, I haue confuted as false and erronious: and that, as I thinkt, by vnanswerable arguments, illustrating the same with varietie of ancient and recent authorities, together with plentie of pertinent examples, being true historicall relations, obserued both by my selfe and other Authors: the which howsoeuer they do not simply proue; yet do they not a little illustrate the matter in hand, and make it more perspicuous to the meaner sort. Now whereas I sometimes insert something of the ignorance and vnsufficiencie of some offenders, some may, perhaps, reply, that it may sometimes befall a good Physitian to faile as well as any of them. I confesse Indeed, <hi>Bernardus non videt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia: He is a good horse that neuer stumbled.</hi> Neuer to
<pb facs="91"/> faile is a priuiledge denyed to any of the ofspring of sinfull Adam:<note place="margin">Quandoque bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus dormitat Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus. Horat.</note> howbeit the learned Physitian building vpon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and experience, keepeth alwayes an orderly and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall course in all his proceedings: and if he may sometimes erre (as being a man and not a God) how much more then an ignorant Empiricke, a shee-Physitian (such a one as now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in Northamptonshire, and in whom I wonder that any that hath any braines in his head can see any sufficiencie) that I say nothing of a medling Minister that neuer was trained vp in that profession; shall they I say be obnoxious to error in so intricate an Art, wherein they haue no interest, as being meere vsurpers vpon other mens right? Besides, the vulgar not being able to iudge of the sufficiencie of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Physitian, preferreth often the paines of some ignorant Empiricke, (soothed vp it may be by the successe of some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall cure) before the labors of the most learned &amp; honest ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist. But my meaning is here of an ordinary erronious course of practising, euē against the rules of art, &amp; the very grounds &amp; principles of this physicall profession. Of such errors I could haue set downe a multitude, besides those few which I had by relation, either from the patients themselues, or else from some of their most familiar friends and acquaintances, who haue protested, that they will be readie to iustifie the same vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their oathes.<note place="margin">Casuall cures sometimes suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, do not proue a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thus practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</note> Neither yet let this suffice, that some of their proctors pleade for them a number of happy and successefull euents; since that thus we may often magnifie the most vile wizard, and most ignorant old wife in the countrey: this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument taken from issue and euent being a meere Paralo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme, a fallacie and deceit, taking that often for a true cause which is no cause indeed, as in the conclusion of this discourse shall more plainly appeare. And in this I appeale to the learned and honest Artist, not to such a persons parasite, who taketh for good and current coyne what soeuer commeth
<pb facs="91"/> out of his mint, nor yet their otherwise honest, yet in this point, too partiall patients, in this particular blinded with the mist of ignorance, or a preiudicate opinion of such mens supposed sufficiencie, they themselues not being able herein to discerne betwixt right and wrong.</p>
   <p>Now that this hath bene no<note n="a" place="margin">An vsual &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie custome to browbeat &amp; ouerthrow er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and to pleade for truth.</note> vnusuall custome to brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat and ouerthow errors, euen in this profession, and for the maintaining of truth to pleade against imposture, might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily, as well by ancient as later authorities, be euinced, which would be too tedious here to relate. But amongst many, one late writer I cannot passe by (the learned <hi>Libauius</hi> I meane) who hath wrestled with many such monsters; as namely <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelius, Hartmannus, Scheunemannus,</hi> the impudent Priest <hi>Gramauus,</hi> and that famous, I meane infamous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor <hi>Ambaldus,</hi> author of that counterfeit<note n="b" place="margin">This Panacae a was a certaine medicine made of saffron, quick siluer, vermili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, antimonie, and certaine sea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shels made vp in fashion of trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular lozenges, stamped and sealed with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine strange characters, and sold at a very deare rate, the very name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting as much as a medicine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and was in as great, or greater esteeme among the Germanes, as euer Aurum potabile once here amongst our selues. <hi>Liban. contrae Ambald &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fens. syntagm. a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And haue we not of late dayes had here at home<note n="c" place="margin">D. Gwin. &amp; D. Raleigh <hi>against</hi> aurum potabile, D.

      </note> some maintainers of truth and opposers of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, some liuing euen at this day? And against this same abuse in particular, besides <hi>Forest, Euritius Cordus</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in Latine a learned booke: so did likewise <hi>Guilielmus Adolphus Scribonius,</hi> the learned <hi>Langius</hi> in some of his Epistles, and many others also, as hereafter shall appeare. But I am not ignorant, that whosoeuer will publish any thing in this last and learned age, cannot chuse but vndergo the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of many iudges, as witnesseth the worthie<note n="d" place="margin">Hieron epist. <hi>132.</hi> partis tertia referente Langio.</note>
      <hi>Ierome.</hi> Some will perhaps say the stile is too meane and plaine: and others, if there were any elegancie in it, would cry out, he
<pb facs="92"/> playes the Orator (perhaps odious in handling vrines) not the Physitian. And some preoccupied with a partiall and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicate opinion, like the diseased of some cholericke feauer, to whō the sweetest things seeme bitter: so whatsoeuer fruite groweth in some mens gardens, be it neuer so good, will giue no content to some mens ouer curious &amp; nice relishes: so hard a thing is it to practise this one point, <hi>Omnibus placeto.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Howsoeuer, kinde Reader, if thou come with a desire to submit thy selfe to the rules of reason, to haue thy iudgement rectified if erronious, and with an earnest desire to be fully informed of the truth, let not my labour be lost, but peruse, I pray thee, this tractate, wherein thou mayest perhaps finde something for thy satisfaction. And howsoeuer, perhaps, the cookerie may not giue thee full content, yet remember the matter is but meane, in the which I haue had a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the matter it selfe, then to the curious manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering the same; and a greater care to satisfie the simplest vnderstandings (for whose cause I haue principally pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished these my paines) then with the ornaments of an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to please the eares of the most learned. <hi>Optimum condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum fames: A good appetite needeth no sauce.</hi> The Germanes in diuerse places of Saxony, in stead of currants bake their cakes with blacke Poppy seeds: and in stead of stewed broth boyle wilde or horse radishes with their beefe. The French findeth a good rellish in his soure sauces: and a Spaniard maketh often as great account of a Lemmon, as an English man of a peece of powdered beefe. Whatsoeuer it is, and howsoeuer liked, yet my principall purpose was and is to profit the publicke. If I should pleade a priuiledge from back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters, and immunitie from malignant tongues, I should sue for that which hath bene denyed the greatest and worthiest personages of ancient and later times. And some varlets haue bene found, who would rather fire the famous temple of
<pb facs="92"/> Diana, then not minister matter to talke of them. And as for my selfe, I deny not but I shall find some of the offenders here mentioned, who will snarle and grumble at my so plaine and vnpartiall reprouing of their faults. Some, who should haue shewed better example, conscious to themselues of their owne guiltinesse, haue broken the ice already, &amp; as I am informed, haue much repined at the Preface of my former tractate.<note place="margin">Iohn 18.23.</note> * <hi>If I haue spoken euill beare witnesse of the euill: but if well, why smitest thou me?</hi> If they can iustifie their actions, let them publish their apologie, and let the Reader iudge.
