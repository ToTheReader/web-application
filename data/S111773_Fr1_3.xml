      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthye praise, to confesse and declare the woorkes of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie GOD, as the blessed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell sayd vnto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Thoby. And therfore they that sawe the miracle done by our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oure Christ vpon the man that was both deafe and dōme, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored vnto his sight, and also to his speach, although they were bidde to make no wordes thereof, yet they consideringe the excellencie of the miracle, and perceiuinge the humilitie of the doer of the same, as intendinge more the occultation of his facte, for the auoidinge of worldlie praise, to geue vs example of like humilitie, then to hide his gratious cure, as thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge they shoulde not haue done well to let suche a marueilous worke vanish to obliuion, were the bu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sier to diuulge and publishe, not onelie that miracle, but others withall, sayinge: <hi>Bene omnia fecit, &amp; surdus fecit audire, &amp; mutos loqui.</hi> This man hath done all thinges
<pb facs="4"/>
wel, he hath made the deafe to heare, and the dōme to speake. So I cōsidering that it hath pleased almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God of his plentuous mercie and goodnes, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen my mouth, and to make me occupied in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge his holie worde nowe by the space of fortie yeares and more, I thoughte it not good to permitte such matters as I haue (throughe Goddes helpe) set forth in my sermons, vtterly to rotte and perishe, and lest (as the morall Poete saieth) <hi>Deferar in uicum, uendentē thus, &amp; arhoma,</hi> I haue therfore perusing, yea rather su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiallie runninge ouer suche sermons as I haue preached in times past, founde much good matter in them, right worthie to be had in memorie, and so compact and set together, that nowe in my olde age I reioyce in God that gaue me his gratious gift, so to trauayle in suche studie while I was yonge and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie. These my longe labours hath be in the mooste troubleous time, and moste cumbarde with errours and heresies, chaunge of mindes and scismes that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was in this realme for so longe time together, that any man can rede of. VVhile I was a yonge stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in diuinitie, Luthers heresies rose and were scat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tered here in this realme, whiche in lesse space then a man woulde thinke, had so sore infected the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten flocke, first the youth, and consequentlie the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, where the children coulde sette the fathers to scole, that the kinges maiestie, and all the catholike clerkes in the realme had muche a do to extinguishe them, which yet they could not so perfitlie quenche, but that euer still when they might haue any main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce by men or women of greate power, they
<pb facs="4"/>
burste out a freshe, euen like fire hidde vnder chaffe, whiche sometimes amonge will flame oute and do hurt if it be not loked to. Against such errours with their appēdeceis I haue inuehied ernestlie and oft in my sermons in disputations and reasoninge with the protestauntes, vntill I haue be put to silence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by general prohibitions to preache, or by name, or by captiuitie and imprisonment, of all whiche (I thanke God) I haue had my parte. And yet euer whē I might haue any clere time, I haue retourned to the same exercise more vehementlie then afore, and so will do while I may haue strength to speake. And because these sermons were made in Englishe, and toucheth sometimes amonge, suche heresies as hath troubled English folke, I thought it best to set them forth in suche language as might presentlie best edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the multitude. Moreouer pleaseth you to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised, that when I shoulde preache in any solēpne and learned audience, I euer fearinge the labilitie of my remembraunce, vsed to pen my sermons muche like as I entended to vtter them to the audience: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers I scribled vp not so perfitlie, yet sufficientlie for me to perceiue my matter and my processe. And of these two sortes I haue kept (as grace was) a greate multitude, whiche nowe helpeth me in this my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise of imprintinge a boke of my saide exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Moreouer I haue made innumerable exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at my cures, and in other places where I haue dwelled, and in the countreis there aboute, and in my iourneis, where it hath chaunced me to be on sondaies, or other holie daies, of whiche I haue no
<pb facs="5"/>
signes remaininge in writinge, althoughe I thinke verelie some of them were as fruitfull, as others in whiche I toke more labours, I praye God they maye be written and registred in the boke of life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinge. And when I shoulde preache oftentimes in one place, I vsed not to take euery day a distinct epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle or gospell, or other text, but to take some proces of scripture, and to prosecute the same, part one day and parte another daye, and so you shall perceiue by my declaration of the .vii. giftes of the holy Gooste, whiche I preached at Redcliffe crosse, in the good and worshipfull citie of Bristow, in sundry sermons, although I was interrupted many yeares by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacie of Hughe Lathamer, then aspiringe to a bisshopriche, and after beinge bishop of worceter, and ordinary of the greatest part of the sayd Bristow, and infecting the whole. And so by the exposition of the first epistle of S. Peter, whiche I preached also in manye sermons at the cathedrall Churche there, where I am one of the Canons, in this also I was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times and longe discōtinued by the odious scisme that was nowe lately, and by the doers of the same. And in like maner in the Cathedrall Churche of welles, on the first and second sondaies of Aduent, on Axe wednisdaye, and others, and there I lacked no trouble by bishop Barlowe and his officers, of which suche as be not perfourmed, I intend (if it shall please God) to perfourme and finishe hereafter.</p>
