   <head>To my ever honour'd Sir <hi>T.</hi> S. Barronet, upon his <hi>Joseph.</hi>
   </head>
   <lg>
      <l>SO the sweet singer did of <hi>Israel</hi> use,</l>
      <l>In holy Layes to exercise his Muse:</l>
      <l>Praysing his God, for wonders in the Land</l>
      <l>Of <hi>Egypt</hi> by his servant <hi>Moses</hi> hand.</l>
      <l>Then with Gods mercies sweetly closing there,</l>
      <l>The soule at once he ravish't, and the ear.</l>
      <l>But so long since is that, that there be those,</l>
      <l>Make scruple yet whether in Verse or Prose,</l>
      <l>The Prophet wrote, as if a measur'd line</l>
      <l>Were more unfit to treat of things divine.</l>
      <l>Such heretiques of Poetry by chance,</l>
      <l>Will in their censure shew their ignorance</l>
      <l>Of this thy labours worth, when they shall hold</l>
      <l>It as a fruitlesse work, if not a bold:</l>
      <l>Deeming the sacred flames that thus inspire</l>
      <l>Thy brests with holy raptures, a strange fire.</l>
      <l>And count thee as prophane, that dar'st rehearse,</l>
      <l>The majestie of Scripture in a Verse.</l>
      <l>Whilst men of abler judgments, that descry</l>
      <l>This last worst ages curious nicety</l>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <l>Such, that Gods sacred word, the heavenly bread</l>
      <l>Of life, by most is dully relished,</l>
      <l>Vnlesse in oyle or honey dipt, they know,</l>
      <l>He whom the holy Ghosts first penman so</l>
      <l>Extolled, as the type of Christ, and square</l>
      <l>Of vertues, for all graces singular;</l>
      <l>Had slept the subiect of our coy neglect,</l>
      <l>As buried in the Scribes grave dialect:</l>
      <l>And <hi>Iosephs</hi> goodnesse, such, some few alone</l>
      <l>Professors, and Precisians had knowne;</l>
      <l>Had not thy bounteous Muse thus set him forth</l>
      <l>In fashionable garbe, to speake his worth</l>
      <l>In moderne tone; now by thy helpe he may</l>
      <l>Converse with Courtiers, in a Coat as gay</l>
      <l>As er'st his Father made him; he may kisse</l>
      <l>Each coyer Ladies hand, nor can he misse</l>
      <l>Admission, or audience to tell</l>
      <l>His story to the best, or worst; so well</l>
      <l>He charmes attention: by his sweet and smooth</l>
      <l>Expressions, so pathetically soothes</l>
      <l>His hearers to receive his sugred pils,</l>
      <l>Whil'st at their ravish't eares and eyes he instils</l>
      <l>His modesty into their soules; and so</l>
      <l>Doth <hi>Ioseph's</hi> story told 'mongst high and low,</l>
      <l>With greater efficacy, vertue teach,</l>
      <l>By's paterne, then best precepts we can preach.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>In briefe, I iudge thy Poem to be such,</l>
      <l>So good, so pleasant, that I dare avouch,</l>
      <l>The reader that no profit reapes by it,</l>
      <l>Or pleasure, hath nor piety, nor wit.</l>
      <l>Hold on this godly course, thy talent spend</l>
      <l>By tickling thus our eares, our heart; to mend.</l>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <l>And when thy budding Springs, spare houres bring forth</l>
      <l>Such fruit, how great shall be thy harvests worth,</l>
      <l>When thy green youth could so exactly trace</l>
      <l>Good <hi>Iosephs'</hi> perfect wayes; well may thy grace</l>
      <l>In riper yeares, as his recorded be,</l>
      <l>A Mappe of vertues to posterity.</l>
