      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Honourable good Lord, it was once an Axiome in the Ethnicke Schooles <note n="*" place="margin">To a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis vita mortis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatio.</note>, that the whole life of a wise man should be a continuall meditation of Death; which, as it was a Principle amongst them, so it was the practise, not onely of the Saints and Seruants of GOD, the auncient Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes, Primitiue Christians, retyred Hermites, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Anchorites, and zealous professors of Religion: but euen of the wisest and worthiest of the Heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.

<pb facs="4"/>
his Sickenesse, and Distempers, the fruits of his sinne, and preambles of his death; Gods Statute-Law, that he should returne to his earth, tolde him truely (contrary to the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="4"/>
Patriarkes made <note n="k" place="margin">
         <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.4 5.</note>, and the possessions which they most frequently mention.</p>
   <p>What should I mention these Fathers that liued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; <hi>Ioshuah</hi> the sonne of <hi>Nun,</hi> the Seruant of the LORD; faithfull <hi>Caleb; Aaron</hi> the Lords high Priest; or <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe, the greatest of Legall Prophets, who mindefull of his mortalitie, euen before the Lord tolde him (as hee did <hi>Ezekias</hi>) that hee should dye, made that Prayer, which the Fathers say the people of GOD vsed daily as a forme of Prayer, pathetically inserting this Petition <note n="l" place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 90.12</note>, that God would <hi>so teach them to number their dayes,</hi> that they might <hi>apply their hearts to wisedome</hi>: the rest succeeding sympathizing in the like thoughts? <hi>Iob</hi> wayting till his changing should come <note n="m" place="margin">

Further good, further gaine then these, in these I desire not, I require not, besides satisfaction to mine owne soule, and comfort in my conscience, in deliuering in this Tractate, the very Image and Idea of mine owne thoughts, which as constantly as vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke vpon this sad and sable subiect of Death, euery day more and more occasioned by the preparatiues to it, and summons of it, the crosses of life, chiefely from the discouragements and discomforts of an vngratefull and vngratious world, in that part of my life, which is eyther Morrall or Ministeriall, concerning my Person or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. 2. In respect of others, from the obligation of loue, I desire to lend the best light that is in mee (being originally fetcht from the word) to lead them thorow the darke wildernesse of the world, euen in the very sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, to their Canaan, shewing all along in this Passage and Pilgrimage, to the weake and willing Christian, the Amalekites, and the Amorites, &amp;c. the World, with her warres, weapons, horrours, terrours, breuitie, miserie, vanitie; fitting them to fight, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them to their desired rest, by meditating of death, and preparation for death.</p>
   <p>Which points and parts, with their seuerall adiuncts, as they are penned and published for the behoofe and benefit of all in generall, so more specially (as in my first designes and desires I did both pretend and intend) in all dutious and deuoted affection, I humbly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them vnto your Lordships perusall, protection, and practise, and that for sundry and weighty Motiues.</p>
   <p>First, in respect of the subiect here intreated of, which

   <p>Secondly, in respect of the sympathie and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt your Honour, and those Heroes, <hi>Moses,</hi> and old <hi>Simeon</hi>; the one a Magistrate, the other a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, both Prophets, both great, both good, both truely Noble, (like those Beraeans <seg rend="sup">x</seg>,) in the best and new birth: the one walking with God, and comming in as
