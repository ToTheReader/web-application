   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll persons bearing affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the Common wealth of these Countreyes, desire to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of the oppressions, which the warre of necessity leadeth and bringeth with it. But this desire is onely a generall discourse. For the effects of the same are hindred styll, and heretofore haue bene interrupted by an irresolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which happeneth not (as many haue thought,) by the faulte of the cheefe Captaynes and Gouernours, who, haue so often, bothe by woord of mouth, and wrytinges in print declared, what counsell was meete to be taken, and with so great paynes and dillygence sent into all the Prouinces, yea, and transported themselues thyther in their proper persons.</p>
   <p>But the fault thereof is to be imputed to the particular Commynalties, the greatest parte whereof doo order their matter with extreme delayes. The causes of such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes are diuerse. But the principall of the same is, that some subtyll and wylie fellowes amongst vs, of the same humour that these were of (whose Letters thou shalt see heere.) When they counterfeyted the good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen with vs, doo feede vs with a vayne hope of peace, eyther by the way of Spayne, or Almayne, or by some other meanes? Hoping, that as already vnder coulour of peace, they haue deuided the prouinces of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toys,
<pb facs="3"/> and Haynault from vs: so they will bring the lyke to passe amongst the other Prouinces, that are yet at vnitie. But if those thinges which we learne by the confession of our enemies, ought to be taken for a trueth: thou shalt know freendly Reader, by these Letters, that we may not any longer looke for peace with the king of Spayne, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we will yet suffer our selues to be burnt. And therfore it remayneth that we make good prouision to defend our selues valiauntly by all meanes possyble, yea, to repulse the force that we see repayring for our ruine: Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if the Spaniardes obtayne the kingdome of Portugall. Which God forbyd.</p>
