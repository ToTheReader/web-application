   <p>IF it had not been, gentle I. C. for your earnest intreatie, whose
wordes might commaunde mee, I assure you, that these three
trifles had not come vnto the handes of any reader, for feare of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
which I doubt that they shall incurre, by meanes of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull
reader. But beeinge perswaded that they shall neuer bee
red of any, (you only excepted, and your louing Brother) I haue
taken the paine, (which for your cause, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> accompt but a sporte) for
to set them downe in the forefrunt. Partly for that they fight
all vnder one Ensigne: Partly for that the other which follow,
bee written vnto sundry persons. Let mee therfore gentle I. C.
intreate you to kepe these close, lest they come to the handes of
them which may for the publishing of them, bee by right moued
with mee. Fare you well.</p>
