      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese Lectures which I haue for so many yeares kept by me, and refused to let them see the light (as iudging them both vnworthy in themselues to be brought into publike view, and altogether needlesse also, though they had beene much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in an age that doth so abound with all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of excellent gifts, both for preaching and writing) I am now at length (though the importunity of sundry, that thinke better of them then my selfe could euer doe;) enforced to giue way that they may be published. And this I haue done the more willingly, that I might haue opportunity by this Dedication of them, to giue publike testimony vnto the world, of my duty and thankefulnesse vnto your Honour, and vnto your Noble House; vnto whom (next vnder God) I doe owe whatsoeuer poore abilities he hath beene pleased to giue vnto me, for the seruice of his Church. For as that noble Vncle of yours (whom his wisedome and seruiceablenesse to his Prince and Country, euen with the great neglect of his owne estate and family, and specially his zealous care to promote the Gospell of Christ, did make much more honourable, then the noblenesse of this great birth could possibly doe) did first maintaine me in the Vniuersity, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brought me to the exercise of my ministry in this place; so haue I beene by the fauour and bounty of your noble Grandfather, and of

your Honour continued here, now more then forty yeares. And vnto your honour especially aboue all other men, is thankes due, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer benefit may redound to the Church by these Lectures: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of that incouragement I did receiue from your Lordship in the preaching of them, not only by your honourable beneficence in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of me, and confirming that vnto me, which by the bounty of your noble Ancestors I did enioy, but by that worthy example also you gaue vnto all my Auditory in your constant and diligent fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting of them. Which as you would neuer haue done if you had not liked them well, or if you had heard any thing taught in them that did disagree with the Doctrine of our Church, or that had any way tended vnto schisme or faction: so haue you made me the more bold euen in this respect, humbly to commend the patronage of them vnto your Honour. Now the Lord of Lords (who hath already made you truly honourable, not by your Progenitors onely, but by many noble endowments bestowed vpon your selfe, and hath promised also to honour them that honour him:) continue and multiply all his graces and blessings vpon your Lordship, and vpon your family, to the increase of your present and euerlasting comfort, through IESVS CHRIST. So prayeth still:</p>
