      </note> which S. Paule termeth spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall craftines in heauenly things. Which thing is most euidēt in these last messengers of hys, the Iesuites or rather Iebusites, the verye dregs of the bottomlesse pitte, led by the vncleane spirite of error, which do not a little disturbe the poore flock of Christ, maruelously disquiet and trouble the consciences of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and occupie with noueltie the heads of the multitude by their secreate conferences, where they haue accesse: and by their pamflets and libelles spread abroade, where they thēselues cannot come: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is adioined one other perilous mischiefe, namelye the workinge hand of the dissembling Papist, and Atheist, whereof the one being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed withall from the Pope to conforme themselues often times
<pb facs="3"/>outwardlye vnto the lawes, that thereby they maye the safelier and without suspition further the Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall attempted enterprise, is the verie mischiefe of our time.

These they be (right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Earle) that are the verye poyson of our time. The Pope by his Iesuites and seminaries, without these is altogether lame and can do nothinge. The simple papistes all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe obstinate, and refuse for conscience to come to the churche, in respecte of these are nothinge. These vnder color of law dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and impudently impugne Gods lavve, these deface the preachers, discredite the ministerie, seduce &amp; deceyue the people, so that where

There is nothinge but brawles and contention, there the people haue their mindes alienated from the preacher vnprepared to receiue the Gospell, and very ready for these seminarie Iesuites. Thys poysoned infection (righte noble Earle) must either haue a speedie &amp; strong purgation, or els it wil breed into an incurable leprosie. It is now past recouerie by preaching &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell of the minister. For thereof is made either a skoffe or els a matter of course without fruite, therefore the swoorde and authoritie of the stronge magistrates, ioyned with a feruent zeale of Gods trueth, must cure this infection: the preacher is too much in contempt, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior magistrate too weake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie this mischiefe, which if it be not in time prouided for, will bring this florishinge realme and churche
