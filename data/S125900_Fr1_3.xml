   <p>hauing receaued your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I thought it no lesse then my duety too performe and graūt your reasonable request wherefore it may please you to vnderstand that the ninthe of April last past this admired Monster was brought into the world, to the great amasement of all those that beheld it, but to obserue decorum it is requisit before I speake or write thereof, that I should shewe some circumstances whiche went before the birthe thereof thereby to make the matter more plaine vnto you and your frendes.</p>
   <p>There is in our parish of <hi>Oteringham</hi> a mā of honest &amp; good disposition named <hi>Iohn Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> who hath to wife one <hi>Elizabeth Rawling,</hi> A woman of honest life and conuersation, who being conceaued with childe accomplished her daies with much griefe: At length the time of her trauell being come, she was the seuenth of Aprill last, safly deliuered of a iolly
<pb facs="4"/>woman child, of right shape and comely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, which child is now aliue, wherat the parents and neyghbors reioyced, thinking al thinges had ben well and their busines ended but so it fell not out. For you shall vnderstand that after the former perill was past, newe panges began to arise vpon the sorrowful wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man in such sort that it caused a lamentation among all the wiues. Thus with painfull throwes she endured two daies more, and at the last was released of her painfull burden, the ninth day of the same moneth she brought forth this monsterous child, a terror to all the behoulders. The head wherof was like a Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny: The handes was like a mole: The bodie, legges, &amp; feete like a woman, hauing also the preueties like a woman, it had no heare on the head or other partes, and the skinne was very blacke and feareful to the eyes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, as M. <hi>Latham</hi> M. <hi>Browne</hi> our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster with diuers others which haue seene the same can certifie you.</p>
   <p>Many times hath the Lord shewed vs his wonders, and maruelous workes, to be a fore warning of the punishments whiche he hath prepared for sin: What a number of straunge tokens, monsterus birthes, blazing starres, earthquakes, dreadful signes in the ayer, and fearefull stormes and tempests to moue vs to repentance and amendment of our wicked
<pb facs="4"/>liues hath he shewen in our land, and yet few or none regardes it. Let no man thinke that such things do come by chance or fortune, but that they are appointed to be messengers of ensuing plagues which are like to fall vpon vs, except with repenting harts we turne vn to our Godand forsake our wicked waies.</p>
