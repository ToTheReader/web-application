      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was an old complaint
vttered by a Prophet,
<hi>Thou haste smitten
them,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ierem. 5. 3.</note>
      <hi>but they haue
not lorrowed:</hi> would to God it were
not verified in vs, or that wee had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to listen to that other Prophets
counsell,<note place="margin">Mica. 6. 9.</note>
      <hi>Heare yee the rod, and who
hath appointed it.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Then, might our endeauour for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuing
sorrow, seeme at this present
needlesse and impertinent; were our
hearts wrought to awfull feare at the
<hi>lions roaring,</hi> and not rather hardned
<hi>as the Adamant stone,</hi> against both
the voice and rod of the Almightie.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>But as on the one side,</hi> the terrours
of the Lord inforce; <hi>so on the other
side,</hi> the loue of Christ <hi>and of his
Church,</hi> constraineth vs <hi>to be</hi> instant
in season and out of season, <hi>vpon this
secure and sencelesse generation.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Amos 3. 8.</note> The
Lord hath spoken; who can but
prophecie? <hi>yea the Lord hath begun
to strike, who</hi> when hee beginneth,
will make an end,<note place="margin">1. Sam 3. 12.</note>
      <hi>and bring forth</hi>
iudgement vnto victory; <hi>whose
eares can now but</hi> tingle? <hi>or whose
heart but</hi> tremble?</p>
   <p>This may bee <hi>defence</hi> inough for a
man, otherwise well pleased <hi>to liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his owne people,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 King. 4. 13.</note> to put the
trumpet to his mouth, &amp; (if it may be)
to awaken such as sleepe secure in
<hi>Sion,</hi> of whom it cannot now bee said,
<hi>because they haue no changes,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 55. 19.</note>
      <hi>therefore they feare not God:</hi> but
rather, as of the desperate Iewes, <hi>in
vaine,</hi> saith God, <hi>haue I smitten
your children,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ierem. 2. 30.</note>
      <hi>they haue receiued
no correction.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>
To speake plainely, an heauie stroake
of Gods hand is now vpon vs for our
sinnes: but that which giueth cause to
feare, that the same hand is <hi>stretched
out still,</hi> is, that to our many other sins,
<hi>we adde this aboue all,</hi> not to take to
heart so grieuous a visitation.</p>
   <p>A maine proppe and limme is rent
from the body of this Church and state:
who considereth it? Our sinnes haue
vndoubtedly brought this maime vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs: who, finding <hi>the plague in his
owne heart</hi> acknowledgeth it? that
which the Lord seeketh at our hands,
is, that we <hi>come downe, and humble
our selues</hi> at his footstoole: who goeth
about it? The only remedy of our woūd,
is our true repentance and conuersion
to him that hath smitten vs: how few
that mind it?</p>
   <p>To reduce to feeling our benummed
hearts, God alone is able: but to shew
the only <hi>good and right way,</hi> I haue
endeauoured, as by preaching at first to
those that heard it, so now by writing
<pb facs="8"/>
to so many as God shal direct to read it.
The Lord grant, that the wofull effect,
may addresse vs to the wo-worthy
cause, and both of them to the sowre,
but soueraigne medicine of <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
not to be repented of.</hi>
   </p>
   <q>
      <bibl>ISAI. 57. 1</bibl>
      <p>The righteous perisheth, and no
man considereth it in heart: and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
men are taken away, and no man
vnderstandeth that the righteous is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away from the cuill to come.</p>
