   <opener>
      <salute>Beloved,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T's growne a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
that every
booke, whose so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
or of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
subject, must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to you in state, with
some prescript purposely.
Were it not that <hi>Custome is a
Tyrant,</hi> this labour might
now be spared. Such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
from such an <hi>Elder</hi>
as here followes, needs no
<hi>epistle of recommendation. The
Reverend Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>hours▪</hi> is wel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
to be <hi>a man of God, a
Seer in Israel,</hi> by those things
<pb facs="3"/>
which without controule,
have already passed the
presse. Might I have my
with, it should bee no more
but a double portion of that
Spirit of God which was in
him. The divine light,
which radiated into his
breast, displaies it selfe in
many other of his labours,
but yet is no where more
condens'd than in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
It's truly sayd of
<hi>Moses,</hi> by faith <hi>hee saw him
that was invisible, Heb.</hi> 11. 27.</p>
   <p>And S. <hi>Paul</hi> prayes for the
Ephesians, <hi>that they might
know the love of that which
passeth knowledge, Eph</hi> 3. 19.
These things imply a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;
yet in like phrase
I feare not to say of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
&amp; Brother, <hi>he saw those
things which eye hath not seen,
<pb facs="3"/>
spake those things which eare
hath not heard, and uttered
those things which have not
entred into the heart of man
to conceive.</hi> This knot needs
no cutting: hee that rightly
understands the text, will
easily looke through this
mystery, without the helpe
of an Hyperbole. His scope
was to stirre us up to love
God: his motive to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade,
is taken from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
of those things
which God hath prepared
for them who love him.
That excellencie is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in a strange manner. By
intimating it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
no nor so much as
comprehended by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
abilitie of the body or
minde; yet it is expressed
in the doctrine of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb facs="4"/>
sufficiently. So as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as in a glasse, we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the glory of God, and
in beholding, bee changed
from glory to glory. What
duty more necessary than
to love God? what motive
more effectuall than the
Gospell? for <hi>what is the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
but a revelation of such
things as naturall men could
never invent?</hi> Such things,
that is, so pretious, so useful,
so comfortable to us; so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
admirable, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
in themselves. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of us are like the Angell
of Ephesue, <hi>Wee have lost our
first love. Rev.</hi> 2. 4. yea as our
Saviour prophesied, <hi>Matth.
24. 12. The love of many maxes
cold.</hi> One reason may bee,
because to see to, wee reape
so little fruit of our love.
<pb facs="4"/>
Were it so, that we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in hand, no present
pay, that we served God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
upon trust without
so much as an earnest: yet
there is something <hi>prepared.</hi>
Let us believe that, and our
hearts cannot but bee war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
wee shall then bee fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
in spirit, serving the
Lord. Be we perswaded of
that, <hi>God is not unrighteous,
to forget your worke, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of love, which you h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ve
she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ed to wards his name, Heb.</hi>
6. 10. and then wee may tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly
insult with <hi>Paul,
Who shall separate us from the
love of Christ? Rom.</hi> 8. 38.
There is this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
natural sight and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.
The one requires
some nearnesse of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
the other perceives
<pb facs="5"/>
things at greatest distance
As Faith makes future
things present, so it makes
remote things near, &amp; things
prepared to affect as if they
were enjoyed. But what
hath God prepared? If I
could answer this, it might
not onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>atisfie, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>briate.
<hi>Such as eye hath not
seene,</hi> &amp;c. It seemes to bee a
proverbial forme of speech,
whereby the rich plenty of
the divine blessings and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
which God intendeth
to us in and by Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Gospel is sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
forth. The words
are to see to, as a riddle; but
here is <hi>one of a thousand an
Interpreter,</hi> at hand to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
them: I could say much
to invite you, but that the
matter it selfe is as a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.
<pb facs="5"/>
My testimony will
adde little weight; yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
some care committed
to me by Mr. P. N. whom
this businesse chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
I could doe no lesse
then let you understand,
here is one rich piece of
Spirituall Workmanship,
wrought by a Master-buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
very usefull for the
building up, and beautify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Gods Temples. The
blessing of God Almightie
bee with it, and upon the
whole Israel of God.</p>
