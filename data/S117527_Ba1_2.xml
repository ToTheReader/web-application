   <head>THE COPIE OF A LETTER SENT frome a priest, being prisoner in the Tovver of London, to the fathers of the Societie of Iesus in England.</head>
   <head>To the deuoute reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthoughe it be true, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques imprisoned in the tower of london, are kept so straitlye, and vncourteouslie in warde: as neyther friends maye haue accesse vnto them, nor they permitted eyther to haue company or to speake with other men, and muche lesse to haue books, paper, or penne and ynke: Yet during the late disputatio there with father Campian the prisoner, some of them whiche were entred in to heare the disputations, finding oportunitie, stepped a syde vnto the holes of some seclused priests, to visit and salute those seruants of Christe: by whiche means, as by gods holie prouidence, some thinges were vnderstoode and knowne, touching their state and passing greate comfort, where whith God of his goodnesse doeth refreshe and recreate them, in the myddes
<pb facs="87"/>
of their extreme troubles and distresses. And among other things, this epistle fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweing, written in haste, (euen foorth of the mouth dowtlesse, as it semeth, of the holy ghooste) by a good preist, which had bene miserablie tormented, and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times racked, came to my hands fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the reuerend fathers of the Societie of Iesus, to whome it was sent. And here I thought good to place yt woord by woord taken oute of the Authors owne handwriting, that all mortall men may vnderstand gods hand not to be abbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but that aswell now, as in old time, he aydeth his confessors in their necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <note place="margin">Esa. 56.</note> and assisteth them with in those dark and close prisons.</p>

         <head>TO THE REVEREND FATTERS of the Societie of Iesus.</head>
         <p>
            <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S often as euer I consider vvith my selfe (reuerend fathers) hovvfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentlie, and by hovv many vvayes and means allmighty God seekeeth our saluation, desireth oure loue, vvisheth to possesse oure hart, and to raigne vvith in vs: euē so many tymes, am I ashamed &amp; abashed, that neyther benefits do moue vs, nor revvardes all ure ys, nor terror of Gods Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do the prouoque vs miserable men, to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue and obey hym vvith all force and indeuour, yea and most freelie to present our bodies as a liuing sacrifice, and perfect offering to his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne maiestie. For beside those his passing greate benefits of creation, redemption, preseruation, iustification, and expected glorification beside these (I say) and infinite other his benefits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stovved vpon vs: he exhorteth vs vvith moste svvete vvoords to haste apace tovvards hym. I loue them (sayth he) vvhiche loue me: &amp; he vv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiche earlie in the morning vvaketh to me, shall fynde me: blessed is the man vvhiche hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth me, vvatcheth at my gates dailie, and attē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth at the postes of my doore: he vvhiche fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth me, shall fynde lyfe, and obtein saluation at the hands of his lorde.</p>
         <p>Novv, vvhere he is to be sought, he hym<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe teacheth vs by these vvoords; vvhere so euer tvvo or three are gathered together in my name (saith he) there am I in the myddes of the.
<pb facs="88"/>
VVe must then think Christe to be trulie in that place, vvhere many being fast ioyned in loue and charitie, do assemble together to this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that they may honor God, serue god onlie, kepe his commaundements and enlarge his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste gloriouse kyngdome. VVho so euer heareth hym, shall learne truthe and shall not vvalk, in darknesse and in blyndnes of errors, but shall goe safe and sure to the fountains of vvaters.</p>
         <p>In such sacred congregations, dedicated to god, lyeth the right vvay to heauen: avvay not planted aboute vvith breers and brembles, not haunted of levved liuers, but continuallie trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vvith the feete of deuout people, A vvaye not abounding in vain delites; nor in faire flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering enticemēts: A vvaye not adourned vvith the fading flovvers of this vvicked vvorlde, but fenced and fortified vvith moste holie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves and rules, that the simple and ignorant can not erre therein, nor anie other go a stray oute of that vvay: except suche as viterlie neglect their ovvne saluatio. Here things are aptlie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed in number, vveight, and measure, in so much as it may vvell be sayd, that true vvisdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in dede dvvelleth here, by vvhose me is all things are sett in good order meruailouslie. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is vsed and exercised a certein heauenlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of brethren, a svvete correction and amedment of stovvard affectiōs vvith a vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull procurement and inuitation to mutuall loue and charitie.</p>
         <p>For these or such like respects, I had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined vvith my selfe novv tvvo yeres agoe to entre in to this kinde of lyfe, yf god so vvold: &amp;
<pb facs="88"/>
I had some speche vvith a learned and deuoute man, then my Ghostlie father to this effect: vvhether there vvere any hope, that the fathers of the societie vvold receiue me vnder their holie rule and obedience, yf I shovvlde vpon reasonable cause returne forth of my naturall countrie againe; for then I vvas in the parts beyond the seas: his opinion vvas cleare that I had no nede at all to doubt thereof, Hereupon my hope encreased, my courage vvas augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in these tvvo yeres, vvhiles I haue bene in England, I haue oftentymes renevved this purpose. But vpon hope and trust that my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and industrie here, in the haruest of oure, Lorde, is not altogether vnprofitable, I haue differred the execution of my sayd purpose. Yet novv, seeth I am by the appointemēt of god depriued of libertie, so as I can not any longer employe my selfe in this profitable exercise: my desire is estsones reuiued, my spirit vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xeth feruent hote, and at the last I haue made a vovv and promise to god, not rashlie (as I hope) but in the feare of god, not to anie other ende, than that I might therby more deuoutlie, and, more acceptablie serue god, to my more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain saluation, &amp; to a more gloriouse triumphe ouer my ghoostlie enemye. I haue made a vovve (I say) that vhen so euer it shall please god to deliuer me (so that once at the length yt like hym) I vvill vvith in one yere then next folovving, assigne my selfe vvholie to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the societie, and that (Yf god inspire their harts to admit me:) I vvill gladlie, and vvith exceding great ioye thorovvlie, and
<pb facs="89"/>
most vvlie, from the bottom of my hast geue vp and surrender all my vvill to the seruice of god, and in all obedience vnder them.</p>
         <p>This vovve vvas to me a passing great ioye, and consolation, in the myddes of all my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, and tribulations. And therfore, vv<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
               <desc>••</desc>
            </gap>h greater hope to obtein fortitude and patiēce p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drevv neare to the throne of his diuine maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, vvith the assistance of the blessed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall virgin Marie, and of all Saincts. And I hope verifie this came of God, for I dyd it euen in the tyme of prayer, vvhen me thought, my mynde vvas setled vpon heauenlie things. For thus it vvas.</p>
         <p>The same day that I vvas first tourmented on the rack, before I came to the place, geuing my mynd to prayer, and commending my selfe and all myne to oure Lorde. I vvas replenis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed, and filled vp vvith a kinde of super natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall svvetenelle of Spirit. And euen vvhile I vvas callyng vpon the moste holie name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and vpon the blessed virgin Marie (for I vvas in sayeing the Rosarie): my mynd vvas cheerefully disposed, vvell comforted, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie prepared, and bent to suffer, and endure those torments, vvhich euen then I moste certe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inlie looked for. At the length my former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose came in to my mynde, and there vvith all a thought to incidentlie fell vpon me to ratifie that novv by novve vvhich before I had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. VVhan I had ended my prayers. I reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued these things in my mynde depelie? and vvith reason as vvell as I could) I dyd debate and discusse them thorovvlie: I Iudged it god,
<pb facs="89"/>
and expedient for me: I accomplished my desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re: I put forth my vovv and promise freelie, and boldlie, vvith the condition a fore sayde.</p>
         <p>VVhich acte, (me thinketh) god hym self did approue and allovv by and by. For in all my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and tourments, he of his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, mercifully and tenderlie, did stand by and assiste me, cōforting me in my trouble and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie. Deliuering my soule from vvicked lipps, from the deceitfull tongue, and from the roring lyons, then readie gaping for their pray.</p>
         <p>VVhether this that Ivvill say, be miraculous or no: God he knovveth: but true it is, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of my cōscience is a vvitnesse before God. And this I say: that in the end of the torture though my hands &amp; feete vvere violently stretched &amp; racked, and my aduersaries fullfilled their vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked lust, in practisynge their cruell tyranny vpō my body yet notvvitstanding I vvas vvith ovvt sense and feling vvell nigh of all greefe, &amp; payne: and not so onlie, but as it vvere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, eased and refreshed by the greeues of the torture by past, I cōtinued still vvith perfect &amp; presēt senses, in quietnesses of hart, &amp; trāquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of mynd. VVhich thing vvhen the commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners dyd see, they departed, and in goeing foorth of the doore, they gaue order to rack me againe the next day folovveing, after the same, sorie. Novv vvhen I hearde them say so: It gaue me in my mynd by and by, and I dyd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie beleue &amp; trust, that vvith the help of god, I should be able to beare &amp; suffer it patientlie. In the mean tyme (as vvell as I could) I dyd mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se and meditate vpon the moste bitter passion
<pb facs="90"/>
of oure Sauioure, and hovv full of innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paines it vvas. And vvhiles I vvas thus occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied: me thought, that my left hād vvas vvoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the palme, and that I felt the blood run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne out: but in very dede, there vvas no such thing, nor any other payne than that, dyd then greeue my hand.</p>
         <p>Novv then, that my sute and request may be vvell knovvne vnto yovv: for so muche as I am oute of hope, in short time to recouer &amp; enioye my former libertie, so as I might personalie speake vnto yovv, And vvhether happilie I shall once at lengthe speake vnto yovv in this vvorld, no mortall man doeth knovv: In the meane season I humblie submitt my selfe vnto yovv, &amp; (suppliā the kneeling) I beseche yovv, to doe, and dispose for me, and of me, as shall seme good to youre vvisdoms And vvith an hū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mynd moste hartilie I craue, that (yf it may be in my absens) it vvold please yovv to admit me into your Societie, &amp; to regester and inrole me among yovv: that so, vvith humble men I may haue a sense and feling of humilitie, vvith deuoute men I may sounde out a lovvde, the lauds and prayses of God, and continually ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thanks to hym, for his benefits: and then after, being ayded by the prayers of many, I may rūne more safelie to the marke vvhich I shoote at, and vvith oute perill attaine to the price that is promised.</p>
         <p>And I am not ignorant that the snares &amp; vvi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les of oure aunciēt enemie are infinite: for he is the slye serpēt, vvhich lyeth in the shadovv, of vvoods, vvyndyng, vvhirling, &amp; turning aboute
<pb facs="90"/>
many vvayes: and vvith his vviles &amp; subtil shifts, he attempteth meruailouslie to delude &amp; abuse the soules of the simple, vvhich vvant a faithfull guyde: in so much, as it is not vvithoute cause, that vve are admonished, to trie the spirits, yf they be of God. To yovv therfore, bicause you are spirituall, and accustomed to this kinde of conflict, I commend all this businesse: beseching yovv euen by the bovvelles of gods mercy that you vvold vouchesafe to direct me vvith your counsaile and vvisdome. And yf in youre sight yt seme profitable, for more honor to God, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re cōmoditie to his churche, and eternall salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my soule, that I be preferred to that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of the most holie name of Iesus: then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently before god, and in the court of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, I do promise obedience, to all and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular rectors, &amp; gouernours established all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, or to be hereafter established, and likevvyse to all rules, or lavves receiued in this societie, to the vttermoste of my povver, and so farre as God doeth geue me grace: God is my vvitnesse, and this my ovvn hand vvriting shalbe a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie hereof in the day of Iudgement. As for the healthe of my bodye, yovv haue no cause to doubt, for novv vvell nere I haue recouered my former strengthe and hardnesse by gods help, &amp; I vvax euery day stronger than other. Thus in all other things cōmending my selfe to youre prayers, I byd yovv farevvell in oure Lorde, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refullye expecting vvhat yovv thinke good to determin of me.</p>
