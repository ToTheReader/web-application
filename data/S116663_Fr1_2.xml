   <head>THE PREFACE OF THE <hi>Translatour, to the Reader.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOVGH worldly men, whose soules are swallowed vp in sense, be content to make their purse of gold their God, by occasion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>S. Paul</hi> thought good to say, that couetousnes was no beter thē a kind of sacrifice to Idols: yet such as are not wholy deafe to the voyce of reason, may heare it protest, that as man is compoūded of flesh &amp; spirit, so his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall goods are incōparably superiour to the corporall, and that riches are to be held of the meanest &amp; low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est ranke, among all such benefits as God Almighty hath vouchsafed to mankind. For as those thinges which men haue any colour to account their owne,
<pb facs="3"/>are eyther plenty of fortune, health of body, glory of reputation, or lastly the soule it selfe; so, who is he that will not empty his purse to recouer his health, or saue his life? What man of worth will not despise his life to preserue his honour? And who doubteth but that the respect of honour should yeild vnto the care which a man ought to haue of his soule? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon may be grounded, amongst others, two appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent truthes; The one, that for the soule a man is to despise all other things; the other, that except the soule, there is nothing so deare as reputation. Now, if reputation be so precious, for as much as concerns the morall man, what accompt ought Christians to haue it in, since scandals are often giuen and taken, vpon the aboundance or defect thereof; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vpon the credit of a few, dependeth the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of very many. The enemy of mankinde who knowes how true this is, hath continually laboured to rob Gods seruantes of so great a Iewell; yea and hath presumed to infame God himselfe, beeing made man for vs; sometimes tempting men to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him as a Coniurer, sometimes as a Samaritane, which did import a Schismatike, and sometimes as a trayterous and seditious person. The same stile he held with the Christians of the Primitiue Church, and we English Catholikes of this age, whose cause is the same with theirs, haue lyen groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning long vnder the same burthen, and felt with vnspeakable griefe, though with vndaunted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, the poysoned arrowes of this kinde, which he hath beene dayly shooting into our sides.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p> Those Aduersaries of our cause who beleeue in God but for fashion-sake, at least conceaue that it importes not after what fashion he be serued, think they do vs a fauour, when they call vs fooles, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing our selues to persecution vpon the differences of Catholike and protestant Religion. Such Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants as in good earnest belieue that Religiō, which they professe, are wont to traduce vs for supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and Idolatrous persons, vnder the pretence of our doctrines which concerne the Reall presence, and the reuerent vse which we make of Images: But they who vse their Religion no more then for a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, or rather slaue to their absurd reason of state, and know well inough that if they should persecute vs vnder the only title of Heretikes, they must be faine both to disclayme from the Society of al ancient Christians, and should be forced to deserue the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of sauage cruelty, for presuming to condemne that faith, to which their auncestours and ours were conuerted from Paganisme: they, I say, are the men who giue out, that we are not vniustly persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for our religion, but iustly punished for our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, disobedience, and treason.</p>
   <p>For the painting ouer of which discourse, how many industries haue beene vsed; how many Iewels and Cupbordes of plate to forraine Princes &amp; Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours haue beene presented; how many crafty and cruell lawes haue beene at seuerall times procured &amp; enacted; and lastly what a couple of daungerous and detestable. <hi>Oathes,</hi> vnder the authority of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said lawes, haue with extreme rigour, &amp; without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
<pb facs="4"/>of sexe or age, byn propounded &amp; exacted?</p>
   <p>The first of these <hi>Oathes,</hi> is that of the Kings <hi>Supremacy,</hi> deuised heretofore by our Aduersaries for the making of all Catholikes expresse Traytours, and executed for a while with great seuerity, though afterwardes they grew halfe ashamed therof. And the vse which it affoardes at this day, is chiefly to distinguish such persons, as adore the present state of thinges, from others who are more indifferent: and so we see it is ordinarily ministred, but to such, as either pretend to make Lawes by voice in Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or els to cary Office in the Common wealth or Church. Alwaies that <hi>Oath</hi> serued rather to other endes, then to make diuision, or procure mutuall scandalls among English Catholikes, since we all agree in the cleere detestation therof; and for this later purpose, the other <hi>Oath,</hi> which is called of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> was set on foot, by the instigation of some <hi>Ministers,</hi> immediatly after the powder-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as if euery one that did refuse to take it, were guilty of that prodigious plot. Withall, it was cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in such cunning and mysty termes, as some Priestes (yea euen since the Pope condemned it) haue not beene ashamed to take it, and more lay Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes haue beene led on by their bad example. This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of theirs, hath implied a kind, of disloyalty in them that refused the same; and the <hi>State</hi> hath not beene a little carefull to publish the brute therof, both within and without the Realme, to the extreme dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage, and discomfort of all sincere and solide Catholikes.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p> There hath not beene a greater meanes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the strengthning of fowle aspersions vpon vs, then the confidence which our Aduersaries, the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi> haue vsed in protesting, that we English Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes who refuse the <hi>Oath,</hi> are controlled by many great partes of Christendome, euen Catholike, where men would vndoubtedly (say they) haue taken such an <hi>Oath</hi> as this, if they were required thereunto by their seuerall Princes. In particuler the example of <hi>France</hi> hath beene euery day obtruded to vs, as if the Catholike parte of that Kingdome were wholy of the English Protestant faith in this particuler<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> And although this vndertaking of theirs, were knowne to be impudent and most vntrue, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of some English Catholikes, who informed themselues of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> which is the Diuinity, Schoole of <hi>Paris,</hi> and found that it abhor'd the <hi>Oath;</hi> yet partly by the confident asseuerations of our aduersaryes, partly by the corrupt beliefe in that point, which some one of the Ambassadours of that Countrey, residing heretofore in <hi>England,</hi> was faln to, and the flattering discourse which for hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he was wont to hold; so it is that the ordinary sort of Protestants conceaued all this while, that <hi>French</hi> Catholikes were in this poynt agreeing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Parlament in <hi>England,</hi> then the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But, God be praised, the curtaine is drawne at length, which heretofore hath parted the stage from the attyring house, and now the spectatours (who are as many of our Country, as can write and
<pb facs="5"/>read) may se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> that such as plead the partes of ciuill, rich, and religious persons, are many of them no better then insolent, beggarly, and lewd compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This worke is perform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d in this <hi>Oration</hi> follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing (wherewith I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e thought good to present the courteous Reader) composed and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>noun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed by that ornament of our age, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Peron;</hi> a man so well knowne to the world, for the great childes portion which the father of all good thinges hath allotted out vnto him, of incomparable lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, prudence, and zeale towardes the Catholique Faith. It pleased God by his meanes long since to conuert the last King of <hi>France</hi> from his erroneous beliefe; to make the said <hi>Cardinall,</hi> amongst others, an Instrument of compounding that busines of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whereupon the peace of the Church did in some sort depend; and now this honour was only wanting to him, that he should be the meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store one of the noblest members of the Church (for so we may without any vanity, to the glory of God, esteeme the English Catholikes, who with so admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grace, and strength are stil swimming through the bitter waues of persecution) to the honour of only suffering for that faith, which other Catholike Countries do professe, wherof our Aduersaries haue studied so earnestly to depriue vs, whilest they say, the doctrine conteyned in the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> is impugned by vs, out of singularity, or seditious humour, and that our next neighbouring Churches, of the same Communion, would acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the same.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p> But I must not reflect so particulerly vpon the dignity of the <hi>Cardinalls</hi> person, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme obligation which al good <hi>English</hi> Catholikes haue to him, as therby to neglect the setting forth of the aduanta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e which our cause hath got by his <hi>Oration.</hi> For although it were not a matter of small importance if it had beene deliuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d by himself but as a priuate man: yet it ought to rise to another manner of accoumpt, when it appeareth, that, as the stile thereof was ordered by his eloquence, and the sound thereof pronounced by his voyce; so also the substance and strength of it, did spring euen from the hart roote of the whole Clergy of <hi>France</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by those Archbishops, and Bishops, and other Prelates there assembled, and was both ioyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, and clerely auowed by the whole Nobility of <hi>France,</hi> assembled also and represented in lik māner. Now to the end, good Reader, that thou may<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>st runne through with mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e facility, and be able with more syncerity to discerne of that which is contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the <hi>Oration,</hi> I will make thee acquainted with the occasion therof, and premise also some few other thinges, whereof perhaps thou art ignoran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, and which may serue to set thy iudgment straight in that which followeth.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Parlaments</hi> in <hi>France</hi> haue no resemblance to ours in <hi>England,</hi> but are certaine sedentary and supreme Courts of Iustice, compounded only of Lawyers, who iudge without appeale within their seuerall precinctes of Iurisdiction. Of these Courtes there are eight in <hi>France,</hi> all independant on of
<pb facs="6"/>another, though the Parlament of <hi>Paris</hi> haue a Country vnder it of greater extent, and by residing in that Citty, which is the ordinary habitation of the French Kinges, it hath growne to that kind of am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ition and vsurpation, which some Patriarchs of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and some Bishops of <hi>Rauenna</hi> haue been subiect to in different causes, but vpon like occasions. That which in <hi>France</hi> doth answere the nature of our <hi>English Parlament,</hi> is the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the three <hi>Estates Generall,</hi> the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and the <hi>Communalty</hi> (which last is called the Third <hi>Estate;</hi>) but it is with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, amongst others, that they sit in three seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Chambers, whereas the two former of ours sit in one and wheras, with vs, an Act is not presented to the King, vnles the maior part of both our Houses or Chambers do finde it good; in France if the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior part of two Chambers do resolue vpon any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, it is to go vnder the name of all the Three Estates, although one of them should dissent therin.</p>
   <p>This supposed, I wil proceed to informe thee, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader, that the greater number of the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the third Chamber, in this last Assembly of the <hi>Estates</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> did conceaue, &amp; frame the forme of an <hi>Oath,</hi> which they wished might be ministred in that Kingdome, as that which beares the name of <hi>Allegiance</hi> is in ours; whereby the same principall Article is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>biured, namely, that no <hi>French</hi> King can be deposed, nor his subiects absolued from their obedience, by any Pope, for any cause whatsoeuer; and that the contrary opinion is Hereticall, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
<pb facs="6"/>to the doctrine of the Scriptures. But this difference is found betweene the two <hi>Oathes,</hi> that whereas the English one, in one of the clauses, seemes to exclude not only the authority of the Church ouer Kinges, but euen of the Cōmon wealth also (yea though it should be accompanied with that of the Church:) that of <hi>France</hi> shoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es only at the abnegation of the Churches authority. Nor is there a man in that Kingdome who appeares to h ld, that Kinges in certaine cases are not subiect to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Common wealth. And as for the <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> in particuler, who knowes not, that diuers of that body haue now helped to animate the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> and his complices, to take arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s against the King and Queene of <hi>France,</hi> vpon the supposall which they make of the ill Gouernment of that Kingdome. But howsoeuer tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> case standes, this <hi>Oath</hi> was drawne by the Chamber of the <hi>Communalty,</hi> which in <hi>France</hi> is called the <hi>Third Estate,</hi> and reiected, as conteyning false and wicked doctrine, by both the Chambers of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and <hi>Nobility,</hi> and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sequently for the reason that I gaue before, by the <hi>Estate Generall.</hi> Some man perhaps amongst o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>r <hi>English</hi> aduersaries may obiect, that notwithst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nding the custome and stile of <hi>France</hi> doth beare that whatsoeuer is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, or repr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oued by any two of the Chambers, doth take the name of all the thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, yet it makes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>y for the credit of our <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> that they of the <hi>Third Estate</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which is the greatest member of that body, should c nspire in
<pb facs="7"/>opinion with the Authours of our <hi>English Oath,</hi> though they be of a contrary Religion to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in other thinges, and esteemed the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout professours of it in that Kingdome. I answere that this argument may looke fayre a far off, but with such as know how thinges were carried, it will fall out to be of no force at all.</p>
   <p>It is to be vnderstood, that this Chamber of the <hi>Third Estate</hi> was wholy, in effect, compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Lawyers, (most of them belonging to the Court of Parlament of <hi>Paris</hi>) and certaine Officers of the Long Robe, belonging to the King, as Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Receauers, and such like; who commonly bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chiefest men of their Parish, are wont with such case to procure themselues to be chosen deputies, as an <hi>English</hi> Gentleman of meanes and credit, can make himselfe in like case be made a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesse. By this meanes there were very few places in the <hi>Third Chamber,</hi> which were filled by <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,</hi> or substantiall <hi>Merchants</hi> of those Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Prouinces, and therefore no meruayle, if vnder the name of the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who are perhaps of the most pious men of that Kingdome (and whereof there was in this Assembly of <hi>Estates</hi> no more in effect but the name) this wicked proposition of a profane <hi>Oath</hi> did come to light, beeing conceaued partly by the Kinges Officers (who crept into those places, expresly against the Lawes of <hi>France,</hi> and who make no scruple to flatter their King with faire words, vpon condition they may the more securely robbe him by other,
<pb facs="7"/>meanes;) and partly by certaine other Lawyers, as hath beene said, who vse to be wel content to deliuer the King from all Tribunalls but their owne, and are generally the greatest Libertines both in vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and will, that perhaps the Christian world is acquainted with.</p>
   <p>This action therefore of the <hi>Third Estate</hi> being thus miscompounded, need not make our Aduersaries more insolent then they were before; but much rather ought they to retract their former actions vpon a due consideration of the proceeding, which was held in this busines, by the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> of whome it cannot be pretended, but that they would gladly haue graunted to their King, whatsoeuer they could in conscience. The <hi>Clergy</hi> I say of <hi>France,</hi> which dependeth more vpon those Kinges by the exemptions of sundry Popes, then any Catholike <hi>Clergy</hi> doth in Christendome; and the <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>France</hi> which enioyeth not only more accesse, &amp; other priuileges, but draweth more money <hi>in specie</hi> by way of pensiō from their King, without obligation to any particuler residence, or seruice, then any <hi>Nobility</hi> doth in Christendome, whether it be Catholike, or other; wherin I will not except <hi>Spayne,</hi> for I know I need not. And when I should say, that the French King di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>burseth yearly not much lesse by way of pensiō to his subiects of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> then the King of <hi>England</hi> receaueth year<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>y to his purse all manner of wayes, I should not be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of a <hi>Paaadoxe,</hi> for the sūme ariueth in sight (besides that which is vnknown) to vpon the point
<pb facs="8"/>of six hundred thousand poundes <hi>per annum.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The <hi>Oration</hi> it self doth follow at the end of this Preface, and therefore I enter not vpon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulers thereof; only the Reader, when he hath peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it, may be pleased to remember two thinges in generall conteyned therein. One, that the <hi>Oath</hi> is such, as that they of the <hi>French Clergie</hi> and <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> will rather die then take it; the other, that there was neuer any <hi>French</hi> writer, since the faculty of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity</hi> hath beene taught in the Schooles of <hi>France</hi> (not excepting euen such as were the most earnest vpholders of Regal authority, &amp; were required by the Kinges of their tymes, to defend the same by publique writing) who affirmeth Kinges to be indeposable by Popes in al cases. And whēsoeuer any of them haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the point of the <hi>Absolution,</hi> which subiectes may haue from the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to their <hi>Prince,</hi> the cases of the Princes <hi>Heresy</hi> &amp; <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy</hi> are alwayes excepted; that is to say, in such cases, the subiects of a King, acording to the iudgmēt of all Catholike <hi>French</hi> writers, may be absolued from the <hi>Oath</hi> of their <hi>Allegiance.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I tie not my self to the wordes, but the substance of these two propositions is cleerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> in the name of the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> which so long as the Reader shall keep in mind, it will make him (if he be a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Protestant) discerne with ease, how falsly his Ministers haue laid certaine seditious opinions to the charge of vs <hi>English</hi> Catholikes, and such (say they) as are not belieued by the Catholike Countries
<pb facs="8"/>ioyning to vs. If he chaunce to be a Precisian, he will haue reason to take compassion of vs Catholikes, whome he findes to agree in this with himselfe, and all the <hi>Calumists</hi> in the world, that Kings may for some hideous crymes des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rue to fall from their Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty; though there be this difference betweene vs, that we hold the common Father of all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to be the fittest Iudge of such high quarrells, as fall out betweene his children (wherin also he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Canons and inuiolable Customes of the Church, in what sort, and by what degrees he must proceed) but they hold that Kinges are subiect to a kinde of popular iudgment, which is so much the likelier to be corrupt, as it is vsuall for the people whome they make the Iudge, to be a party. If he be a faint Catholike who hath brought his conscience to take the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to run dauncing round the may-pole of humane respectes, it will make him returne to the good company, which in that point he hath left, and fetch the bloud into his face, when he considers that he beeing an <hi>English</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, who was wont to haue the honour to be so entire in the confession of his faith, hath need to be put in mind of his duty, by an action performed in <hi>France,</hi> where leuity and liberty are ordinarily so much in vse. If lastly he he a sincere and loyal Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, who doth choose rather to starue, then to strayne his conscience, and consequently resolueth to be far inough from taking the <hi>English Oath,</hi> he may giue God humble thankes for his infinite mercy, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the promise of future rewardes, for these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb facs="9"/>sufferinges, and the testimony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which, euen in this life, is so great a Iewell as both the <hi>Indies</hi> cannot buy, hath vouchsafed to iustify him in point of spirituall reputation, by the testimony of that Nation, whose syncerity was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led most in question, and whose example hath been heretofore so impudently, though without controle, alleadged against him, and vs.</p>
   <p>And though if we were sure that our persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were to continue as long as the world: yet we should know withall, that there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the longest tyme and eternity; and that, the sufferings of this life, though neuer so grieuous, are infinitly vnworthy of that glory, which is prepared for such as keepe the <hi>Depositum</hi> of Catholike Faith, vndiminisht. But we are taught, not only by the experience of former tymes, which tells vs of the periode of great persecutions, euen then when there seemed to be least humane hope therof; but also by that which we may haue obserued by the passages of the late action of the <hi>Estates</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> how able God Almighty is, to make his greatest enemies the liueliest instruments of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in despight of their owne wicked hartes, and to make their endeauours, which ayme at the dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and abusing of his Church, to giue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test contribution that could be wished, to the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Maiesty of the same.</p>
   <p>Who knowes not, that the holding of these <hi>Estates</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> was pursued only, in effect, by certaine irreuerent semi-Catholikes, who loue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>urisdiction? Who knowes not, that as soone as the said <hi>Estates</hi> were opened, that rotten member which tooke the name of the <hi>Third Estate,</hi> discouered that Canker, which hath been feeding gredily vpon it (especially since the introduction of heresy into that Kingdome) by plodding vpon some course, how to make an Id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ll of the temporall power of Kinges, in respect of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence due to Popes; and so far to abuse the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Apostolike Sea, as that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt it no more then a meere Scarcrow, or Chyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra? And yet we see God hath fetcht the Treacle of which I haue spoken, from the poyson that grew in the festred bowells of his Enemies; for if that <hi>French Oath</hi> had not been propounded by those Lawyers, the contrary doctrine and beliefe of the Church of <hi>France,</hi> had not beene protested by those Prelates. Shall the prouidence therefore of God, be able to watch so fruitfully ouer the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and shall the narrow seas be broad inough to keepe him from shewing his power in <hi>England</hi> to our comfort, and the confusion of such, as either know him not, or care not for him? nay rather let vs learne by this, that when our persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ministers do most conspire our ruine, then shall we be surest of Gods present help; &amp; when the graue shalbe finished wherin they hope to bury vs aliue, <hi>incident in foueam quam fecerunt,</hi> it is then that they are likeliest to die in the same ditch which they made for vs.</p>
   <pb facs="10"/>
   <p> Courage therfore is that which we are to beg at the hands of God, who knowes not how to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake, but such as confide not in him It was said long ago by one who had no supernaturall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="10"/>instant in the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> where the Prince Protestant of them all, is vexing his King by all the power he hath, either of credit, or other meanes, hauing drawne to his lure many others of both Religions: That, since his Maiesty hath beene ill counselled and v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> abroad vpon that light, which they were wont to be afraid would dazell their eies; and at last are come so neere vnto it, as that they touch and handle it, by the discourse of reason, and experience, which tells them, that <hi>Kingly Authority</hi> cannot come imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly from God to any man, but by miracle: That all the Kinges whome we know, do either rule by force of conquest, and in that case the authority of the Commō wealth if it be vsurped, may be resumed, or by <hi>Donation, Election, Marriage,</hi> or <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of bloud, in which cases Kings forfait by not performing the conditions, vnder which either they or their first auncestors did enter, whether they were expressed, or necessarily implied. Necessarily
<pb facs="11"/>I say implied for supposing, that a people who was without question the first owner of supreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity vpon earth should cause a King to gouerne them without obliging him in particuler to do this, or that, it were a Barbarous conceipt to thinke that it were in his law full power, to Tyrannize ouer them at his pleasure, without hauing respect either to their defence in time of warre, or the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Iustice in tyme of peace, for which only respectes they made him King. If this discourse be true in case of Kinges, euen by the Law of Nature and of Nations; how much more shall it be so, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Christian Kinges, who in their Baptisme do their homage to the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> and at their Coronations do sweare the mayntenance of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> which are the conditions expressed, whereupon the progenitours of the most absolute Christian Kinges, were placed in their Royall Throne. These thinges, I say, are growne into the consideration of men, and strikes the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable part of their soules with such an euidence and demonstration of truth, as no formulary of an Oath, though perhaps for feare, or fashion sake they may chance to accept therof, will euer be able to wipe out.</p>
   <p>Some questions there may be, betweene men of different Religions (as hath beene toucht) to whom the iudgment ouer <hi>Kings</hi> for their offences may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; some holding that this <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> resides in the <hi>Church;</hi> some in the <hi>Common Wealth;</hi> some in both together; and some others other seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="11"/>opinions, which are not so much worth the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying; but all the Christian Congregations of all Religions in the world do agree in this, that all Kinges for hideous crimes may fall from their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and their subiectes may be absolued from their <hi>Oath</hi> of fidelity. Nay I haue not heard euen in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> where our <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> was enacted, nor in <hi>France</hi> where the like was offered, that when the generall propositions which were conteyned in both the formularies were well deduced into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, men would be drawne to subscribe and sweare thereto (otherwise then forced by feare) excepting only a few hypocritical Ministers amongst vs, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Lawyers amongst our neighbours. But as God would haue it, neither the <hi>Ministers</hi> in <hi>France</hi> are of that opinion (for they professe the contrary) nor yet the <hi>Lawyers</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> if you put the case home to them: for howsoeuer it costes them nothing to sweare, that the Pope can neuer come to depose a King because he is a protestant; it would trouble some of their consciences, if they haue any, to sweare that if an Vpper and Lower house of the <hi>English Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> should condemne a King, who might happen to be so great a Tyrant, as that he would abrogate all the <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Common Lawes</hi> of the Realme; bring in by force a summary course of Iustice, as is vsed in <hi>Switzerland;</hi> confiscate all the Common Lawyers of <hi>England,</hi> who are able to spend aboue a thousand poundes <hi>per annum;</hi> and in a word dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of their wiues and children, as if they were his owne; it would trouble them, I say, to sweare, that
<pb facs="12"/>such a King might not be deposed by the Houses of <hi>Parlament,</hi> and that themselues could not be so far discharged from the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Fidelity,</hi> which they made to him when they were sworne Iustices of Peace, as to make some personall resistance in their owne defence.</p>
   <p>There is nothing more certaine, then that many a man reades ouer the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and diuers take it, who consider not the importance of those fearefull generall clauses, which include and exclude all particuler cases of <hi>No Pope, No King, neither by his owne, nor by any other Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for any cause whatsoeuer, can Depose or Absolue subiects &amp;c.</hi> And yet, as I said before, there are so many Protestantes, who by occasion of this <hi>Oath</hi> haue entred so deeply into the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Kingly Authority, as it is euident (to all such as freely and familiarly liue with Protestantes, and vnderstand sincerely from them what they think) that thousands of them are growne to a lesse adoring conceipt of Royall Dignity, then they were wont to haue. And though his Maiesty can hardly come to know the preiudice that he hath susteyned by yeilding to them, who haue vnfitly sought to help him, or rather to help themselues by propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this <hi>Oath,</hi> because he is a King, and cannot equally conuerse with his subiectes, (nor can he from his seruantes expect but such newes, as will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to him) yet it may be hoped for, at the Handes of so Excellent a Iudgment as his Maiesty is endued withall, that he will one day fall vpon the true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb facs="12"/>of these businesses, by other meanes, and not cōtinue his Catholike Subtectes in his so ill conceipt, for professing of that beliefe, which is now, <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi> auowed by the learned and noble Catholikes, euen of <hi>France;</hi> the contrary whereof is not auo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed by any Protestant Church vpon earth (if we chaunge the name of <hi>Pope</hi> into the name of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth</hi>) and the sequele whereof hath done nothing but disseruice to him. I beseech God of his infinite mercy, giue his Maiesty such light of mind wherby to discerne the distempered thoughts of his <hi>Ministers,</hi> who are in such a rage against Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, and to vs, that he will vouchsafe so much strength of mind, as that whatsoeuer happeneth, we may rather obey God, then Man.</p>
