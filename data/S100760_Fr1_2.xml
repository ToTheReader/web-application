      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Adam: The sweet taste I have had, of your Ladyships love
to the best things, hath encouraged me, humbly to present this little tract
unto you. What <hi>Solomon</hi> speakes <pb facs="3"/>from experience, that you
upon triall have found true, <hi>That the most promising con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of this
life, are vanity and vexation of Spirit.</hi> Our wise and mercifull Father,
doth usually thus imbitter the sweetest things of this world to us, that
we may the more cordially rellish, and fervently seek after, that full
satisfying and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sweetnesse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which is in
communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Christ our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Husband, in whom all fulnesse of
consolation dwels. A drop of this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendant fulnesse, your
La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyship <pb facs="3"/>(I hope) shall finde, distilled into your soule,
by reading this little worke now come to your hands, which like <hi>Aqua
Vitae,</hi> shall cheere and revive your sad spirit, when ready to faint.
Fainting persons, carry lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bottles of reviving li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids, alwayes about
them; if your Ladyship shal think fit, to make this little Tract, your
pocket-companion, and peruse a little of it still, when you feele
soule-qualmes to seaze upon you, you shall finde (I trust) through the
blessing of Christ, much ease and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; <pb facs="4"/>and so
spend and end your aged dayes, in more true solace of heart, then you have
done your primest dayes of flourishing youth. The accomplishing of this,
is the sincere and holy aime of your much obliged Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, in this his
first of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to publick view. Which simple aime, that the Lord may
graciously answer, to your Ladyships comfort here, and eternall
happinesse hereafter, I shall still continue my prayer, (though here I
end my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) that the Lord will still attend this my poore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour 
<pb facs="4"/>with his rich blessing, to all the partakers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and in
speciall to you.</p>
