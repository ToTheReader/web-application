   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus far hath the Authour pleaded for him selfe, whom while I Translate, least the fault be translated vpon me, I will speake somewhat for my selfe, before I be accused: least when I am accused, there be no bodie to speake for me: If therefore it be thought preiudiciall, either to the literarie common-wealth of <hi>Physicke,</hi> that I haue exported and made common a commoditie, which the learned would haue had priuate to themselues: or if I haue been oftensiue to Women, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting and divulging that, which they would not haue come to open light, and which beside cannot be exprest in such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest termes, as are fit for the virginitie of pen &amp; paper, and the white sheetes of their Child-bed. I must (as well as I can) defend my selfe from these imputations, and shew my care to keep both learning and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie illibate, and inuiolable. First then, I haue done no more in this, then the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath in his French Copie, which is
<pb facs="8"/>
common to be had and read in that vulgar tongue: In defence of which, and this the shadow therof, I must say that it is not writ so much for the learned (who notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if they haue not the french, may make vse of this) as for the Chirurgions, &amp; Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiues, who are called to this kinde of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. As for women (whom I am most afraid to offend) they must be content to haue their infirmities detected, if they will haue helpe for them, which I wish might not come to any eare or eye, but to those which they themselues would haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therewith, and as well for their sakes, as mine owne satisfaction: I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to be as priuate and retired, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing al the passages in this kind as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I could.</p>
   <p>And with this I hope all good Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women will rest satisfied: to whom I wish all happinesse of increase, and all increase of happinesse, that they may haue a good houre for this businesse, and for all other Contentments, many good daies and yeares.</p>
