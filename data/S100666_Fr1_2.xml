      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Author of this Treatise was required by
some persons of honor, who might dispose of
him and his labours: to set downe by way of an
historicall narration, what hee had obserued
touching certaine positions holden, and some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises
atchieued or vndertaken, for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending,
and bringing the <hi>Presbiteriall Discipline</hi> into this Iland
of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> vnder pretence of reformation. The performance of
which dutie, when hee had vndertaken and was entred into it: hee
found the worke to grow farre greater vpon him, then at the first, he
did imagine. Insomuch as although in the beginning he verily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
tha hee might easily haue contriued his matter into a few
sheetes of paper: so that as many coppies, as were to bee disposed,
might easily and in very short time haue beene written forth: yet by
the necessary length of the Discourse, as it fell out, and through his
manifold quotations, hee was constrained, (as the time required) to
procure for the better dispatch, that some fewe copies might bee prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And albeit there is no meaning, that this Treatise (laboured
but for the priuate satisfaction of some fewe especiall persons) should
otherwise continue then as an vnpublished Copie: yet the writer of
it wished to haue it signified, that nothing is alleadged therein, which
is not to be found either in Bookes and writinges published to the
view of the world, (such as he thinketh will not be disclaimed,) or in
publike records, or else is to be shewed vnder those parties own hands
that haue beene either the principall procurers, fauorers, or dealers
in those thinges, whereof hee intreateth. Which asseueration of his
thus made, he will be ready, (as he sayth) God assisting him, to iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
at any time for the satisfaction of such, as shall make doubt of it.
And doth further protest with all sinceritie: that he hath not (wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly)
detorted any thing in this whole Discourse, to make either the
cause it selfe, or the fauorors thereof more odious, then their owne
wordes and deeds shall necessarily inferre, and enforce against them,
with all indifferent and considerate Readers. <hi>Farewell in Christ.</hi>
