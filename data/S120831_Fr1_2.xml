   <head>The Epistle to the gentle Reader, of what estate or calling soeuer.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, whether adorned with the royall Roabes of true Nobilitie, or apparrelled with the gorgious Garmentes of Gentilitie, pardon I pray, these my vnpolished lines: vnrip not, I beseech you, the mistaken stitches of this botcherit, neither sensure seuerely the vnsauerie taste of this Loafe, being <hi>Primogeniti,</hi> the first batch of my baking: But if you finde any thing herein conteyned dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing your humours, say with the Doctor in Cambridge, What, was it I he meant? No, he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not mee, he spake it not by mee, he knoweth mee not; How should he then be priuate to any of my doinges? No no I am none of these miserable Maisters that so inhumanely burieth in obliuion vnrewarded the long, good, and duetifull seruice of my olde Seruant: But if you be such as either thus, or otherwyse abuseth those good creatures that God hath lent you, I meane these earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders, Golde and Siluer: Let these my cauiats
<pb facs="3"/>
worke some remorse of conscience, and play not the gauled Horse that kicketh and winseth, his sore being once touched, to burst out into vngentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlike tearmes agaynst the Authour, being with his worke displeased. For assure your selues, and before God I protest, I speake not against one in particuler, neither against all in generall, vpon a malepart or presumptuous minde, as not caring who are offended with my doinges; but carefull least I should offende any, or incurre their displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, by my presumptuous enterprise, I humbly (as before) pray pardon. Thinke not Gentlemen, that whereas I speake any thing of Maisters hard vsage of their Seruantes, or of any auncient famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aritie betwixt them, that thereby I woulde giue any incouragement to the Seruant to be negligent in his duetie, or by malepart sawcinesse to abuse that reuerence that he oweth vnto his Maister: for God is my recorde, be it farre from mee, that I shoulde once dreame of so inhumane and sedicious a practise: For I protest for my owne part, yf I should serue the meanest Carman that whistleth after his Horse, and be bound by his wages to call him Maister, I would not skorne to do him any reuerence and duetie that by my place and calling were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at my handes. Therefore gentle Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, since curtesie is alwayes the companion of true Gentilitie, courteously I pray you consider of me and my doinges. And now Reader, if you by degree deserue the name of a Yeoman, submissiuely without hautines of hart I pray your patience in
<pb facs="3"/>
perusing this my first practise, for I hold your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling no lesse commendable, and your profession no lesse pertinent to the supportyng of this humane societie, then them of higher dignitie and degree: For, What is the Prince without the Plough? or the Potentate without the Pasture? Doth not the one affoorde them Corne, the other Kine, with all other prouision for their bodyly sustenaunce? Since therefore gentle Reader, yf Yeoman you be one, that I shall happily haue somewhat to say to in this folowing Treatise, I pray (as before) your patience, that if you finde any thing therein amisse, either in vnmanerly tearmes, or otherwyse, that you would passe it ouer with silence, and impute it to ignoraunce, and not to be done of any malicious or set purpose; or els to say with your selues, <hi>In ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena republica ne sis curiosus,</hi> It is not good to scalde ones lyppes in other mens Pottage. Since he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth neither by me, of me, nor agaynst me, nor any thing that consernes me, why should I spurne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst his speches, or hate him for his harsh harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie? Let them that are galled kicke, and them that are wounded seeke remedie: But yf you be such as your guyltie conscience perswades you, that what as is spoken, is meant by you, for it is an olde saying <hi>Concius ipse sibi, de se putat omnia dici,</hi> the guyltie conscience thinkes what as is sayd, is alwayes spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken himselfe to vpbrayde: Then worthely waigh and consider whether you be iustly accused, and complayned of or no; and yf you finde your selfe to haue offended in such and such thinges, and that
<pb facs="4"/>
what hath been sayd of you, you haue worthely deserued; then be content to bite the lyp, wincke at small faultes, and mende that is amisse: for if you manifest your malice in any opprobrious speaches against the Authour of this worke, then you shall pronounce a definitiue sentence of condemnation against your selfe, as worthy to haue deserued all, and more, then herein is conteyned. For be it kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen vnto you, and all other of higher or inferiour degree, that I haue not touched any of the better sort, neither any that are men well meriting for their mindes and manners; but such as are mates of no merite, and as haue condingly deserued more then I can say against them: but if any of what estate or degree so euer, shall murmure against mee, I will say vnto him as Christ said to the men that brought the woman taken in adulterie before him to be stoned to death, <hi>Hee that hath not offended, let him throw the first stone:</hi> So, he that will acknowledge himselfe touched herewith, let him cast the first stone, let him the first seeke remedie and reuenge: but before he seeke reuenge, it were good he knew who had wronged him. And if he thinke I haue wronged him by speaking any thing against him, then let him come to me and know whether I ment it by him or no, and I will not onely resolue him of that doubt, but also pacifie his impatient humour. Therefore gentle Reader, I expect a pardon of course, if I haue offended by ignoraunce; which I vndoubtedly perswade my selfe to receaue at your handes, and so I leaue you to your labours: which
<pb facs="4"/>
I pray God may yeelde you a plentifull increase. Now curtuous surueyour of these barren Landes, nay barren and mosse-begrowen lines, if thou beest my fellow in fraternitie a Seruingman, to thee I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse my petition, if you be a Gentleman borne, and a Seruingman by profession, if in reading this my Booke, you shall happely stumble on any vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie sentence that may mislike your taste, pocket I pray you this iniurie, as I may tearme it, since (God is my witnes) I meane you no harme, but rather pray for your preferment, and wysh your welfare, then by any meanes to seeke your indignitie, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. And if gentle Reader, thou be a Yeomans sonne, that hath with the complet Armour of foure Markes and a Lyuerie, entered the lystes to play the pryses of a Seruingman, shall in this my Booke finde a lumpe too much leauened, that a weake and queasie stomacke can hardly disgest, I pray thee perswade thy selfe, that it is better to haue a frowne of a friende, then a smyle of a flattering and deceitfull enemie: and whatsoeuer I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of thee, or concerning thee, is rather of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, to forewarne thee of an imminent danger, then to beate thee with the dry blowes of intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ignominie. Wherefore gentle Reader, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer thou be, I earnestly intreate thee, to reuerse that hard sentence of Hatred in lue of my laboure, and rather smother thy discontent with the ashes of silence (if any such thou finde in reading this Treatise) then to wreake thy malice with the hot coales of inquenchable furie; which will sooner
<pb facs="5"/>
consume they selfe, then preuayle against thy mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken enemie. Thus hauing (as I hope) satisfied my curious enemies, I am to craue the goodwill of my courteous friendes; desiring you (gentle Reader) to accept in good part these my labours: which if they shall like you, I shall accompt my gayne great; if not, yet must I needes count my losse but light, in that the doing of it kept me from idlenesse, a thing so dangerous to a young man, as it is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent he should seeke with as much industrie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde the same, as the skilfull Mariners with vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant eyes do labour to passe without perill the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Rockes of <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Caribdis:</hi> And so wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee as to my selfe, I commit thee to God.</p>
