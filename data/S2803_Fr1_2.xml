      <salute>GOOD MADAM,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Do vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that in my priuate iudgment
<pb facs="3"/>
I haue alwaies distasted the too much forwardnes of this age in publishing vnnecessary bookes, and pamphlets. So farre haue I bene from once inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my selfe to offend in that kind. First, in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of mine owne weaknesse and insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie best knowne vnto my selfe; Next, in regard of that great light of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; knowledge which shineth most brightly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where at this day: And lastly, in respect of the great peruersnesse &amp; curiositie that reigneth in the minds of sundrie
<pb facs="3"/>
men, whom nothing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and contenteth, but that which they them selues do, or (at the least wise) affect. Howbeit notwithstanding, after that I had (for mine owne priuate vse) collected and gathered these spirituall directions and consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and also perceiued how that the same might be of some good vse to others, not onely in time of sicknesse, but also in all other afflictions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, whether of mind or bodie: I esteemed it a part of that great dutie which I owe vnto the
<pb facs="4"/>
Church of God, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate &amp; impart these my poore endeuours vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such, and for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite &amp; comfort of all such, as shall stand in neede thereof, in times of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and mortalitie, in the conflict of death, and other sharpe and bitter daies of triall and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; whensoeuer their sins shall stand vp against them, to vrge and accuse them, or the vgly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of death shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright them, or the feare and horror of hell and damnation shall seeme to dismay them. Against
<pb facs="4"/>
all which fearefull &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous assaults of death, of sinne, &amp; of Satan, here in this small Treatise are prouided &amp; selected (out of the rich Armorie of the sacred Scriptures) se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall and peculiar wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and armour of proofe, both defensiue, &amp; offensiue, both for the withstanding and resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, and also for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling and quenching of all the fierie darts of the wicked. Now I haue bene bold to dedicate and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the same vnto your Ladiship, being moued thereunto, partly by the
<pb facs="5"/>
sundry fauours receiued from your Ladiship by my selfe in particular, and partly by those gracious works of pietie and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie wrought, and the great and manifold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits from time to time conferred by your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, in and vpon the whole Towne or Parish in generall, ouer which God hath placed me, (though his most vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy seruant &amp; minister:) accept (I beseech you) this small present (being as the poore widdowes mite) which here I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to offer vnto your
<pb facs="5"/>
Ladiship, as a pledge and testimonie of my vnfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thankfulnesse. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, (who is rich in mercie) grant that as you haue exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion and mercie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies for the relieuing and comforting of many his poore children: so also you may find abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant mercie in the last day, &amp; may be filled with ioy and comfort at the glorious appearing of his Son Christ Iesus. Amen.</p>
