   <head>To my louing Countrymen, but especially to the Parishioners of Standish in Lancashire.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y deere brethren, beloued and longed for, these twenty yeares haue I wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stled with God, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> in teares and prayers, to gaine a blessing to my selfe in the saluation of your soules; and with what fruit, he knoweth best, who knoweth all: as a father I haue trauailed in birth, againe and againe, that Christ might be formed, or at least confirmed in you. Many a Sabboth haue we sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with a double solemnity of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, praise, and prophesie: Many a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth haue we celebrated the Lords
<pb facs="5"/>
Table with the blessed memory of his death and passion: Many a time as a Nurse haue I wiped and wrapped vp your stains: and many a careful night haue I told in mourning after your de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fectiōs: And for any wrong I euer did you, heere I am, beare record with me before the Lord, &amp; before his anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whose Oxe haue I taken, or whom haue I impleaded. God will witnesse with me before whom I stand, in the sight of men and Angels, that I neuer sought yours, but you, that you might be moulded for a better life, and that Christ might be formed in you.</p>
   <p>Yet may I say in some sort as it is in the Prophet: <hi>This day is a day of tribulation and rebuke:</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Isay. 37.3.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>for the children are come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth.</hi> I speake not of all, for many of you hath the Lord chosen, and you are my hope, my ioy and reioycing, in the presence of our Lord Iesus Christ
<pb facs="5"/>
at his comming; but of many I may say, I feare left I haue bestowed vpon them labour in vaine.</p>
   <p>While some with <hi>Reuben</hi> abide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the sheepfolds to heare the blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the flocke, they are couetous:<note place="margin">
         <hi>Iudg. 5.</hi>
      </note> Some with <hi>Gilead</hi> abide beyond <hi>

         </gap>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in the greene fields, and medowes of their delights, and they are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse: Some with <hi>Dan</hi> remaine in ships, and are gone beyonde the seas; they dote vpon their Romish Idols, and they are faithlesse: Some with <hi>Meroz</hi> sit at home in the cels of their superstition, and they are resolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants, who will not come to helpe the Lord, to helpe the Lord against the mightie. Well, I say no more but this: These diuisions of Tribes are great thoughts of heart, yet may we not bee heartlesse, but hold on our course with vnwearied diligence, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that if we sowe in teares, we shall reape in ioy, as did they of whom it is
<pb facs="6"/>
sayd by the Psalmist; <hi>Ibant, flebant, mittentes sua semina:</hi> They went weeping, and carried precious seede, but they shall returne with ioy, and bring their sheaues.</p>
   <p>A glayning of which sheaffe former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallen into your eares, but now I feare forgotten, and gone out of your hearts, I haue thought good, againe to present vnto your carefull and chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian viewe; for it grieueth me not to rehearse the same things often; and for you it is expedient. <hi>Asaphs</hi> song was melodious, though Israel sōg it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tē; &amp; the Arks marching about <hi>Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> seuen times, was no shame in the siege &amp; sacking of <hi>Iericho.</hi> As it is an office of the holy Ghost to leade vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all truth, so is it to bring all things to our remembrance which haue been told vs: seldome told, often forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and who is sufficient for these things? You are nailes of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary and it is not one stroke can fasten
<pb facs="6"/>
you to your hold; but you must be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten riuited with the same heart, hand and hammer. I hope to see you in the high feast of Christ his Natiuity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: yet for that I know not how the Lord may dispose of me, and of mine occasions abrode, I haue sent you this <hi>first step towards heauen,</hi> as an exercise for the time. It was <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> her holy haunt, looking and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Israels cōsolation; I pray God you may trace it on earth, as she then did: so shall you be sure to treade it in heauen, as she now doth. My good &amp; worshipfull friend required it, I may not deny it: your soules need it, I may not withdraw it: Take it then as a pledge of my deerest loue, euer in my praier with you, euer in my practise for you. And now the very God of peace sanctifie you throughout, so as both in soule, spirit, and body, you may be kept blamelesse vnto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Lord Iesus Christ:
<pb facs="7"/>
faithfull is he which calleth you, which will also do it. Brethren pray for vs▪ and the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>
