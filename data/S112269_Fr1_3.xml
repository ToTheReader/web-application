   <head>¶AN ANSVVEARE TO
M. Hardinges Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T misliketh you muche, M. Hardinge, that in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and sundrie cases by mee mooued, wherin standeth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
force of your Religion, I shoulde saie, You, and others of that
parte are vtterly voide, not onely of the Scriptures, but also of
the Olde Councelles, and Ancient Fathers, and that in suche an
Audience, I should so precisely, &amp; so openly discoouer the wantes,
and weakenesse of your side. And therefore, <hi>The greatter my heape riseth, the lesse,</hi>
saie you, <hi>is mine aduantage.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Whereunto I may easily replie, The larger is mine Offer, the more wil your
discrete Reader mislike the insufficiencie of your Answeare: and the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
is your libertie, the lesse cause haue you to complaine.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Wise men,</hi> ye saie, <hi>woulde more haue liked greatter Modestie.</hi> Uerily, the men, that
you cal Wise, woulde haue thought it greattest Modestie, to haue dissembled, and
saide nothinge. But what may the same Wise menne thinke of your Modestie,
that hauinge so often made so large, and so liberal offers of so many Doctours,
are not hable in the ende to shewe vs one?</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Neither looke wee so fiercely, nor shake wee the swearde so terribly,</hi> as you reporte vs.
This was euermore your, and your felowes special, and peculiar commendation:
Who bisides your fierce, and cruel lookes, and bisides the shakinge, and terroure of
your swearde, haue also hewen, and cutte, and slaine, and filled your handes with
the bloude of your Brethren.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, ye shoulde not take it in suche griefe, that, onely for distinctions
sake, by so Ciuile, and courteous a name wee cal you our <hi>Aduersaries.</hi> For, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
you armed with Swearde, and Fiere, and embrewed with our Bloude, wée
might wel haue spared you some other name. That I saide, Ye haue no suche
assurance of the Ancient Fathers, as ye haue borne vs in hande, and as your
frendes vpon your credite haue beléeued, I saide it not, neither of Ambition, as you
expounde it, nor of Malice: but forced thereto by your importunitie, and with great
griefe of minde.</p>
   <p>Therefore ye did mee the greatter wronge, to saie, <hi>I came vaunting, as Goliath, and
throwinge foorth my glooue, like a chalenger, and proclaiminge defiance to al the worlde.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In these woordes, M. Hardinge, Wise menne may finde some wante of your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie.
For, who so auoucheth the manifest, and knowen Trueth, and saieth, that
you bothe haue béene deceiued your selues, and also haue deceiued others, ought not
therefore to be called Goliath. And, notwithstandinge you haue aduentured
your selfe, to be the Noble Dauid, to conquere this Giante, yet for as muche as
ye haue neither Dauids slinge in your hande,<note place="margin">Extra. De Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitu. Licet.</note> nor Dauids stoanes in your scripp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>,
and therefore not likely to woorke greate maisteries, ye may not looke, that the
Ladies of Israel with their Lutes,<note place="margin">De Electio. &amp; Elect. potestate. Significasti. 9. quae. 3. Nemo.</note> and Timbrelles wil receiue you in triumphe,
or singe before you, <hi>Dauid hath conquered his tenne thousandes.</hi> He rather is Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liath,
that setteth his face againste the Heauens, and his foote in Emperours
neckes: and openeth his mouthe a wide, to vtter blasphemies: That soundeth out
these woordes into al the worlde,<note place="margin">De Maioritate, &amp; Obedientia: Vnam Sanctam.</note>
      <hi>I cannot erre: I haue al lawes, bothe Spiritual, and
Temporal in my breaste: I am aboue as General Councelles: I may Iudge al men: but al the
worlde may not Iudge mee, bee I neuer so wicked: I am Kinge of Kinges, and Lorde of
Lordes: I can doo, what so euer Christe him selfe can doo:</hi>
      <note place="margin">In glosa.</note>
      <hi>I am al, and aboue al: Al power
is geuen to mee, as wel in Heauen, as in Earthe.</hi>
      <note place="margin">In Concil. Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran. Sub Iulio.</note> Ye knowe, whose woordes these bée,
<pb facs="5"/>
by whom they are spoken, by whom they are defended, and to whom they are
applied. This séemeth to be the very expresse, and liuely Image of Goliath:
That Goliath, I saie, whom nowe you sée knockte in the foreheade, and fallinge
downe, not with force of worldly power, but onely with that litle roughe despiced
stoane of Goddes euerlastinge, and heauenly Woorde. Touchinge that moste
woorthy, and learned Father, sometime your Maister, D. Peter Martyr, whom
ye would séeme somewhat to commende, not for his Doctrine, from whiche you
haue so suddainely fallen awaie, but onely for his modestie: it cannot be doubted,
but he, beinge at Poissy in that woorthy assemblie, in the presence of the Kinge,
and of other the Princes, and Nobles of that Realme, bothe did, and spake, that
might stande with the trueth of the cause, and also might wel become his owne
personne. But beinge demaunded his iudgement in these cases, he would haue
answeared, euen as wee doo, and woulde muche haue marueiled, that any learned
man would saie the contrary. Not longe sithence ye made the Pulpites ringe,
that your Masse, and<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> al other your whole Doctrine, was assured vnto you by
Christe, and his Apostles, and that for the same ye had the vndoubted continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and succession of fiftéene hundred yéeres, the consent of al the olde Councels,
Doctours, and Fathers, and al Antiquitie, and the Uniuersal allowance of al the
worlde. Thus ye doubted not then to saie, without feare of controlment of
God, or man. Many thousandes thought ye dealte simply, and woulde not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
them: and therefore were easily leadde to beleeue you.</p>
   <p>In this case Christian dewtie, and Charitie required, that the trueth, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of your tales shoulde be opened, that the simple mighte vnderstande, ye had
deceiued them, and that of al that your so large talke, and countenance of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
you were, as you wel knowe, vtterly hable to auouche nothinge. Where
as it so muche offendeth you, that I shoulde so precisely auouche the Negatiue,
and require you to prooue your Affirmatiue, whereof ye woulde séeme so wel as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
it may please you to consider, that S. Gregorie writinge against Iohn the
Bishop of Constantinople, that had intitled him selfe the Uniuersal Bishop of the
whole world, reasteth him selfe likewise vpon the Negatiue. His woordes be these:
<hi>Nemo de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>essorum meorum hoc superbo vocabulo vti consensit:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lib. 4. epist. 32.</note>
      <hi>Nemo Romanorum
Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>tificum hoc Singularitatis nomen assumpsit. <hi>None of my Predecessours euer consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to vse this arrogante name: No Bishop of Rome euer tooke vpon him this name of
Singularitie.</hi>
      </hi> S. Augustine, when he had reckened vp al the Bishoppes of Rome,
before his time,<note place="margin">August. epis. 165.</note> added thereto by a Negatiue, <hi>In hoc ordine successionis nullus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natista
Episcopus inuenitur: <hi>In this order of Succession there is founde no Bishop, that was
a Donatiste.</hi>
      </hi> Yet neither S. Augustine, nor S. Gregorie was euer condemned for
Goliath. By the like Negatiue, you, M. Hardinge, your selfe saie, although vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely,
as ye doo many other thinges bisides, <hi>That neither M. Iuel, nor any one of his side
is hable to shewe,<note place="margin">In the 3. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and in the 15. Diuision.</note> that the publique Seruice of the Churche in any nation, was euer for the space
of sixe hundred yeeres after Christe, in any other tongue, then in Greeke, or Latine.</hi> And yet
wée may not therefore cal you, either Goliath, or Thersites, or by any other like
vncourteous name. You saie, <hi>I take presumptuously vpon mee, to haue readde al thinges, and
to be ignorant of nothinge:</hi> onely bicause I saie, you in these cases can allege no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge.
And why so? Can no man discrie your wantes, and disclose your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truethes,
without presumption? You say, ye haue the consent of al Doctours, of
al ages, and of al times, of your side, shal wee therefore saie, that you vaunte your
selfe of your knowledge? or, that you knowe al thinges, and are ignorante of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge?
You saie, <hi>Ye haue al the Doctours.</hi> I saie, and true it is, <hi>Ye haue not one
Doctoure.</hi> The difference of these saieinges standeth onely in this, that the one
is true, the other vntrue: That your Affirmatiue cannot be prooued: My Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb facs="5"/>
cannot bee reprooued. But, touchinge vaunte of readinge, and knowledge,
there is no difference.</p>
   <p>Howe be it, for as muche as, this Negatiue so muche offendeth you of our side,
let vs hardly turne it of your side: And let vs saie so, as it may bes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e like you, to
haue vs saie: That it cannot appeare, by any sufficient clause, or sentence, either
of the Scriptures, or of the Olde Doctours, or of the Ancient Councelles, or by
any Example of the Primitiue Churche, either, that the Prieste then receiued the
Holy Communion togeather with the people: or, that the Sacrament was then
ministred vnto the people vnder bothe kindes: or, that the publique Praiers were
euer saide in the Uulgare, or Knowen tongue: or, that the whole people thereto
saide, <hi>Amen,</hi> within the space of sixe hundred yéeres after Christe. Let vs saie
further, that Christe him selfe, and al his Apostles saide Priuate Masse, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the Holy Sacramente seuerally alone: That al the Ancient Fathers mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
the halfe Communion onely vnder One Kinde: That al the Common Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were euerywhere saide in a strange Learned Tongue, vtterly vnknowen
vnto the People. This offer is frée, and liberal. And what can you desire more?
But perhaps it shameth you to saie so muche. For, al be it some of you haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
saide it, yet the vntrueth thereof is manifest, and sheweth it selfe.</p>
   <p>Onely ye wishe, <hi>I had vsed some greatter Modestie.</hi> And woulde you, that I
shoulde haue saide, <hi>Ye haue one Ancient Doctoure directly, and plainely of your side,</hi> and
so in that place, and in that presence, for Modesties sake, to haue auouched
open Untruethe, as you, and others had donne before? O, M. Hardinge, in these
cases a meane waie is no waie. Accursed is that Modestie, that drowneth the
Truethe of God. Chrysostome saithe,<note place="margin">11. quaest. 3. Nolite.</note>
      <hi>Veritarem negat, qui cam non liber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat.
<hi>He is a renouncer of the Truethe, that dareth not freely to saye the Truethe.</hi>
      </hi>
   </p>
   <p>Ye saie, <hi>I haue soughte vp certaine smal quaestions of light importance, wherein the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Doctours haue not traueiled,</hi> as not daringe to enter into maters of greatter
weight. Howe be it, it seemeth ouer muche for you, to limite, and appointe
eche man, what he shoulde preache at Paules Crosse. Neither is it muche mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
whether these maters be Greate, or Smal: but, whether you, by colour of
the same, haue deceiued the people.</p>
   <p>But woulde ye haue vs nowe at laste beléeue, that your Masse, your Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
your Real Pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nce, your Adoration, your Sacrificinge of the
Sonne of God, and your Supremacie of Rome be so smal maters? Ye tolde vs
not longe sithence, there were no other maters so greate, as these. And may we
thinke, that your Religion is nowe greatter, nowe smaller: and increaseth, and
vadeth: and waxeth, and waneth, as doothe the Moone? Uerily Pope Nicolas
woulde haue ioyned your Transubstantiation to the Crede, and woulde haue
made it the Thirteenthe Article of our Faithe. And Pope Boniface the eight
saithe,<note place="margin">Extra. de Maio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita &amp; Obedi. Vnam Sanctam. Dist. 22. Omnes.</note>
      <hi>that to be subiecte to the Churche of Rome, is of the necessitie of Saluation.</hi> And
Pope Nicolas saithe, <hi>Who so euer deuieth the Authoritie, and preeminence of that See,
is an Heretique.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Notwithstandinge, howe Greate, or Smal these maters be, it forceth not.
In déede, you had learned them in very smal time: and, as nowe, ye auouche
them with very smal proufes. And, howe smal, and lighte so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uer you woulde
nowe haue them to appeare, yet for the same, ye haue made no smal adoo. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
ought to be taken for smal, wherewith so greate multitudes of Goddes
people maie be deceiued.</p>
   <p>The maters, wherewith Christe charged the Phariseis, were not so Greate.
Yet Christe saithe vnto them,<note place="margin">Matthae. 23. 1. Corin. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

the greate plagues of God. They that firste beganne to maineteine that arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gante
presumptuous title, of Uniuersal Bishop, whiche nowe the Bishop of
Rome chalengeth wholy to him selfe, saide, it was but a Smal mater. But Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie
saithe,<note place="margin">Gregor. lib. 6. epist. 30.</note>
      <hi>Alia sunt friuola, &amp; innoxia: alia sunt friuola, &amp; noxia: <hi>Some thinges are
Smal, and doo no hurte: some thinges are Smal, and doo greate hurte.</hi>
      </hi> And comparinge
the same with the pride of Antichriste, who shoulde cal him selfe, <hi>Deus,</hi> (that is

in two syllables: If the weight of the wickednes, it is an vniuersal destruction.</hi>
      </hi>
   </p>
   <p>Though these maters were Smal, yet the Untruethes, and Errours, that
thereof haue risen, are not Smal. Remooue the same, and your greattest Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
wil fal to nothinge. To conclude, if these maters be Greate, they are the
more woorthy to be considered: if they be Smal, there is the lesse hurte in leauinge
of them, and the more wilfulnesse in defendinge of them: Uerily the whole worlde
is weary of them.<note place="margin">Luke. 16.</note> Christe saieth, <hi>Qui in modico iniquus est, &amp; in maiori iniquus
est. <hi>He that is wicked in the Smal, is also wicked in the Greate.</hi>
      </hi>
   </p>
   <p>You saie, <hi>VVe flee, and forbeare the Iudgemente of the Learned, and shake out these
thinges with greate admiration onely emongest the simple.</hi> As Alexander the Kinge of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia
made him selfe a God, and had muche talke of his Father <hi>Iuppiter</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
the Barbariens: but emongest the Greekes, that were wise, and hable to
iudge, and knewe him wel yenough, he was contente to talke of other maters.
This comparison, M. Hardinge, is odious, and sauoureth ouer muche of your cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.
Wée hunte not for any Admiration, or opinion of Godheade emonge the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

they haue no learninge, they knowe not the Lawe. Emongest them wil he be. There
be reigneth like a Prince: There he seeketh to be made a God.</hi> Here mighte I eftesones
put you in remembrance of him, that hath so longe abused, and mocked the whole
worlde, bothe Princes, and Subiectes: as wel learned, as vnlearned: accomptinge
them al, as wilde, and barbarous: and hath suffered him selfe openly to be Proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

   <p>Alexander stoode in some awe, and reuerence of the Wise: but this man despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
bothe Wise, and Unwise: Learned, and Unlearned, and al the worlde.</p>
   <p>It was somewhat out of season for you, in this place to intreate of the Ualidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of your Canon, &amp; so earnestly to labour, to prooue it faultelesse, before any man
had begonne to touche it, or to prooue it faultie. It is supposed, that some parts
thereof was diuised by Leo: and afterwarde augmented by Gelasius: and after
that by one,<note place="margin">Gregor. lib. 7. epist. 63.</note> whome S. Gregorie calleth Scholastieus: and after againe by Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorius
him selfe: and that at laste, aboute eighte hundred, and fiftie yéeres after
Christe, it was brought to some perfection, and made vp by Pope Sergius.
As nowe, it is more closely pronounced, and more reuerently vsed, then either the
Epistle, or the Gospel.</p>
   <p>But, whether there be any faulte therein, or none, I leaue that to you, M.
Hardinge, to be better considered by your selfe. Your Doctour Durande saithe

   <p>And yowe your selfe, M. Hardinge, at your Masse, and in the highest Secretes
of your Canon, desire God the Father, to looke fauourably vpon Iesus Christe his
owne Sonne, at your request. Your woordes be plaine, and euident: No inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
or shifte is hable to salue them. Nowe yf it be meete, yowe shoulde
intreate God the Father to be merciful vnto Christe his Sonne, and to beholde
him fauourably for your sake, then maie yowe saie, there is no faulte in al your
Canon.</p>
   <p>Yowe seeme to complaine, that I leaue out praier for the Deade, and Inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

      </hi> These menne thinke, they doo no il, geuinge the honoure of

wee haue accesse to Kinges by Knightes, and Marshalles, for that the Kinge is a mortal man,

   <p>Where as ye vntruely say, we laie on loade of sclaunders, to deface the Churche,
yowe maie remember, that there were sometime that charged S. Steuen, S. Paul,

   <p>But he defaceth not the Churche, that defaceth the defacers fo the Churche: and
wipeth of the soile of your Errours, that her face maie shine, and appeare more

Wée maie not thinke, that Christe, Esai, &amp; Hieremie were defacers of the Churche.
He hindereth not healthe, that sheweth the disease. He despiseth not the Churche,

   <p>But yowe of your side,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> haue saide, <hi>Here is Christe, and there is Christe:</hi> And so haue

      </hi> But, what so euer want either is, or is surmised to be in

   <p>And yet I sée no greate cause, why any man should séeke so greately to disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage

muche had I readde, that I marueiled, M. Hardinge woulde euer enterprise, so
muche to abuse the names of the holy Fathers.</p>
   <p>But knowledge oftentimes is vaine, and puffeth vp the minde. God make vs

   <p>It reioiceth mee mutche, that ye saie, ye loue mée, and in respecte of our olde

Infidelles, Antichristes, and Forerenners of Antichriste?</p>
   <p>These woordes be yours, M. Hardinge, not onely, for that they be vttered by
yowe, but also, for that they perteine directely, and properly vnto your selfe.
With these, and other like pearles ye haue thorowly besette your whole Booke,
that it might the more glitter in the eie of your Reader. Herewith your stage
is fully freight. Some man woulde thinke it were <hi>Vetus Comoedia.</hi> So faitheful
ye seeme to be in kéepinge your promise. Yf ye vtter sutche woordes of pure loue,
and frendship, what then maie wée looke for, yf ye once beginne to hate? They say,
the Scorpion embraceth louingely with his feete: but smiteth his poison with his
taile. Thus ye suffer the tēpestes of your affections sometimes to blowe you oute,
and to tosse yowe of from the shoare. In a man of professed grauitie reasons had
benne more conueniente, then reproches. Sutche eloquence might better becomme
some of your yonger Iannizers: who, as their frendes saie here, haue not yet lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to speake otherwise.</p>
   <p>As for these woordes, and these stages, they maie not wel chas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> vs awaie from
the Gospel of Christe. Yt is not needeful for vs, to heare your good reportes:
but it is most needeful for vs, to speake the Trueth.</p>
   <p>The aduertisement, that yow allege out of Salomon <hi>(There is a waie, that vnto
a man seemeth right: but the ende thereof leadeth to damnation)</hi> is common, &amp; toucheth vs
bothe, aswel yowe, as mee: or rather, somewhat more yowe, then mee. Ye were
once deceiued before, by your owne confession. But they, that haue indifferently
weighed the causes, and suddainesse of your change, haue thought, ye are as
mutche, or rather mutche more deceiued nowe.</p>
   <p>Marke, I beséeche yowe, M. Hardinge, what ye were lately, and what ye woulde
nowe seeme to be: what waie ye trodde then: and what waie ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>reade nowe. The
difference is no lesse, then is bitweene Light, and Darknesse: Life, and Deathe:
Heauen, &amp; Hel▪ So greate a change would require some good time of deliberation.</p>
   <p>But if ye be thorowly changed, as yow saie, and if ye be touched in deede, either
with the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> zele of God, or with the loue of your brethren, be not then ashamed to
telle vs, what thinges God hath donne for yowe. Let your Reader vnderstande,
that yow your selfe sometime were that man, of whom Salomon speaketh: That
yow sometime were in a waie, that seemed right, and yet the ende thereof leadde
to damnation: That yow sometime bent your whole harte, and studie to deface the
Churche of God: That yow preached so many yeeres togeather directly contrary
to your conscience: That yow sometime witingly, and willingly, and of purpose,
and malice, deceiued Goddes people: That yow sometime were the Minister of
the Diuel▪ a Turke, an Heathen, an Infidel, a Forerenner of Antichriste: and, that
<pb facs="8"/>
from this rueful state ye were suddainely changed, not by readinge, or conference
of the Scriptures, or Anciente Fathers, but onely for that ye sawe, the Prince
was changed.</p>
   <p>Thus must ye deale, M. Hardinge, yf ye deale truely. So wil your frendes
thinke, ye dissemble not nowe, as yow did before: but are mooued onely of true
zele, &amp; pure conscience. Certainely either, as wee saie, ye are nowe deceiued: or, at
the leaste, as your selfe must needes graunte, not longe sithence, ye were deceiued.
And S. Augustine saithe, <hi>Hoc est erroris proprium, vt, quod cui{que} displicet, id
aliis quoque oportere existimet displicere:<note place="margin">Augustin. De Gene. contra Manichae.</note>
         <hi>This is the very nature of Errour, that,
what so euer misliketh any man, he thinketh al others shoulde likewise mislike the same.</hi>
      </hi>
   </p>
   <p>Sutche is the miserie of Adams children: their harte is euermore inclined vnto
il, and errour. Hereof false prophetes oftentimes take occasion to saie, <hi>Good is Il,
and Il is Good: Light is Darknesse, and Darknesse is Light.</hi> And oftentimes the
people is wilfully leadde awaie, and cannot abide to heare sounde Doctrine: but
turneth their eares to heare Fables.</p>
   <p>Therefore, Salomons counsel is wise, and good. And for that cause wee truste
not our owne eies, to choose our waie: but wee calle vnto God with the Prophete
Dauid,<note place="margin">Psalm. 142.</note>
      <hi>O Lorde, shewe vs the waie, that wee maie walke in:</hi> Wee seeke vnto him,

      <hi>I am the Waie, the Trueth, and the Life: I am the Light of the World:
who so foloweth mee,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iohan. 8.</note>
      <hi>walketh not in darknesse, but hath the Light of Life.</hi> And wee
thanke God, that with his Daiespringe from aboue hath visited vs, and directed
our feete into the waie of peace: into the same waie, that Christe hath shewed vs,
and the holy Apostles, and anciente Catholique Fathers haue trodden before vs.</p>
   <p>Touchinge your exhortation to humilitie, and the denieal of my learninge,
whiche, I trust, of your parte proceedeth from a meeke, and humble sprite, I maie
safely denie that thinge, that I neuer auouched. It cannot shame mee to saie, that
S. Hierome saide, <hi>Dicam illud Socraticum, Hoc tantùm scio, quòd nihil scio:<note place="margin">Hierony. in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa. in Abdiam.</note>
         <hi>I wil saie, as Socrates sometime saide, This thinge onely I knowe, that I knowe nothinge.</hi>
      </hi>
In these cases, as I séeke no praise, so I feare no reproche. What so euer wante is
in mee, there be others, that can supplie it. How be it, I neuer vnderstoode, but
Ueritie, and Humilitie might wel stande togeather.</p>
   <p>Where yow saie, what so euer skil, or knowledge I haue, or had, I haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
bente it onely to the reproche, and sclaunder of the Churche, it is no greate
maisterie, M. Hardinge, to speake il. But I trust, God him selfe, that iudgeth
iustly, iudgeth otherwise. Yf there be in mee, I say not, any talente, but onely
any mite of a talente, my praier vnto God is, and euer was, it maie be bestowed
wholy to the honoure, and comforte of his Churche.</p>
   <p>And yet maie not yow, M. Hardinge, neither sette sutche stoare by your selfe,
nor so mutche abase, and discredite others, as though bisides yow, &amp; your felowes,
there were noman méete to be counted learned. When the Iewes, in contempte
of al others, boasted them selues to be the onely stocke, and Bloud of Abraham, S.
Paule by an humble kinde of presumption doubted not in al respectes to compare
with them in this wise:<note place="margin">2. Corin. 11.</note>
      <hi>Hebrewes they be: and so am I. Israelites they be: and so am
I. The seede of Abraham they be: and so am I.</hi> Againe he saith, <hi>Thus doo I, and thus
wil I doo, that in the thinges, whereof they glorie, they maie be founde to be, as wee are.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I wil force this comparison no further. Sutche contention is but vaine. O
M. Hardinge, this saieinge is common vnto vs bothe: <hi>By the Grace of God wee are,
that wee are. O that his grace be not in vs in vaine.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Corin. 15.</note>
   </p>
   <p>For my parte, bothe at your requeste, and also without your requeste, I vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly

to gréeue you, I denie it too: I denie myne estimation: I denie my name: I
<pb facs="8"/>
denie mée selfe. Onely the Faithe of Christe, and the Truethe of God I cannot
denie. Or with this Faithe, or for this Faithe, I truste, I shal ende. I cannot
withstande the Sprite of God. I cannot saie, the consente of al the Auncient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Fathers was an heape of errours, and a linke of Heresies. Although
you, M. Hardinge, coulde denie al togeather at an instante, and vpon the suddaine,

   <p>Touchinge D. Fisher, I scoffed neither at him, nor at any others. Onely I

   <p>Kinge Agesilaus, the better to embolden his Souldiers to the fight, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

the saide woorde, <hi>Victorie:</hi> and immediatly shewed the same vnto his Captaines,
and Souldiers, as if it had beene written by the Goddes. The simple Souldiers,
not vnderstanding this policie, and thinkinge, the whole mater had in deede béene
wrought by miracle, grewe full of courage, not doubtinge, but their Goddes, that
had written, <hi>Victorie,</hi> woulde also geue them <hi>Victorie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>By like policie, and to like purpose, it séemeth, you, M. Hardinge, would beguile

   <p>But you are not yet equal with the credite of Pythagoras. It is not sufficient

and Heretiques. That lesson might haue serued you longe agoe, before ye were
espied. It behooueth yow now, to haue some stronger argumentes, specially figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge
against God.</p>
   <p>For my parte, notwithstandinge I were thorowly persuaded longe before,
yet am I nowe some deale the more satisfied by these your traueiles. For, touching
your wante of Scriptures, Councelles, Doctours, and Examples of the Primitiue
Churche, I am wel, and fully confirmed by the sclendernes of your proufes.</p>
   <p>And I doubte not, but some of these, that now be aboute you, beinge, I trust,
not frowardly carried awaie with wilful malice, but hauinge the feare of God, and
a reuerente zele to doo the best, although perhaps not knowledge sufficiente, to
iudge, what is best, after they shal vnderstande some parte of your dealinge herein,
wil by Goddes Grace beginne, somewhat to forethinke them selues of their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<note place="margin">Augustin. in Iohan. tract. 7.</note> &amp; to caste some doubtes of your credite. S. Augustine saith, <hi>Iuris forensis est,
vt qui in precibus mentitus sit, illi ne profit, quod impetrauit: <hi>The Lawe is this,
that, who so hath made a false suggestion, shal lose, what so euer he haue gotten by the same.</hi>

   <p>O M. Hardinge, Credite without trueth, is no credite. Your woorke is ouer
weake: It hath no fundation: It cannot stande. Chrysostome telleth you,
<hi>Sutche is the Nature of Errour:<note place="margin">Chrysostom. de Laudibus Pauli hom▪ 5.</note> It vadeth of it selfe, and wil comme to grounde
without resistance.</hi> Remember the place, ye sometime stoode in: Remember, from
whence ye are fallen: Remember the causes of your fal. It is no shame to rise
againe.<note place="margin">Ecclesi 4.</note> God is able to restoare yow. The wise man saith, <hi>There is confusion, that
bringeth grace, and glorie.</hi> God hath endewed yow largely with greate giftes.</p>
   <p>Turne the same to the obedience of the Faith of Christe. As there is wisedome in
séekinge the Victorie, so there is wisedome in geuinge place. Folowe the same
Counsel, ye geue others. Denie your owne learninge: denie your owne estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
denie your selfe.<note place="margin">Iohan. 9.</note> Geue the glorie vnto God.</p>
