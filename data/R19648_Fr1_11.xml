   <head>The Introduction.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD hath created all things for his glory;<note place="margin">Prov. 16.4. for himselfe. Esay. 43.7.</note> and must be glorified by them, all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and by every of them in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The celebration of this his glory, he hath committed in heaven to the Angels, in Earth unto Man. Yea the devils de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his glory, and Hell it selfe roareth it forth. For this purpose he hath assigned unto man the circuit of the whole earth, to be the stage of this Action, and the place of his habitation, whilst it is in hand.<note place="margin">Wisd. 9.2. Ecclus. 17.2.</note> He hath delivered unto him the wealth and furniture thereof, to be the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for performing of it: and the meanes of his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in the meane season. And lest he should want leisure, and opportunity sufficient for so great a busines, he hath commanded the heavens themselves, the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres, yea the whole frame of Nature,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.19.</note> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon him, to apply their sweet influence unto him: to assist him in all his indeavours, and to measure him out a large portion of time and life for the full accomplishing of this right noble most glorious Vocation.<note place="margin">Ecclus. 17.2.</note>
   </p>
   <p>It is a rule in Philosophy that <hi>Beneficium requirit officium.</hi> And we are taught by the law of nature, that he which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth a benefit oweth to his benefactor, Honour, Faith, and Service, according to the proportion of the benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Vpon this rule was the ancient law not oweth of England, but of other Nations also, grounded, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled every man that had Lands, or tenements of the gift of another to hold them of his Donor, and to doe him feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="27"/>and service for them, (that is, to be faithfull unto him, and to yeeld him some kind of vassallage) though no such matter were once mentioned betweene them; Yea at this day, if the King give Lands to any man without expressing a tenure, the Donee shall not only hold them of him, but he shall hold them by the greatest and heaviest service, viz. Knights service <hi>in Capite.</hi> But God knowing the heart of man, and seeing that man was like those husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Gospell, which having the possession of the Vineyard, forgot their Lord of whom they received it; he thought not sit in wisdome to leave the rights and servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces due unto him in respect of this his seignory and dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the mutable construction of Law and Reason: but hath expresly declared in his written word in what sort man shall enjoy and hold these his infinite benefits. Therefore since our owne reason hath taught us, that we owe no lesse unto our earthly benefactors then <hi>Homage, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,</hi> &amp; some honorary and <hi>subsidiary rent</hi> for the Lands and tenements we receive of them; much more effectually must the same reason teach us, that we owe a farre larger proportion of all these unto God, of whom besides our essence and creation we have received such innumerable blessings.</p>
   <p>But as God is a Prince full of all royall munificence and bounty, so is he likewise of all abundance &amp; riches: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he neither needeth nor requireth anything of all that we possesse, as a subsidiary rent wherewith to enrich his coffers, or support his estate, but as an honourary tribute towards the magnifying of his goodnesse, and the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of our own thankfulnesse. This, to be short, is the sum of all religion. Therefore whilst <hi>David</hi> with admirable strains of divine meditations flieth through the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of all the glorious works of God, and of our duty
<pb facs="27"/>to him in respect thereof, he breaketh out in every passage of his Psalmes with variety of acclamations and invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to stirre us up to glorify God, not only inwardly by the spirit, but outwardly also, in, and by, and with all worldly things and meanes whatsoever. And not knowing how or whereto containe himselfe in this his passion of most blessed zeale, he runneth at last, as he were wild with it, and closeth up his Psalter, with Psalme upon Psalme, six or seven together, one upon the neck of another, onely to quicken and inforce our sluggish disposition to a worke of so great consequence and necessity.</p>
   <p>It almost carrieth me from my purpose; but to returne to my selfe, let us see in what way we must glorify God with these externall things that we have thus received from him, and that is, as before we have shewed, in the same steppes that the rules and maximes of his owne law have prescribed. viz.</p>
   <list>
      <item>First, that we shall doe unto him <hi>Homage,</hi> that is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> true and faithfull service. For it is written; <hi>Him onely shalt thou serve.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>Secondly, that we shall be faithfull unto him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth true tenents, that is, not to adhere to his enemies, the world, the flesh, and the devill, as conspiring with them, or suffering them to subtract, or encroach upon any part of that, which belongeth to God our Lord para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount.</item>
      <item>Thirdly, that we shall pay duely unto him, all rights, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and duties, that belong unto his Seignory: for it is written, <hi>Give unto God that that is Gods.</hi> And againe; <hi>Give the Lord the honour due unto his name, &amp;c. Psal.</hi> 29.1.</item>
   </list>
   <p>For all which we must be accomptants at the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: and there lies a speciall writ of <hi>Praecipe</hi> in that case; <hi>Redde rationem villicationis tuae,</hi> Give an accompt how
<pb facs="28"/>thou hast carried thy selfe in this thy businesse, that is, this his service committed to thee.</p>
   <p>But omitting to handle the first and second of these great Reservations, I have undertaken the last, viz. <hi>de reddendis Dei Deo,</hi> of ren dring that unto God that is Gods. And in this I humbly beseech his blessed hand to be with me, and guide me, for whose onely sake and honour I have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to leave the shore I crept by in my former booke, and now as with full sailes to launch forth into the deepe, upon so dangerous and uncertaine adventure. Amen.</p>
