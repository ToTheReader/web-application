      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong all the histories (gentle reader) that any time haue bene written frō the beginning of the world vnto this present was there neuer any to be compared to the historie of the Passion, resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ascension of Christ, written most exactly by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> foure Euangelists, albeit dispersed and in sondry places, and aptely not without great trauell and payne gathered in due order by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> most godly &amp; wel learned man <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius,</hi> with certaine briefe annotatiōs and many wholesom &amp; godly instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and declarations of the harder places adioyned vnto it by the same man for the easier vnderstanding to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> reader, which history as it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and true, for that no percel ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was written but by the holy ghoste
<pb n="4" facs="3"/> (although he vsed men as instrumēts therunto) which onely is truth, &amp; frō whom proceadeth nothing but truth. So by it is sette forthe vnto vs the springe and ground of our saluation, namely the passiō and death of Christ the price of our redemption, the onely pacifieng of the wrath of god towarde vs, &amp; way to eternal ioy which Paule affirmeth to be great and wonderful &amp; such as neither eye hath sene, neither eare hath heard, nor heart can imagin but what shal I nede now to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lōg or further declaratiō either of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> certaintie therof, wherof no christiā man hauing y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> feare of god before his eies hath euer douted: or of the cōmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie comming vnto vs by the same, whiche is so amply and manifestly set forth in the treatise it selfe. But for as much as it is writtē in a strāge tonge namely in latin which y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> multitude of our countrey vnderstand not, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so (which is much to be lamented) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="5" facs="3"/> of these which are in place of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, such is the infelicitie of this our time, lest these I say shuld vtterly wāt the vse of so fruitefull a worke, I was moued and thought good both for the aduaūcement of the glory of god, and also for our brethrens farther encrease of knowledge, to bestow some labour at such conueniēt leasure as I coulde well spare, to turne it into our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish tongue plainly and truly without all arte or eloquence, as one tendyng nothing els but the endes aforesaide, which if I obtein, I shal accompt my labours right wel bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, minding also farther to trauail in the same kind of labor, if I shall se by this that my labour hath bene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
