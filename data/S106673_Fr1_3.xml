   <head>¶ <hi>Yues Rouspeau to the Christian Reader,</hi> helth from Iesus Christe our Lord.</head>
   <p>AMongst the causes of common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and scourges wherwith God puni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sheth the world, <hi>S. Paule</hi> maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the abuse and contempt of the Lords Supper: sayīg, for this cause many are weke and sick among you, and many sléep. For if we would iudge our selues, we should not bée
<pb facs="4"/>iudged. Therfore we ought not to meruail that the last yéer God did so seuerely punish this poor Realme of <hi>France,</hi> with plague, war and famin. For the contempt of the Gospel, and the abuse and prophanation of the Lords holy Supper, were the cause therof: so that niether they that folowed the Popes faction ought to complain of God, nor they likewise that make profession of the Gospel, because there was a fault bothe in the one &amp; the other. First touching the abuses of the Papists, we are able to set down sure iudgement by the woord of God how that the Masse is wholly fraught with blasphemyes: how it abolisheth the holy Supper of our Lord Iesus Christe: how the remembrance of his death and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is therin suppressed &amp; brought to nought, how there is no communion, and that in sted that Iesus Christe commaunded all his in ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nerall to take, eat, and drink the bred &amp; wine, one only taketh, eateth &amp; driketh for all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rest. We see there moreouer, how they cause a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature tobe worshiped therin, yea a morsell of bread in stede of the Creatour, how they séek Christe Iesus there in earth, wher as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> word of God, the Apostles créed, &amp; the olde Canons teach vs to haue our harts lift vp on high and to séek him by faith in Heauen. To be short there are to be séen many other detestable and
<pb facs="5"/>infinit abuses whiche I now passe ouer with silence. Now then séeing they haue obstinatly planted &amp; grounded thē selues in that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yea &amp; for the maintenāce of so vile and wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked a thing haue put to death so many good mē, so many holy &amp; true martirs of our Lord, Ies{us} Christe. Hath not God rightfully visited vs in this behalf? Secondly we sée also y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ther were great &amp; notable abuses on their behalfe, that made profession of the true woord of God. How many were there which knew no more then y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Papists to giue any reasō of their faith and which presented them selues like beasts to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lords holy Supper? Some came thither as ignorāt asses, other as swine leding a disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute &amp; slanderous life. I wil not speak of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit number of hipocrits, false brethern, trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp; Apostates,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Luc.</hi> 21.48.</note> which were vnknowē &amp; had a countenance &amp; shew of honestie. Therfore is was not without cause that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wrath of god was kindled against his people, &amp; that they were scourged with stripes, for wittigly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the knowledge of his holy name. Now that this good God through his Sonne Iesus Christe, may cast his pitiful and merciful eye vpon this so poore and desolate Realme: it be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>houeth bothe the one and the other to learne hence forwarde to serue and honor God accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to his woord, better then they haue doon,
<pb facs="5"/>espetially that they take héede that héerafter they prophane not by any meanes y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Iesus Christe our Lord. To this ende and purpose they may read this little tretise, wherin they shall finde y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> the true preparing of our selues to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lords supper, consisteth not in decking of the body, fair garments, pomps,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.24.</note> countenaunces, and outward profession of the name of God, but in clenenesse of hart, and vp rightnes of consciēce, to th' end that God who is a spirit, may be also serued of his in Spirit and trueth.</p>
