   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Short Horse is soone curried; though a ragged Colt is not so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlie broken. A pettie pamphlet may be sodenlie answered; though a prophane pedantick <hi>Haeretick</hi> is not so readily put to silence. But it is no matter: Dogs will barke; and euill wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers will euer be busie bodies? and the Concision will neuer bee of the true circumcision. <hi>Si pro er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore homines &amp; damnabili dissensione, &amp; conuicta modis omnibus falsitate tanta praesumunt, &amp;c. quantò magis aequum est, &amp; oportet eos qui pacis &amp; vnitatis Christianae asserunt veritatem &amp;c. sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere instanter at{que} impigrè, non solum pro eorum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimine quiiam catholici sunt, verum etiā pro eorum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectione qui nondum sunt? Nam sipertinacia insupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles vires habere conatur, quātas debet habere constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,<note place="margin">Aug. ad Festū ep. 197.</note> quae in eo bono quod perseuerantèr &amp; infatigabilitèr agit, &amp; Deo placere se nouit, &amp; proculdubio non potest hominibus prudentibus displicere?</hi> It is therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, and it shall not be grieuous, because it is a work of no great labour, as to answere words with words againe; <hi>a foole according to his follie, &amp;c:</hi> so to teach a yong coltish Priest, by this Priest, to range a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="5"/> without an errand; and pretend an Embassage without a message. Whose ragged
<hi>Rhetorick,</hi> &amp; jm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudēt boldnes is the more jntolerable, because he taketh vpon him the person of <hi>Christ,</hi> hauing been himselfe a <hi>Priest</hi> &amp; lym of Antichrist: &amp; hauing crept like a <hi>Locust</hi> out of the bottomlesse pit; he crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himselfe the king of kings and Lord of Lords as comming downe from heauen. Is it any matter to halter the necks and euen to breake the hearts of such Colts? Who dare to entitle their owne beastlie and blasphemous neighings with the name of, <hi>An Embassage from the sonne of God, our Lord and sauiour Iesus Christ?</hi> But because this Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor is now departed the mortalitie of this life, as it seemeth to be insinuated in the preface, I leaue him to the Iudgement of the Eternall Iudge:<note place="margin">Augustinus.</note> whose Iudgements are sometimes manifest, sometimes secret, alwaies iust. Neuer-thelesse as one of the <hi>Lords Prophets</hi> and servants of Christ, in the cause. and quarrell of my Maister though the meanest and weakest of Ten-thousand I haue thought good to take in hand from a true and harty zeale that I beare vnto the Church of Christ, to examine this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage. And first he might haue gyuen leaue to some sturdier steed to haue rushed into the battell formost, whether his meaning were in simple ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie to call backe his friends from the Enemies campe; or in slye subtiltie to stirre and raise vp an open Rebellion: so to muster all the papists in this Kingdome: (Recusants and
<hi>Schismaticks</hi> (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe diuideth them) in one <hi>Armie.</hi> I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine

<pb facs="5"/> his meaning, because I know not his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, I leaue the purpose of his heart to him that is <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. But (as one saith) <hi>Quicquid id est,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Virg. AEneid. 2. Prov. 12.5.</note>
      <hi>timeo.</hi> I feare whatsoeuer it be. For I am sure: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silia impiorum sunt fraudulenta.</hi> The counsels of the vngodly are deceitfull.<note place="margin">Mat. 7.18.</note>
      <hi>An evill Tree cannot bring foorth good fruit:</hi> and a bad man can hardly haue a good meaning: (as the Lord said to the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses):<note place="margin">Mat. 12.34.</note>
      <hi>How can yee speake good things when yee your selues are euill?</hi> Wee will not doubt but the Iesuited Recusant is in his hart traitourously affected: and waiteth onely for an oportunitie to be a Rebell. When time and power should haue offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues we make no question but Captaine <hi>Buckland,</hi> Priest, would haue buckled vp himselfe and his harnesse to the battell; and so will all that are of his minde, to roote out the memoriall of English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, though it be by faggot and fier, or famine, or Sword, or any other violent &amp; forcible meanes. But thanks be to God, we hope, that long desired black and bloudy day dawneth not yet, howsoeuer their many brauadoes and cracking threats may make perhaps some peoples harts, of the weaker sort amongst vs, to startle now and then within them. A little puffe of a quick winde will easely raise a small billow in euery Riuer, yet no danger of a storme at all. And therefore not troubling our selues greatly with this pettie Captaines purpose: though it were, as it may seeme it was, in this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage, to strike vp an Alarum to an opē Rebellion of the Popish faction: but trusting in him that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
<pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>Israell</hi> neither slumbring nor sleeping:<note place="margin">Psal
121.4.</note> wee leaue his jmagined deuice and drift vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his associats, to discloze or Cloze vp in their owne bosomes at their owne pleasure. Only this wee aduise his (so named by him) Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: that because they are Papists, they would Correct their opinions, and because no Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in Ioyning with our Church, they would hold on their practise: It may in time by Gods grace, and good means, reforme their hypocrisie and dissimulation wherewith they are charged, whether Iustly or vniustlye, themselues can tell best, by this Priest. Yf they haue a good meaning and are comming onwards to the true Christian faith, they are in a right course to Ioyne with vs in our seruice and Churches. If they stand resolute as yet in their superstitious deuotion: Yet God may reueale the better parte vnto them. If they be obstinate both <hi>Haereticks</hi> and <hi>Hypocrits,</hi> and corrupt our people with their leven of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Creeping into corners seduce the hearts of the simple; either let them hearken vnto their owne priest; or els, <hi>Vtinam abscindantur qui perturbant nos.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Galat. 5.12.</note> Would to God they were cut of that trouble vs. And so I come to the Embassage. Wherein not to trouble our selues at all with his method, beeing, as I conceaue it, nothing els but a bundell of goodly argumēts heaped together to perswade <hi>Schismaticall</hi> dissembling papists to become open and obstinate Recusants: (That only conclusion being the drift of his whole message:) Let vs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
<pb facs="6"/> him foote by foote; and as he nūbreth them vp in order, and so prawnceth forward in his run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vaine and Rhetoricall trappings: so let vs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the fowle and daungerous bogs of filthy Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish way wherouer he trippeth like a wilde Irish: and, as it seems, would haue our Protestants who may light vppon his booke, to runne and fall, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnacquainted with such paths and Passages. Wherefore our Cheife purpose is onlie to discouer those erroneous and Blasphemous Positions and Paradoxes which here and there he hath tumbled into his Treatise: whereinto whosoeuer shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him of the Protestant flocke may plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues as into popish and Impious bogs and gulfes before they be aware. The rest of his Rhetoricke tending only to the perswasion of their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall Crew to vnmaske themselues and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in outward profession that which they are in inward resolution. We let Passe, as it were, as not offensiue vnto vs: wishing, as well as he, that no one of them would dissemble with God and the world, but shew themselues in their owne colours that we might know by their pronunciation whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be <hi>Gileadits</hi> or
<hi>Ephraimits?</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iudg. 22.5.6.</note> on our parts, or on our enemies. For if wee shall finde them hereafter to be onely <hi>Temporizers,</hi> Cunning <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auels, vnderminers, Vault-workers,</hi> or the like because they are in opinion halting
<hi>Israelites,</hi> halfe-baked <hi>Ephraimits,</hi> luke warme <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> and the like: wee shall hold it, I trust, a most iust and necessarie course to cut them of for notorious <hi>Hypocrits</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="7"/> God, &amp; detected Traitors against their King and country. Lastlie, because this false Embassador hath been so bold to deliuer this Message in the name of Christ; wee hauing greater reason in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the verie truth, then he had of his Popish cause, to craue the assistance of our blessed <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Sauiour:</hi> doe most humbly intreat his heauenly Maiestie to Countermaund this Embassage as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forged in his name, &amp; to controwle the follies, falshoods, and blasphemies thereof, in his owne words: Humbly crauing pardon of his Highnes, &amp; Holines, being most vnworthy to speake from so great &amp; absolute a Monarch, though wee shall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the message with no semblable wisedome, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie, and perfection as may beseeme so diuine a Maiestie. Therefore thus we proceed.</p>
