   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S none but a faithfull friend, can perfectlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of those requisites, which truly belong vnto his friend: So none but a Father, can rightlie coniecture of that sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing loue, which a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beareth to his owne child.</p>
   <p>This loue of mine (my Sonne,) hath made me ouer-bold with mine owne businesse, and with mine owne conuenient pleasures; in borrowing
<pb facs="4"/>some houres (which were indeede owing to my publike imployments and to my necessarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation) to compose, and to write this ensuing Discourse; not to please my selfe, (if it were praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie) but to doe you good: and (by such Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, and by such Instructions, as are therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised) to enrich your vnderstanding and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, with those selected virtues, and most commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded qualities, whose discourse it doth containe.</p>
   <p>For like as the fairest building, wanteth her chiefest beautie, except it bee exactlie flourished, and bountifullie furnished within: so the outward lineaments of the bodie, are depriued of their choisest, and of their chiefest luster, if the inward parts and mind bee not adorned, with such splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent virtues, and with such Gentleman-like qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as doe make a man to bee compleat, and consequentlie, a profitable member in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale.</p>
   <p>J say, a profitable member in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale; because it sufficeth not, that a man doth know much, and can doe well, by meanes of that knowledge; except he also doe produce into action, such effects as his virtues and his knowledge haue
<pb facs="4"/>enabled him to performe. For, otherwise, such a man may fitlie be compared, to a rare and perfect Diamond, which beeing vnpollished, serueth for no vse. Or to a faire Ship, loaden with Silkes, with Spices, and with Gold, beeing swallowed vp into the Seas mawe, whereby it is made of no value or esteeme. For a recompence therefore, of these my labours, and in thankefulnesse, for my loue towards you, I wish and doe aduise you, to imploy some times, not onely to reade this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course often, but also with diligence to meditate, and publikelie to exercise those virtues, and those qualities, which heerein are deseruedlie praised, and commended.</p>
   <p>Especially and aboue the rest, those two, which cannot too much bee applauded: I meane Religion, and honestie of life: which (as good Salt) will season, whatsoeuer you take in hand: And will (as the South and the North Pole Starres) direct your course aright, whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you chance to saile, in the troublesome Ocean of this your worldly and transitorie pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage: So shall your life bee profitable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, and pleasing to your quiet conscience:
<pb facs="5"/>And so shall your death bee crowned with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited praise and commendation; and both your life, and your death shall bee precious in the sight of God: <hi>Who will reward euerie man according to his workes, be they good or euill.</hi>
