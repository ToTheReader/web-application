   <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Sir <hi>Thomas Bennet,</hi> Lord Major

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Heras it is the order of the most, to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate vnto the
best deseruer, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of worthines of the one, as office and
dutie of the other, I deeme me not to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, in dedicating vnto your L.
this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which is dimmed for want of time, wherein more acuitie might
haue increased, yet perfectly seeing the way wherein to wait attendance,
for your L. vse and seruice: the readier for that your L. is placed a
prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour ouer our worthiest and most famous place of protection, whose
wings beeing but bedewed with false report of pestilence, no small sort
doe sauour of distresse, there, and els where: but bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by death
displumed of many, and dispossessed of more by daily departure, may
iustly possesse all with griefe, and desire to releeue, to see
the citie in griefe, induring separation daily, whereas vnitie should be
howerly: the rather, for that your L. hath not beene absent, but with your
brethren carefully busied, in comforting, releeuing, and preuenting, which
ought to be a ioy and comfort for all, to see the distressed haue so
readie a keye, not onely to shut vp, and secure from pursuing
pestilence, but to let out at libertie without wast of the afflicteds
wealth. Of which ioy I taking part, haue ioyfully imparted, this little labour,
which I shall with more ioy in better manner, indeuour to pollish and
finish, and with most ioy of all bold to dedicate vnto your L. if this may
mooue your Honour, to limit the same to passe in open way, where the
most may accompanie the benefit therein: which I humbly commend vnto your L.
as a better, beseeching the best of all, to comfort your Honourable
estate with increase and continuance of happines and heauenly blisse.
And so ceasing your further trouble, J humbly take my leaue.</p>
