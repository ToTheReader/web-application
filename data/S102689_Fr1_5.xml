   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Gentleman by name <hi>Nomomathes,</hi> with the ritches, fortunes &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewes of this world very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully furnished, being liberally minded, and willing that his foūtaines should flow forth to the benefit of others <note n="a" place="margin">Prouerb. 5. vers. 16.</note>, being a great fauourer of learning, and desirous by all meanes to increase &amp; aduaūce it, maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and kept with him continually in his house three learned men, &amp; greatly addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the studie of the Lawes, one of thē named <hi>Canonologus</hi> a Canonist, the other <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicgnostes</hi> a Doctor of the ciuill law, and the third <hi>Anglonomophylax</hi> a Barrister, &amp; profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of the cōmon law of this realme of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland: of them he made great accōpt, &amp; of their learning aboue all humane sciences, as being most fit and pertinent to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding &amp; administratiō of publike affaires: &amp; as the famous <hi>Cosimus, Medices,</hi> &amp; <hi>Laurentius</hi> his nephew <note n="b" place="margin">Machia. lib. 7. &amp; 8. Flor. hist.</note>, did harbour in their houses at seuerall times, and with many benefites pleasured the two excellent men &amp; starres of learning <hi>Marsilius Ficinus,</hi> and <hi>Ioannes Picus
<pb facs="12"/> Mirandula,</hi> being in their houses the nurse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of good learning, as two faire flowres in their naturall roote: &amp; as <hi>Cato</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">Plut. in Cat.</note> the Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can a long time before the family of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was knowne in Florence, or Florence was knowne by the name, had continually in his cōpanie three worthie philosophers <hi>Apollonides</hi> the Stoike, <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetike, and <hi>Cleanthes</hi> a cunning Phisition, many times conferring with them, alwaies profiting by them: so this Gentleman of whom I speake, reaping much good and benefite by the persons abouesaid did vse them exceeding kindly, and many times proposed diuerse questions of the law vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, wherein he had good resolution; and hauing sequestred himselfe from the multitude of priuate affaires, wherwith he was often molested, hauing attained to a conuenient dispatch and cōclusion of thē, hee allotted certaine times of purpose for the hearing of matters of law handled and debated: and sometime in his parlor, and chamber, sometime in his garden, and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, he would giue diligent eare and attē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to such disputation &amp; discourse, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="13"/> set downe certain rules, &amp; as it were, a good platforme of the exercise. The rules were but two in nūber, which were great in weight. 1. He willed thē to exclude all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilling, to yeeld vnto the better reason, &amp; with ioint indeuour to search out the truth of euery matter proposed: for he said that <hi>nimiùm altercādo amittitur veritas.</hi> 2. He would not (sithence cōparisons were of al things most saucie &amp; malepert) that they should enter into any disdainefull comparison of the lawes which they professed, but should rather vse them as bretherne, then as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and should reuerēce the greatnes of knowledge, where they found it, &amp; pardon the weakenes when they had discouered it, without bitternes of tongue or venom of hart, assuring themselfes that the meanest of these Lawes might in some particular things profite the greatest of these lawiers: for as he obserued the sayings &amp; doings of <hi>Cato</hi> in stead of a law, so one of <hi>Catoes</hi> sentē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious &amp; iudicious oracles he had alwaies in his mouth, <hi>Alienā artē temerè ne contēnito:</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by these rules as by limits bounded the order &amp; manner of there cōference, he
<pb facs="13"/> proposed certen things distinctly, &amp; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be discussed, which were thus by him marshalled. Because in the raunge of all humane affaires subiect to the contēplatiō of law, cōtracts haue frō ancient time bene the ground of vesting &amp; altering the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of things, he wold therfore first haue thē to begin with a discourse of cōtracts: &amp; because there be two things following af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cōtracts cōcluded much in vse namely. 1. a gift or graunt. 2. a bargaine or sale, he would therfore of these two haue thē dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gētly to argue: &amp; because gifts haue bene often made to raise and create a tenure, his desire was that in the 4. place they should discourse of seignories and seruices: &amp; for that grāts or gifts be made somtime ioint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or by moities he wold haue thē to speak somwhat of iointenāts or tenāts in cōmō: &amp; because they that haue things by gifte &amp; grant do often exchange thē, his mind was they should hādle the nature, &amp; māner of exchāges, &amp; sithēce the last disposing of al worldly things is by the last will &amp; testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the party, he therefore requested them to be painful herein: after as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cōueiances of lāds, which be in the
<pb facs="14"/> realty he would haue them to proceede to personal things, as namely to treat of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing and lending, and of the bailement or deliuery of goods and chattels: because such things were much in vse. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these and the precedent matters were many times occasions of action, therefore he thought it conuenient that they should speake somewhat of the forme and manner of ordinarie proceeding in matters of law, and when they had finished this taske a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouesaid, he praied them to discourse of penall and criminall matters, of common trespasses and wrongs, and other offences against the peace, the order of which he would hereafter set downe. The method of their conference being thus digested, and respit of studie and deliberation being giuen, <hi>Nomomathes</hi> thus spake to <hi>Codicgnostes.</hi>
