   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Lemens Alexandrinus</hi> hath a strange relation of <hi>Locrus,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Admonit. ad Graec. <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> a famous Musician in <hi>Greece;</hi> who, as he was playing a choise <hi>Madrigall</hi> upon his Harpe, in the midst of it, brake his Trebble; and (see) a Grashopper leaping upon the necke of his Instrument, held out the note till he had made an end of the Song. The like accident hath befallen our <hi>Locrus,</hi> or rather <hi>Lynus;</hi> who, as hee was warbling an exquisite <hi>Lesson,</hi> lately <hi>prick'd</hi> by him, brake not his <hi>Harpes,</hi> but his <hi>Hearts string:</hi> and J like the Grass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper, with my harsh sounding voice, must now supply that defect, and perfect the tune. The prime Doctor of the Schooles, <hi>Aquinas,</hi> was wont to say, that hee desired but to live so long, till hee might see the golden-mouthed
<pb facs="149"/> Father, Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> his imperfect worke upon <hi>Matthew</hi> finished. And J doubt not, but that many, who very much affected Sir <hi>Humphrey Lynde</hi> his person, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, heartily wish, that this his <hi>Cygnea cantio,</hi> and last worke against the common Adversarie, might be perfected. Which task, partly out of my respect to the worthy deceased Knight, partly at the request of some friends yet alive, I have undertaken; promising to adde (according to the distinction of the Schooles) <hi>perfectionem partium</hi> thereunto, but not <hi>graduum,</hi> a perfection of Parts, but not Degrees: that is, an Answer to all the parts and Chapters remaining, but not with the like multiplicitie of reading, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratnesse of style, as may be observed in the Knights writings. For, J <hi>owne</hi> not this Worke as mine, nor intend to shape any new weapon against the Adversaries of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, upon his <hi>Anvile,</hi> but onely <hi>Hammer</hi> that <hi>Iron</hi> which hee tooke <hi>red hot out of the fire.</hi> In which regard, I entitle my Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adversions upon <hi>Flood</hi> his reply, <hi>Stricturas;</hi> partly, because like sparkles, they give some,
<pb facs="149"/> though small light into the points in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie: partly, because they burne whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they light. Some peradventure, would have wished a more moderate Answer; but in reason they could expect no other from him, whom, not zeale onely, of the truth of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion scandalously traduced, but love to a departed friend, and just anger and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at an Adversarie, trampling upon his ashes, heat in the penning hereof, above his ordinarie temper. Were <hi>Romish</hi> Priests and Jesuits ingenuous Adversaries, in whom there were any hope to gaine by mildnesse, and win by yeelding unto them as much as might be, without prejudice to the Truth; I should then perswade all that write against them, to temper their Inke, rather with Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water than Ʋinegar.<note place="margin">Vrtica si mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liùs tractetur vrit.</note> But in all my conflicts with them, at home and abroad, I find them like Nettles, <hi>which sting if they be gently touched, but hurt not at all if they be roughly handled.</hi>
