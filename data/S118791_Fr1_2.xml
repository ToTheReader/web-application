   <p>RIght worthy and much respected, The last Aprill, when I went out of the Towne to the Army, I was engaged by promise to three of my friends among you; As occasions offred, to aduertize you now and then, of our proceedings before y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Busse, which according to my weake ability, I did performe. But seeing the most part of you were eye witnesses at the siege, Saw our workes, and approaches, went to the very point, and into the galleryes, and sent some Cannon bulletts into the Towne, before it was giuen ouer, and since saw that glorious day (which made amends for your ill nights lodging) when the Enemies garrison marched out of it: And that hauing now more leasure for the refreshing of your memories, I haue recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the parts of my letters then written to you, into a whole and briefe discourse Touching the siege of the Busse, and the surprising of Wesell. I confesse it is a graue story, &amp; a braue subiect, for a farr more eloquent pen then mine, to worke vpon, but considering my employment in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>his siege and that truth &amp; bluntnesse best beseemes a souldier, I haue ventered vpon It to breake the yee vnto another. Such as it is, It comes vnto you from a souldier as a small retribution in acknowledgment, of that great loue and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>omfort he hath found amonge you, and not to shewe him selfe an vngrateful man beseeching you to accept of it with as free a hart, as he Presēts it vnto you: &amp; to pardon what therein is amisse. Thus praying the Almightie to enrich you with all his blessings both Spirituall and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall I recommend you to his grace, and protection, and rest.</p>
