   <head>THE ARGVMENT OR CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TENTS OF THE FIRST BOOKE OF GOVERNMENT.</head>

      </gap>d on from the most single to the composed, because we may then be well said to know a thing, when we know the first causes and the first principles thereof, euen to the verie bottome and ground thereof, as is written in the beginning of his Naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie. Forasmuch therefore as the dutie of him that dealeth with matters of State, is to treat of ciuill Societie and to seeke out the causes thereof, from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Aristotle purposing to write thereof, sheweth first of all from whence this societie proceedeth, wherein it consisteth, and to what end it is ordained: begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the first and simplest partes thereof, that is to wit, the companie of man and wife, master and seruant, father and children: of which companies a hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold is compacted. Afterward by increasing many housholds into a street or ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and many streets into a Citie, Corporation, or Common-weale: he sheweth the same to haue a naturall constitution, and to be the most perfect companie, and the end thereof to be of the best sort, as which comprehendeth all the other endes, and whereunto they be all referred. Then forasmuch as no companie can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themselues without goods, he treateth of the manner of getting them, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the maintenance as well of houshold as of Common-weale, of which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of getting he setteth downe diuers sorts both natural and artificiall: among the which he vtterly discommendeth interest and vsurie. Moreouer, because no companie can continue vnlesse it be held togither by some gouernment, he fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the first causes of Gouernments from out of nature, beginning at the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernments of houshold, and affirming that the husbands commaunding of the wife, is Citie-like or Commonweale-like: the fathers commanding of his children, is Kinglike or Princelike: and the masters commaunding of his seruants and slaues is tyrant-like: disputing there at large whether there be any slauerie or bondage by nature or no. Insomuch that from these first three Gouernments of Houshold, he deriueth all sorts of publicke gouernment, as well voluntarie as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, resembling their first originall to man, who is composed of bodie, soule, and mind: the soule hauing masterlike authoritie ouer the bodie, and the mind hauing Commonweale-like and Kinglike soueraigntie ouer the soule. And therefore hee affirmeth that the ordinance of Gouernments, and of obedience vnto magistrates, is no lesse naturall than is the beginning and maintaining of ciuill societie. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit as the Philosophers of old time spake of matters more stately and cunningly
<pb facs="16"/>
than the common people, so did they vse many wordes and phrases farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the common vse of speech. But yet of all others Aristotle laboured to shewe himselfe most obscure, vsing short speeches, and most commonly doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which maketh him verie hard to be vnderstood, and more hard to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. Neuerthelesse, for the great profit that is to be receiued by the reading of him, he hath been translated into Latine, Arabicke, Hebrew, and many other Tongues: a sure token that for knowledge and cunning, he holdeth the chiefe roome in common reputation, and by vniuersall consent of all men. The which thing hath mooued me likewise to translate this worke of his into French, which I take to be very profitable and agreeable to the manner of our countrey. And if this my translation be not found to be so smooth and elegant as many other mens are, let them which shall looke vpon it, vouchsafe to consider, that in Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle not eloquence but substance is to be looked for: and that it is not possible to deliuer him other than he is in his owne originall Greeke: and yet that it were verie much to haue deliuered him as he is there, and to haue set downe his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faithfully, keeping the proprietie of both the Languages. Notwithstanding to the intent he might be the better vnderstood and the easier to be dealt with, I haue added expositions taken out of the best Authours, and interlaced them throughout where need was, with examples of things done within mans remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, specially such as were nearest to our present age, and to mine owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, in hope to make this worke of Ciuill Gouernment the more perfect by comparing things of olde time with the things of late time in euery sort of Gouernment.</p>
