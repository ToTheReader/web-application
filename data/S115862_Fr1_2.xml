   <head>TO MY HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOVR'D FRIEND, Sir KENELME DIGBIE, Knight.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ere it not well knowne to me, and more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to some singularly literate men, endowed with sublime wits (with whom great is your name) whose ingenuity, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb facs="3"/>
iudgement, and iustice I have not without cause) in high esteeme. Were it not that the voices of all those Schollers who have occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily conversed with you, testifie your great gifts by nature, your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richments by industry, methodical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commenced in the Latine, Greek, and the mysticall Languages (rare instruments of universall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) prosecuted in the liberall Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, perfected in the high and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. I say your propitious nature, your named addictions, with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not ordinarily found in any so intensive, yea, and so immersed, by which the accomplishment of them, as also almost of all speculative and
<pb facs="3"/>
practique hath beene by you rarely acquired. Were you not knowne to be a great Animater to Learning, and hence affect and cherish all the wayes to the acquisition of it in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of them, who yet are to bee bred; were there not yet over and above manifestations of your cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous respects to our family, my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table encouragement among these so many foresaid.</p>
   <p>I should not have beene so bold to have presented this, alas, poore Introductory offering, so farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you, so richly in this and other excellent parts endowed.</p>
   <p>And lest yet I prove too too hardy in my presumptuous importunities
<pb facs="4"/>
upon the precedent named. I here crave humbly that I may under your wings coverture deliver these not formerly received in our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to this our countries view; yet such, as <hi>I</hi> am no wayes diffident, but will square to true, authentique, and genuine Latine construction, with evident perspicuitie, and easie manuduction, therfore profitable &amp; full of encouragement to youth. All which will clearly appeare to your worthy selfe, as singular helpes, I say, to those who are not arrived to the habite of Latine construction.</p>
   <p>Let but the luster of your incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably endowed selfe appeare fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to my labours, and many
<pb facs="4"/>
sollicitudes in this little compiled piece, then will <hi>Momists</hi> snarles ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be checkt, nipt, and intelligent men (such as are not preiudicated) to whose iudgements I humbly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my selfe, will not disdaine the reading hereof, were it that they were solely allured by your accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For further abilities cannot they acquire by this low subiect. Language already in them being spunged up from authentique Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors true fountaines.</p>
   <p>And though small be my present, yet may not I give the attribute of the entire peece to my selfe. Should I be bold herein, it must necessarily be that I were a betrayer of the
<pb facs="5"/>
Truth. Though I may well say that I have not beene idle. The most part of the <hi>Regimen,</hi> as you reade it in Latine, was compiled by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brixa</hi> (a rare professour of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca)</hi> His Spanish Comment, vindicatory of his texts truth, I turned into English. Yet have I strengthened the one and the other diversly, and in many places.</p>
   <p>Whatsoever concerneth <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance</hi> is mine, there being not found in the said <hi>Nebrixa,</hi> such as might ought profit, or exceeding little.</p>
   <p>The totall cutting off the figures of Construction hath beene my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; which <hi>I</hi> haue wrought to
<pb facs="5"/>
release the learner from innecessary perplexities: which both the truth and profit will plainly appeare to the intelligent, and will facilitate the ignorants taske.</p>
   <p>The further reasons of all will appeare in the Preface which is drawne, at my request, by a friend, well versed in the learned Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, importuned by me to confront the Latine with them. Vpon assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was my request that there would bee found consonance and harmony in this Latine Language and them. I am satisfied in my friends integrity therein, that so they are found.</p>
   <p>Be you (worthy Sir) iudge who
<pb facs="6"/>
are expert in them. And were it that the Latine Syntaxe should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare divers from the construction of those Languages; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, so delivered as it is, The Latine will answer in its true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine compleatly for it selfe.</p>
   <p>Thus wishing happinesse, and all graces to your worthy selfe, Noble Sir, I humbly take my leave.</p>

      <signed>Yours in all due respect: IOH. HAWKINS.</signed>
