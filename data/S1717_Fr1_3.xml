      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O bee much in perswading those that be favorites of some great person, to use that interest for their best advantage, were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour somewhat needlesse, considering naturall selfe-love inclineth men in such cases to be sensible enough of their owne good. Yet so dull is our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of matters that are of an higher nature, that though wee have the eare of God alwayes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto us, and free accesse to the throne of grace through Christ who appeareth in heaven for us,
<pb facs="6"/> carrying our names in his breast, yet wee need stirring up, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this blessed liberty, though the whole world be not worth this one prerogative, that wee can boldly call God Father. This dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion of our carriage ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in part from Satans malice, who laboureth to keepe us in darknesse, that we beleeve not, or minde not our best priviledges: which if wee did, how glorious would our lives appeare? how comfortably and fruitfully should we walke? what honour should God have by us? what sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice from us? how should wee overlooke all opposite power? But now by reason wee are prone to beleeve Satan, and the lyes of our owne heart, and ready to call truth it selfe into question, as if these things were too good to be true, no marvell if we passe our dayes so deadly. For what use of an hidden and lockt up treasure, if we use not this key of prayer to
<pb facs="6"/> fetch from thence for al our need? What benefit of all the precious promises made in Christ unto us, unlesse wee alledge them unto God, and with a reverent bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse binde him with his owne word, which he can no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, then ceasse to be God? If we tooke these things to heart, God should heare oftener from us, we would be more in heaven than we are, seeing wee should bring as much grace and comfort from God as we could bring faith to graspe and carry away.</p>
   <p>Besides this fore-mentioned mindlesnesse of our priviledges, since the fall the soule naturally loveth to spend and scatter it selfe about these present sensible things, and cannot without some strife gather it selfe together, and fixe upon heavenly things. Now this talking with God requireth an actuall bent of the minde, and carryeth up the whole soule into heaven, and exerciseth as all the
<pb facs="7"/> parts, so all the graces of the soule, faith especially, prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing else but the flame of faith. And Satan knowing that when we send up our desires to God, it is to fetch supply against him, troubleth the soule, weake of it selfe, with a world of distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Where he cannot corrupt the doctrine of prayer (as in Popery) with heresies and superstitious follies, there he laboureth to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the exercise of it. Wherein we should be so farre from being discouraged, that we should rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son rather that that must needs be an excellent dutie which is so irkesome to the flesh, and which the devill so eagerly sets against. This should incourage us to this exercise, wherein lyeth all our strength, that if in spite of Satans annoyance and our owne indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, we will set upon this duty, we shall finde our selves by little and little more raised up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and our hearts more and
<pb facs="7"/> more enlarged, God rewarding the use of that little grace wee finde at the first, with increase of strength and comfort. To him that hath (in the exercise of that he hath) shall be given more. We should labour not to be ignorant of Satans enterprises, who besides his diverting our mindes from prayer, and disturbing us in it, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth by all meanes to draw us to some sin, the conscience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will stop our mouthes, and stifle our prayers, and shake our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and eclipse our comfort: which he oft aymeth more at then the sinne it selfe unto which hee tempteth us. We should labour therefore to preserve our selves in such a state of soule, wherein we might have boldnesse with God, and wherein this gainfull trading with him might not bee hindred.</p>
   <p>To passe over many other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the neglect of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and dealing with God by
<pb facs="8"/> prayer, we may well iudge, as one of the chiefe, a selfe-sufficiencie whereby men dwell too much in themselves. He that hath nothing at home will seeke abroad. The poore man (saith <hi>Solomon</hi>) spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth supplications. If wee were poore in spirit, and saw our owne emptinesse, it would force us out of our selves. Alas what temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation can we resist, much lesse overcome without fresh succour? What crosse can we endure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impatiencie, if we have not new support? What successe can we looke for, yea in common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, without his blessing? What good can we do, nay thinke of, without new strength? When we do any good by his power, do we not need pardon for the blemishes of our best performances? What good blessing can we enjoy, so as we defile not our selves in it, without a further blessing, giving us with the thing the holy use of it? Yet we see most men content to
<pb facs="8"/> receive blessings as they come from Gods generall providence, without regarding any sanctified use by prayer, whereas holy men knowing that God will be sought unto even for those things of which hee hath given a promise,<note place="margin">Ezek 36.37.</note> in obedience to this his divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, desire to receive all from him as a fruit of their prayers. And Gods manner is to keep ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny blessings from his children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they have begged them, as delighting to heare his children speake. The consideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of moveth those that have neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est communion with God to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him in all their waies, depending on him for direction, strength, successe, whereupon he delighteth in shewing himselfe more familiarly unto them in the sweetest experiences of his love, guiding them by his counsell whilest they abide here, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bringing them to glory.<note place="margin">Psal. 37▪24</note> As other graces grow in those that
<pb facs="9"/> are in the state of grace: so this spirit of prayer receiveth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall increase upon more inward acquaintance with God, and their owne estates. Whence they can never be miserable, having God to poure forth their spirits and ease their hearts unto, who cannot but regard the voyce of his owne Spirit in them. But of our selves, such is our case, that God who knoweth us better than wee know our selves, saith, wee know not what or how to pray, <hi>Rom. 8.26.</hi> This language of <hi>Canaan</hi> is strange unto us. Which our blessed Saviour in mercy considering, stirred up a desire in his Disciples to bee taught of him the Sonne, how to speake to the Father. Where thereupon hee teacheth them a forme, which for heavenly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of matter, and exactnesse of order, sheweth that it could come from no other Author.</p>
   <p>This holy pattern comprizing
<pb facs="9"/> so much in so little, all things to bee desired, in six short petitions, it is needfull for the guides of Gods people to lay open the riches of it to the view of those that are lesse exercised. An endevour which his excellent Majesty thought not unbeseeming the greatnesse of a King. For the use of a set forme of prayer, and this in speciall, I will make no question: yet in the use of this prayer, we may dwell more in the meditation and enforcing such petitions as shall concern our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasions: For instance, if ever there were time of praying, <hi>Let thy kingdome come,</hi> let Christ arise and his enemies bee scattered, then certainly now is the time for us to ascend up into heaven by our prayers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake Christ, that hee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the winds and waves, and cause a calme: that hee would bee strong for his Church, in
<pb facs="10"/> maintaining his owne cause. It is Gods manner before any great worke for his Church, to stirre up the spirits of his beloved ones to give him no rest. How earnest was <hi>Daniel</hi> with the Lord imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly before the delivery out of Babylon.<note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> And undoubtedly if we joyne the forces of our prayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and set upon God with an holy violence, hee would set his power, his wisdome, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, on worke for the exalting of his Church, and ruine of the enemies of it. Now is the time for <hi>Moses</hi> his hands to bee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held whilest <hi>Amalech</hi> goeth down.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">As in the lives of David, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa, Ezekia, Iehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, &amp;c.</note>The prevayling power of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with God in times of danger, appeareth not only in the sacred history of the Bible, but hath been recorded in all ages of the Church.<note place="margin">Euseb. l. 5. Tertul. in Apologet.</note> In the primitive Church, <hi>An. Dom. 175.</hi> the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Christians was called the
<pb facs="10"/>
      <hi>thundering legion,</hi> because up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their prayers God scattered their enemies with thunder, and refreshed themselves with show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in a great drought.</p>
   <p>After in the good Emperour <hi>Theodosius</hi> his time, <hi>An. Dom. 394.</hi> upon an earnest prayer to Christ, the winds fought from heaven for him against his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as they did for us in <hi>1588.</hi> And continually since, God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver left the force of faithfull prayer without witnesse. If we would observe how God answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth prayers, wee should see a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed issue of all the holy desires he kindles in our hearts: for hee cannot but make good that title whereby he is stiled, a God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer, <hi>Psal. 65.2.</hi> which should move us to sow more pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into his bosome, the fruit whereof wee should reap in our greatest need. Jt would bee a strong evidence in these trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb facs="11"/> times, of the future good successe of the Church, if wee were earnest in soliciting Christ with these words which himselfe hath taught us, <hi>Let thy kingdom come.</hi> For put him to it, and hee will never faile those that seeke him. <hi>Psal. 9.10.</hi> He loveth impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
   <p>But to speake something of this Treatise of this godly and painefull Minister of Christ; which is written by him without affectation, as desirous to cloath spirituall things with a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner of writing, the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and godly Reader shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a sound, cleare, substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all handling of the greatest points that naturally fall within the discourse, and a more large and usefull unfolding of many things, than in former Treatises. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth he sought the good of all: so that besides the labours of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy men, there will be just
<pb facs="11"/> cause of blessing God for his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance in this worke. To whose blessing I commend both it and the whole Israel of God.</p>
