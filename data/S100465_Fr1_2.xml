   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT there is no studie either more Excellent, more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: or more worthy of Man, then the studie of the holy Scriptures; hee <pb facs="3"/> shall best know and iudge that applyeth himselfe wholy thereunto; and shal perceiue that man to bee worthily called blessed,
<hi>Which meditateth in the law of God day and night.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 1, 2.</note> I doe verily confesse that all the sacred bookes, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, are wrapped and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties; by which (as it were by certaine strict keepers of a most stately Temple) The holy Ghost hath straitly prohibited the accesse and misteries vnto prophane and proud men; and that it is rightly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <pb facs="3"/> of them which <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> is reported to haue said when he hapned vpon <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus</hi> bookes of nature: <hi>That those things which hee vnderstood seemed excellent vnto him; and that hee thought so also of them which hee vnderstood not; but that it was needfull to haue an Interpreter to them.</hi> No where can you see more euidently, no where can it more appeare which is spoken in the old Greeke prouerbe; <hi>Those things which are excellent are difficult:</hi> Or, that saying which passeth far &amp; neare from <hi>Hesiodus</hi> concerning vertue, <pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>That it is scituate in a steepe and high place, and that it hath a passage in the beginning, hard, and full of paine and labour.</hi> But doubtlesse although the labour be great, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall, it doth sufficiently recompence with profit, the paine with ease; the earnest endeauour of the minde with rest. For although they seeme to haue much hardnesse; yet without doubt they haue farre more of true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect delight. For how great a matter is it to bee led by a King into a wine-Cellar?<note place="margin">Cant. 2.4.</note> For Charity to
<pb facs="4"/> be rightly ordered? How great a matter is it to sucke those brests better then wine, sauoring sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the best oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?<note place="margin">Cant. 1.2.</note> To hold wisedome (as the Apostle speaketh) among those that bee per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.6.</note> Yet not the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world, nor of the Princes of this world which come to nought; but the wisedome of God in a misterie, which none of the Princes of this world knew?<note place="margin">7.</note>
      <note place="margin">8.</note> To be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the distribution of heauenly treasures? <hi>To behold the glory of God with open face?</hi> Certainely the <pb facs="5"/> sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the future glory, which (when wee well vnderstand the sacred bookes) shall be reuealed in vs. But the men of our time are quicke and ready to other studies, vnto these for the most part they are slow and do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that these are to bee left to idle men, and such as tarrie at home, or else vnto Preachers. Whereby it happens that such as are vnfit for sermons, though they haue leasure enough, doe rather bestow their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and endeauour in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <pb facs="5"/> other matter.</p>
   <p>How much the holy Scriptures doe profit prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, I haue often said; and how greatly they stand in neede of them which are excercised in Schoole disputations, I could say, and perchance will hereafter shew. Now this I auouch, that (albeit these Scriptures bee most profitable to helpe others) they iudge very ill, who thinke they are to bee stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died onely for other mens sakes. For if we reade with great profit the bookes of the holy fathers, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned men which <pb facs="6"/> are called, and are spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and by reading them doe finde our selues much bettered; shall there bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny book so spirituall which may bee compared with those which the spirit of God it selfe (by the choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest, and wisest men) hath deliuered vnto vs? If the small brookes doe helpe and (as it were) satisfie; what shall that great <hi>Riuer</hi> doe which
<hi>Ezechiell</hi> saw,<note place="margin">Ezec. 47.1.</note> issuing forth vnder the threshold of the Lords house? which he could not goe through because the waters of that deepe riuer were risen so that they
<pb facs="6"/> could not bee passed ouer. And when I had returned,<note place="margin">5.</note> said he, behold, at the bank of the riuer were very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trees on either side,<note place="margin">7.</note> what are those many trees on either side the banke of the riuer, but the ancient writers ioyned to the Law and the Prophets, and the new writers, who sitting together by the streames of the Euangelists and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; doe alwayes waxe greene as most beautifull trees and abound with pleasant fruite: the riuer is the same, because it is the same author of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the scope the <pb facs="7"/> same, but the ages and times diuers, which are resembled by both the bankes.</p>
   <p>Of these trees and of these waters it is said, and he shall be like a tree <hi>plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the riuers of waters that bringeth forth his fruite in his season,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 1.3.</note>
      <hi>his leafe also shall not fall away, and whatsoeuer be doth it shall prosper.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I was wont to maruaile with my selfe as often as I did reade in Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> that the study of the Scriptures had wonderfull power to change the <pb facs="7"/> minde of man, to quench the desires of the flesh, to procure the contempt of the world, and briefly to gaine all kinde of vertue; vntill I perceiued hee spake those things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee had made triall in himselfe; and that it is a wrong, not to belieue him that hath experience. <hi>Hee that beleeueth not,</hi> let him first reade the Scripture, not as though hee would interpret it to others, but to be turned wholy to his owne profit: let him medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate therein day and night; he shall feele a stony heart <pb facs="8"/> to bee mollified, a cold heart to be inflamed, with heauenly fire: <hi>for the words of the Lord are like fire,</hi>

         </gap>er. 23.29.</note>
      <hi>and as a hammer that breaketh the rocke in peeces.</hi> He shall perceiue the loue of the world to vanish away, the desire of eternall good things to bee stirred vp in himselfe, his minde filled with a certaine incredible delight; which he that felt it cried out,
<hi>how sweete are thy words vnto my taste?</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal.

      <hi>yea sweeter then hony to my mouth.</hi>

   <p>O wisdome guide of the heauenly life, teacher of <pb facs="8"/> vertues, bane of vices, fountaine of light, expeller of darkenesse, what should wee, nay what should the whole life of man be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee▪ Thou art the companion in labour, thou art the comforter in aduersitie, the ouerseere and guide in prosperitie, the instructer of youth, the foundation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the most sweet rest of old age. Come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs ascend vp to the hill of the Lord,<note place="margin">Isa.
