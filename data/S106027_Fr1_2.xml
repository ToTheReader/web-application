The other confesses neere threescore differences amongst their owne doctors in one onely point of their religion. Gathered faithfully out of their writings in their own words, and diuided into foure bookes, and those into seuerall decads. Whereto is prefixed a serious disswasiue from poperie. By I.H</title>

Yet here, I offer to your Highnesse not so much any fight of ours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them of Rome, as theirs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst themselues, and therein for vs: what can be more aduantage to vs, or shame to them?

Behold, here your Highnesse shall sit still, and see all the Romish Doctors (after all their brags of peace) scuffling and grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling together before you: and (which is most worth) in BEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LARMINES owne Theater; No aduersary can giue them more deep wounds, then their own swords: And if ciuill discord can give vs hope of their ruine,<note place="margin">Har.

not either their innocence, or our guilt: If God haue not now opened their own mouthes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them of bold falshood, let them haue no accusers.
