Church, and also in these latter times, that
zealous desire and endevour in many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Divines to advance true Religion, and
to benefit the church of God, that they have
not onely by their assiduous preaching in
their life time wonne many soules to God, but also have left
divers monuments in writing, whereby they <hi>being dead, doe yet
speake:</hi> and the holy Doctrine by them taught is transmitted
and propagated to posterity after them. Amongst whom
M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>John Smith,</hi> late Minister of <hi>Clavering</hi> in the Countie of

and Holinesse of life whilst he lived; whose memorie is
also very pretious with good men since his departure out of
this life: besides his indefatigable paines which he tooke in
dispensing faithfully the Word of life, did leave behinde him
certaine Treatises in writing, which in the judgement of some
godly men were like to prove profitable to the Church, but
because they were left by him not perfectly digested into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as having no intention to present them to the publike
view (such was his Modestie and Humility;) therefore some
of his friends at the intreatie of me and my wife, the Relict of
the said M. <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> her former deare husband (having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

from us) have taken great paines to gather them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
to make them readie for the light, which their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie,
as it was very acceptable to us, so we were very desirous
that the fruit thereof might redound unto many, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did cause commit them to the Presse, knowing that any
good the more it is communicated, the better it is. And this
Treatise containing the <hi>Summe of Faith,</hi> being (as it were) a

unto your Honorable Patronage being an Orphan deprived

great Care of the good of your Countrie which is not onely
