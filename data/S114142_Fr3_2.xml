   <head>TO THE READER, that asketh, what, when, and where, was this Battaile of LEPANTO?</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the yeare of CHRIST IESVS, 1571. His o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Arch-Enemie the Great <hi>Turke,</hi> having had many Victories by Land in sundry Nations, as well in subduing whole Countries as in taking ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny strong Cities and Castles from the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> which confined neere his Territories, enforcing the <hi>Christians</hi> either to renounce their holy Faith, or to endure unspeakeable Slavery themselues, their Wiues and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, beeing daily bought and solde in open Markets, like Horses, Oxen, and Asses.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="51"/>The <hi>Turke</hi> by this time had Conquered many Ilands and Cities bordering upon the Sea: by meanes whereof hee was greatly enriched and strengthened with Gallies and other maine Forces. And in this yeare, 1571. knowing a Division amongst divers <hi>Christian</hi> Princes, as well for matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as for affaires of State: Vpon hope of which advantage, hee assembled and furnished a mightie Armie of Gallies, presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thereby to become Soveraigne of the Sea, and Lord of the Land, at one instant.</p>
   <p>But such was the great Mercy of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie GOD that he stirred up the hearts of many <hi>Christian</hi> Princes, (the Queene of <hi>Englands</hi> ayde beeing not wanting) who conjoyned together, and furnished a very strong defensible Navie of Ships, Gallies, and Galliasses: And encountred with the <hi>Turkes</hi> at <hi>Lepanto</hi> (which lyeth in part of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania</hi> in <hi>Turkie:</hi>) And at the time of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, the Winde changed on the <hi>Turkes</hi> side, and came on the backe of the <hi>Christian</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, and carried the smoke of all their Shot upon the <hi>Turkes</hi> Gallies, Foists, and Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines: so as they could not well see how to
<pb facs="51"/>
defend themselues or offend their Enemies: which the <hi>Christians</hi> well observing, with all religious Resolution, right brauely gaue Charge and chase upon the Miscreants; and sunke and tooke of <hi>Turkish</hi> Gallies full Two hundred and thirtie, and at that Fight slew aboue Thirtie thousand <hi>Mahometists,</hi> besides a great number of Prisoners taken by the <hi>Christians</hi>: and aboue Twelue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand redeemed by force from <hi>Turkish</hi>-slaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. In this blessed Victorie, the <hi>Christians</hi> lost not aboue seven or eight Gallies, nor of them aboue Eight thousand persons slaine.</p>
   <p>This Overthrow to CHRISTS Enemies was done, the Sixt day of October, 1571.</p>
   <p>And the Ninth of November following, amongst other <hi>Christian</hi> Princes the Newes being brought over land to Queene ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZABETH (of ever blessed and immortall memory.) Shee commanded the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> to giue Almightie GOD hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and heartie thankes, <hi>Her Sacred selfe</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the same: The <hi>Londoners</hi> also made Bonfires, and showed other pleasant signes of rejoycing.</p>
