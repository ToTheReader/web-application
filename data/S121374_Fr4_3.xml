   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Vagrius</hi> a noble man of <hi>Antioch</hi> a learned writer and continewer of this Ecclesiasticall historie may not lightly be ouerskipped with out commending of his prayse and vertues to immortall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and rehearsing of them to the encouragement of all studious nobilitie, to the profite of the louing reader, and the furtherance of christian profession. his honor was nothing impaired, his blood nothing blemished at all, in that he being a tēporall man acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him selfe with ecclesiasticall affaires. <hi>Sabellicus</hi> writeth that <hi>Bartolomevve</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle<note place="margin">Sabellicus.</note> came of a noble race, forsoke the brauery of courtiers, and became the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Christ. <hi>Peter: Dorotheus,</hi> and <hi>Gorgonius</hi> being pages vnto the Emperour <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>

Euseb. eccle. hist. lib. 8. cap 11.</note> woulde forsweare Christ. The treasurer together with the lieuetenant of a certaine towne in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> chose rather for the trueth in Christ, with fire to be consumed to ashes, then here to enioy all worldly treasure. <hi>Audactus</hi> a noble man of <hi>Italie,</hi> prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the garland of martyrdome before all the glorie and pompe of this transitorie<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 8. cap. 5. Euseb. eccle. hist. lib. 7. cap 15. Socrat eccle. hist. lib. 3. cap 11. 1. Cor. 1.</note> life. A noble man of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> rent in pieces a wicked proclamation in the face of all the foure Emperours. <hi>Astyrius</hi> a Senator of <hi>Rome,</hi> thought it no staining of his honor, to take vp on his shoulders the deade bodie of a blessed martyr, and prouide for it a funeral. <hi>Iouianus, Valentinianus</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> noble men and afterwards Emperours one after the other, threwe away their sword girdles, left their offices, departed the court of <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostata,</hi> rather then they woulde deny Christ. Yet <hi>S. Paule</hi> saith that not many wise men according vnto the fleshe: not manie mightie, not manie noble men are called. true it is in respect of a greater number of the contrary, or rather we may say that these were not fleshly minded, their disposition was not carnall, their wisedome was not worldly. how great a comfort is it vnto christian profession when princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fosterers, when Queenes become nurces, and noble men become fauourers of the christian faith? In some countries we see that noble men most of all spend their time in studie and learning. It is not decent in some countries for the pesants sonne, the farmour, the frankline, or howsoeuer ye terme him to forget his fathers rusticall toile, &amp; forthwith addict him self to the gentlemans trade. The Pope most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calleth noble men to his colledge of Cardinals, Dukes and Earles yongest sonnes, he vsed to make Cardinals sometimes in their cradles. Bishops and Archbishops in many countreis descende of noble houses. <hi>Osorius</hi> Bishops of <hi>Lusitania</hi> in Portingall writing against <hi>M. Haddon,</hi> sticked not to giue vs an inklinge of his parentage. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I mislike with this in the churche of Rome, <hi>sicaetera essent paria,</hi> for I reade<note place="margin">Socrat. eccle. hist. lib. 5. cap 8.</note> that <hi>Nectarius</hi> a noble man by office praetor of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was chosen to be by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of that seae, of a hundred and fiftie byshops which then assembled together at
<pb n="460" facs="206"/>
      <hi>Constantinople,</hi> partly for that, and partly for other things. <hi>Ambrose</hi> also lieuetenant of a prouice was made byshop of <hi>Millayne.

Thalassius</hi> Senator of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> lieuetenant of <hi>Illyrium</hi> was made byshop of <hi>Caesarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> I see that <hi>Euagrius</hi> vvho in the time of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius Constantinus</hi> was Quaestor, and in the time of <hi>Mauricius Tiberius</hi> was maister of the rolles, together with diuers others occupied themselues about Ecclesiasticall affaires, but I highly commend such as shewe forth tokens of their nobilitie by studie of vertue, politicke gouernement of their countrey, noble prowesse, valiauntnesse of courage, maintenance of the trueth, and furtheraunce of the Gospell. some thinke it is inough for them to bayte at the vniuersitie, there steale a degree and forth with be counted gentlemen: or to be in commons in one of the Innes of court, where there are many wise, zealous, and learned gentlemen: or to get into some noble mans ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and by vertue of the cognizance to be called a maister: or to purchase for a piece of money a coate armour: or to begge a farme, and by vertue of the valuation in the queenes bookes to become a gentleman. Euery one thinkes not I am sure, that these sorts of men are to be numbred among the auncient &amp; noble houses, though in processe of time antiquitie seeme topreuaile very muche with suche kinde of men, long possession is a great matter in lawe and an olde deede though it be forged will further the matter very much. The <hi>Arcadians</hi> called them selues <gap reason="foreign">

I except them euer and in all places, vvhiche liuely expresse in vertuous life, the noble fame, and great renowme of their auncestors. </q> so farre <hi>Theodorus.</hi> But (God be praised for it) we are able to report farre better of <hi>England,</hi> that there are of the nobilitie, vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant men, vertuous, godly, studious, politicke, zealous, of auncient houses, and blood neuer stayned. There is hope the dayes shall neuer be seene vvhen the prophesie of <hi>Chaucer</hi> shall take place vvhere he sayth:</p>

When I wrote this, I was eight and fiftie yeare olde, two yeares before, this sicknesse had bene foure times in <hi>Antioche,</hi> and when as at length the fourth reuolution and compasse was past, besides my aforesaide chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren God tooke away from me a daughter and a nephewe of mine.

I haue finished an other worke, comprising relations, epistles, decrees, orations, disputations with sundrie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters. The relations for the most part are in the person of <hi>Gregorie</hi> byshop of <hi>Antioche,</hi> for the which I was preferred vnto two honorable offices. <hi>Tiberius Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> made me Quaestor, <hi>Mauricius Tiberius</hi> made me maister of the Rolles, where the noble men, and magistrates were registred.</q> The autor endeth his historie about the yeare of our Lord 595. wanting onely fiue yeares of sixe hundred.
