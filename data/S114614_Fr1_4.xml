   <p>So as, the sacred mystery of our Redeemers Crosse, which J purpose briefly to treate of in these ensuing papers, was the chiefe end of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into this worlde; the high, and hard worke of Obedience, on him, by his Eternall Father, for vs imposed; the paynefull period of his mortall pilgrimage heer amongst vs; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of his charity toward vs; the Abyssall depth of his mercy; the effusion of his bounty; and highest reach of his infinite wisedom: wherin for his owne glory, and our good, he deuised to circumuent Sathan in his owne crafte, weaken him in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and vanquish him in his malice: and that also in such a manner, as in this Combat betweene them, he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed (sayth <hi>S.
