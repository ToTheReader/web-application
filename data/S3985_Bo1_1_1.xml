      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING had iust occasion, Right Honourable, to remayne in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, during the tyme of Midsomer terme last passed, and being earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye required of diuers my friends, to set downe some briefe discourse of parcell of those thinges, which I had obserued in the reading of such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold antiquities as I had perused toward the furniture of a Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, which I had then in hande, I was at the first very loth to yeelde to their desires: first, for that I thought my selfe vnable for want of witte and iudgement, so sodainly and with such speede to take such a charge vppon me: secondly, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the dealing therin might prooue an impechement vnto mine owne Treatize: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye for that I had giuen ouer all study of hystories, as iudging the tyme spent about the same, to be an hinderaunce vnto my more necessarie dealings in that vocation &amp; function whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I am called in the mynistery. But when they were so importunate with me, that no reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excuse coulde serue to put by this trauaile, I condescended at the length vnto their yrke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some sute, promising that I woulde spende such voyde time as I had to spare, whylest I shoulde be inforced to tarie in the citie, vpon some thing or other that shoulde stande in lieu of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of my Country. For their partes also they assured me of such helpes as they coulde pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, and thus with hope of good although no gaie successe, I went in hande withall, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as one leaning altogither vnto memorie, sith my bookes and I were parted by fourtie myles in sonder. In this order also I spent a part of Michaelmas and Hillarie termes insuing, being inforced thereto I say by other businesses which compelled me to keepe in the citie, and absent my selfe from my charge, though in the meane season I had some repaire vnto my libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but not so great as the dignitie of the matter required, &amp; yet farre greater then the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haste woulde suffer. One helpe, and none of the smallest that I obtayned herein was by such commentaries as <hi>Leland</hi> had collected sometime of the state of Britaine, bookes vtterly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, defaced with wet, and weather, and finally imperfite through want of sundrie volumes secondly, I gate some knowledge of things by letters and pamphlettes, from sundrie places and shires of Englande, but so discordaunt nowe and then amongest themselues, especially in the names and courses of riuers and scituation of townes, that I had oft greater trouble to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them, then to penne the whole discourse of such pointes as they contayned▪ the thirde ayde did grow by conference with diuers, eyther at the table or secretly alone, wherein I marked in what things the talkers did agree, and wherein they impugned eche other, choosing in the end the former, and reiecting the later, as one desirous to set forth the truth absolutely, or such things in deede as were most likely to be true. The last comfort arose by mine owne reading of such writers as haue heretofore made mention of the condition of our country, in speaking whereof, yf I shoulde make account of the successe, and extraordinary comming by sundrie treatizes not supposed to be extaunt, I shoulde but seeme to pronounce more then may well be sayde with modestie, and say farder of myselfe then this Treatize can beare witnesse of. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I referre not this successe wholly vnto my purpose in this Description, but rather giue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof to come to passe in the penning of my Chronologie, whose cromes as it were fell out very well in the framing of this Pamphlete. In the processe therefore of this Booke, if your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour regarde the substaunce of that which is here declared, I must needes confesse that it is none of mine: but if your Lordshippe haue consideration of the barbarous composition shewed
<pb facs="9"/>
herein, that I may boldely clayme and chalenge for myne owne, sith there is no man of any so slender skill, that will defraude me of that reproche, which is due vnto me, for the meere negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, disorder, and euill disposition of matter, comprehended in the same. Certes I protest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and your Honour, that I neuer made any choise of stile, or picked wordes, neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded to handle this Treatize in such precise order and methode as many other woulde: thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it sufficient, truely &amp; plainly to set forth such things as I minded to intreate of, rather then with vaine affectation of eloquence to paint out a rotten sepulchre, neither cōmendable in a writer nor profitable to the reader. How other affayres troubled me in the writing hereof many know, &amp; peraduenture the slackenesse shewed herein can better testifie: but howsoeuer it be done, &amp; whatsoeuer I haue done, I haue had an especiall eye vnto the truth of things, &amp; for the reast, I hope that this foule frizeled Treatize of mine, will prooue a spurre to others, better learned in more skilfull maner to handle the selfe same argument. As for faultes escaped here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as there are diuers, I must needes confesse, both in the penning and printing, so I haue to craue pardon of your Honour, &amp; of all the learned readers. For such was my shortnesse of time allowed in the writing, &amp; so great the speede made in the Printing, that I could seldome with any deliberation peruse, or almost with any iudgement deliberate exactly vpon such notes as were to be inserted. Sometimes in deede their leysure gaue me libertie, but that I applyed in following my vocation, many times their expedition abridged my perusall, and by this later it came to passe, that most of this booke was no sooner penned then printed, neither well concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before it came to writing. But it is now to late to excuse the maner of doing. It is possible that your Honour will mistyke hereof, for that I haue not by myne owne trauaile and eyesight viewed such thinges, as I doe here intreate of. In deede I must needes confesse that except it were from the parish where I dwell, vnto your Honour in Kent, or out of London where I was borne, vnto Oxforde and Cambridge where I haue beene brought vp, I neuer trauailed 40 miles in all my lyfe, neuerthelesse in my report of these thinges, I vse their authorities, who haue performed in their persons whatsoeuer is wanting in mine. It may be in like sort that your Honour will take offence at my rashe and rechlesse behauiour vsed in the composition of this volume, and much more that being scambled vp after this maner, I dare presume to make ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doure of the protection thereof vnto your Lordships handes. But when I consider the singular affectiō that your Ho. doth beare to those that in any wise will trauaile to set forth such things as lye hidden of their countries, without regarde of fine &amp; eloquent handling, &amp; therinto do weigh on mine owne behalfe my bounden duetie and gratefull minde to such a one as hath so many and sundrie wayes profited and preferred me, that otherwise can make no recompence, I can not but cut of all such occasion of doubt, and therevpon exhibite it such as it is, and so pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as it is vnto your Lordships tuition, vnto whome if it may seeme in any wyse acceptable, I haue my whole desire. And as I am the first that (notwithstanding the great repugnauncie to be seene among our writers) hath taken vpon him so particularly to describe this Isle of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, so I hope the learned and godly will beare withall and reforme with charity where I do treade amisse. As for the curious, &amp; such as can rather euill fauouredly espy then skilfully cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect an errour, &amp; sooner carpe at another mans doings then publish any thing of their owne, keping themselues close with an obscure admiration of learning &amp; knowledge among the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort) I force not what they say hereof, for whether it doe please or dispease them, all is one to me, sith I referre my whole trauaile in the gratification of your Honour, &amp; such as are of experience to consider of my trauaile, and the large scope of things purposed in this Treatize, of whome my seruice in this behalfe may be taken in good part, that I will repute for my full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, &amp; large guerdon of my labours. The Almighty God preserue your Lordship in cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall health, wealth, and prosperitie, with my good Lady your wyfe, your Honours children, whome God hath indued with a singular towardnesse vnto all vertue &amp; learning, and the rest of reformed familie vnto whome I wish farder increase of his holy spirit, vnderstanding of his worde, augmentation of honour, &amp; finally an earnest zeale to follow his commaundements.</p>
