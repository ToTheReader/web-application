   <head>To the sacred Memory of that most abste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Gentleman, <hi>Mr.</hi> Henry Welby.</head>
   <l>OF any man at once alive, and dead,</l>
   <l>Should any make report, (as seene or read)</l>
   <l>He'd hardly find beleefe: yet they that knew</l>
   <l>This shadows substance, say this may be true,</l>
   <l>And in his person prove it; for his breath</l>
   <l>Was ballanc'd equally, 'twixt Life and Death:</l>
   <l>To Heaven he liv'd, but to this treacherous world,</l>
   <l>(Her toyes and all her honyed-poyson hurl'd</l>
   <l>Farre from his bosome) he was dead; his Face</l>
   <l>Not seene by any, in the lingring pace</l>
   <l>Of foure and forty Winters: but his hand</l>
   <l>And heart were often, in his strict command</l>
   <l>Of Almes, and bounteous Largesse; his Estate</l>
   <l>Not seene so at his Table, as his Gate.</l>
   <l>Forty foure Winters one poore petty roome,</l>
   <l>To him, was all the World, to him a Tombe.</l>
