                 <title>Tobacco tortured, or, The filthie fume of tobacco refined : shewing all sorts of subiects, that the inward taking of tobacco fumes, is very pernicious vnto their bodies; too too profluuious for many of their purses; and most pestiferous to the publike state. Exemplified apparently by most fearefull effects: more especially, from their treacherous proiects about the Gun-powder Treason; from their rebellious attempts of late, about their preposterous disparking of certaine inclosures: as also, from sundry other their prodigious practices</title>

   <l>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F handi-crafts-men haue great praise for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king well,</l>
   <l>(With toyling trade) the trifling wares which they for money sell:</l>
   <l>Then why should <hi>Deacon</hi> doubt to purchase praise of men,</l>
   <l>To whom he frankly giues the gift of this his learned pen?</l>
   <l>If he his busied brow hath beat for our auaile,</l>
   <l>And for our profit taken paines: why should his guerdon faile?</l>
   <l>No greedie golden fee, no gem, no Iewel braue;</l>
   <l>But of the Reader, good report this Writer longs to haue.</l>
   <l>No man of meanest wit, no beast of slender braine:</l>
   <l>Who thinkes that such a worke as this, was penn'd with little paine.</l>
   <l>The worke it selfe portends what toyle he vndertooke,</l>
   <l>Or er'e his curious file could frame this passing pleasant Booke.</l>
   <l>If pleasure thou possesse, or profit thereby take:</l>
   <l>He hath the depth of his desire, who penn'd it for thy sake.</l>
   <l>But, though thou feele some want of that thou wish at furst:</l>
   <l>Reade once againe with good aduice, before thou iudge the wurst.</l>
   <l>Lay loue and hate aside, affection put to flight:</l>
   <l>So shalt thou iudge as Iustice wils, so shall thy doome be right.</l>
   <l>Remember, <hi>Midas</hi> eares were framed like an Asse:</l>
   <l>Because he said that <hi>Pan</hi> in skill, <hi>Apollo</hi> farre did passe.</l>
   <l>So, if thou shalt preferre some trifle more then truth,</l>
   <l>Thou shalt deserue (as <hi>Midas</hi> did) the Asses eares with ruth.</l>
   <l>For, learned is the man that did this Treatise frame:</l>
   <l>And, learned is the wight, to whom he dedicates the same.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="12"/>And, learned is the worke, and honest eke the fact:</l>
   <l>And honest men will honestly allow each honest act.</l>
   <l>But, those that needes will storme, and wot not well wherefore,</l>
   <l>Must needs haue part of that reward which <hi>Midas</hi> reap't before.</l>
   <l>Which, if thou wilt auoid (as I would wish to shun)</l>
   <l>Do deeme with good aduised drift, this deede by <hi>Deacon</hi> done.</l>
   <l>So, I that made this verse, will thinke no worse of thee,</l>
   <l>Then <hi>Deacons</hi> worke doth well deserue, accompted of to be.</l>
   <l>But, if thou barke at Moone (like Bandog void of feares)</l>
   <l>All men may deeme thee for an Asse, by those thine Asse like eares.</l>
