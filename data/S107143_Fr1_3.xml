      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough in correcting and polishing of this Commētary, most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Queene, I haue trauelled with such diligence, that it may well be esteemed a new booke: yet because in the first edition it was dedicated to your brother King <hi>Edward,</hi> who in his infancy farre surpassed the men of his time; whose memorie also I wish euer to flourish, as worthily it deserues: I was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to alter nothing touching the inscription. But because in this miserable and wofull scattering of the Church, and the abolishing of the sincere doctrine which hath happened in so short a space, with an incredible violence; this booke, with the whole word of God, was banished England for a time: and that now as I hope it shall be receiued (as before) at your happie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into that kingdome; I haue committed no absurditie, as I thinke, if together with the name of so worthy and excellent a King, I also ioyne yours; which all good men do both loue and honour. Yea, besides this occasion which thus offers it selfe; necessitie also may seeme to require that I should intreate your fauour touching this Commentarie in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; the banishment whereof hath (I am well assured) been much lamented by very many of the faithfull, your louing subiects.</p>
   <p>Although I confesse my meaning is not so much to obtain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> your fauour onely in respect of my labours, as humblie to beseech, yea and by the sacred name of Christ to adiure you, that not onely all good bookes may againe find intertainement, and bee freely vsed in your kingdome vnder your allowance: but also that you be carefull in the first place, of that true religion which hath been shamefully corrupted. If Iesus Christ, the onely sonne of God doth iustly challenge this of all the Kings of the earth, then hath he bound you, most noble Queene, with a more holy band to put your sacred hand to such a worke. For in that time wherein your selfe, the daughter of a King, were not free from that dreadfull tempest rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe so furiouslie vpon the heads of all the faithfull; (this Lord Iesus I say) plucking you safe thereout, albeit you had your part with them in the feare of this danger; he hath obliged you to vow your selfe and all your designes to his seruice. And so farre is it off that you haue any cause to blush in respect of such a deliuerance, that contrariwise God hath therein giuen you ample and plentifull matter of reioycing, in vouchsafing thus to conforme you to the Image of his sonne; vnto whom our Prophet among other glorious ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles giues him this, namely, That out of prison, and from iudgement was he taken, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted vnto a soueraigne degree of celestiall rule and dominion. As it is not a common ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour then to resemble such a Patron: so as oft as you shall call the same to mind (which you should neuer forget) out of what perplexed and wofull feares you are escaped through
<pb facs="5"/> Gods prouidence, who hath in a visible manner as it were, reached forth his hand from heauen vnto you. Know yee, that he sets this marke before you; namely, that with a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse constancie, and an inuincible magnanimitie of mind, you should interchangeablie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue vnto your Protector and Redeemer, that right which vnto him appertaineth; and setting all other businesses aside (with which on all sides you shall be enuironed in these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of your reigne) you will (which I nothing doubt of) giue such order that his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnworthilie corrupted for a time in your countrie, may bee there reestablished in its first glory.</p>
   <p>And if Satan endeuour to terrifie, or weaken you in proposing many and great impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments; you know of whom you ought to craue courage, cheerefully to goe on, and to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all obstacles. God also for his part, who approoues of mens particular actions, will crowne in you his worke, with an happie and wished end.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, your dutie to religion, most excellent Queene, should the rather prouoke you; seeing our <hi>Isaiah</hi> requires, that Queenes should be no lesse nurcing mothers to his Church, then Kings the nurcing fathers thereof. Neither are you only bound to purge out the filth of poperie againe; and that the flocke lately affrighted and dispersed, be againe gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and fostered: but that you also call home the banished exiles, who chose rather to lose the present profits of their natiue countrie, then there to continue, whilest pietie was chased thence. Here is the summe of your thankefulnesse towards God, and a sacrifice of a most sweet sauour, namely, that the faithfull seruants of God, who were constrained to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to and fro in farre countries for the profession of the Gospell, may now returne home to their houses by your fauour.</p>
   <p>As for vs, who for good cause haue bitterly bewailed so lamentable a spectacle (we, I say) haue iust occasion giuen vs now to be glad, and to gratifie you, when by the clemencie of your eie, we presently see the way made open to our brethren, not onelie to serue God with freedome in your Maiesties dominions; but also to be a meanes whereby others may enioy the like benefit there with them.</p>
   <p>To conclude, most noble Queene, if of your fauour you accept (as I hope you will) this testimonie of the reuerence which I owe to your Greatnesse; though many may esteeme the same small and contemptible: yet shall I thinke my selfe abundantly recompenced, and will all my life endeuour by all meanes possible to manifest my thankefulnesse to your Highnesse for the same.</p>
   <p>The Lord guide and gouerne you, most noble Queene, by his Spirit of wisdome; streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then you with inuincible fortitude; defend and inrich your Highnes with all sorts of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings. From Geneua, the yeere <hi>1559.</hi> Ianuarie the <hi>15.</hi> which, as they say, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the day of your Coronation; for which cause I did the more willingly set pen to paper, hauing obtained some release from a quartan Ague.</p>
