      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader whosoever thou art, into whose hands this Treatise may come; I advise thee that howsoever this diamond of thy felicity come thus rudely (yet clearly and truely) presented unto thee, thou make such good use of this and the like, that thou mayest happily in the end enjoy the glory it selfe. Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hereon thou wilt easily see how degenerate thou art from thy owne Originall dignity, if by the contagion of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented sinne, thou deprive thy selfe of that gemme which God hath prepared for thee, and all those that feare him, and love his comming. Had the naturall Sages of the world knowne this end of man, whereas some of them, as the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians called him a little world, an Earthly God: Others, as the Egiptians and their Trismegistus, the miracle of the world, they would in respect of the glory expected and to be revealed, have termed him the miracle of heaven, a glorious companion by grace, of majesty it selfe, thus entring into, and diving into, the Lords owne Ioy it selfe. But whence hath man this, but from the free grace of the Father? By whom hath hee this, but by the humble obedience of the Sonne to the Father? By what, all this? but by obedient faith in the Saviour; The first is the fountaine; the second, is the way and meane of this glory: the third is the condition without which, this glory is not obtained. O then having found this most precious diamond, and from whom it is; God the Father: By whom it is; Christ Iesus the Sonne: for whom it is: the faithfull and loving beleevers. Presse thou on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the marke, for the price of this high calling of God in Christ Iesus, the glorious vision and fruition of God himselfe.</p>
