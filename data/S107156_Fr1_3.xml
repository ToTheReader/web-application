   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONG all Writers, things written, or to be written whatsoeuer, none haue bene, or can be in any time, or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, or by any person more vsefull, or necessary then such, as haue truely written, bene or shall be written of the true office and dutie of all men, of all Estates and conditions to God, and his hig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> dutie. This is the end of all good Lawes and Lawemakers. Histories, and Historians, diuine, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, to giue and leaue direction both in present, and to Posteritie to all men, how to liue in dutie to heauēly and terrene Authoritie. And to take the worde Historie, Historia, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, in the most true and proper sence, meanind and ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>spectare vel cognoscere, to beholde or knowe</hi> what they write. The holy Prophets, Apostles, Euangelists, and other holy Writers of holy Scriptures, beholding and most certainely knowing of God, by diuine reuelation what they committed to writing, are most properly and truely the best Historians, and their Writings most properly best and truest Histories: and next to them the true Narration or History of their Traditions, and holy doctrine and teachings which were most true and certaine, taken from the most auncient and approued Antiquities, Antiquaries and Registers ef those things where they were performed, And in times and places of Controuersies, Contentions &amp; Questions about Religion, noe History, Narration, or Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as History signifieth of Ecclesiasticall affaires, can be more requisite, or necessary to knowe, and truely finde true Religion, to receaue and professe it.</p>
   <p>Wherefore seeing all true Christians confesse, and agree, that this holy Lawe, Religion, Religation, and Dutie was truely taught by Christ, and his holy Apostles, and Disciples, and, as in many other Kingdomes, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, so in this Noble Kingdome of greate Britaine, by his greatest Apostles, and Disciples, S. Peter, S. Paule, S. Ioseph of Aramathia that buried Christ, and others then, and after most holy and learned true Apostolike men: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more common, and frequent in the mouthes, and penns of the learned then that the Britans receauing this most true and holy Religion, neuer left, lost, changed or altered it, not when they left, or lost the greatest part of their Country in the six hundred yeares of Christ, nor long after; And all Writers agree, that neuer any Heresie except the Pelagian, of which it was happily freed by our renowned Apostles and Prelats S. German, S. Lupus, S. Seuerus and S. Dauid, tooke roote in Britaine for a longe time after.</p>
   <p>By which we are assured by all accompts, that the Church of Britaine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed many glorious Apostles, Apostolike Saints and others, teaching, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and professing with the Church and Christians here the most holy and vndoubted true Religion of Christ in all Articles, both now questioned and others, as all our Rulers spirituall and temporall, Kings and Subiects, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
<pb facs="4"/> and Saxons did, thereby giuing and duely to this renowned, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Iland, the name and Title of the most Noble and Holy first Christian Kingdome in the world. To renewe and illustre whose honor and glory, therein (lately too much by some obscured) and shew the way of truth to all that be now wandring in error, and want direction, to know the holy true Religion of those happy times in this Nation, that if they will not be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully erring and ignorant, they may easely and plainely knowe it, and secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrace and professe it, as their holy, and Religious Auncestors and Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors did. This dutie hath cheefly called vpon me to write this Ecclesiasticall History, of our Noble Britaine, deducing it from the Natiuitie of our blessed Sauiour Christ Iesus vntill the happy, full Conuersion of our Auncestors the Saxons in the seuenth hundered yeare, after which time our Ecclesiasticall Histories are plaine and perfect, not needing helpes, or Additions.</p>
   <p>And this which I haue taken in hand, especially the first 600. yeares, are the most difficulte Worke Britaine had to be performed in this kynde, most or many of the Antiquities and Monuments of those times by many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of enemies to those holy dayes, parsons, and proceedings, destroyed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, concealed, suppressed, defaced, or abused, and those that from many difficulties, and dangers be still preserued, are not without greate fauour, labour, diligence and cost to poore Students, especially Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks to be obtained. Yet I a poore Catholike Student in holy learning from my young yeares, vnto my now old Age, may boldly confesse, which this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story itselfe will proue, that I haue seene, &amp; diligently perused the most &amp; best Monuments, and Antiquities extant, or their true Copies, which I could learne of, know and procure, requisite and vsefull for such a Worke, and therefore at the entreaty and desire of diuers my learned friends, hauing better opinion of my studies and reading, then I dare affirme of my selfe, haue taken this greate charge in hand, and wholly performed and ended it, written in our English tongue, because principally of England, and to English men.</p>
