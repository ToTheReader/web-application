   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>YOu know (good Reader) if a man have a pretious
Iewel, hee will bee exceeding carefull to keep it from
any tash. True religion is more pretious then the most
pretious jewel, it should be the breath of our nosthrils, and the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oy of our hearts. Wee finde that in all ages the preservation
of religion in puritie hath beene dearer to the godly then their
very lives. As the preservation of religion in puritie hath been
maintained, so hath the restauration to puritie beene purchased
with the bloud of Martyres, and grievous troubles of many
confessors. The reformation of the Church within this realm
was not obtained without the martyrdome of some, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of the lives and estates of many other of our worthie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours.
The temple was throughly built, and the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
brought foorth, with the acclamation of other reformed
Churches, (the Church of England, which as <hi>Bucerus</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in histime, standeth in the midst betwixt the Romane and
reformed, only excepted) crying <hi>Grace grace</hi> unto it. No
where was the doctrine sounder, the divine worship purer,
the government fitter for the building of Gods house. But of
late yeares the doctrine is leavened with Arminianisme and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie,
the worship of God defiled with superstition and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
the joint government of Pastors in presbyteries, synodall
and generall assemblies, with subordination of presbyteries to
synods, and synods to generall assemblies, is changed into ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall
oligarchie: So that it may bee observed in our times to
bee true, which was noted by <hi>Aventinus,</hi> to have beene done
among the Popes in his time, that the same deedes are at one
time branded with the mark of superstition; and at another
time set out with the glorious title of pietie, at one time attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to <hi>Antichrist,</hi> at another time to Christ: at one time judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
tyrannicall and unjust, at another time just and righteous.
That which before we rejected as superstitious or idolatrous,
is now called truely religious: that which before was called
Antichristian and tyrannicall, is receaved now as ancient, and
Apostolicall.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
Is it not lamentable to see that government which maintained
the kingdome of Antichrist in former times, and with much
paines thrown foorth, to bee reestablished. Some idle mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
deserting their owne particular flocks, have taken upon
them to bee diocesan pastors, the principall and only pastors of
all the congregations within an whole diocie, to plant and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
Ministers without consent of presbyteries, to stay their
proceedings against hainous offenders, to sit as Princes amongst
priests at their diocesan synods, to suspend and deprive Ministers
by the power of the high Commission, without the consent of
any lawfull, let bee pretended assemblie of the Church, to fine,
confine, imprison Ministers, or other professours, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the estates, to sit in the Checker, Counsell, Session, and
to bear offices of estate, to vote in Parliament in name of the
Church, without consent of the Church, many of the Ministrie
repyning, and none consenting, but upon conditions and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which are not regarded, to send Commissioners to Court,
as directed from the Clergie or Church, who return with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
in favours of Papists, or for advancement of their estate:
is not the office of Deane, and election of bishops by deane
and chapter, rejected as Popish by our generall assemblies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
again, without consent of the Church, or so much as a
pretended assemblie? Are not the best qualified exspectants
debarred from entrie to the Ministrie, unlesse they subscrive
such articles as the pretended bishops have devised, and others
obtruded upon congregations to their great grief. Ministers
are troubled by them with the acts of pretended assemblies,
whereas themselves transgresse the acts of many laudable assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie.
Ministers are become dissolute, and erroneus doctrine is
taught without controlement. We have cause to fear ere it be
long, that sound and faithfull Ministers shall become as rare as
wedges of gold.</p>
   <p>Consider further, that soone after the government was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
idolatrous, superstitious, and ridiculous ceremonies were
introduced into the worship of GOD with the five famous arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
of which we are now to treat. Moe are intended in the


<pb facs="3"/>
cannos lately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>blished, and yet moe expected with the liturgle
not yet printed: neither can wee look for an end, till the whole
worship of God be defiled. And yet these ceremonies are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commended as ancient, or slighted as matters indifferent.</p>
   <p>It is called in question, if not altogether denyed, whether
the Pope bee the great Antichrist or not: the possibilitie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with Rome is maintained, and to this end errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
points of doctrine delivered in publick, or defended in
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ivate, or our differences from the Romish church slighted
as not fundamentall. Bookes of this kinde are printed
with priviledge in our neighbour church, and in private
commended by such amongst us, as apprehend the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of this course to bee the easiest way to preferment.
Doctor <hi>Francis White</hi> in his treatise of the Sabbath ranketh
among the traditions of the church, the baptisme of infants, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
observation of the Lords day, the administration of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme,
and the Lords supper in publick assemblies and congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
the deliverie of the elements of the holy communion
in both kindes, the service of the church in a known language.
The Reader may finde more of this stuffe in <hi>Coz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ns</hi> devotions,
in <hi>Montagues Gagg</hi> and <hi>Appeal,</hi> and in <hi>Shelfords</hi> sermons. Have
wee not need to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ar the burning of our owne house, when our
neighbours house is in fire? Have wee not greater cause to
fear and bestirre our selves, when the fire hath seased upon the
thack of our own house, and poysonable errours are vented
amongst our selves,</p>
   <p>Do wee then complain without iust cause, or for matters of
no importance? The reconcilers cry <hi>peace, peace,</hi> but mean to
peace, till wee bee at peace with Rome. The Prelates charge
us with shisme and sedition, but they mean to peace without
peaceable possession of their places, and obedience to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.
They call us shismaticks, and yet cannot endure gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
assemblies, the ordinarie remedie of division and shismes,
as was acknowledged by the Kings Commissioners, and such as
were acquainted with his Maiesties minde at Linlithgow, <hi>anno</hi>
1606. To what end was it enacted with their owne consent at


<pb facs="4"/>
Glasgow, 1610. that those who were called bishops, should be
lyable to the triall and censure of the generall assemblie, for
their office and benefice, life and conversation, if we have not
yearly or set generall assemblies, to try them, or censure us, if
we shall be found guiltie of shisme. Grievances presented by
Ministers to parliam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nts, which should be the chief sanctuaries
of refuge to all distressed subiects, are suppressed, and not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to be read in publick before the Estates: yea lawes are
made in parliament concerning matters Ecclesiasticall, without
the knowledge or consent of the generall assemblie, and acts
of pretended assemblies are ratified, sometime made worse with
omissions, additions, alterations. We want our assemblies
to direct commissioners with articles, grievances, and petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to parliaments, conventions, court and counsell, and to
treat of all the affaires of the Church: what wonder is it then
that all be out of frame?</p>
   <p>But wee are still charged with frowardnesse, that wee ever
except against assemblies when wee have them. So did the
Ubiquitars the Theologues in the Palatinat, <hi>Synodum appellatis,</hi>
said they, <hi>&amp; synodum detrectatis.</hi> The Theologues answered
in their admonition, <hi>Hinc istae lachrymae, quod synodum ejusmodi
vellent, qualem principibus praescripscrunt, in qui ipsi fuissent accusato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
ipsi judices, ipsi saltarent, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>c spectarent suam fabulam, &amp; ipsi sibi
plausum d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ent.</hi> So do wee answere to our Prelats, if they will
suffer no assemblies, but such as they themselves overrule at
pleasure, they can not pretend desire of peace. Wee call for
no other assemblies then such as shall bee constitute according
to the order agreed upon with his Majesties owne consent, in
the generall assembly holden, <hi>anno</hi> 1598, such as shall have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
to conveen yearly, or at set times, and to treat of all
affaires belonging to the Church, such as shall have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in their proceedings. It were dangerous to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
every meeting, which claimeth to it self the name and
authoritie of a generall assemblie.</p>
   <p>Can wee acknowledge that convention at Perth, <hi>anno</hi> 1618.
for one of our lawfull generall assemblies? The pretended pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

contrare to the cautions agreed upon at <hi>Montross, anno</hi> 1600,
and at <hi>Linlithgow, anno</hi> 1606. These who were entituled bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;
wanting commission from presbyteries, where they should
make residence, had place to vote contrare to the cautions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon at <hi>Montrose,</hi> and notwithstanding they had put in
practice before kneeling, and observation of festivall dayes. Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
ministers then three out of a presbyterie were admitted, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
drawn to that meeting to give their voice. Some modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of presbyteries being the bishops substituts, were admitted
without commission. No Baron ought to vote according to
the act made at <hi>Dundie, anno</hi> 1598, but one out of the bounds of
a presbyterie having commission. But a number were present at
this assemblie, being only required by his Majesties missives'
and their voices were numbred with the rest Some minister<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
were the Kings pensioners, or looked for augmentation of sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
or were threatned in privat by their diocesan bishop with
deposition, or were circumveened with promises, that they
should not be urged with practice. Necessitie of yeelding was
urged, under no lesse danger then of the wrath of authoritie,
and utter subversion of the order and state of our Church.
Such as had courage to oppose, were checked, interrupted,
threatned: yea, it was plainly professed, that neither reasoning
nor voting should carie the matter: All the five articles were
put to once voting, with this certificat, Hee that denied one
should be reputed to have denied all. Much more might bee
said to this purpose, but these few particulars are sufficient to
justifie our exceptions against that assembly, as null in it self.</p>
   <p>Because many are desirous of information concerning these
five articles enacted at this assembly, and treatises formerl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

   <p>I beseech you (good Reader) read and ponder without a

and submit your iudgement to the light of the truth.
For that is the way to apostasie to seek for shifts and fig-tree
leafes, when the truth is born in upon us. What hath made so

Men glorie now to dispute like <hi>Scepticks</hi> upon the very
articles of our faith, so that they are like to lose the sense of all
religion. The detaining of the truth of God in unrighteousnesse
bringeth men at last to a reprobat sense. Pitie the case of our

Wishart,</hi> which he uttered a little before his martyrdome, <hi>God

with the light of the gospel, als dearly as ever was any realme sines

it shall not lack, whatsoever the enemie imagine in the contrare, the

Neither</hi> (said hee) <hi>shall the time bee long, till that the glory
