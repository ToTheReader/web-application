      </hi> Doe offer and present vnto thee (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) heere published in Print, this little Treatise, first written by that famous and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned Doctor in CHRISTS Schoole <hi>Martin Luther,</hi>

      </gap>ite and commoditie of this our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>srael,
<pb facs="3"/> by one most studiously care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and zealously desirous of thy profite. This excellent Preface will leade thee as a Lanterne of light to the better vnderstanding of that most precious,<note place="margin">The vse of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</note> most fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and profitable Epistle of S. Paul to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which when thou canst well and wisely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, first it will make thee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy armed, well furnished and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed to withstand &amp; answear all the popish Romanists (GODS greatest adversaries, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to his Gospell) who stoutlie maintaine and defend that mans workes doe merite and deserue salvation, and so present vs just and righteous before GOD: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly it will teach thee a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian life &amp; conversation: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how thou oughtest to bring forth the worthie fruits of Faith
<pb facs="3"/> which alone doth justifie vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, because it is (as it were) the hand whereby wee apprehend and take hold fast of the merits of Christs blessed Passion to be ours Other branches of doctrine and manners there be in that notable Epistle good store. Ʋse and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vse this prologue, and then it will lighten thy vnderstanding verie much in this weighty matter of our salvation, in this chiefe and principall poynt of Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: to wit, whether wee bee justified by the works of the Law, or by the mercie of God only, for the mediation of his Sonne, who was made a slaine sacrifice vpon the Crosse for vs most wretched and miserable sinners. After that thou doest fully and perfitlie attaine to the true meaning of it, I doubt not but thou wilt (by the
<pb facs="4"/> helpe of Gods holy Spirit working mightily in thee) persevere and continue faithfull vnto the ende in this doctrine of faith taught heereby the Apostle.<note place="margin">Tim 1.19</note> Onely bee strong in the LORD, fight a gud fight, keeping faith and a good conscience: then surelie this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doctrine will prepare thy heart in a strong defence, that the fiery darts of the Divels Ministers by errours and falshood shall not wounde thee. Wherefore (gentle Reader) vse this Introduction to thy comfort &amp; commoditie: Read and regard it, and giue God the glorie, who bee praised for ever and ever. Amen. Farewell in the Lord, and pray for me, as I daylie doe for thee.</p>

      <hi>Ephes. 2. v. 8. &amp; 9. By grace are yee saved through faith, and that not of your selves. For it is the gift of God, &amp; commeth not of workes: least any man should boast himselfe.</hi>
