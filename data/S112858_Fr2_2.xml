MAISTER FRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIS
YOVNG OF BRENT PEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
in the Countie of Hertford Esquire, and to
Mistresse Susan Young, his Wife, and my
kinde Mistresse, he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>lth, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
intirely wished.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LPHONSVS</hi> king of <hi>Naples,</hi> (Right
Worshipfull) a King renowmed in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
volumes of Antiquitie, for his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Bountie, and Affablilitie of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
lying very sore sicke in the Citie of
<hi>Capua,</hi> hauing tryed the very vttermost
cunning his Physitions could vse on him, yet all would
not helpe to recouer his health, determined with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to take no more Medicines: but for his recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
caused the Storie of <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> (concerning the
deedes of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great) to be read before him,
at the hearing whereof hee conceyued such woonderfull
pleasure, as Nature gathered strength by it, and chased
away the frowardnes of his disease.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Wherevpon in some sorte, hauing soone recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his health, hee discharged his Physitians, with
these wordes:</hi> Feast mee no more with <hi>Galene,</hi> and <hi>Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi>
sith all their skill would not serue to asswage my
<pb facs="223"/>
sickenesse: but well fare <hi>Quintius Curtius</hi> that holpe mee so
soone to my health.</p>
   <p>By this example may be gathered (right worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
how necessary it is (oftentimes) to reade Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which in the iudgement of the wise are esteemed as
healthfull to the mind, as Phisick is accounted holesome
for the body: yea, oftentimes more, for that the sodaine
inward conceit of delight (wherewith Histories are plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
enriched) may sooner breake and qualifie the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity
of a painfull disease, then the long and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
applying of Physicall receipts. Yet, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the one, nor extoll the other more then it deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
I allow of both very well: but I must needs thus
confesse with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that History is the Schoolemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
of Princes, and the onely Trumpet that soundeth
in the eares of all noble personages, the famous deeds of
their worthy progenitors.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Plato</hi> likewise affirmeth, that the name of History was
giuen to this end, that by recording matters of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
our fleeting memories might be stayed, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
would soone be lost and retaine little.</p>
   <p>Seeing then (right worshipfull) that Histories carry
such credite among the learned sort, and haue not bene
a little esteemed of both Emperours, kings, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Potentates? as a testimony of my vnfained affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and dutie to your worshippe: I offer you the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of this excellent and famous Historie, which
how bad the rude translation thereof may seeme to
the daintie eares, I know: but how singular it is of it
selfe, no better description then the reading ouer can
be made.</p>
   <p>I presume therefore, maister <hi>Young,</hi> as the Romanes
did, who were woont to place the pictures of their
<pb facs="223"/>
most especial friends, at the very entrance into their state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Pallaces, therby to declare their zealous and vnspotted
affection to him. In like maner haue I stampt your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
name in the face of this historie, as well to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the Book with such a worshipfull personage, as to
credit my selfe with your woonted and fauourable good
liking: for I account my selfe, and my labours free from
the reproach of wounding tongues, being allowed but
the least moitie of your gentle iudgement. It shall bee
needlesse for me to wade into tedious circumstances,
when to the wise and learned a word is sufficient: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Palmerin</hi> reposeth himselfe on your kinde conceite,
and wisheth such happy continuance to you, your wife
my gentle Mistresse, and whole issue, as the world being
partaker of your vertues, my selfe acquainted with your
fauourable opinion, and my Booke defended by your
worthy selfe, you may remaine, as in yeeres, so in happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
and the longer your course, the larger your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
