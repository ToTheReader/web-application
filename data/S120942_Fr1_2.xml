      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS may seeme a small worke (good Reader) for so great a scādall as hath beene giuen by the Authour, but it is an abridgement only of another more large, &amp; ample, that is to ensue; and yet in this, thou mayst perceiue how men may so farre be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by vnbridled passions, as to fall into open schisme, &amp; heresy: on the other side thou mayst see also, the force and efficacy of Gods grace in recalling of sinners by true repētance to his loue, and fauour. Let the one of these ballance the other, and let the latter cancell the fault of his committed errour. <note place="margin">1 Cōsilium Profectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis. 2. Cōsilium Reditus.</note> That was wicked, pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and detestable; this is vertuous, exemplar, and laudable. The latter counsayle is alwayes wont to be more ponderous, graue, and iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then the former; especially when as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former is recalled by the latter.</p>
   <p>His reuolt you will say was scandalous. True. But now —</p>

      <hi>Vna eadē{que} manus vuln{us} opē{que} tulit.</hi> He hath in part made amēds for his former fault by his submissiue confession: and this <hi>learned Prelate</hi> (as an vnlearned Mynister stiled him) <note place="margin">Hall in his honour of the mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed clergy. pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>that had honoured the English Church with a Dalmatian Pall, that had passed ouer the Alpes to leaue Rome, that was so potent a Protestant as none of al our
<pb n="4" facs="4"/> Bandogges durst fasten vpon him,</hi> hath now withdrawn both Pall &amp; Honour from that Church, hath left <hi>Englād,</hi> is returned ouer the Alpes to <hi>Rome</hi> againe, &amp; like a bandog indeed hath fastened himselfe on the English wolues, &amp; bites so hard as he makes them bleed; &amp; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes all Protestants to see their weaknes (if yet they haue eyes to see) &amp; <note place="margin">Hall ibid. in the ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to the aduertis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that the whole <hi>Region of Deuines and those so incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, that may set Rome to schoole,</hi> could not defend themselues from open Schisme and Heresy; nor perswade one man, &amp; he such a one as offered himselfe freely into their hands, to remaine &amp; continue amongst them. <hi>Magna est veritas, &amp; praeualet.</hi>

   <p>Thou mayst further see, with what care and sincerity our Aduersaries write agaynst vs, how they examine the matters they handle, how little truth &amp; learning, &amp; how much, lies, detractiōs, forgeries, &amp; passionate fancies are regarded. By these base means, &amp; shameful shifts must heresy be mantained, Catholiks impugned, &amp; iniured, all vertue depressed, &amp; troden vnder foote. Let the example of one be a warning vnto all, &amp; let the Retreate of this seduced Bishop make men looke on what ground they stand, &amp; not hazard their saluation, bought with the ransome of our Sauiours bloud, vpon the false, Heretical, and Schismaticall opinions of these times.</p>
