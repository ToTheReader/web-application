   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>onsidering, indifferēt Reader, how sinister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some of ignorance, and others of malice, conceaue of the state &amp; dignity of the High and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> &amp;c. of his Coūtry, of his receauing his most honored La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die the Princesse <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and entertainement of my Lords the Commissioners, and accordingly
<pb n="54" facs="29"/>make report thereof; as also how desirous others are to be rightly informed of the truth: I could not, in my dutie, knowing the place, and hauing certaine aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements thence from honorable personages, and others of great worth &amp; credit, but add this short &amp; plaine yet true narration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as well for the easier stopping of intemperate mouthes, as for the better satisfying of all honest mindes that bee desirous of the truth.</p>
   <p>First, therefore concerning the Prince Elector Palatines originall and state, though those many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degrees published here already of his Highnesse discent, sufficiently shew his ancient and high blood, rising from many great Emperors and Kings, yet giue mee leaue to fetch it from the very beginning.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="55" facs="29"/>The <hi>Palatinate</hi> and <hi>Bauaria,</hi> were once a kingdome, yet subiect (as other States) vnto alteration and change.<note place="margin">Chron Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian. lib. 4. Chronolog. Func.</note> The Kingdome conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from <hi>Adelgerius</hi> the first King, vntill <hi>Tassilo</hi> the last, all in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall discent 332. yeeres, from the yeere of Christ his incarnation 556. vntill the yeere 788. This <hi>Tassilo</hi> the last King, for that he would neither be subiect, nor friend vnto <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> was at length after much warre subdued by him, taken prisoner, and both he and his sonne <hi>Dedon</hi> depriued of their Kingdome, and kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners in the Monasterie of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceack</hi> neere vnto <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> where they both ended their daies in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie.</p>
   <p>After this, the posterity of <hi>Charles</hi> the great held those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, vntill the seuenteenth yeere
<pb n="58" facs="30"/>full, or meane, as is by some sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. It is in length about 200. english miles the lower and vpper Countrey. In the lower the Prince hath 26. walled Townes, besides an infinite number of good and faire Villages, 22. houses; and the land is very fruitfull of wine, corne, and other comfortable fruites for mans vse, hauing the Rheine &amp; Neckar running throgh it. The vpper Countrey hath not so many walled townes and princely houses, but those that are, be generally fairer then in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, especially <hi>Amberg</hi> and <hi>New-market.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For her Highnesse receauing: After that she had passed the low Countries, the Dukedomes of <hi>Gulick, Cleue,</hi> and <hi>Mont,</hi> the <hi>Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes of Collen,</hi> and <hi>Trier,</hi> with a part of the <hi>Landgraue</hi> of <hi>Hessens</hi>
      <pb n="59" facs="30"/>countrey; in all which places she had so great welcome, entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and honorable presents, as truely expressed the loue and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of the people, the affection of friends, and greatnes of those Princes through whose territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries shee passed. Shee came at last happily to <hi>Cowlsome,</hi> where the <hi>Prince Elector Palatine</hi> met her highnesse post, with a few horse, and went together to <hi>Gauelshemi,</hi> another very smale village of his, the 1. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1613. inconuenient for the prouiding for, and lodging and prouisions for such a traine, which was occasioned by reason <hi>Coub, Bachrahe,</hi> and all other good townes of his thereabouts were infected.</p>
   <p>Here the <hi>Prince Elector</hi> and <hi>Princesse</hi> earnestly inuited my Lords the commissioners, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="60" facs="31"/>his Maiesties officers, who had attended in the voiage to goe along with them vnto <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> whereby they might not only haue a better view of some part of the countrey, but also finde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement to their more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. The commissioners condis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vnto so gracious a ioint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and the rather to see her highnesse well arriue at her owne home: But the other officers could not by any intreaty be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to goe further, desirous (perhaps) to make speedy report vnto their Maiesties and the state, of her Highnesses safe arriuall in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and soe re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ued the next day for <hi>England.</hi> And this is the cause they saw not any memorable thing worthy of praise in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> as my Lordes the commissioners did, and will not
<pb n="61" facs="31"/>forbeare to speake honorably thereof, thogh some haue done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; for answering of whom and satisfying of others, I haue thought good to touch this much by the way, and noe more I am informed of.</p>
   <p>Thence they rid the next day the 2. of <hi>Iune</hi> vnto the City of <hi>Mentz,</hi> whither the Archbishoppe, and <hi>Prince Elector</hi> thereof, Chancelor of <hi>Germany</hi> had inuited their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, where they stayed two nights, and were of him roially entertained, with great and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous feasting, &amp; sundry excellent Fireworkes, the better to expresse their welcome, and passe out the time in princely manner.</p>
   <p>The 4. of <hi>Iune</hi> they rodd to <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penheim</hi> an ancient City with a Castle therein of the Prince Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and there lodged all night.</p>

   <p>which the Troianes drew into the Citie: in the night the Alarum was giuen, <hi>Troy</hi> fired, and the Greekes in triumph, marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Conquerours.</p>
   <p>The next day the 7. of <hi>Iune</hi> the Princesse remoued towardes <hi>Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delberg,</hi> after shee had Passed the walled town of <hi>Ladeberg,</hi> was met 3. miles from <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> with the <hi>Prince Elector,</hi> accompanied with 12. other Princes, the rich coach, 30. Earles, one thousand gentlemen, of the countrey richly attired, and brauely set out with gallant horse, armour, and other habiliaments of war. The horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men attending the Princes, were besides these two thousand more. So that all the horse were three thousand, and all great horse. The Princes alighted, and welcomed her Highnesse, who ascended into
<pb n="65" facs="32"/>her rich coach. After a while shee was again encountered in three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall places, with three regiments of foot, 2000. in regimēt, who first welcomed their Princesse with vollies of smal shot, &amp; had after the thunder seconded with 20 peeces of great ordnāce. Then they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched altogether orderly in good aray, conducting her to <hi>Heidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> where the Citizens wanted no expressions of ioy, loue, and duty in hearty welcoming of her, &amp; praying for her; all windows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing replenished with people of all ages and degrees, and the streetes thronged with multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, drawne thither from all parts, not so much to see the Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants that were erected to further this honorable entertainement, as to haue their eies filled in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of her Highnesse, whom

      <pb n="66" facs="34"/>all honoured and admired. And thus hauing passed in magnificent great state through the Citie, shee was in like pompe conueied into the Castle, where the Prince Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors mother, with many other great Princesses, Ladies, &amp; Gentle women receiued her with all fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting honor, due to so great a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</p>
   <p>The morning of the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, being the 8. of <hi>Iune,</hi> was dedicated vnto God, with singing of Psalmes, prayer, thankesgiuing, and this annexed Sermon, as was meere for so great mercies recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from God. The next daies, the 9. 10. and 11. were appointed for Tilting, Tourney, and running at the Ring; the nights for fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes and dancings; two nights, after the Germane manner, the other times according to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb n="67" facs="34"/>and French custome. Where let mee not omit to shew, that my Lords the Commissioners, and all the Princes were lodged within the Castle, in lodgings well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated, and richly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with bedding, hangings, and all other necessaries.</p>
   <p>The Princesse and other great Ladies, with the Commissioners, being fitly placed at the Tilt-yard in the Princes garden: The first that entered the Tilt-yard the, 9. day, was the Prince Elector him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, accompanied with other Princes of the Empyre, gallently mounted, but were interrupted for that time from their matiall sports by night: But the next day being the 10. recompenced the same, for there came before the Prince Elector in a very stately manner, this shew, which gaue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="68" facs="35"/>content vnto her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and all other great persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the beholders.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Iupiter</hi> came first, sitting in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich Chariot, drawne by two Griffins, guarded by <hi>Mercury,</hi> who was coachman <hi>Iuno</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed next in another Chariot, drawne by Peacockes, and driuen by <hi>Iris.</hi> The God of Husbandry followed close with 3. Ploughes. And after him <hi>Neptune</hi> the God of the sea entred; in a Chariot wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>befitting such a <hi>Marine God,</hi> drawne by 3. <hi>Sea-horses. Neptune</hi> had to attend him a <hi>Merman,</hi> who sate behind him on a rocke with a looking glasse in his hand, and 3. Mermaides on an other Rocke, singing and playing on musicall Instruments.</p>
   <p>The next presentation that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, was a Centaure, (halfe a
<pb n="69" facs="35"/>man, halfe a horse) holding a Booke in the one hand, and a Mace in the other; <hi>Arion</hi> followed him riding on a <hi>Sea-Vnicorne,</hi> and playing on a Lute. After whome followed the seauen dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinnes, all chained, and driuen forward by a Dragon, which did euer spit fire. Immediatly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prince Elector, with two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in a ship: himselfe resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <hi>Iason;</hi> attended on by six Squires, bearing shields and laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The golden Fleece which <hi>Iason</hi> brought from <hi>Greece,</hi> was to be seene in the Ship: at the sterne whereof was Enuy dragged, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her owne heart.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Mars</hi> followed in a chariot gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with all warlike Ensignes, hauing three Knights &amp; six Squires for his attendants, bearing laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Then came <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupid,</hi>
      <pb n="70" facs="36"/>drawne by Swannes in a chariot, six virgines going before, <hi>Hercules</hi> following after, and three Knights following him, the Sunne artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gazing on the chariot.</p>
   <p>Next hereunto was Victorie mounted on high in an Imperiall Chariot (signifying Soueraigntie) on whose top aboue there stood a displayed Eagle: on which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise attended three Knights, and six Squires.</p>
   <p>In the last Chariot of Forrest-worke, garnished with liuing birds and beasts, was <hi>Diana,</hi> attended by six Satyres, playing wildly on mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke: six other Satyres leaping and dauncing Antick-like: twelue Satyres more leading Dogges and Deere: the Wood-men followed: then came the Nymphes with bowes and arrowes: and last, the chariot of other Nymphes play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

   <p>Thus this dayes sports, and the night, being passed with much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and they come the next day againe (une the eleuenth) into the Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>-yard, the Prince Elector, with those other two that sate with him before in the Ship (himselfe still representing <hi>Iason</hi>) attended vpon by six Squires, eight Trumpeters, seuen footmen, and seuen horses of State, lead single: Two others followed him, resembling <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> who were accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with three Wild-men, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on strange musicke; Satyres rustically dancing, three Nymphs on horsebacke, crowned with gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands. Next came <hi>Musoeus, Orhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> with musicke, on horsebacke: <hi>Mydas</hi> followed with
<pb n="72" facs="37"/>Asses eares, riding on an Asse, for compating <hi>Pan</hi> to <hi>Apollo;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him miserable <hi>Marsyas,</hi> and a Satyre fleaing off his skinne, for daring to contest with skilfull <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> in musicke. A prettie space after followed the nine Muses, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted seuerally vpon Parnassus hill, and playing sweetly vpon diuers instruments of Musicke: then came the three Graces with <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> accompanying them: and <hi>Silenus, Bacchus</hi> his steward, with a too and a glasse, which as fast as hee could fill with wine, hee presently dranke off: which representation was finished with <hi>Bacchus</hi> himselfe, drawne by Dogges in a Chariot, and waited on by <hi>Iunius, Pamona, Hymenaeus, Zephinus, Flora,</hi> and <hi>Vertumnus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The last representation was a man wearing an Imperiall Crown,

Next came three clothed like Turkes, attended vpon by sixe Squiers carrying Lances. And last of alone cameriding in, armed at all points, followed with three persons, leading barbed horses single, which sights being passed they tilted. And so the 11. dayes Glory and Triumph ended with exceeding great State, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and noble performance of all Courtly Ceremonies, and feats. of Armes.</p>
   <p>The next day after, being the 12. of <hi>Iune,</hi> the better to recreate their mindes with taking of the aire abroade, and vsing other sports, the Princesse Electoresse, greatly attended, rid on hunting:
