The Masse, the Masse (I saie) yea, the holie blessed masse laie so extreemely sicke, that men began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie to sing a <hi>Requiem</hi> ouer her, the holie Saintes, did not get anie more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall offrings, more sensinges, nor more pilgrimages.

No man would geue any thing for pardons, nor for the Popes bulles: Yea, the hole staple of pardons, especially pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, beganne to waxe coulde. The Pope himselfe was esteemed for an how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieglasse: The Decrees, and Decretals, the Sophisticall gloses, the sentences, the Quotlibets, and suche like toyes of the schollers and doctours of Louen, were cast behinde the benche: Satisfaction, and ful recompence were no more made anie accounte of: Auriculer confession was almost murdered: Shroue tuesday, and Iacke a lent had almost broken their neckes: all the holie and goodlie Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

In conclusion, all the holinesse, of the Catholike Church of Rome beganne to fall in the ashes: and in place thereof you should heare nothing else, neither in the townes nor without, yea, nothing was read but the Byble, or Saint Paule.

<pb facs="11"/>
seruice bookes, the Gospel, &amp; holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, onelie should succeed, &amp; take posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Therefore your Honour is highly to be praised for such noble actes: And eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man is duely bound herein, to assist &amp; further you in your enterprise, to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of his knowledge &amp; abilitie.</p>
   <p>This (Right Honorable and blessed Bishop) is the cause, which hath moued me poore &amp; vnworthie brother of Saint <hi>Frauncis</hi> order, to dedicate and sende this my simple present to your honour, to the ende that I (with this my small gifte of good will) may somewhat (though but a little) helpe to strengthen &amp; repaire the decaied walles of the Romishe Church, and establish againe the right &amp; perfect foundation of our most holie father, the Pope. Therefore hauing a while agoe: seene &amp; marked that in the Citie of <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe</hi> was a small booke sette foorth in French &amp; Flemish, intituled &amp; named <hi>A Letter Missiue:</hi> Or, <hi>An Epistle directed vnto the Apostates &amp; Backsliders, from the true Christian beleefe, compiled and made by Maister Gentian Heruet, &amp;c</hi>: And for that the same booke was greatly desired, and verie much esteemed of all good and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
<pb facs="11"/>
hearts: I haue (with all diligence and circumspection) perused and read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the same: wherein I haue founde in effect, that in the same is briefly declared and set foorth the whole grounde and foundation of the holie Romish religion, which your Honour, euen with fire and swoorde, to the subuersion and vtter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the whole land, doth seke most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously to mainteine. And I am thereby persuaded, that the same booke was most worthie to be read ouer of all men, to the ende that all startbackes from the faith, might returne into the right way: and the good faithfull Catholikes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by strengthened &amp; confirmed. But nowe considering the saide booke to bee verie shorte, and something darke for a matter of suche importaunce, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise had either none or verie few proofes out of the Scriptures, Councels, holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Decrees of the Popes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue thought good to set penne to Paper, and to set foorth and declare the same at large, that nothing needefull should be lacking. Moreouer cōsidering that it is most necessarie, to declare some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more at large, especially touching
<pb facs="12"/>
the woorthines, and authoritie of the holie Churche of Rome, and the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the holie Scripture: wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the summe of all our matters doe depende, for that we haue alwayes beene forced to call vpon the Church, &amp; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally now, when there is none other shield or defence left vnto vs: therefore haue I traueiled brieflie to shew of this matter, where the sure grounde and foundation lies, by what Scriptures, by what holie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by what Councels, &amp; by how many Decrees euerie point is defended: and likewise howe and in what manner the Scripture and the holie Church of Rome are ioyned together, and Catholikelie vnderstoode in suche order, as the same shall in no wise serue the Heretikes anie thing at al to their purpose or aduantage. And forsomuch as this woorke is sucked out of sundrie sortes of flowres gathered together: therefore haue I named it, <hi>The Bee hiue of the Romishe Churche,</hi> thereby to geue to vnderstande▪ that as the honie Bee, doeth not gather her honie out of one flowre alone, but out of manie and diuerse: So doeth not the Churche of Rome stande vpon one Scripture, Byble,
<pb facs="12"/>
Councels or bokes of Decrees, but doth catche and snatch out of eche of them, that which best serueth her purpose, as hereafter euerie man may plainelie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and in the ende of this booke shall vnderstande more at large, whereas the speciall causes are set foorth, why and wherefore we haue christened this booke with such a name. And now, hauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode that your Honour did a good while agoe set foorth a certaine booke, against the confessiō of the faith of these newe Gospellers, I did verie earnestly trauell to gette the same, trusting that it might (perhaps) haue eased me of this my labour, for that I thought your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour shoulde haue set foorth these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there at large. But after that I had superficially and lightly reade ouer the saide booke, (not hauing the lucke to kepe the same lōg by me.) I was the more willing to set foorth this my <hi>Bee hiue,</hi> for that I sawe it shoulde serue verie well, to the opening and more plaine declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the foresaide booke, which your Honour hath made and published: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that your honour is busie in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie place with the aucthoritie and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb facs="13"/>
of the holie Churche, of her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances or constitutions, additions, or tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ditions, and of the spirituall exposition, which shee hath made vppon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: &amp; perceiuing nothing to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set foorth, whereby one may finde out these constitutions and ordinances, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Scripture, in the Fathers, in the Decrees, or in the Coūcels: so that a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple man might alway stande in doubt, what you will haue esteemed and holden for the commaundementes ordinances, or traditions of the Churche, and what men shall call the Churche, and likewise what rule or inuiolable order this holie Churche doth commonly keepe and vse in the exposition of the scriptures, but I thinke your Honour did leaue this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, as our saide <hi>Maister Gentian Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet</hi> did, especially, because it was to small and slight a matter for you to trouble your mytered head with all. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue I gladlie taken vppon me this paine and trauell, and haue clearely sette forth in this my booke, vpō what ground and foundation all these thinges are buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: So that the necessarie vse of this booke is vnspeakeable as euerie good
<pb facs="13"/>
Catholike shall well perceiue of him self. And forsomuch as herein is not written anie thing, but it doeth agree aswell, yea, better with the said booke made by you, thē with <hi>Gentians</hi> booke, I would gladly haue it set forth, as an Exposition, Glose, or Cōmentarie vpon your foresaid pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie booke: but considering that I had not anie copie of your said booke in my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie, and fearing also least your Honor might haue bene offended, that any man should take vppon him to expounde or comment vpon your writings, which are as cleare as hellishe sunne, euen as your owne name <hi>Sonnius</hi> doth signifie: so that I haue proceeded with my first determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, thinking it sufficient for me, if I might hide this my trauell vnder the winges of your Honor, like as vnder the same, all our newe Bishops haue beene hatched. Most humblie beseeching your Honor, to accept this my simple gifte in good parte, and as becommeth such a worthie Bishop to do, trusting yet (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in short time) to set foorth more such woorkes, and thereby so preciselie to expounde all the bookes that are set out
<pb facs="14"/>
by your Honour, and other doctoures of <hi>Louen</hi> your companions, that a blinde man may feele them with his handes: yea, and without spectacles or candle, conceiue what greate holines lies hid in such coafers. You may (if it please you) in the meane space accept this my woorke, as an explanation and commentarie, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your booke, which to doe resteth at your pleasure and good will. And herein I commende your Byshopps Myter and crosyers staffe vnto the tuition of our holie Father the Pope, who preserue and keepe your Honour with all your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren our new Byshoppes, in prosperous estate and proceedinges against all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes.</p>
