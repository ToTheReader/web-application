   <head>The Authors Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was admired of old,<note place="margin">Theod, l. <hi>4.</hi> c. 26.</note> that <hi>Aphraates,</hi> who lived in the Cottages of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse all his time, yet once was found in the streets of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> in the dayes of the Emperour <hi>Valens</hi>: He excused the change of his former behaviour, by the similitude of a modest Virgin, lurking quietly in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret corners of her fathers house, so long as it is in safety, but if it be set on fire, it is a hurtfull modestie to lurke any longer; necessity forceth her to runne abroad, that shee may giue warning of the imminent danger. This exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Aphraates</hi> might sufficiently excuse mine vnaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed boldnesse, to set forth my head, which hath beene lapped vp so long in hurtfull silence. For now the power of darkness increaseth, and (as the Prophet sayth): <hi>Woe vnto vs,<note place="margin">Ier, 6.4.</note> for the day declineth, and the shadowes of the evening are stretched out, yea the shadowe of Mount Athos reacheth to the Isle Lemnos, a sure fore-running token, of the going downe of the Sun.</hi> And therefore now it is time to creepe out of our subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall caues, that wee may giue notice to quence the fire in time, before it spread further, and bring greater desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the house of our God. Papists are become insolent of late dayes (like vnto Serpents in summer weather, taking courage, and byting the heeles of horses that the riders may
<pb facs="8"/>
fall) not sparing both in word and writ, to reproch our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as not countenanced by An iquity; and our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie as altogether naked and voyd of the knowledge of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient learning: Shall wee now stand still (as idle men in the market-places) one looking vpon another? I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (then wee should sustaine such apparent damage and hurt, through vntimely silence) step forth with the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian</hi> souldier, impotent of his legs, and neither apt to fight, nor able to flie; having this comfort (as he had) that happily I may blunt the edge of the enemies sword, and make others ashamed, who are more fit for fighting then I am. And although those who haue vndertaken to write <hi>Compends,</hi> haue found therein great difficulty, being so invironed with straits, that they finde it very hard, either to satisfie themselues or others (for if the <hi>Compends</hi> bee short, they seeme obscure; if written at length, they seeme to haue need of other <hi>Compends,</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge their prolixity) yet notwithstanding of all these difficulties, it is better to set forward by doing some good, either to our selues or others, then to spend our time in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, left our cogitations (like vnto the vpper and lower mill-stones,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Simile.</hi>
      </note> which lacking good graine to grinde vpon, rub violently one vpon another, vntill both be broken) not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well exercised, but spent vpon vaine things, become hurtfull to both our soules, and bodies.</p>
   <p>In the 1. 2. and 3. Centuries; I haue made no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Councels, either Provinciall, or Nationall; for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time, as they were few in number, by reason of the rage of persecuting Emperours; so most part of those which were gathered, were obscure, and the lesse regarded in respect of their contradiction one to another. There was a Councell gathered at <hi>Rome,</hi> another in <hi>Caesarea
<pb facs="8"/>
Palestinae,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Euseb. l. <hi>5</hi> c. <hi>23.</hi>
      </note> another in <hi>France,</hi> the fourth in <hi>Pontus,</hi> and one in <hi>Asia</hi>; all for one, and to the selfe same purpose: <hi>viz.</hi> to deliberate concerning the keeping of Easter. In <hi>Rome, Victor</hi> was of one opinion; <hi>Polycrates</hi> in <hi>Asia</hi> held ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Iraeneus</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> was wiser then the rest, and was more carefull to keepe vnity in the Church of Christ,<note place="margin">Euseb. l. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>37.</hi>
      </note> then to dispute con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>entiously about the keeping of dayes: A National Councel of <hi>Philadelp.</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> was gathered against <hi>Artemon</hi> &amp; <hi>Beryllus,</hi> wherein <hi>Origen</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Another at <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Cornelius,</hi> for the suppressing of the error of <hi>Novatus.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cypr. epist. lib. <hi>1.</hi> epist. <hi>2.</hi> Euseb. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>29.</hi>
      </note> Another at <hi>Antiochia,</hi> against <hi>Paulus Samo
satenus,</hi> a pernicious Heretique. Others were gathered by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizing of those who were baptized by Heretiques: which weaknes both in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and in other Bishops of <hi>Africk,</hi> was after corrected by the Church.</p>
   <p>Take in good part the Goats-haire, and Rammes-skins, which I present to cover the Tabernacle of our God. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the ornaments of gold, silver, and precious-stones, for beautifying the inner parts of the Tabernacle, to others, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom God hath vouchsafed greater gifts. The house of God is large and ample, and as it hath neede of bright-shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning torches, for the Hauls, Parlors, and Chambers; so it hath need of smaller lights, for Cellers, and office-houses: if my farthing candle giue light in the lowes Celler of the house of God, my heart is fully content.
