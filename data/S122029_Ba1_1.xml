   <head>A letter that the Author vvritt to the Lady Victoria Columna Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of Pescara, vvhom he mentioneth in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle before his booke.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>MOST HONORABLE AND MY VERIE good Lady. I am much behouldinge to M. Thomas Tuke,</hi> bicause he was the occasion that your Ladishipp hath vouchsafed to write vnto me: which is most accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to me, and not without cause, consideringe I haue written so manye letters and coulde neuer receiue anye answere from you again, albeit they conteined sundrye matters. Truth it is indeede, that vnmeete it were your L. shoulde write vnto me, onlesse therewithall you vsed my seruice and commaunded me in what I am able to do for you. As touchinge <hi>M, Tuke,</hi> I will do as much for him, as shall lie in me to doe, both for your L. sake that may commaunde me, and for the brotherlye loue that I beare him. Where <hi>M. Gutteriz</hi> hath wrytten vnto you that I complayned of you, I wonder nothinge at it, for (to saye the troth) I vttred my greef a good while sins in a letter that I wrott vnto you your self, as I passed the mountaignes of <hi>Fraunce</hi> to come into <hi>Spaine.</hi> And he that toulde me the matter that caused it, was my L. Marquesse of <hi>Vasto,</hi> who showed me a letter of yours, in the which you your self confessed the stelth of the Courtyer. The whyche thynge I as then tooke in great good part, doubtynge nothynge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ut that it shoulde remayne in youre handes, and be well kept vntyll I my self shoulde come to demaunde it of you.



<pb facs="190"/>
At the last I was enfourmed by a Gentilman <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> who continueth still here in <hi>Spaine,</hi> that there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein Fragmentes of the poore Courtier in <hi>Naples,</hi> and he sawe them in the handes of sundrye men, and he that scattered it thus abrode reported that he had it of you. It was some greef to me, as a father that seeth hys chylde so yll handled: yet afterward yeeldyng to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I knewe he deserued not to haue anye more store made of him, but (like an vntymelye birth) to be left in the hygh waye for the benifit of nature. And so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly was I determined to do, consideringe yf there were any thinge in the Booke not yll, men woulde haue the woorse opinion of it, whan they shoulde see it so out of order. And no diligence shoulde preuaile any more to poolish it and to sett it furth, sins it had lost the thyng, which perhappes at the first was onlye it, that made it esteamed: that is to weete, the noueltye of the matter. And knowinge your saiynge to be true, that the cause of my complaint was verye triflynge, I resolued wyth my selfe, to leaue at the least my complaininge, though I coulde not my sorowynge. And that whyche I brake wyth <hi>M. Gutteriz</hi> (in case it be well wayed) was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. In conclusion others, more bent of a zeale then I was, haue enforced me to write hym ouer again, as the shortnesse of tyme hath serued me, and to sende hym to <hi>Venice</hi> to be put in print, and so haue I done. But if your L. shoulde suspect that the good will whiche I beare you were any deale feinted for this, your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shoulde deceyue you, whiche (I beleaue) it did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in all youre lief beefore: but rather I recken my selfe more bounde to you, bicause the necessity that droue me to make hast so spedilie to imprint it, hath saued me a great peece of labour, where I was once mynded to haue added manye other matters, which coulde be but of small moment as the rest are. And thus shall the reader haue the lesse labour and the Author lesse blame.



<pb facs="191"/>
Therefore it is nowe past time eyther for you or me to repent or correct. And thus I take my leaue of you.</p>
