I may justly pronounce your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, happy: yet there is a better Title, for asserting Happinesse to you, than both these: That your Delight is in the Law of the Lord; and in his Law will exercise your selfe, both Day and Night: For now, it is not the World; it is not I; it is</hi> David <hi>himselfe, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth you happy: and give me leave, my Lord, to shew you the Picture of a happy man, drawne here by</hi> David; <hi>and let all the World judge, if it resemble not you: and that so neere, that not any in our Age; and I may say, nor yet in many Ages, hath beene more like it. And having shewed you this; my part remaines, onely to Pray; that you may long enjoy this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

as a fruite of your vertue here; and come at last, to bee like the Tree it selfe; which will yeeld you a fruit of happinesse, that shall never fade; nor so much as the leafes of it, ever wither: for how should they wither, when</hi> In memoria aeterna erit Iustus? <hi>Thus he prayeth that is</hi>
