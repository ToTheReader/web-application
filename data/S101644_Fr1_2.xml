      </gap>n in eueri mans hand: but for a certain peculiar deare frind of mine: whom I perceiued very desierous of the knoledge thereof
<pb facs="3"/>which is vnlerned and lamēteth him selfe muche y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>acked the good y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vertuous bringing vp in lerning y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> many men haue had to there great confort. Partly by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I do knowledge mine owne reudnes to be such, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> scant I can satisfie &amp; please mine owne minde in the doinge thereof being often tyme displeased and offēded with my selfe that I can do no better: at the leastwyse not so well: as I would that thing should be done which beinge once a brode, muste nedes come vnder many mens iudgments, must susteine and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> opinions of ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>i, of whom some wyl saie this might be more cleane trāstatid: this word or that is not in his owne kind: this sens or that is not giuen according to the minde of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> authour as it hath ben alwaye sen, the nisnes of some

   <p>Partly bycause I knewe my frende so gentyll: that he woulde vowchsafe howe so euer it were done to take it in good worth, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temming my zeale and good wyl in as muche as thowght it wer so fienly done: that no man myght amend it. But after that I had made an end of the translacion: and had red it ouer once or twyse againe, mi thowght that the plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure done therby to my peculiar frende, should not haue bine able to haue weighede doune y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wrong and iniurie which I should haue wrowght to innumerable: in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
<pb facs="4"/>&amp; keepinge a waie or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in hidinge of so great a iuell and treasure frō so manie which might haue therby great confort in receyuing knowledge &amp; lighte in the thinge wherein they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>o vanish such vices &amp; detestable abominaciō from there hertes as they shoulde se in this boke open<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly reprehended.</p>
   <p>Esteming therefore the sober godly &amp; modest discreciō of many: before the momishe reprehension of a fewe vndiscrete and vngodly momes. I turned my purpose frō apeculier and a priuate commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of one or twane to the cōmō vtilitie of all men whiche are desi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous to knowe the trueth.</p>
   <p>Thys done for as muche as in tyme past men haue vsed to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb facs="4"/>their workes: some to one mā some to an other, some to obteine fauoure: some to haue there wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes &amp; writings by their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie defended &amp; mainteined (if any peraduenture shoulde or woulde kicke against the) &amp; finally some y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> their workes might be the better regarded for those mens sakes vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der whose name they were putte furth. None of al these causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my minde other wise thā only for to profit (the veritie of it selfe being alway a sufficient suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour &amp; bulwarke against all false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade &amp; lies) yet I thought with my selfe not vnmete and vnconue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nient but rather expedient and necessarie folowinge the example of many lerned men whiche haue written, to dedicate thys small worcke bringinge wyth it to the reader greate and vnspeakeable
<pb facs="5"/>proffit to some noble person at whose hand: they whiche are desi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous of knowledge might receiue i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> the more willingly, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> more glad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, and wyth the more fruit: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that it is the natur of al men commonly to haue in more highe estimacion a small gift at a great mans hand: and it wer but a beke of hys head thā a thing of much more valeur to be giuē and receiued of a person of lower estat and degre yea &amp; would also make much more of it.</p>
   <p>Thincking therefore with miself howe I might bestow thys littell gyft worthely and to whome: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge all other your grace came first vnto my minde, whose excellē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie being a goodly &amp; a bright spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle to womanhod: and no small reproch to a great meany of men, which ar slogardes in ded and ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ri
<pb facs="5"/>idel bodies: and great shame (if any shame were in them) to those whiche shoulde be the brekars of this heauēly foode &amp; breade vnto the people, to their trust and smal fidelite commited, not being satis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fied and contented them selfes to be idel: but do wishe al other men to be y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same, hatinge and eating them vp in there hertes which be otherwyse affectioned and amōg al other not abideing to here that a woman should once haue the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelie in her hande or in here mought. Whose excelentie I saie what for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ardēt loue &amp; desire that your grace doeth beare to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worde of God: but in specially for the diligent promotinge &amp; set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng furth therof to your greate charges: as it deserueth no small cōmendacion and prayse: euen so to take vpon me to extol and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēd
<pb facs="6"/>those heauēly giftes which the Lorde hath bestowed in your noble person (your grace abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe nothynge more than your owne laude &amp; cōmēdacion, which referreth all to the glory of the lorde) it should seme rather to be an obscuringe of the brightnes of them then a makinge of them to apere more cōmendable being no thinge at al praised when they be but halfe praised: nor yet hauing their dew cōmēdacion: the chiefe and principal parte of them lefte vnspoken and vnmencioned at the leaste wyse not accordinge to there dignite declared nether w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> fit wordes nor sentencis adorned.</p>
   <p>For as much therefore as your grace before alother most luckely did come to my memoriat whose handes beinge certaine that the cōmō people hath receiued alredy
<pb facs="6"/>many confortable &amp; spirituall cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solatiōs, instructiōs, &amp; techinges thinkinge also that they woulde fech this swete morsel of meat the more gladde &amp; redier at the hādes which haue ben wont to fede and norishe them: rather than at the hādes of a strainger. I coulde not deuise in my mynde to whome I might be so bolde to dedicate this matter as to your noble grace: where so great gentilnes &amp; lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of spirite is: I doubt not but you will so accept &amp; take in good part: this my rugged and vnfiled reudnes that both I shall haue no cause to be sory hereafter for my intempeste and bolde auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie: and also the readars here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of shal haue cause to yelde thākes to the Lorde for the great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they shall here fech at your hande: to the greate profite
<pb facs="7"/>and cōforte of theresoulls: praing the Lorde of al confort, both they and I togither to preserue your grace in this godli minde to your own hertes desire accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wil and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Lorde ⁂</p>
