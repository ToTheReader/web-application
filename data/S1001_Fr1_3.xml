   <head>TO THE
Vnderstander.</head>
   <p>VNderstander (for,
to euery Reader I
write not) beholde
this Booke with a gentle
eye, and entertaine it with
fauour. It was penn'd by
him who had rather say,
<hi>Est iudicium in nobis,</hi>
than <hi>est furor in nobis.</hi>
Winke therefore at the
want of witte thou shalt
finde; since it is a worke
<pb facs="7"/>
of iudgement onely. As
for the Asses of the Age,
I care as little for their
censures, as their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
Though they can pick
out good sense, yet they
will not; contrarie to the
equity of a Reader; who,
in a place doubtful, should
striue to vnderstand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he cry out, <hi>Non</hi> sense.
They little knovve, that
hee, who writes in euery
thing properly, shall neuer
vvrite anie thing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singly.
If I were disposed
to carpe, I doe not thinke
there are ten lines in any
booke extant, out of which
I would not pick somthing
<pb facs="7"/>
to cauill at. My greatest
comfort is, I neuer yet
saw any carper that had
any iudgement. VVhich
vvhosoeuer wants, lacks
the very salt of wit: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, whatsoeuer is
read, lies ravve, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested.
But, that which
makes mee most merrie,
is, that some of our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
puppies thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
worthy to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
vvith the most au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticke,
auncient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours;
vvhose vvittes
they come as short of, as
of their vvorkes. I haue
heard some of them cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
Authours, vvhome
<pb facs="8"/>
they doe as little vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
as they doe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
If they had but
some small deale of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vvith their manie
vvordes, they might (I
confesse) rubbe-out rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
vvell, amongst
coxcombes, that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of no higher mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
than themselues. But,
as they are, I vvould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
them to content
themselues vvith their
Iigge-learning: in which
when they haue knowne
all they can, they then
knowe iust nothing; and,
as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, <hi>opero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sè
nihil agunt.</hi> I write
<pb facs="8"/>
not this out of Spleene,
for the wrong they haue
done mee: for, my spirite
is pearcht so farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
them, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fling so high, as to
hit it. Doe not I knowe,
that these Times let-loose
<hi>literatores,</hi> to set vpon
<hi>literatiores?</hi> Yes, yes: I
knowe it; and haue put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a resolution to beare
both vvith the iniquity,
and the stoliditie of the
Times. Farewell, Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstander,
and
vse mee
wel.</p>
