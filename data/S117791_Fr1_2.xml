   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath beene thought needfull that a true and perfect Relation of the whole proceedings against <hi>Iohn Ogilvie,</hi> a Iesuit, lately exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted at GLASGOW, should bee published; as well for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of those, who desire to be informed of his behauiour, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of his imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and at his arraigment &amp; execution; as to obviate the misreportes of the enemies of true Relegion; who wrest and draw all thinges, without respect of trueth, to their owne aduantage. It is knowne within these few yeeres, <hi>Henry Garnet</hi> and <hi>Edward Oldcorne,</hi> English Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, beeing called in question, for that prodigious and damnable Powder-treason; although it was proved by cleare euidences and their own confessions, vnder their owne handes; that they were speciall authors and actors in it, and for the same were executed by publicke justice, not in a corner, but in the open Cities of LONDON and WORCESTER: yet (such is the shamelesse impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of that sect) by printed Apologies they haue beene iustified: and which is more, inserted in a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of their Martyrs, set foorth at Rome, <hi>Anno</hi> 1608. by the licence and permission of their superiours. By
<pb n="4" facs="3"/> which maner of doing, what may be expected in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, at their handes, any man may easily perceiue. Euery thing they are about to doe (bee it neuer so great a mischiefe) they cloake with the mantle of Religion: and if the statutes of the Kingdome ouer-take any of them, either for practises against the King, or sowing the seed of rebellion amongst the subiectes, it must bee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed (forsoothe) they suffer all for religion. Now were it so, and that according to the law, for Masse saying they were punished to the death, they could not glorie in it, nor rightly challenge the crowne of Martyrdome, their masse beeing a vile and idolatrous seruice, flatly disagreeing with the faith of Christ, and trueth of the Gospell. But it is not so, albeit wee haue such statutes, for the restraint of Masse abomination within this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, they are not able to instance any one, who for the transgressing thereof to this houre hath suffered. His Majesties proceedings with them haue beene more gentle: where death might haue beene inflicted, milder courses haue beene taken: imprisonment for some short time, &amp; banishment foorth of the Realme haue bene the sharpest punishments: so vnwilling was his Highnesse to force, or once to seeme to force the consciences of any men whatsoeuer. And to say that which trueth is, if this vnhappy miscreant, who nowe hath his reward, had not discouered his traiterous minde, openly disauowing his Majesties authoritie and stood to the maintaining of the Popes power, for dethroning kings, and freeing subjects from their oathes of alegeance, hee had felt no harder measure, then others, although the circumstances of his fault, were much greater: but his peruerse speaches, and insolent cariage beyond all credite, his sowing of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, tending to open rebellion, the hande of Iustice
<pb n="5" facs="3"/> could not forbeare. What was it, in the hearing of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of people to affirme, <hi>that he would returne or abide in the Kingdome, contrary to the lawes, and his Maiesties commandements? to value his Highnesse authoritie with his old hatte, &amp; the acts of our Parliament with a rotten figge: to say, it was treason to sweare with the oath of alleageance to the King, and that his Maiestie by vsurping the Popes power, had lost the right of the kingdome.</hi> Yet these &amp; diuers other more treasonable speeches he vttered at his arraignemēt which are set down in the processe, so far as could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred: for all could not be kept in mind. I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the honester minded of those of his own profession, wil in their hearts condemne, &amp; judge him justly to haue suffered: for, praised be God, the Iesuits arte hath not so farre preuailed, in planting such opinions in the hearts of people, but euen amongst the aduersaries themselues, they are many, that doe no wise approue their seditious &amp; proditorie doctrines. And here, to all our Catholickes, (they will be so called) in this Kingdome, if nothing further may be obtained, &amp; that still they wil lye in that superstition, wherein they haue bene nuzled, I wish at least so much wisdome, as to beware of Iesuites policies and not to thinke their practises, the cause of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church. It is not Religion, as one hath well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, they striue for, but soueraignitie: It will not content them to haue the Romish faith, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies embraced, the crownes of Kings, their scepters and subjects must all be at the Popes deuotion. This is their speciall worke, and the effect of their blinde obedience, that speciall vowe, I meane, which they besides the three vowes common to other orders, vow and sweare at their receptions: To this point runs all their seruice, to make the Pope the lord of all the earth, Emperours, Kings, &amp;
<pb n="6" facs="4"/> Princes his dependants, to be remoued, altered, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, deposed, and killed, when it pleaseth his holines to giue commission. MARIANA, a Iesuit, counteth it a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some meditation, for Kings, to think they may be killed, not only lawfully, but with glory and commendation to the doers. And CAESAR BARONIVS in his <hi>Annales,</hi> recites <note place="margin">Tomo 11. pag. 802.</note> a brieue of Pope VRBAN the second, sent to GODFREDE Bishop of <hi>Luca,</hi> wherein hee declares, that they are not to be esteemed murtherers, who burning with the zeale of their catholicke mother, kills excōmunicates. The words of the Rescript are these: <hi>Non illos homicidas arbitramur, qui adversus excommunicatos, zelo catholicae matris arden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, eorum quoslibet trucidasse contigerit.</hi> BELLARMINE that <note place="margin">De Pont. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">

         </gap> cap. 6</note> great Doctor, in his cōtrouersie, <hi>De Romano Pontifice,</hi> hath these expresse words, <hi>Papa potest mutare regna, &amp; uni au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, at{que} alteri conferre, tanquam summus princeps spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis si id necessarium fuerit ad animarum salutem.</hi> That is, the Pope as chiefe spirituall prince, may change king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, &amp; take them away from one, &amp; giue them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be necessarie for the sauing of soules. But <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscus Suarius</hi> in his late booke intituled, <hi>Defensio fidei Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicae,</hi> goes beyond all this, saying, that any, to whom the Pope permits the doing, may kill or expell the King, who is by sentence depriued, or which is all one, if he be declared to haue committed the crime, which by law deserues that penaltie: and if the Pope neglect to giue power, the lawfull successour may take the execution to himselfe, and if hee faile, the communitie of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome succeedes in that right: to wit, to kill and expell him. His wordes are these, <hi>Post sententiam condemnato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam regis, de regni privatione, latam per legitimam potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, vel quod perinde est, post sententiam declaratoriam ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis habentis talem poenam ipso iure impositam, potest ille
<pb n="7" facs="4"/> qui sententiam tulit, vel cui ipse commiserit, regem privare regno, etiam illum interficiendo, si aliter non potuerit.</hi> In the same place: <hi>Si Paparegem deponat, ab illis tantum poterit expelli, vel interfici quibus ipse id commiserit. Quod</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 4. num. 18.</note>
      <hi>si nulli executionem imperet, pertinebit ad legitimum in reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no successorem, vel si nullus inventus fuerit ad regnum ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum spectabit.</hi> And that no man should thinke this his priuate opinion, amongst the approbations prefixed to the worke, yee haue <hi>in censura Academiae Complutensis</hi> this saide, <hi>Nihil est in toto hoc opere à nostro omnium sensu discordans, quum de hac re sit omnium nostrum eadem vox, idem animus, eadéque sententia.</hi> That is, there is nothing in all this worke, which is not agreeable with our mind, seeing heerein we haue all one voice, one opinion, and one iudgement. Nowe if this bee the minde of all, it is high time they were all met with, and that <hi>celeri poena,</hi> by a present dispatch. The knightes templars, erected, as is thought, by the princes of France to preserue their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest in the holy land, when by keeping the rules of their institution in the first yeeres, they had purchased a great reputation of holynesse, and thereby drawne to themselues an infinite wealth, became at last intolerable to kinges, and by one uniforme consent in the councell of <hi>Vienna</hi> were condemned, &amp; the order abolished. The order was of a longer standing by much then our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, but to kinges nothing so dangerous. The writers that mention them, do not agree vpon the causes of their generall hatred, and leaue the Reader in suspense, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iustly they merited exterminion or not: But poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie shall haue an aduantage in vnderstanding the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Iesuites by their printed bookes, and their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious practises, by the attempts they haue made against the estates and liues of princes. <hi>Secta haec rebellis est, &amp;
<pb n="8" facs="5"/> nocens regibus.</hi> A rebellious sect they are, &amp; hurtfull ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to kings, cruel assasins, teaching disloyaltie, &amp; plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the deaths of princes, which all EVROPE, and thou France by the rest canst testifie. O Kings, when shall yee awake, &amp; take it in your harts, to fulfil Gods decree? Whē shall yee vindicate your crownes from the vniust usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of the priest of Rome? Shal the disgrace and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence done to some of your sacred persons for euer thus lye vnauenged? We know it shall not: But GOD hath his day, who will patiently attend. In the meane time I shall wish the Catholikes of this kingdome to consider and looke more deeply in their profession, then they yet haue done. The mysteries of the Romish Religion are not seene at the first. Surely, some of our Papistes doe not know them, especially that principle, which bindes them to obey the Pope against al the world. <note n="*" place="margin">

      <hi>Suarius</hi> hath taught them, that it is to be held as an article of faith, that the Pope hath power to depose kings, and that hee who denyes this power to the Pope, denyes the Catholicke faith. By this is there no meane left to be a Catholike, &amp; remaine the Kings loyall subiect. To beleeue the Popes power is such, is vndenyable treason: To refuse it is to renounce Catholick religion: which last I perswade my selfe all true and naturall SCOTS will choose, and of the choise shall it neuer repent them. I beseech GOD to open their eyes that are closed, and giue vs all to bee contented with the Scriptures of GOD, which by them selues are able to perfect vs vnto euery good worke.</p>
