   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y olde and féeble age which now hath fully atteined the number of lx yeares, with the sundry requests of many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men my very friends, which many times haue giuen me occasion to yéelde héerevnto, moueth me now (my fatall, vncerteine end approching) to satisfie &amp; accomplish theyr reasonable desire, and therefore I haue now enterprised to shew them in a small treatise, by noting, that which many times they haue intreated me by word of mouth, a matter that hath bene thought by them I could better performe (then in truth I am able) by reason of the long continuance that in the art <hi>De re militari,</hi> my troubles and trauell hath brought me vnto. And although y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> some haue written of this matter héeretofore very excellently (with great perfection,) yet for that those times and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice the which they did write of, doth differ much from that which is at this present. It cannot be, but this my trauell (at leastwise if it deserue to be called trauell) will somewhat profit them, which truly I haue taken in hand but onely for pleasure and recreation. And forasmuch as that which is already written of this matter, is but of a few authours, which were well knowne, &amp; if there were many more, yet it cannot be ordered by their rules &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts without great incōuenience, for truly in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there would be great want within our time, if there were no order by art for to place in proportion, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer number be it great or smal, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> which ought to be estée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; more chiefly obserued, then those rules which bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth &amp; compelleth with prescription of number by limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and marke appointed them as though that there they should end, which is to be amplified and increased vnto such a greatnesse as the number doth require, and this may be spoken of many, that I doe it of a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention,
<pb facs="4"/>
if there were not many others that reade this little treatise, which will affirme themselues to knowe the same, the which giueth me occasion not to offer this my rude worke vnto such, but vnto those vnskilfull soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers as are not instructed in the art of ordering, or haue any light or knowledge what they ought to doe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnto suche as are most excellent Maisters and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, there is no order but that they haue perfect, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice but they haue séene, no warres but that they haue béene in, nor no other science but that they doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand. Vnto such therfore the whole iudgement ought to be left, forasmuch as Fortune and Nature hath endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with so great value, whereby they deserue to be more aduaunced then those hoarie heads of lx. yeares of experience, vnto whome hath all things bene contrarye, for not allowing or hauing any regard vnto straunge things, but estéeming more their owne proper dooings, whose knowledge cannot be lesse then this that I sette forth.</p>
   <p>I doe not meane to publish this to such like persons of vnderstanding, but rather I doe request them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise me of my ignoraunce, for that the same maye bée amended &amp; corrected that is amisse. And also I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire them if there be anye thing in this which before was vnknowne vnto them, that they woulde in good part friendlye accepte the same at their discreations, for my intent is onelye to write vnto those that are affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned vnto matters of the warre, and to the arte of ordering, not desirous to staye vppon a long experience to sée the same done, without there be an order to helpe them, or art to make them perfect, to such I doe pray, desire, and earnestly request, that they do not desist from so worthy an intent, since that order that we doe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallye set foorth and declare, is so meruailous and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull.</p>
   <p>For by the same we doe sée the daye and night is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned,
<pb facs="4"/>
by this the bodylye health of man is preserued, all Cities and Townes well ordered and mainteined, and by the same, Kingdomes are susteyned, vpholden, and kepte in peace, and the people in quietnesse and tranquilitye, the which order in matters of warre, they ought to haue in lyke regarde as in that of a Citye, that is well gouerned, yea, farre better, for in one onely Citye, the hurt or losse of ill gouernement is therein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed, but the lacke of order in a Campe or Armye of men in time of necessitye and approch of enimyes, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes hath béen the onely losse of sundrie kingdomes. The which béeing knowne vnto the Maiestye of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to those that doth gouerne in theyr high Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells of warre, hath bestowed such offices vppon suche excellent graue persons of vnderstanding, to whome they may most assuredlye commit and giue all care &amp; charge thereof, leauing the same to theyr most prudent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
   <p>I doe leaue to speake of those excellent Generalles, the which are at this present, whose prayse I dare not with my pen to touch, but rather referre that to others, who canne better sette foorth theyr worthye commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and it is sufficient for me to bée thankfull that GOD hath giuen vs them from aboue, for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the earth.</p>
   <p>And thus thou godlye Reader which art affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned vnto this arte of a Souldyer, doe not giue ouer, nor cease not to procéede in this manly enterprise and pretence, for by the same thou shalt reape most swéete and delectable pleasure and rewarde, that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thée, and besides shalt lyue in an exercise, that is greatlye estéemed, from whence thou shalt obtayne honour, which is thy last desire. And nowe first you must vnderstande, that it is necessarye to abandonne all suche faultes, as are accustomed to bée, at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of a Companye, of whose disorder commonlye
<pb facs="5"/>
chaunceth great daungers and inconueniences, because the Captaines haue not commonly that great respect and care to the charge that doth apperteine vnto them. And therefore I will declare how they shall march and bée gouerned, &amp; of their obedience to the order, the which is giuen them by theyr Officers, the which shall bée diuided into thrée partes, beginning after the order following.</p>
