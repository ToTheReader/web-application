                 <title>A reply against M. Gilbert Brovvne priest : Wherein is handled many of the greatest and weightiest pointes of controuersie betweene vs and the papists, and the truth of our doctrine clearely proued, and the falset of their religion and doctrine laide open, and most euidentlie conuicted and confuted, by the testimonies of the Scripture and auncient fathers; and also by some of their own popes, doctors, cardinals, and of their owne writters. Whereunto is anexed a seuerall treatise, concerning the masse and Antichrist. By M. Iohn Welsche, preacher of Christs Gospell at Aire</title>

   <head>TO MAJSTER GJLBERT Browne Priest, defender of the <hi>Romish faith.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Receaued a booke of yours sent to me wherein is contained, partlye an answere to a little scrolle sent be me to a Catholick as ye name him: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye your exhortation to mee, after the answere, together with some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, whereof ye craue to be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by me and my bretheren. Your answere to my writing you haue subscriued, so I see you will stand by it: The other parte is not subscriued. It is a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pitifull thing, to see the glorious gospell of his deare Sonne our Sauiour so obscured and darkned in this country with the
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Reuel. 9.2</note> smoke of that kingdome of darknesse of yours, that hes ascended &amp; come out of the bottomles pit, to their eternall damnation, who is blinded and deceaued thereby. I haue sorrow in my hart for it, and it is my earnest desire to God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, that once in his mercy, the smoke of that fornace maye bee scattered by the light of his glorious Gospell, and the beames thereof maye shyne in their owne strength and clearnesse in this blinded country, that is drunken with the
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Reuel, 17.2 2. Thes. 2.5</note>
      <hi>abhominations</hi> of that harlote of Babell, and deceaued with her strong delusions whereof ye are vsed as the instrument in the Lordes Iustice: that as the rest of the land hes risen that first
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Revel. 20.5</note>
      <hi>resurrection</hi> from the death of her darknesse and her abhominations: so this country may also be partaker of the same, that in that great day they may rise that second resurrection to life and glory. I beleeue &amp; therefore I speak, &amp; that with confidence and assurance knowing by his worde, that
<note n="(d)" place="margin">Reuel. 14.8.</note>
      <hi>Babel</hi> must fall
<pb facs="16"/> as the
<note n="(e)" place="margin">Reuel. 11, 13.</note>
      <hi>tenth parte</hi> of it is fallen alreadie. The
<note n="(f)" place="margin">Reuel. 17.10</note>
      <hi>whoore must bee made naked and desolate, and her flesh muste be eaten vp.</hi> For true is the Lord who hes foretolde it, &amp; that God who condemnes her is a strong God, therefore
<note n="(g)" place="margin">Reu. 18, 8.5.</note>
      <hi>her plagues shal sal vpon her at once,</hi> death, famine and sorrow: for her sinnes are come vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen,
<note place="margin">Reu. 17.4. Col. 2.23, 2. Tim. 3.5. Reu. 17.4.2. &amp; 18.3.4.24.</note> &amp; God hath remembred her iniquities. And sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the cupe wherin she reached her fornications &amp; abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations to be drunken out of, be of golde, hauing a shew of holinesse &amp; voluntary religion, yet the drink that is in it, is abhomination and Idolatry, wherewith she hes corrupted the earth, and made the nations drunken therewith. Let all the children of God therefore, that loues to be saued, forsake her, and goe out of her, least they be partaker of her iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and of her iudgements also: for her iudgement is pierced through to the heauens, and is lifted vp to the vppermoste cloudes. In vaine therefore doth anye man goe aboute to cure her with balme, for she cannot be healed. It is al but in vaine to you Maister <hi>Gilbert,</hi> or any man else, to display her banner vpon her walles, to strengthen her keepers, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt her watchmē, to prouid for her spyes, for the Lord hes both thought it, and will performe that whilk he hes spoken against her. The Lord is to recompence her, all the euil that she hath done to Sion; and his holy Temple, and the Saintes therein: for their blood is found in her. The Lord hes sworne by him self, euen he that made the earth by his vertue, that established the world by his wisedome, and stretched out the heauens by his prudencie: and yet man is so brutishe that he will not vnderstand, and so bewitched with her pleasures, that hee will not beleeue it. I beseech God who is able to quicken the dead, and to open the eyes of the blinde, and to cal the things that are not, to be: to open your eyes that you may vnderstand and beleeue these things, and to glorifie his owne name in your conuersion vnto the trueth, and if it be possible, for ye haue caused many to erre: and as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> caused the people to sinne, because he stayed them from cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vp to Ierusalem, to haue worshipped God aright, and made them to worship Idoles in their owne lande: So haue you done great iniquitie, and hes staied sundry of the Lords
<pb facs="16"/> people to come to mount Sion, the Kirk of God: where there they might haue learned his wayes,

And as the Lord put an impure spirit of errour in the mouth of <hi>Achabs</hi> false Prophets, to entise him to goe vp to <hi>Ramoch Giliad,</hi> that he might perish thereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord had spoken euill against him, who entised and preuailed also. So hes the Lord put an impure spirit, and a spirite of error in your mouth,
<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.</note> and in the mouthes of the rest of her false Prophets, to entise so many, as loues not the trueth in this sinfull country to beleeue your lyes, and to be deceaued with your strong delusions: that all these might be damned whilk had pleasure in vnrighteousnes, as the Lorde foretolde in the 2 Thes. 2. O that ye had an harte to turne to God, that as ye haue beene a stumbling blocke to many, to cause many to fal with you to the damnation of their soules; So ye may be by your conuersion to the trueth of God, the instrument of the rysing of many againe. O that treasure of wrath that yee haue hoorded vp againste your selfe in that greate day: for Sathan hes wrought effectually by you, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer by any in this land, with all power, &amp; in all deceaueable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of vnrighteousnes amongst them that perish. For cursed is he, and the Lord commanded to proclaime it in mount <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball,</hi> that causes the blinde to turne out of the way, and let all the people say, Amen. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. What curse of the Lorde is then abyding you, who thinkes it good seruice to God to cause the blinde to wander, and turne away from the lighte of the Gospell; whilk is the words of eternall life to all them that beleeues. Oh remember, and lay it to your hart, the eternity of damnation. It is hard for you to kick against the pricke: the stone of the trueth that ye stumble at, will crushe you all in peeces at the last. Shut not your eyes at the clear light of life and grace, &amp; harden not your hearte while it is called the day. And while yee are in the waye with your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary

The Lorde take away the vaile that is hung ouer your harte, that yee maye bee turned to the eternall weill of your owne soule, and the saluation of many that is blindlings led by you to the bottomlesse pit of condemnation. Because I haue compassion on you, &amp; on this miserable country, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this writ I vnto you. Fot allace who can bide it to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for euermore from such a wonderfull and euerlasting weight of glory, from the fellowshipe of the Lambe, and of all his glorified creaturs, man and Angell? who can compasse the eternitie of damnation in that vtter darknesse, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for euermore? who can tell their terrors? who can nomber their sorrowes, who can reckon and count the eternal woes of the damned. Be not cruell to your own soule and the soules of your owne country men, loue not yours and their eternall damnation. Beleeue the Scripture &amp; be not incredulous. Without that citie of God, that new Ierusalem, shal be dogges, inchanters, murtherers, and idolaters: and whosoeuer loueth &amp; maketh lyes. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 22. Yea, their portion shall bee in that lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, whilk is the seconde death. Either wonderous blinded and indured must you be, or else in your owne conscience you know your Kirk &amp; your selues to be murtherers of soules, Idolaters, luiffers and makers of lyes. For the vphold of the credite of your religion, and that not be the writtings of your enemies, but of your freinds men of your owne profession: yea, by your owne latine seruice set out in your owne bookes, for yee worship not the one true God in Iesus Christ through his spirite, but as <hi>Ieremie</hi> sayes of the Idolaters in his time, according to the nomber of your

For there is as direct opposition betwixt your heade &amp; Iesus Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your religion and his, as is betwixt light and darknes, Christ and Beliall, the doctrine of diuels &amp; the doctrine of saluation. But the Lords iudgements are vnsearchable and his wayes past finding out: he hardens whome hee will and hes mercy on whome he will. I thought it surely the Lordes good prouidence, that he hes broght you out into the campe now, and that nowe by write ye haue set your foote into the battle, who hes beene sik a sore enemie to the gospell of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ in this country, and hes resisted the preaching of it vehemently, that it may be seene that darknesse was but your strength, and lyes the foundation of your religion. But I leaue you to the Lord. Now as for that scrowe of mine, as ye call it, if it was so as you set it downe heir, there hes beene some little escapes in <hi>scribendo,</hi> in the writting. In the laste section (as I haue marked in yours heir and there, as may be seene in sundry places) whilk I haue corrected in this my answer as 1258. for 1158. next 129. for 1290. &amp; <hi>Iames Gyles</hi> a threatning Friar, for to <hi>Iohn Geillis:</hi> and the Kirk of Grecia whilk with the reste of the Greeke and Easterne Kirks was moe nor the Kirks of Europe.

I haue set downe your answere fullie, and hes answered to euery poynt &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument seuerally: the like now Maister <hi>Gilbert</hi> I desire of you that if euer you can be able to put to your hand to make an answere, that you set down mine word for word, &amp; answere euerie head and poynt thereof seuerally, as I haue set them downe heir, and shew what you graunt, and what you denie in euerie head, and argument as I haue done in yours: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, I wil take it for no answere, but for a manifest demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that ye are convicted in your conscience of the truth of our doctrine and of the falset of your owne religion. The two heades concerning the Masse and Antichrist, I haue put them in a seuerall treatise, whilk I haue annexed to this: and that both because they are the corner stones and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall poynts of your religion, and also because vvhen I offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to disproue them in word, whilk you shifted of vnder this pretence onely, because there vvas a brother of the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vvith me, vvhome ye vvould not suffer to be present; to be a vvitnesse and penner of our disputation only: but would haue him remoued from the hearing of it altogether: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithstanding that it vvas promised faithfullie, both by him and mee, and al the gentlemen that vvas present, offered as caution, that he should not speake a sillabe, neither secreitlie nor openly, during all the time of our disputation; but only be a witnes and penner of our conference vpon my part, ye hauing also both Maister <hi>George Ker,</hi> &amp; another to haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for your part, and nothing to be vvritten, but that whilk should be subscriued by both parties. You not daring face your own cause, vpon so equal conditions, you desired to set them dovvne in vvrite, the vvhilk I haue done heir. Novve the Lord open your eyes to see the truth for Christs sake.
