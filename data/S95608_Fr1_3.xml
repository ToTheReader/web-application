      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE cause of making these Purposes and Resolutions cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, is not common: It is my knowne weakenesse, not conceit of their worthines. There are some, that think the vertues of learned and famous men to bee admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not imitable; but if workes of Grace appeare in a meaner person, by not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing to ouertake him, they begin to follow him. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> before his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conuersion, thought a
<pb facs="5"/> christian life too difficult for his then wauering minde, but when he perceiued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vnlearned women, and ruder <hi>Artisans</hi> to be great proficients in the Schoole of Christ, he then in holy emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation emboldned himselfe, and his conscience preached, <hi>Tu non poteris,</hi>

      </note>
      <hi>quod isti, &amp; istae?</hi> Canst not thou doe as much as these, and these? and in another place; <hi>Surgunt indocti &amp; Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum rapiūt, &amp;c.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. <hi>8.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>An quia praecesserunt pudet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui, &amp; non pudet nec sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem sequi?</hi> The ignorant rise vp, and lay violent handes vpon the Kingdome
<pb facs="6"/> of Heauen. Because they went before, art thou asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to follow; or rather, art thou not ashamed not to doe so much as followe? The firme resolution of them, which were most likely to faint, added such vigour, and constancy to this Saints endeuours, that though hee came the latest, yet he went the furthest in Christianity. I knowe, I feele my owne frailty and imperfection, and yet trusting to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and mercy of my God, I haue set my rest to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise these published purposes and Resolutions. It is my hope that my boldnesse will
<pb facs="6"/> encourage others not to thinke the way hard, or the iourney troublesome, being vndertakē by so mipotent a trauailer. I haue not in the prescribing of my intended course affected curiositie, but proceeded in a naturall and free straine, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which then came into my minde, did seeme to lead me. I expect not, I desire not popular applause. If I finde in perusing my worke the infirmities of holy Iob, that I handle a good matter ill, I reioyce in it, not because I handle it ill, but because the matter is good: and I had rather with
<pb facs="7"/> that godly Father betray my ignorance, in imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discoursing vppon a good subiect, then shew wit and learning with his three no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friends, in maintaining any argument of a differing Mold.</p>
