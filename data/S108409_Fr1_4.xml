                 <title>An appeal to the Parliament; or Sions plea against the prelacie : The summe whereoff is delivered in a decade of positions. In the handling vvhereoff, the Lord Bishops, and their appurtenances are manifestlie proved, both by divine and humane lawes, to be intruders vpon the priviledges of Christ, of the King, and of the common-vveal: and therefore vpon good evidence given, she hartelie desireth a iudgement and execution</title>

   <p>If ever soundnesse of minde, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere uprightnesse of heart were to be manifested for the Lord; now is the time especially, because this is the <hi>adulterous,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Marc.</hi> 8.38.</note> &amp; <hi>sinfull generation,</hi> that the Spirit speaketh off; which is come to such a hight of impiety, iniquity, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanesse, that by sinne it stareth heaven in the face, &amp; dasheth Gods people out of countenance, that they may be ashamed of the Gospell: we doe not reade of greater persecution, higher indignitie and indemnitie done upon Gods people, in any nation professing the gospell, than in this our Iland; especially since the death of Queene Elizabeth; witnesse, the silencing, fining, excommunicating, and casting out of the Ministerie; yea the pining of some of them, and sundry good people to death, whose blood we must know cryeth yet for revenge; for <hi>precious in the sight of the Lord, is the death of his Saincts:</hi> yea in some measure we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready payed for it; for how much Britan-blood hath the Lord sould for no price, within this ten yeares? and what for all our paines, meanes and losses, but the highest dishonour that could be thought on? yea who
<pb facs="7"/> knowes yet what a deep <hi>Aceldama,</hi> or field of blood, our Land may be, if that blood be not expiated; but who is the main Impulsive cause of these evills of sinne, and judgement? Even those <hi>men of bloods,</hi> the Prelacie, as we have proved, whose dignitie (as the late King hath it in the preface of his Basilicon) <hi>smelleth vildlie of Popelike pride;</hi> yea they are a main part of him; <hi>bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh.</hi> Against this Hierarchie we do not commence, but renew our suite, for the recovery of the <hi>Keyes</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>veyle</hi> of his <hi>spouse:</hi> In the prosecution whereoff we intreat the help of all that love the Lord: First agree with God, by reforming at home; and then looke upon them, as they are clearly convinced, to be enemies to God, and the State; and so <hi>hate them with a perfect hatred; be not ashamed of Christ and his Word;</hi> that is, of standing for the Priviledges of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, no, not among an <hi>adulterous &amp; sinfull generation;</hi> that is, when Christ <hi>enemies</hi> are in their <hi>ruff,</hi> left Christ be ashamed of you. As for their swelling pride, feare it not. There are <hi>more with vs, then against vs:</hi> yea it is enough, that the <hi>Lord of Hostes</hi> is against them.</p>
   <p>We may say truely of them, as an ancient said of the Prelates of his time: <hi>Omnibus terrori, amantur à nullo:</hi> they are a terror to all, and loved by none, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by such as stand too nigh them in a contiguitie of profitt, Poperie, or Prophanes; these indeed cannot see; because they will not see.</p>
   <pb facs="7"/>
   <p>As for their traditions, whereby they support them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they are branches of the same root, condemned by the Word, Councils, Fathers; by all ancient, and modern, Orthodox writers: yea, and by the Positions of the Papists. But it is enough, (as D. Whittaker ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth): <hi>quod à Christo damnantur:</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Controv.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 48.</note> that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Christ. The matter is of no lesse weight then the <hi>Kingdome of Christ;</hi> in the suppressing, or advancing whereoff, standeth the ruine, or reviuing of our Kingdomes: and therefore we commend it to your serious consideration: we have endevoured to clear Christs title, and the trueth of the Positions from the <hi>Word</hi> especiallie; as for other testimonies, let them have their owne weight: by that <hi>Intire word,</hi> as the Psalmist speaketh, and for it, we doe contend, Ps. 19.8. For it hath in it self <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, Luc. 1.4. That infallible certaintie, which is <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, by divine inspiration, and onely of it self to be beleeved: Though in regard of our danger we have used freedome of speech, we neither hate their persons, nor envie their pomp, but we wish their con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>sion, and safetie of the State.</p>
   <p>If in stead of entertaynment, or of a legall tryall they turne againe, to teare this treatise, and trouble the maintayners of it, let them take heed, for by this trueth heer maintayned, they shall one day be judged: if they should also go about, to incense the Kings Majestie with a prejudicate opinion of this juste APPEAL, we hope it
<pb facs="8"/> shall plead for it self (our infirmities excused.) That in uprightnesse of conscience we could not doe him better service: yea we are confident, if all that love the Lord (especiallie men of place) will do their part, we shall have our King, as an <hi>Angell of God</hi> in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: though Rome must fall by the sword, yet the word must both instruct Princes, that <hi>Babell</hi> cā no other<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wise be healed, &amp; also in arm them for her ruine. We thought the volume should have been farre lesser then it is; and therefore me made no chapters, nor Index; but considering the subject, it required both longer time, and a greater volume; An other edition may come forth in better order. Censure not a part, before ye have perused the whole, because diverse parts of the same matter, have their diverse places in severall <hi>Positions.</hi> Part not with a good title, though it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered. Labour hard, by prayer, and practise, that God may have his honour; the King his right; and the Enemies of both their defert; and the <hi>Lord will dwell among vs.</hi> It is not our intent in this treatise, to dispute at large every particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and proved; for the subject would not suffer it; the volume would have beene too large; and the trueth of diverse particulars, is alreadie vendicated by whole volumes, from all gainsayers: But if any lift to be contentions in contradicting any point asserted, and proved, either directlie, or by consequence; we shall be readie at all times by Gods assistance further to make it good.</p>
