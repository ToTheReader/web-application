   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Adies and Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
so it is, that hauing
passed some partes of
the world, &amp; beholding
the stately pallaces of
diuers princes, after my
returne into my natiue country, finding
the contemplatiue life, the most neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Angelicall nature, and no contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō
so comfortable as the mercies of god,
the first fruicts whereof, and the neuer
ending Glory of the same, are no where
so apparant as in the historie of the holy
scriptures: where looking into the court
of heauen, I finde the world but a base
corner, when the King of Kinges, with
the brightnesse of his glorie doth rauish
the soules of his beeloued: and reading
in this diuine historie of the excellencie
of Gods loue, and emong many of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
of some women in his especiall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
I could not but acquaint your good
mindes, with the memory of their names,
<pb facs="4"/>
&amp; such matter touching them as you may
and will (I hope) applie to your comfort,
I finde them blessed for their faith, and
beeloued for their humility, two Iewels
of the soule, not cōmon to our humaine
nature, but as it is incorporated to christ,
but I will leaue the imperfect to Gods
amendment, the faithfull to his blessing,
and the elected to his loue: beeseeching
him so to blesse you with his grace, in
the feeling of his loue, that in praier to
his mercy, yee may all liue to his glory,
that hauing Christ for your loue, ye may
liue in ioy for euer: and so wishing you
happinesse on earth, &amp; heauen hereafter:
I rest in praier for yee &amp; all faithfull in
Christ Iesu: as I finde cause.</p>
