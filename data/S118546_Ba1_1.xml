      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ee, Christian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how in the worst times they were prepared to die, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to God: if the ancient books did not proclaime this truth, some would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue but that they had been made in this latter time. But seeing the truth cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, I desire thee with me to obserue these few collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons arising out of due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the premisses.</p>
   <p n="1">
      <pb facs="66"/>1. Heere is answere to that great question, how our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were saued, euen by the same faith as we are at this day.</p>
   <p n="2">2. How truly <hi>Christ</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his promise, namely, that the gates of hell should not preuaile against the true faith, for so we see that in the vilest times this Faith hath beene preserued.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Obserue how here is no touch, nor once mention of Purgatory, nor of any thing to be done for their good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life.</p>
   <p n="4">4. Here is no relation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pardons or indulgences from the Pope.</p>
   <p n="5">5. Here is no necessity laid
<pb facs="66"/> downe of sending for a Priest to bring his Hoste, and his Pix, and his holy water, and his Taper: These matters, it seemes, are rather comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; pressed vpon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the Romish Cleargie▪ then much regarded by the wiser, and godlier sort of our forefathers: neither are they commanded to stay till the Priest come, but (saith the booke) let these prayers bee said, and the Commendation of his soule, by one of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers.</p>
   <p>Lastly, let it bee obserued, that in all these prayers and commendations, and questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (and these saith the booke are all that be of necessity to
<pb facs="67"/> be said) here is not one smack of Popish idolarry, or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</p>
   <p>In these respects I haue thought it no needlesse la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to communicate these to thee (deere brother,) I know there be store of godly prayers and meditations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready extant. But these are of a special vse more then others and are venerable for their antiquity. And are to be the more welcome, because God preserued thē in the hands of our very enemies. And thogh they were mingled with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things not so good, yet<note place="margin">Hieronym. ad Laetum. Grandis prudentiae est aurum in luto quaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</note> let vs know as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> tels vs, that it is no small point of wisdome, to seeke out
<pb facs="67"/> gold out of mire and clay.</p>
   <p>Make vse of these, and helpe mee with thy prayers, and thou shalt shortly (if God permit) bee perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of more.</p>
