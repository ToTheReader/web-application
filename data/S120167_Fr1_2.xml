      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Esides what hath bin added to this Booke, which is apparent, you shal find two faults especialie amended by this impression. One is the confusion of number. For in a praier sometime the person of one, sometime of many praieng was vsed: which thing, in my iudgement, caused some iar. For the auoiding whereof I haue thought it best to amend that fault, and, I trust with the good liking both of the Autor, and as manie as shal reade them, henceforth to vse altogether the plural number in those praiers which are for euery daie of the weeke: albeit the rest are in the singular number, forasmuch as they are praiers for some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al persons.</p>
   <p>The other is the difficultie properlie to applie diuers of those textes of scripture placed in the margins. For manie times the places of Scripture were falselie quoted. But now, how soeuer the Compositor haue set them, if you marke the letters of the Alphabet <hi>a, b, c, d,</hi> &amp;c. vsed both in euerie praier, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, they wil rightlie direct thee to the textes.</p>
   <p>Other things besides these are amended, which are needeles to be vttered in this place.</p>
   <p>Some perhaps wil mislike the applieng of praiers vnto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daies: but for that a better some doe both like wel enough thereof, and laude God for this dailie exercise of their faith prescribed; and also because it is not done (as againe in the table to this booke I protest) to tie thee superstitiouslie to our order, I haue nothing varied from the former and first impression in that point, doubting not but thou canst, and wilt vse this booke to thy profit, and be thankeful, Farewel.</p>
