   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are only two things that are the objects both of Contemplation and of Admiration, that is, the Creator, &amp; the creature: amongst the Creatures onely two, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men; in Man only two parts; the body and soule; in the soule, onely two faculties, the minde and the will; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </gap> the minde, two things onely; GOD <hi>

         </gap> his word:</hi> the Word of God is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold;
<pb facs="3"/>
internall and externall: the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall word is two-fold; spoken and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: the written word hath two parts; the old, and new Testament; the old containeth two, <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh of these two we formerly mentioned, which onely are the obiects of our contemplations; euen the Creator, and the creature: the Creator we know <hi>via negationis, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentiae, &amp; causalitatis?</hi> but we know the creatures, if they be sensible, <hi>Cognitione sensitiua?</hi> if not, <hi>intellectiua:</hi> but proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this life we know not God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Essence, (for how shall we know him, of whome there can not be framed either <hi>Species intelligibiles</hi> or <hi>sensibiles,</hi> seeing that knowledge is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>species;</hi>) yet in part we know him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard we haue some knowledge of his personall and essentiall properties, of his effects and operations.</p>
   <p>Which knowledge is but small, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our finite science cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb facs="3"/>
that infinite Essence. For if a shell cannot contain the Sea, which is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; much lesse can our soules him, that is our Creator. The cause then why the Owle can not behold the Sunne, is in the eies of the Owle, not in the Sunne: so, that we cannot know God perfectly is not in God, who is most perfect, but in vs that are imperfect? <hi>&amp; quidquid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitur, recipitur admodum recipientis, non ad modum recepti.</hi> Then our knowledge is so weake, that wee neither know the first effector, whose essence is most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; neither his first effect (I meane the first matter) whose existence is most impotent.</p>
   <p>Yet a more eminent knowledge of our Maker haue wee than the <hi>Pagans,</hi> who only know him by his works, but we by his words: they by contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we by inspiration: they by sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <hi>Images,</hi> we by his essentiall <hi>Image:</hi> they by painted and carued stones; we by that stone which the builders did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse,
<pb facs="4"/>
which became the head of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which was cut out of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine without hands, which brake all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>heir <hi>Images</hi> to powder, vpon which are seuen eies, euen that tried and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stone, that was laid in <hi>Sion:</hi> by him (I say) in whome the God-head dwels bodily, in whome are hid al the treasures of wisdome and know ledge, haue we the knowledge of our Creator; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom, our science is but igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and our meditations, vexations.</p>
   <p>This is that internal word, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, by whome, and by whose spirit was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and written this externell word contained in the Scripture, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, in the which word, the Creator and the creature is only to be knowne, not only in all, but in euery part thereof, no lesse than the soule is all, in all the body, and all in euery part of the same: so is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in this word. Now this externall word differeth from Christ the internal word of the Father, as in vs the word,
<pb facs="4"/>
which is in our mind, doth differ from that, which is in our mouth and bookes: our internall speech and reason, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in the soule, and of the soule, and is coetaneall with the soule: so is <hi>Christ</hi> begotten in the Father, and of the Father, ard is coeternall with the Father; but the word that is in out mouth and books, is accidental, and the effect of our internall word; so is that word, which is in the Scripture, and in the mouth of Christs seruants acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and the effect of Christ the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall word of the Father; who is both <hi>ratio &amp; oratio patris,</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> is both our soules, <hi>cognitione directa,</hi> doe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand many things that are without the soule, but <hi>cognitione reflexa,</hi> she vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth her selfe, and then, <hi>idem est in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligens &amp; id quod intelligitur;</hi> so God doth know all his creatures, which are but his effects: but in vnderstanding himselfe from all eternitie, he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that knowledge of himselfe, and in
<pb facs="5"/>
himselfe, which is himselfe, euen <hi>Christ▪</hi> his owne wisedome and knowledge.</p>
   <p>Yet there is great relation betweene Christ, Gods internall Word, and the Scripture, his external word, for as none knoweth the Father but by the Sonne, his word internall; so none knoweth the Father &amp; the Son, but by the Scripture, his Word externall. As the internall word was, <hi>Principium essendi,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the creatures; so the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is <hi>Principium cognoscendi,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of knowledge. As nothing did exist before the word internall, so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was spoken before the word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. As by the internall Word the world was created: so by the externall word the world is instructed. As that word was conceiued of the holy Ghost: so this word was inspired by the holy Ghost. As that word was persecuted by the Iewes, and crucified by the Roman <hi>Pilate:</hi> so this word hath beene falsified by the Iewes, and wounded by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Prelate.</hi> As it was held vnlawful for the People to cōuerse with that Word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> so it was held vnlawfull, for the Lay people to conuerse with this word. As the Iewes did more regard their tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than that word; so the Romans doe more regard their vnwritten lies, than this Word. As that Word was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
