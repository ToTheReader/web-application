   <head>TO READERS OF both kinds.</head>
   <p>TO find as many excuses, as curious sences can faults, were to begin a new <hi>Legend Auri,</hi> or a second part of the Booke of Martyrs: a paire of gates, through which, this little <hi>Poem</hi> would not be seene to steale: wherefore, briefly, to helpe what I know is weake, this Paraphrase was first intended for one priuat mans repast, and not for a wedding table; the time when Poesie was lesse, but more belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: Poets fewer, but not so bitter: and Readers in generall, by much, much better affected. Now, since time, impudencie, and other powers, plucks the blush from my cheekes, and that perforce I am prostituted to the racke of your imaginations, stretch me not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my strength, the rather for my confession sake: but considering the daies of this poore <hi>Poems</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, take pittie that he was too soone borne: and out of that clemency, it may be, he wil bring you as much delight, as some other children of his owne yeare: and my selfe shall extoll that in you, which is seldome or neuer found in a multitude: <hi>some Iustice.</hi>
