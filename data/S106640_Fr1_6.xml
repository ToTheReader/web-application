   <head>THE ARGUMENT.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T that time when the States of <hi>Greece</hi> began to grow great, and Philosophie to be thought precious, <hi>Solon</hi> the first light of the Athenian commonswealth, like a provident Bee, gathering honey over many fields, learning knowledge over many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, was sent for by <hi>Croesus</hi> King of Lydia, as famous for his wealth, as the other was for his wisedome. And not so much for any desire the King had to profit by the experience of so profound a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, as to have the report of his (as he thought it) happinesse approved by the testimonie of so renowmed a witnesse. But <hi>Solon</hi> alwayes like himselfe, entring the regall Palace, and seeing the same very gloriously apparrelled, but very incommodiously furnished with Courtiers, more curious to have their bodies deckt with a womanishly affected forme of rayment, and some superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall complements of pretended curtesies, then to have their mindes enriched with the true treasure of inestimable vertue, he had the same altogether in disdaine. Therefore after some conference had with <hi>Croesus</hi> concerning the felicitie of man, his opinion not seconding the Kings expectation, he was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with contempt as one of no understanding. But yet comforted by <hi>Aesop</hi> (Author of the witty fables) who for the time was resident at Courts, and in credit with the King.</p>
   <p>Immediately after the departure of <hi>Solon, Croesus</hi> having two Sounes (whereof the eldest was dumbe, and the other a brave youth) dreamed that the yongest dyed by the wound of a Dart, wherewith being marvellously troubled, he married him to a Gentlewoman named <hi>Caelia,</hi> and for farther disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the suspected, though inevitable destinie, he discharged the using of all such weapons as he had dreamed of. Yet who could cut away the occasion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, from accomplishing that which they had design'd. The spiritfull youth ing long restrain'd from the fields, was invited by some Country-men to the chace of a wilde Bore, yet could very hardly impetrate leave of his loving sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious Father.</p>
   <p>Now in the meane time there arrived at <hi>Sardis</hi> a youth named <hi>Adrastus,</hi> Sonne to the King of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> one no lesse infortunate then valorous, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lost his Mistrisse by a great disaster, and having kill'd his brother by a farre greater, came to <hi>Croesus,</hi> by whom he was courteously entertained, and by the instancy of the King, and the instigation of others against his own will, who feared the frowardnesse of his infectious fortune, he got the custodie of <hi>Atis</hi> (so was the Prince called) whom in time of the sport, thinking to kill the Bore, by a monstrous mishap he killed. After which disastrous accident standing above the dead corps, after the inquiry of the truth, being pardoned by <hi>Croesus,</hi> he punished himselfe by a violent death. There after, <hi>Croesus</hi> sorrowing exceedingly this exceeding misfortune, he was comforted by <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danis,</hi> who laboured to disswade him from his unnecessary journey against the <hi>Persians,</hi> yet he reposing on superstitious, and wrong interpreting responses
<pb facs="6"/>of deceiving Oracles, went against <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who having defeated his forces in the field, and taken himselfe in the Citie, tyed him to a stake to be burned, where by the exclayming divers times on the name of <hi>Solon,</hi> moving the Conquerour to compassion, he was set at libertie, and lamenting the death of his Sonne, and the losse of his kingdome, gives a ground for this present Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie.</p>
