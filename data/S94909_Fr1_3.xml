      <hi>A briefe Admonition to the godlie</hi> Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit (good Christian Reader) this present discourse bee a continuate style, wherein one thing necessarily dependeth vpon an other: and albeit it bee not diuided, and distinguished into Chapters, as the common sorte of bookes published at this day are: notwithstanding I trust that those Marginall notes, which I haue set to the booke, as certeine <hi>Statuae Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiales,</hi> are able, as a skilfull guide, to direct thee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the particular pointes of this booke, as well as if it had bene parted into Chapters. I haue also added for thy comforte, and commoditie, the places, and senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, which the Author had not quoted at all. This booke will (I hope) bee a good staffe, and stay to thy faith amongst these strifes, and contentions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion in these dayes. There is nothing in it but sounde, and sincere doctrine, which wee professe: and a detection of the wandering wayes of the Church of Rome. Bee alwayes thankfull to our good God for restoring to vs his Gospell, which is, and ought to be, the onely ioy of our dayes. If thou doest finde thy faith by this excellent treatise any whit encreased, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, the Author, and the Translatour thinke them selues sufficiently recompensed, and rewarded. See that thou courteously accept their zealous endeuors, &amp; giue all the glorie to God alone, whose name bee blessed for euer, Amen.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>I please all men in all thinges, not seeking mine owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 33.</note>
      <hi>but the profite of many, that they might bee saued.</hi>
