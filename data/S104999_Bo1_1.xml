   <head>The Lord Coke,
the Preface to his Charge
giuen at the Assises houlden
in Norwich, the fourth of
August. 1606.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause I perceiue the time
hath more swiftly passed then
I did expect: my strife and
labour with my selfe, hath bin
in my selfe to abreuiate what
I purpose to speak. And thogh
my speech shall principally bee directed to you of
the Iurie, which are sworne: yet for that I know
the scope and summe of my endeuours are solely
dedicated to Gods glory and my countries pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
benefit, I hope that all my words shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
vnto the generall good of all these here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
vnto whom they are spoken. For I do pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in my course, as it were with a finger to point
<pb facs="5"/>
out those growing and groning euils, which doe
not only for the preset time disturb &amp; hurt our
<hi>Publique Weale,</hi> but doe also striue, and that
with a most dāgerous force to deface, ruin, &amp; vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
subuert the Honors of our auncient name,
&amp; our now Great <hi>Brittaines Monarchie.</hi> But
before the substance of my intended speech re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues
his purposed begining, I think it not amisse
first to begin with my selfe, and of my selfe to
speake thus much.</p>
   <p>There was a certaine young <hi>Romane,</hi> whose
youth so directed his labours, with industrious
care to attaine to knowledge by the reading and
study of good letters, as that the <hi>Senat</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
amongst thēselues determined to make that yong
man a Iudge: therby with honored reputatiō to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōpence
the trauels of his youth, &amp; to giue encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragemēt
vnto other <hi>Romane</hi> Citizens by their
good endeuors to attain vnto like estate &amp; credit
in the gouernment of <hi>Romes Publique Weale.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It happened that shortly after the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō
by the <hi>Consuls</hi> &amp; <hi>Senat</hi> agreed vpō, the yōg
man vpon whō the place of a Iudge should be cōfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
cōming vnto the knowledge therof, fell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sētly
into a deepe cōsideratiō with himselfe about
the force &amp; Office of that worthy place wherunto
<pb facs="5"/>
he should be called. And first cōsidered that in his
owne opiniō, he was most vnfit: sufficitōly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
the subctantiall and somtimes dangerous
(though most cōmended duties) properly belōging
to so great a dignity. For this yong <hi>Roman</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
many Friends, Kinsfolkes, &amp; Allies, some
of thē of such Rancke &amp; Place, in the authority
of gouernmēt, as that their loue or hate could not
aptly draw vnto it selfe a light or triuial respect
(amongst whō) this yoūg man thoght that cōming
to be a <hi>Iudge;</hi> time might vnhappely produce sōe
such occation wherin his sentēce, in the place of
<hi>Iudgemēt</hi> might giue distaste, procure enimies,
loose Friēds &amp; gaine suspect of hatefull partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.
From which corrupt &amp; most impoysoned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
thogh this yong <hi>Roman</hi> did neuer so much
desire, to stand cleared, yet <hi>Iudging</hi> amongst
Friends, &amp; Kinsfolks, he should assuredly (as he
thought) by some detractors, be therof suspected.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Romaine Cittizen</hi> hauing thus vnto
himselfe presented diuers obstricles and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
which could not in his owne sence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
sufficient contradiction, he resolued by no
meanes to take vpō him the Place &amp; person of a
<hi>Iudge:</hi> but did vse all his Friendes and greatest
power of meanees to perswade the <hi>Senate,</hi> to
alter their determination concerning him and to
<pb facs="6"/>
bestow so great an Office on some other, that
might more worthily deserue the same.</p>
   <p>Whilest this young man continued in a discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
passion, with purpose to desire some good
aduice, he goeth vnto a faithfull friend of his,
whom he acquainted with what the Senate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and how loath he was to vndertake so high
an Office as to be a Iudge. His friend vpon hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the cause, presently concluded, that hee had
great reason to shun the execution of such an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
in the discharge whereof, so much danger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.
For (said he) <hi>Caue ne sis Iudex inter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micos</hi>
because <hi>inter Amicos Inditare,</hi> Amōgst
friends to iudge, is a thing nothing more dāgerous.
And therfore he cōstātly aduised, that in any wise
he should refuse such honor, though offered vnto
him: and rather be contented with a meane and
priuat life, then in such a place to be imployed: in
which he should assuredly loose old friends, and
get new enemies.</p>
   <p>This yong man (though thus by his friend ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised,
and in himselfe resolued neuer to take vpō
him any such, as he accounted dangerous digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
yet whē he vnderstood, that the Senat would
not be altered in their purpose, but that by them
the place was decreed vnto him, he then determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="6"/>
with himselfe, to trie the counsell of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
friend, whose Iudgement and Experience
might beare some generall note, in directing the
high affaires to the State belonging. And in this
purpose he went vnto a certain Nobleman, whose
prudent wisdome had oft bin vsed in businesse of
most w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ighty consequence: vnto whom, when he
had laid open his mind, shewed his griefe, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
the Senats pleasure. The noble Gentleman
with pleasant, yet graue alacritie of spirit (sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
with the soundnesse of a learned and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
wisedome) did most powerfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise,
that this young man should cheerfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
so worthy an Office, being so freely bestowed
vpon him. And that he should by no means seeme
to neglect the gracious clemencie of supreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie:
Nor in any sort account it dangerous
amongst friends to iudge: for in the Office and
execution of Iudgement, he that is a Iudge (<hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinet
esse Amicus</hi>) ceaseth to be a friend: for in
the manner of iudgement, no acquaintance, no
griefes, no friends, no remembrance of fore-passed
present, or hope of future friendship must direst
the thoughts of him that is a Iudge. All that on
iudgements seat is done, must be, because Iustice
commaunds the doing thereof, and that with no
<pb facs="7"/>
other affection, but onely because it is just. And
therefore said this Noble Gentleman vnto his
friend, arme thy selfe, in the constancie of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
vprightnes, and be noe longer loath to
execute the Honorable Office of a <hi>Iudge,</hi> but in
thy loue to <hi>Romes Common-wealth,</hi> dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
thy laboures to her publique benifit.</p>
   <p>By the graue and sage aduice of that Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Lord, this yong man was perswaded contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to his former purpose, with humble thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to accept that Office, which the <hi>Senate</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any meanes of his, was pleased freelie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
vpon him: and yet generallie made shewe
as if he ment the contrarie. and soddainlie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
a sumptuous Feast, vnto which he enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all his Friends, Kinsfolke, and familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintance,
seeming that in regard he did rather
choose to leaue his Countrie, then to take vpon
him the Office of a <hi>Iudge:</hi> he had prouided a Bā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
or Feast, to Banquet with his Friendes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his departure: and in some solemne maner
would take leaue of them all. Who being, as they
thought, to this end assembled: did sorrowfully
expect the occation of their griefe, by the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their friend, which when the yong man
perceiued, he spake thus vnto them.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>It is true that I purpose as I must, to take
my leaue of you all, and to be a stranger to my
dearest friends, and nearest Allies: I must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
all former friendships, and my most familiar
Acquaintance, I must accompt as greatest strā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
vnto me; Thus must I depart from you, &amp;
yet continue amongst you, for by the loue, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
&amp; authoritie of the <hi>Senate,</hi> I am appointed
to be a Iudge, and in the seate of Iustice, I must
forget the remembrance of your former friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
and acquaintance, and onely in the person
of a Iudge, with respect to keepe my conscience
cleare, I must with equitie &amp; vprightnes, iustly
administer iustice vnto you all. And this is my
cause, by the loue &amp; fauour of my greatest mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
King <hi>Iames,</hi> in whose royall and gratious
disposition I am, (<hi>Sinè precationè, vel preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi>
without price or request, freely called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this great Office, by the fauour of my King)
Vnto whose seruice, my life, and all I haue is
humbly bound, by him, and by his gratious
Clemency, I am thus sent to bee a <hi>Iudge</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
my Kinlfolkes and familiar friends, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in bosome of my natiue Countrie.</p>
   <p>I must therefore as the young <hi>Romaine</hi> did,
take leaue of all former Acquaintance, &amp; do
<pb facs="8"/>
that which is iust vnto all Estates and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
without partialitie. Which dutie (by
Gods permission and assistance) I will faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performe, so long as God and my King shall
please: that in this place I be employed in the
vprightnesse and equitie of Iudgement, shall
all my performance entirely consist. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
whereof shall (as I hope) neither
be desired nor expected. And thus
much for my selfe.</p>
