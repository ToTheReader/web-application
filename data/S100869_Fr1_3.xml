   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN
READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He extreame libertie, which this
scribling age taketh of writing,
and publishing idle and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
pamphlets, and the double
diligence of Popish Writers in
painting the old and withered
face of their <hi>Iezabel;</hi> not onely
may, but ought to prouoke those that can dee it, to set forth
wholesome things as counter-poysons or preseruatiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the foresaid poysons of manners and doctrine.</p>
   <p>Hereupon I confesse to haue encouraged the translator
of this present Treatise to publish the same in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
into which hee had (and so farre as I can indge
both faithfully and fitly) turned it out of French, that our
countrey-men might see, how the Ministers of other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are assaulted, and do make their iust defence with the
same weapons with which our owne.</p>
   <p>Touching the author of this booke, I may not conceale
that he is a man of singular note, for his learning, grauity,
pietie, and conuersation, and hath so stood in the seruice of
the French Church at Dort in Holland, for the space of
eighteene yeeres to the praise of God.</p>
   <p>Concerning the worke, I will not so much ouervalew
my selfe, or vndervalew it, as to recommend it vpon my
word vnto the Churches of God: for who am I? but sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb facs="4"/>
that the seuerall impressions of it in French, the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating
thereof into the Dutch tongue, and the good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
thereof in the French and Dutch Churches, doe
more then sufficiently commend it vnto all men:
wherefore (good Reader) I leaue it thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
vnto thee, and pray God
to make it profitable to thee,
as it hath bin to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others.</p>
