   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the end (good Reader) thou mayst more cleerly conceaue the Scope of these Writings, I haue thought fit, to giue thee notice of some things, concerning the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vnto the <hi>Nine Poynts,</hi> and of the occasion thereof.</p>
   <p>I suppose, thou hast heard of some Conferences about matters of Religion, which passed between <hi>M. Iohn Fisher</hi> Iesuit on the one side, and <hi>D. Francis White</hi> Minister on the other, for the satisfaction of an Honourable Person that was moued to doubt, whether the Protestant were the true Church. At the second Conference our late Soueraigne King <hi>Iames</hi> being himselfe present, about the conclusion thereof imposed vpon <hi>M. Fisher</hi> a Taske of writing about some Questions of Controuersy, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb facs="18"/>
sent a note contaying <hi>Nine Poynts,</hi> with this title of Superscription: <hi>Some of the Principall Poynts, which with-hold my ioyning vnto the Church of Rome, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept she reforme herselfe, or be able to giue me satisfaction, are these.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This is the true Occasion of <hi>M. Fishers</hi> writing, and the manner in which his Maiesty proposed the sayd <hi>Nine Questions</hi>: whereby thou mayst discouer the falshood of the Occasion pretended by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister <hi>D. White,</hi> to saue his owne credit, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit <hi>M. Fishers</hi> Relation of the Conference. He sayth,<note place="margin">
         <hi>In his Preface to the Reader.</hi>
      </note> his Maiesty <hi>hauing well vnderstood of the Iesuits Cretizing Relation, &amp; of his dispersing hundreds of papers to his owne prayse, and to the disgrace of his Aduersaryes, THERFORE made the proposition of the Nine Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, that,</hi> the Iesuit answering them, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster replying agaynst his Answere, <hi>a publicke testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny might be extant, whereby men might iudge of the suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the one, and insufficiency of the other.</hi> This is a Tale faygned vpon the fingers ends of the Writer thereof. For (besides that the superscription of the <hi>Nine Questions</hi> sheweth, his Maiesty had another intention in proposing them) his Maiesty layd the charge of writing vpon <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> at the second Conference when he had dispersed no papers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the particulars of the first Conference; yea the sayd Relation was not penned, nor the penning thereof begun, when the Note of the <hi>Nine Poynts</hi> was d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>liuered into his hands. So that it is a meere Fable, that his Maiesty iudged the Iesuits Relation of the Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rences to be Cretizing and false, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore charged him with the obligation of writing.</p>
   <p>And in my Iudgment the Minister is not aduised
<pb facs="18"/>
in confessing, that according to <hi>M. Fishers</hi> Relation, his carriage in the Conference was most shameful, <hi>That a Schoole-boy of thirteen yeares old,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Preface to the Reader.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>could not haue been more vnskillful, and childish.</hi> This Confession, (I say) cannot but be a stayne to his Cause &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the Iudgement of most men, the foresayd Relation being of such Credit, and in substance so exactly true, as none of the Honourable Audience disclaymed from it; yea, which is more, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Counter-narration ready and prepared, as he sayth, for the print, durst neuer appeare agaynst it. Whereof no doubt the reason is, for that he saw that his printed narration must eyther be notoriously false, with dāger to be proclaymed a falsifyer by the Honourable Audience, or else in substance agree with <hi>M. Fishers,</hi> which he doth acknowledge to be so much to his discredit.</p>
   <p>Agayne, the Minister (which was the cause <hi>M. Fisher</hi> published his Relation) had by word of mouth vttered vaunting reportes of his owne victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, and of his putting <hi>M. Fisher</hi> to a <hi>Non-plus,</hi> by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments he neuer proposed; yea concerning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersyes that were not touched. In his printed Narration, these triumphant arguments could ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue been well omitted, nor hamsomely set downe. If he should haue omitted thē, his Credents would haue been scandalized, perceauing he doth delude them by verball Reports which he dares not vtter in print. If he should haue set them downe, the Honourable Audience would haue been offended to see the Cause (as they suppose) of Truth, mantay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by such exorbitant Falshood.</p>
   <p>This is the true Reason he is so silent in print
<pb facs="19"/>
about the particulars of the Conferēces, only doing his endeauour to disgrace the Iesuit in generall tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes saying, <hi>That he vanished away from before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty with foyle and disgrace, his Maiesty telling him, he neuer heard a Verier</hi>
      <note n="(*)" place="margin">Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a <hi>Foole</hi> or <hi>Asse.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A report so false, as the Minister contradicts the same himselfe elsewhere, writing to the contrary,<note place="margin">
         <hi>In his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face towards the end: and Reply to the Iesuits Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face initio.</hi>
      </note> That, <hi>by the second Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence his Maiesty obserued, that the Aduersary was cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and subtill in eluding Arguments.</hi> For what more opposite to the <hi>Veriest Asse, or Foole, then one cunning and subtill</hi>? If his Maiesty obserued by that Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that the Iesuit was <hi>cunning, subtill,</hi> acute in answering, how could he say of him, <hi>I neuer heard a Verier Asse?</hi> Thus men implicate themselues, that speake what they would haue belieued, without care of Truth. But in defence of the Relation, I need say no more, there being extant an Apology for the same in print.</p>
   <p>Now concerning the Answere it selfe to the <hi>Nine Poynts, M. Fisher</hi> hauing receaued the note, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently addressed himselfe to comply with his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styes Cōmand, being encouraged thereunto by the Title, shewing his Maiestyes desire of ioyning vnto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> could he be satisfyed about some Poynts. And as he imployed therein his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test strength, so likewise he was carefull to vse the expeditiō that was required, atchieuing the Worke in lesse then a moneth, though the same was not so soone deliuered into his Maiestyes hands. This expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was likewise the cause, that he did omit the discussion of the <hi>Ninth Poynt, About the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to depose Kings.</hi> For being bound by the Cōmand of his Generall, giuen to the whole Order, not to
<pb facs="19"/>
publish any thing of that Argument, without sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the same first to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be reuiewed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, his Answere to that Poynt could not haue been performed without very longe expectation &amp; delay. And he was the more bold to pretermit that Controuersy, in regard that sundry whole Treatises about the same, written by Iesuits and others, both Secular &amp; Religions, had been lately printed: These Authours so fresh and new, he was sure were not vnknowne to his Maiesty, nor was it needfull that any thinge should be added. Also knowing that commonly Kings be not so willing to heare the proofes of Coerciue Authority ouer them, be the same neuer so certayne, he iudged by this omission, the rest of his Treatise might be more gratefull, and find in his Maiestyes breast lesse disaffection &amp; resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance agaynst the Doctrine thereof. Nor could he thinke, that his Iudicious Maiesty, being persuaded of the other eight Points, would haue been stayd from ioyning vnto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Nynth, <hi>Of the Popes Authority ouer Kings</hi>; the Doctrine of the Protestant Church about the Authority of the people, and of the Cōmon wealth in such cases, being farre more disgracefull &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. And this forbearance is not,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Reply pag.</hi> 571.</note> as the Minister obiects, against the resolution of a constant Deuine, or <hi>S. Bernards</hi> rule, <hi>Melius est, vt scandalum oriatur, quàm vt veritas relinquatur.</hi> It is indeed, <hi>better that scandall arise, then Diuine Verity be forsaken,</hi> by the deniall thereof, or by not professing our Conscience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Reply vnto the Iesuits Preface ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</hi>
      </note> when we are iuridically examined by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; wherein euen the Minister giueth testimony that the Iesuit was not defectiue, but did fully and
<pb facs="20"/>
cleerely declare his Fayth about the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, his Maiesty telling him, <hi>he liked him the better,</hi> in respect of his playnesse. This notwithstanding, there is no man of Learning &amp; Discretion, but will acknowledge, that <hi>a Constant Deuine</hi> may put off the Scholasticke Tractatiō of some Poynt of Fayth that is lesse pleasing, vntill the Auditours, by being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of Articles that do lesse distast, be made more capable of the truth, towardes which by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection they are not so prone.</p>
   <p>The other articles are largely discussed, and as exactly as shortnes of tyme ioyned with penury of Bookes would permit. They be according to the <hi>Note,</hi> but Eight, yet some of them contayne diuers branches, and so all togeather they amount to the number of fourteene: to wit, 1. <hi>The worship of Images.</hi> 2. <hi>The worship of the holy Crosse &amp; Reliques.</hi> 3. <hi>That Saynts &amp; Angells heare our prayers.</hi> 4. <hi>That they are to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with honour super-humane, or more then Ciuill.</hi> 5. <hi>That we may &amp; ought to inuocate thē.</hi> 6. <hi>That Repetitions of Prayers in a fixed number is pious.</hi> 7. <hi>The Liturgy lawful in a language not vulgarly knowne.</hi> 8. <hi>The Reall Presence of Christs body vnto the corporall mouth.</hi> 9. <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</hi> 10. <hi>Merit.</hi> 11. <hi>Workes of Supererogation.</hi> 12. <hi>The remaynder of temporall payne after the guilt of Sinne.</hi> 13. <hi>That holy men by Diuine grace may for the same make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensant, yea superabundant Satisfaction.</hi> 14. <hi>That super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant Sati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>factions may be applyed vnto others by the Communion of Saynts.</hi> Before these is prefixed the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Controuersy of the <hi>Church; That men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be resolued what doctrines are the Apostles, but by the Tradition and Authority of the Church</hi>; About the <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency &amp; perspicuity of the Scripture</hi>; About <hi>the Churches
<pb facs="20"/>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>isible Vnity, Vniuersality, Holynes, Succession from the Apostles</hi>; That the Roman, <hi>is the visible Catholicke Church whose Tradition is to be followed.</hi> So that in this Treatise a Summe of all the chiefest Cōtrouersies of this Age is contayned.</p>
   <p>Concerning the manner of hādling these Points, the Minister graunting the Iesuite sheweth himselfe <hi>well verst in Controuersy,</hi> addeth,<note place="margin">
         <hi>In his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>he is deficient of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine proofe in euery Article, and farre more specious in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluding our Arguments, then happy in confirming his owne.</hi> What reason he may haue to giue this cēsure of the Treatise I do not see, but only that he would say something agaynst it, and no better exception oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred: otherwise it is cleere, that in euery Article the Answerer vrgeth not only the Tradition of the Church, not only the consent of Fathers, but also sundry Texts and Testimonyes of Scripture. And he doth not only (which is the Ministers tricke) score Bookes, Chapters, Verses, without so much as citing the wordes, nor only doth he produce the wordes of the Text, but also refuteth the Protestant Answeres, by the rules of interpretation themselues commend, by recourse vnto the Originalls; by the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Texts, Antecedent, and Consequent; by the drift and scope of the discourse; by Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of other places, specially by the expresse Letter and proper sense of Gods word. He sheweth that Protestants pretending to appeale vnto Scripture, interpreted from within it selfe, as vnto the supreme Iudge, in very truth appeale from the expresse sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of diuine Scripture vnto the figuratiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of their humane conceyte. For in euery Point of these Controuersyes, they are proued to
<pb facs="21"/>
leaue the litterall sense of some Text of Scripture, without euident warrant from the sayd Scripture so to doe, vpon Arguments at the most probable, vnto which themselues say, <hi>specious Answeres</hi> are made, yea vpon the Arguments that haue neyther substance, nor seemelines, neyther forme, nor <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciosity</hi> in them.</p>
   <p>And this will be more cleerly confirmed by the ensuing Confutation of the Ministers Reply, which agaynst the Answere vnto the <hi>Nine Points</hi> came forth at last after two yeares expectation. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that his Booke being <hi>long before finished, &amp; ready for the print,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>In his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>he stayed that he might cite word by word the sentences of the Authours, quoted in his margent; that so his worke might be more vsefull vnto such as want the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Libraryes.</hi> Which excuse to be false his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents proclayme in innumerable places. I should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke, considering the circumstances of the tyme (if his booke was so longe before ready) that another reason stayed the printing thereof. You may remember, that the Catholickes of <hi>England</hi> by the Clemency of our late Soueraigne during those two yeares had more calme dayes, and a season of some more freedome, then many yeares before they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed. Whereby the mindes of Protestants became more free &amp; vnpartiall, more erected to vnderstand the issue of the Controuersyes betweene them and vs, and lesse vnwilling to see the Catholicke Truth, which now they might with lesse trouble &amp; danger imbrace. Wherfore the Ministers booke not daring to appeare in these sunneshine dayes of more sincere and vnpassionate iudgment, was by him reserued to be published, when the Skye should be darkened
<pb facs="21"/>
with the Cloudes of Persecution, and displeasure, without which protectiō of darkenes it would (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

         <l>Euen as deformed Birds the day-time lye</l>
         <l>Hidden in barnes, in night abroad they flye.</l>
      </q>
For when former amity and peace with Catholicke Princes began to be shaken, when the Parlament was hoat in petitioning for a persecution of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks with vttermost rigour, then presently went the Ministers booke to the presse, and not longe after (when the Decree for Persecution was enacted) came forth secure and ioyfull,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Answere to the Iesuits Preface. In fine.</hi>
      </note> chaunting (as <hi>Syrens</hi> singe in tempests) certayne verses of <hi>Ouid,</hi> extending by his Vote and Suffrage, the Persecution decreed for England, to the Roman Church farre &amp; neere.</p>

   </q>
   <p>And who shall with indifferency reuiew the booke, may find the same had good reason to fly the light, being euery where full of afflictiue Tearmes, and spitefull Inuectiues, which can giue no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tēt, but only to mindes dimmed with the extremest passion of dislike, who take pleasure to read not what may conuince and conuert, but what may grieue and gall the Aduersaryes. Wherein the Iesuit hath some cause to complayne, that his Answere being so moderate and temperate, without any sharpe tearmes agaynst Protestants, still excusing their Errours &amp; Mistakings, by the forwardnes of their Zeale; he hath reason, I say, to grieue, that his Treatise written with such Charity, and Modesty, and this not vpon his owne pleasure, but enforced
<pb facs="22"/>
by his Maiesties Command, could not find in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland a proportionable Reply, tending towardes a calme cleering of the truth, but was set vpon by fierce Reproaches, as if he had been vrged to write for no other end, but that a Minister might haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to disgorge towardes him, and his Religion, the bitternes of his gall.</p>
   <p>It is true, that with these reproachful discourses, the Minister hath mingled matters of substance, that is, all the principall Shifts deuised by others, and which he could deuise himselfe, to giue a shew to his Religion, or to obscure the light and euidence of the Catholicke; which had he set downe learnedly and calmely, without the admixtion of so much ragefull Impertinency, his Booke had been of lesser bulke: Whereby also, one good peece of this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynder</hi> might haue beene spared, to wit, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure prefixed before the same.</p>
   <p>My purpose indeed, was to haue passed ouer his bitter Inuectiues &amp; large impertinencies with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and only haue touched what is really of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: but the request of friends wonne me to the contrary. For they cōsidering, that many be carryed away to their perdition, not by the Ministers lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but by their opinion thereof, thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary I should prefixe a Discouery of his In-side, in the beginning of this <hi>Reioynder,</hi> as he hath placed a faire Picture of his Out-side, with diuers glorious Emblems to his Honour, vpon the front of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. In which prefixed <hi>Censure,</hi> in euery passage thereof matters of substance are handled; yet my principall drift is to make the same a <hi>Picture,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Ministers Ignorance in all sorts of Sciences,
<pb facs="22"/>
&amp; his falsifying of all kinds of Authours is set forth, not with the black Coale of bare verball Accusatiō, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ut with the lightsome and liuely Colours of eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dēt Proofe: which that they may be more indeleble, are oyled with commiseration of his blindnes, and of his deceaued Credents, that on him for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation rely.</p>
   <p>In the <hi>Reioynder,</hi> which is collaterally ioyned with the Text of the Answere vnto the <hi>Nine Poynts,</hi> the matters of substance in the Ministers Reply, that indeed may breed doubt to men not perfectly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are refuted: The difficulty is not dissembled, nor shūned, the same is set downe commonly in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters words, with the whole force &amp; pith thereof summed togeather, the Refutation presently follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not by the sole contradiction of words, but by the oppositiō of reasons. These, as they be ordinarily still <hi>of number,</hi> so I hope the Reader will find them to be likewise <hi>of waight,</hi> that pondering them, and comparing them with the Ministers, in the ballance of vnpartiall iudgment, he will easily see towards whom the doctrine not only of Christian Traditiō, but also of the holy Scripture inclineth.</p>
   <p>If any wonder that this Treatise came forth no sooner the tyme being more then an yeare and a halfe since the Ministers Reply was printed; let him consider, that it was a good while after the printing thereof, before the same came to my hands, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of my absence &amp; great distance from London. The booke is huge and vast, that to read the same attentiuely tyme and disoccupation is required. The Vastnes thereof was likewise the cause the same could not be confuted <hi>Verbatim</hi> (which had been
