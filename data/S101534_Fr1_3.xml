      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the saying of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romane, who going to dye in a valiant manner (according to the accompt which then was made) &amp; being withal desirous, that one of the branches of his House should profit by the sight of that example; <hi>Specta iuue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis &amp;c. in ea enim tempora natus es. qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus firmare animum expedit constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus exemplis.</hi> Behold, O yong man, for thou art borne in such an age, as wherein thy mind hath need to be fortifyed by such examples of constancy as this is. How much more need haue we of pregnant, and excellent examples
<pb facs="7"/>
we who are Christians, and must therefore by answerable to the dignity, and height of that incomparable vocation: and who withall are fallen vpon such a sensuall, corrupt, and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous age as this, wherein well doing is so wonderfully out of fashion. And therefore <hi>Specta iuuenis,</hi> behould, and looke vpon examples, which may help thee both vnto true spirituall fortitude in vndertaking, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming that with is good, and to vncorrupted prudence in discerning, and auoyding that which is ill.</p>
   <p>And howsoeuer it be true, that through the goodnes of God, we haue many other helps which (by our cooperating with his grace) may induce vs much towards the remayning in our duty, or at least returning towards him; as namely the counsaile of vertuous friends, the reading of holy bookes, and the obseruation of Gods vniuersall prouidence; yet I thinke there is none which doth more sweetly insinuate it selfe, and more effectually preuaile with vs, then that of good and fit examples. <hi>Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niùs irritant animum demissa per aures, quàm quae sunt oculis subiecta fidelibus:</hi> The hearing of good aduise is but a dull kind

   <p>I propound to you therfore, towards the making of you with my selfe, a little more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruant of the good will of God, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideratiue of what his grace is accustomed to worke in their harts, who truly, &amp; operatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue him, an example of a venerable, &amp; most holy creature, by sex a woman, but in spirit &amp; strength of mind, more then a man. And I would not go far off for it in respect of tyme, least I should be tould of being vnseasonable, as if so great perfection were not compatible with such an age as this: but I bring it to you of such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

Now these grew to multiply both in so great number and measure as that the foresayd second part, did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards endure a diuision into fiue, so as in all they are six parts, and they make a large vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, full of admirable Conceptions and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions. Which yet because they are so high,
<pb facs="8"/>
and full of Mysteryes, I haue contented my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>elfe with translating only the first, that being all the historicall part of her life, wherein also are diuers sufficient touches of those other, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with many most approued miracles, whereby it pleased God to declare the sanctity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>f this his Seruant.</p>
   <p>The Author whome I named, is also a <hi>Florentine,</hi> a Gentleman of a good house, and of a good estate, but which he is dayly giuing away for Gods sake; and a man of great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation both for his iudgment, his piety, and the good example of his life. Which yet with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ne, is much the more considerable, because I haue vnderstood by some who know him best, that himselfe (for as much as concernes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science) is also gouerned by others of great sanctity, and experience in the way of spirit: and it is well that he is so. For though many do excellently gouerne others, no creature is able to do it sufficiently for himselfe. But as for his own vertue, &amp; valew, it is not a thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nly knowne to men of his owne Citty and Countrey, but to many Gentlemen, and some Noblemen of <hi>England,</hi> and they not only Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, but Protestants.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="9"/>This vertuous Priest, was the Ghostly Father of that holy Woman, and he gouerned her soule (togeather with the whole Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery where she liued) for the space of some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate years before she dyed. And for the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater credit of that which is heere deliuered and to the end that not only no pious Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like may doubt thereof, but that euen no pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Protestant may haue colour to quarrell or so much as question the truth of that which shall be in this booke declared, I will deliue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> some circumstances, which I assure my selfe, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> the iudgment of indifferent, and morall men will serue the turne.</p>
   <p>In the Monastery of <hi>Florence</hi> called <hi>Santa Maria de gli Angioli,</hi> there be three score Religious women, who are though worthy (as worthy as flesh, and bloud may be to receaue euery day the Body of our Blesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Angells, they are admitted not by any impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, or fancy, or particuler iudgment o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> their owne, but by the hand of this Priest
<pb facs="9"/>
whome I haue already described. In whose go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of them, if there be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>y imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is in that he may be thought a little scrupulous, through the great light he hath of the purity &amp; Maiesty of almighty God, on the one side, and the great indecency or rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, which he discouereth in the least sinne on the other. Now the passages of this Saints life, after she entred into the Monastery were verifyed, and that vpon Oath, by these other Religious women that liued with her, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of their spirituall Magistrats, who had authority to take full information thereof.</p>
   <p>Let me further present to your conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, discreet Reader, that at the tyme of taking those Oaths, the Religious were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly put in mind (though they were far from being ignorant therof before) of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an oath, and with how much truth &amp; reuerence they were bound to sweare; &amp; that they must not, for the conuerting, or sauing of the whole world, tell the least officious lye, &amp; especially in matters of this nature; wherin as it was to be an act of Iustice, and Religion, to expresse a truth when they were lawfully called thereunto: so to publish, and authorize an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,
<pb facs="10"/>
truth, was to commit a grieuous sinne. And indeed the Catholique, Apostolique, Roman Church doth so much abhorre all collusion, &amp; fraud in this high kind, as that it denounceth a solemne sentence of most rigorous Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> to be incurred, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that shall publish, or any way cooperate wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly towards a false Miracle.</p>
   <p>Now therfore that such a company of holy women, as I haue heere described, who do otherwise lead a life of so great perfection, and pennance, as is notorious to the world in those parts, being directed in their cōscience by such a Ghostly Father, &amp; being put in mind of their duty towards God, and the world, in so expresse manner, by their other spirituall Gouernours, should in despite of all Religion, and reason, combine, and band themselues to deceaue the world, and damne their owne soules, by auow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing solemne vntruths; and to do all this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene foure walls, and in the middest of perpetuall fastings, praying, haire cloath, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines, and the like, is not only improbable, but impossible. And I shall wonder with what sense, by the Ciuill, or Municipall Law of any Countrey, the oaths of any two honest men, or
<pb facs="10"/>
women, may be admitted to rule the case of mens lands, and liues, and that the oaths of so many persons, and such persons, should be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, in verifying of that which passed vpon their knowledge, and vnder their eyes. So that when this truth is tould you, that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Chapters of this following history, were ratifyed by the subscription, and oaths of these Religious, I assure my selfe that all danger of doubt will be remoued; and to the end that there be no question made, but that they did so subscribe, &amp; sweare, I will heer set down that part of the Authors Preface to the Reader which concerneth the act in law, wherby it is expresly declared.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>To the end, that the truth of what is deliuered in this history, might appear more clearely, the most Reuerend</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sig<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Pietro Nicolini, <hi>Vicar-Generall of</hi> Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>at the instance of the Gouernour of the Monastery, came in person to the same place, togeather with the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the</hi> Archbishoprike, <hi>vpon the 14. day of April, in the yeare of our Lord 1609. where, calling all the Religious of that House into their presence, who had
<pb facs="11"/>
seen with their owne eyes the actions of their Mother</hi> Suor Maria Maddalena, <hi>which are set down in this presēt work, he examined them most particulerly, concerning the truth therof. Which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious women, amounting to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of threescore, who are accustomed euery morning to receaue the Body of our Lord, did affirme, vnder their oaths, that those thinges which are recounted in this life of this seruant of God, are meere, and reall Truth; and many of them, did moreouer say by word of mouth, that they had seene many more particulers, then are written there. Now therefore at the end of euery Chapter of this booke those Religious women who were present, and saw the wonderfull things which therein are seuerally rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, did subscribe the same with their owne hand writing; and so by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of all these Chapters, there is a great booke filled; and in the presence of Monsig<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. the Vicar Generall, and of the Gouernour of the Monastery, and of foure witnesses, there was an authentical
<pb facs="11"/>
Instrument, or Writing, made by Sig<seg rend="sup">r</seg>.</hi> Frosino, <hi>a</hi> Milanese, <hi>Chancellour of the Archbishoprike, which publique Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or writing, togeather with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayd booke, full of subscriptions is kept for eternall memory in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery; and a coppy of them both (being authenticated by the sayd Chancellour) was entred, &amp; is conserued in the Roles of the Archbishopricke of</hi> Florence. <hi>And all this diligence was vsed, to take from any man (that shall read the great and wonderfull thinges that God did worke by this Mother</hi> Suor Maria Maddalena, <hi>his beloued Spouse) the least suspition, or doubt, of the truth therof.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This is contayned in the Authours Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Reader, touching those thinges that passed from the tyme of her entring into the Monastery, which was in the seauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenth yeare of her age, vntill the tyme of her death, which happened in the one and fortith yeare: and for those other that are recounted from her first vse of reason, till she entred into Religion, her Mother, and Seruants, &amp; next kindred, and Ghostly Fathers did certainly, &amp;
<pb facs="12"/>
ionytly, and seuerally auow, that which is heer related, besides that her selfe did confesse them to be true. So that for as much as concernes the matter in fact, the credit of the history be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now settled, as I conceaue it is; I will only in a few words giue an aduice, or two, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reading of this life, whether it fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> into the hands of Catholikes, or Protestants.</p>
   <p>And first let it be layd for a ground, that <hi>mirabilis est Deus in Sanctis suis,</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God is wonderfull in his Saints. God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> wonderfull in all his workes, and wayes, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> he is sayd to be wonderfull, <hi>per excellentiā,</hi> in his Saints, as if in comparison of that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfullnes, the rest of his works were not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull. Heerupon I would have it follow, that in the reading of Saints Liues, men ought t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> carry themselues with great sobriety. Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes must be sober, and not venture to freely vpon the imitation of euery thing, wherof they find an example in the life of Saints, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselues with the knowledg of how litl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> themselues are worth, and with admiration o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> that which is aboue their calling, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Gods grace giuen to them. And for as much as concerneth practise, they must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> himselfe.</p>
   <p>We see that he gouerneth his seruants o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> ordinary condition with great variety, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the seuerall temper of their mindes; some are drawn by health, plenty, estimation, and all kind of prosperity which without sinne may be enioyed; some others againe would be as it were putrifyed by such warmth as that, and are best kept in temper by the contraryes. So also are his Saints (in whom nature is not destroyed, but perfected) conducted by the hand of his admirable prouidence in seueral wayes: some by Comforts, and Rapts &amp; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies of loue and they also are in themselues of very seuerall kinds; for some of them bind all the senses at once, and some leaue them free to some particuler purposes; euen as we see, that naturally it happeneth sometyms in dreames. And in like manner we also find by experience, that some men are mad outright, and others againe are so in some one particuler occasion,
<pb facs="13"/>
and some againe are mad in all, vnles it be only in some one wherein <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hey are of as sound dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course as any other man.</p>
   <p>But it pleaseth God to lead on other Saints by great aridityes, and desolations of spirit: and so he maketh them appeare in the eyes of men to be no more then ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; &amp; others againe he placeth as Lanternes and Beakons, for all the world to behould▪ and take example by, through the supernaturall concourse which it pleaseth his diuine Maiesty to yield of working many, and most vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted miracles in confirmation of their sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or otherwise for the manifestation of his owne greater glory, as it hath been abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seene in the case of <hi>Suor Maria Maddale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> The euidence of whose holynes, and the testimony which it both pleased God to giue vnto it, hath so appeared in the eyes of the world, as that order is come from <hi>Rome</hi> to the Religious where she liued, that they may publiquely expose her Picture in their Church, with the <hi>Voto's</hi> round about it, which are te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonyes of the graces that God hath granted by means of her intercession. Now these things are yielded to so very rarely, and neuer, but
<pb facs="14"/>
after a most rigorous examination of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers (which is taken by a Congregation of Cardinalls, and other learned and prudent, pious men deputed euer for these purposes) as that euen this circumstance alone, doth much aduance our certainty of her sanctity, and this so much the more because it hath beene done within a dozen yeares after her death. A rare example: for the Church walkes on with a foot of lead in such occasions as these, and maks not such hast, but vpon extraordinary induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
   <p>And whensoeuer any particuler is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted, if a man shall deride it, because only it is strang, or superiour to the course of nature, or because it is ridiculous in his opinion, and contrary to those foolish, and false grounds which mās discourse being naturally both lame and blind, hath framed for it selfe to walke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, he may also scoffe at those particulers which are related in the holy Scripture it selfe, <hi>That God condemned all mankind, for one only mans, and womans eating of an apple: That he brought armyes of frogs into Pharo's Court, in despite of al his guardes: That the wedge of the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet
<pb facs="14"/>
leaped instātly vp to the helme, whē it was put into the water: That the sight of a man borne blind, was giuen by meanes of applying durt, and spittle to his eyes: That sicke persons were cured by walking only in another mans shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</hi> These thinges, and many other like to these, are recorded in holy Scripture, and yet no Christian man must presume so much as once to doubt therof. So as the only strangnes or supernaturallnes of any euent, cannot au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize any modest, and wise person to deride it; but may iustly &amp; ought in prudence oblige him to doubt thereof, or rather to deny his assent therto till it be conueniently proued.</p>
   <p>The authority therefore is that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the credit of any supernaturall thing doth depend, whether it be more, or lesse, and not only the meere strangnes of the thing it selfe. And from hence it is, that whatsoeuer is recorded in holy Scripture, how wide soeuer it falleth in respect of our experience, or how far soeuer it ouershooteth in respect of reason, must cheerefully, &amp; vndoubtedly be assented to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it resteth vpon an infallible authority, which is the Reuelation of God, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb facs="15"/>
of his Catholike Church. And such an authority doth declare whatsoeuer thing to be as certainly true, as truth it selfe is true; and that no man may doubt thereof, but vpon the price of being either an Infidell or an Heretike. There is another kind of inferiour authority, standing vpon humane, and morall proofe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited vnder the Oaths of many persons, being eye witnesses, and free from all exception, both concerning the very actions themselues of Saints, and the miraculous works of God shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in honour of them, &amp; by the meanes of their intercession, whereof no man, that hath perfect information of the particulers, can so much as doubt without extreme imprudence, nor once deride without profanenesse.</p>
   <p>But he that deserues to weare that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, will not only laugh at me, translating heere the life of this moderne Saint; but will make as little scruple to laugh at all our Saints Liues, though written by other Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and other most excellent persons, as <hi>S. Bonauenture</hi> writing the life of <hi>S. Francis, S. Bernard</hi> of <hi>S. Malachias, Paulus Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conus</hi> of <hi>S. Gregory, S. Gregory</hi> of <hi>S. Bennet, Possidius</hi> of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
<pb facs="15"/>
Doctour, <hi>S. Hierome</hi> of <hi>S. Paul</hi> the first Eremit, of <hi>S. Hilarion, Malchus,</hi> &amp; a great number of most holy Virgins; <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sianus</hi> of whole troops of ancient Eremits, <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> of <hi>S. Agnes,</hi> and <hi>S. Athanasius</hi> of <hi>S. Anthony,</hi> who all relate miraculous things of those seuerall Saints in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. As little difficulty, I say, will he make to laugh at these, which I heere relate in the person of my Authour, whilest yet whosoeuer he be, he cannot bring the tenth part of that proofe, whereby he would be taken for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sonne, or the heyre of his Fathers land, or that the very name he is knowne by, is his owne; which I will offer to the eye of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man, for all that is affirmed heere concerning this great seruant of God. And that any person either absurdly incredulous, or prophanely blasphemous, may see how little reason he hath in rebelling thus from the laws of human society, and planting his owne either humorous imagination, or impious assertions in place thereof, I will addresse him to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Treatise, <hi>De vtilitate credendi,</hi> written by that Top and Crowne of wits <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> who by a number of most preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb facs="16"/>
reasons, and most palpable experiments, doth demōstrate it to be a point of sottish pride and impertinency, and not of wit or iudgment for men to be euer questioning or doubting, &amp; to admit of nothing which hath passed vnder the testimony of their owne eyes.</p>
   <p>We therefore that are Catholikes shall make no difficulty, to imbrace with a most pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affection the beliefe of this history, and Protestants I hope will find no true cause to doubt thereof. And moreouer if it were but euen out of nouelty, these later, me thinkes, ought to flye vpon this kind of studdy, with great appetite, for as much as concernes the vnderstanding part; because in their owne Communion, they haue in effect none at all of whome they write, and recōmend the liues of Saints: nay I scarce know of any ancient Saints whom yet they will (though extremely against the very appearance of common sense) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to haue beene of their Religion, whose liues they haue written, or in whose honour they haue so much as published any Sermon, which yet they might do, at least for admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or imitation, though they will not do it for Inuocation.

say, that will not tremble to compare himselfe to such a patterne of perfection as this is?

the producing of such acts in a false Religion, whereby the iudgment of men may be intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and abused.

   <p>O wretched, and thrice miserable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that <hi>Suor Maria Maddalena</hi> was, if the way of pennance, mortification, and most voluntary suffering, both exteriour, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, be not the true and only way to heauen▪ How many painefull disciplines, rude haire-cloaths, hungry meales, sad nights, bitter sighs and salt teares, did she with a noble &amp; fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hart endure, send forth, and shed? And all in vaine, if it should be true which Protestants affirme, that fayth only iustifyeth, that Christ hath so suffered for vs all, as that we are not bound in our bodyes to suffer with him, that these voluntary afflictions are no better then superstitions, and that any satisfaction which we pretend to make to God (though we protest we can make none but by vertue of his grace in
<pb facs="19"/>
Christ) are no lesse then so many derogations to the infinite valew of his sacred Passion. But on the other side, O happy, and a thousand tymes happy, is that excellent soule of hers, if it be both true, and euident, that the way to heauen is narrow, and few there are that find it; and if that of liberty be a wide, and open way, by which men runne with ease vpon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; if heauen be such a thing as will not be gotten by one that seekes it, <hi>tamquam aliud agens,</hi> and much lesse, <hi>in contrarium ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> but he must be carefull, and studious, &amp; laborious, and earnest, and ardent, and euen violent in the attayning thereof: <hi>Et violenti rapiunt illud.</hi>

   <p>This was euer true since the fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and hath much more byn euident, since the Redemption of Mankind was wrought by Christ our Sauiour, through the mystery of the Crosse, yea and through all the actions, and passions, of his most sacred life.

      </gap> assistance, and by his example, by fasting, &amp; praying, and retyring, and mortifying, and submitting our selues to affronts, and corporal paynes, for the satisfaction of Gods iustice due to former sinnes, and that afterwardes neither sensuality, nor ambition, nor any other passion may dishonour, and defloure our soules.

   <p>When any speach is vsed to them by vs, concerning fasting, they tell vs out of the Scripture, <hi>that those things defile not the man that enter in, but those others that issue out of man:</hi> when we speake to them of other pennances, they aske vs still out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Who commaunded these thinges at our hands?</hi> And when we yet come further to such particulers, as carry with them any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary maceration of the body by hayre-cloathes, or the drawing of a little bloud by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines, or the taming of a mans selfe by long watches, and the like, they stuffe our eares, &amp; they would stop our mouthes, with speach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those false Prophets, who are sayd in holy Scripture, <hi>to haue launced, and woū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themselues with kniues:</hi> and others, <hi>that sacrificed their sonnes, &amp; daughters to the Diuell.</hi>

   <p>It were well if once they would begin to thinke of what they sayd, and finding that it

      </gap> of these three places, our B.

By this doctrine he discouered their Hypocrisy, and confounded their presumption, but he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse then disallow, either of those fasts to which his Church should haue power to oblige our consciences, or of those others which euery man in his own priuate deuotion, should thinke fit to make, either in contemplation of his loue, or in vnion with his paynes, and pennance.</p>

   <p>And indeed, if we meane to inherit the promises of Christ Iesus our Lord, and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, we must consider, and accept of the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye, which he gaue to his chosen followers, euen when he was going out of this life, which was no better then a bundle of myrrh; for he sayd we should <hi>grieue, &amp; weep,</hi> and <hi>the world, and worldly men should be well at ease, and full of ioy.</hi> And though his word be as

But such wishes or offers will not serue their turnes; for there they must appeare in the eye of the whole world and that with such a cry of lamentation, as none but the vtterers of it are able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.

   <p>And heere I will beseech both all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, who laugh at the Catholike Church, when it is subiect to persecution, and when it speakes of Pennance (and therefore, in their translation of the Bible they do expresse, <hi>poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiam agite,</hi> by the wordes of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> only, and not of <hi>doing pennance,</hi> as if all consisted in the bare affection of the mind without putting the body to any paine at all) and all sensuall Catholiks also, who allow of the name, but care not for the thing which by it is signifyed: I beseech them both, I say, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the sacred bowells of our B.

and (if interest weigh more with them then loue) by the desires they haue of declining that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ake of torment, to ponder well this place of Scripture last alledged; and to see who they be that must perforce take those words into their mouth, at the day of iudgment: that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are to be good Catholikes, who are persecuted, and who haue lead an austere life of pennance, according to the Counsailes of Christ our Sauiour, and the practise of our holy Mother the Church; or whether they be not Protestants, and such as will be Libertines of any other Religion.</p>
   <p>It is euident that Catholikes neuer let it passe their thoughts, that the life of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, or Libertine, was to be accompted a kind of madnes, according to the state of this only world, and the discourse of flesh and bloud, (wherof that place of Scripture speaketh:) for if we square things by this only rule, and that we thinke not of the other better life, there is noe question but they are the only wise &amp; well iudging men; and in conformity of this doth the holy Apostle expresse himselfe, when he sayth, that sinnes are <hi>Prudentia carnis,</hi> The wisedome of the flesh. But Protestants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="32"/>
Libertines, are (without all manner of contradiction) the men that count all other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> fooles, who vndergo any penaltyes for their conscience, and take paines, and inflict punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon themselues, that so by the infinite goodnes of God, they may one day arriue to heauen. For how often do they make themselus merry with the miseryes of other men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride the patcht coats, the pennances and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall labours of our religious orders, &amp; other exemplar Catholikes, who are euer procuring and <hi>working out their saluation, in feare and trembling,</hi> according to the aduice of <hi>S. Peter?</hi> And how much do they congratulate themselues, for hauing so much wit, as to hould such thinges as these for toyes, and to preferre that which they see, and feele, before any thing which they heare, &amp; should beleeue? And therefore since they are the men, who now esteeme, and are ready to begge, such as suffer for their conscience, &amp; addict themselus to pennance, for Idiots; let them take heed, that heerafter they pronounce not vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues that other miserable, and irreuocable sentence of being frantikes.</p>
