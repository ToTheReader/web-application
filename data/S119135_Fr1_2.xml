   <p>And Right worshipfull, I am bould to present unto you this Sermon, preached at Pauls Crosse, because the Authour had so intended, after that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of some Christian friends had prevailed
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
with him to have it published; which Sermon, is intituled <hi>Londons looking back to Ierusalem,</hi> according as God send <hi>Ierusalē to looke to Shilo, what he did unto it, for the wickednes that was in it,</hi> which was his text handled: And what the sinnes of Ierusalem were this sermon doth plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely discover, as pride, fulnes of bread, &amp; idlnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods Ordinances and ministery; And hereby we may be admonished of that generall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward formality in Religion; but where is the life and power, in a holy walking with God? where is the earnest contending for the faith once given unto the Saints?</p>
   <p>God hath advanced your Honour to this place of dignity: stand fast, to that charge, which God and his Maiestie hath put into your hands, to cut off the cords of all prophanesses, and Sabbath brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, &amp;c. And the Lord make you zealous for his glory; to stand fast in that liberty: wherein Christ hath sett you free. Receive this Right Honorable, and Right Worshipfull, as a testimony of his, for your loues to Gods Church, in maintaining so many Preachers at home, and abroad, which drawes the great blessing of God upon you, and the Cittie for the same (as it was his speech on his death bed) receive

it Right Honorable, and Right worshipfull Company of Haberdashers, from whom he received some yearely stipend while he lived, his Lectureship being but smale; Reade it Right Honorable, and Right worshipfull; and the Lord writ it in the tables of every one of your hearts, that you may avoid the iudgements of the wicked, and inioy the blessings prepared for the righteous, &amp; that for the Lord Iesus Christ his sake: to whom be given all honor and glory, now, and for evermore. Amen.</p>
