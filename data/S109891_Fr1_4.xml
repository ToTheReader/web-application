   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>THat at first I made choise of this argument, I haue not as yet repented me for if the Muse haue not much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsed me, it was most worthy to haue found a more worthie Pen then mine owne; for the <hi>Barrons warres,</hi> (omitting the qualitie of those Armes, whereof I haue not heere to speake) were surely as well for their length in continuance, as for their manifold bloodshed, and multitude of horrid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, meet matter for trumpet or tragedy. Therefore, as at first the dignitie of the thing was the motiue of the doing, so the cause of this my second greater labour was the insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient handkung of the first, which though it were more then boldnesse to venter on so noble an argument without leisure, and studie cōpetent, either of which trauell hardly affoords; yet the importunitie of friends made me, contrarie to mine own iudgement, take, vndertakem &amp; publish it, so as the world hath seene; but herein I intend not to be too exact, as if ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it needed too much excuse (knowing, that euen as it was it ought to haue passed for better then some would suffer, who can hardly thinke any thing hath sauour but their own, though neuer so vnsauoury) or as if I should seeme now to haue excelled my selfe, and failing in my hopes, be kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuse. <hi>Grammaticasters</hi> haue quarreled at the title of <hi>Mortimeriados,</hi> as if it had beene a sinne against <hi>Syntaxis</hi> to haue subscribed it in the second case, but not their idle reproofe hath made mee now abstaine from fronting it by the name of <hi>Mortimer</hi> at all, but the same better aduise which hath caused me to alter the whole; and where before
<pb facs="3"/>
the stanza was of seauen lines, wherein there are two cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plets, as in this figure appeareth.
<figure>
</figure>
the often harmonie thereof softned the verse more then the maiesty of the subiect would permit, vnlesse they had all bin Geminels, or couplets. Therefore, (but not without fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the whole frame) I chose <hi>Ariostos</hi> stanza, of all other the most complete and best proportioned, consisting of eight, six interwouen, and a couplet in base.</p>
   <figure>
</figure>
   <p>The Quadrin doth neuer double, or to v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e a word of He raldrie, neuer bringeth forth Gemells. The Quiazain too soone. The Sostin hath Twinnes in the base, but they detaine not the Musicke nor the Cloze (as Musitians terme it) long enough for an Epicke Poeme; The stanza of seauen is touched before; This of eight both holds the tune cleane through to the base of the columne, (which is the couplet, the foote or bottome) and closeth not but with a full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the care, for so long detention.</p>
   <p>Briefely, this sort of stanza hath in it, maiestie, perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and soliditie, resembling the pillar which in Architecture is called the Tuscan, whose shaft is of six diameters, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of two. The other reasons this place will not beare, but generally all stanzas are in my opinion but tyrants and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, when they make inuention they their number, which sometime would otherwise scantle it selfe. A fault that
<pb facs="4"/>
great Maisters in this Art striue to auoide. Concerning the diuision which I vse in this Poeme, I am not ignorant that antiquitie hath vsed to distinguish workes into Bookes, and euery one to beare the number of their order, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>liads,</hi> and <hi>Vlysiads</hi> indeede are distinguished by seuerall letters of the Greeke Alphabet, as all the world kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>wes, and not by the numerall letters onely, which to lot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> are digit, and afterward compound; the Alpha being our vnite, for the Greeks had no figures nor ciphers in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticke. <hi>Virgils Aeneis, Statius Theba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>s, Silius</hi> worke of the Carthaginian warre, <hi>Illyricus Argonau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Vidas Christeis,</hi> are all diuided into books. The Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians vse Cantos, and so our first late great Reformer Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Spenser;</hi> that I assume another name for the sections in this volume, cannot be disgratious nor vnauowable.</p>
   <p>Lastly, if I haue not already exceeded the length of an Epistle, I am to intreats, that he who will (as any man may that will) make himselfe a partie to this of ours, would be pleased to remember that <hi>Spartan</hi> Prince, who being found by certaine Ambassadors playing among his children, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested them to forbeare to censure, till also they had some of their owne. To such I giue as ample power and priuiledge as euer <hi>Ius lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>rorum</hi> coulain <hi>Rome,</hi> crauing backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at their hands by a regrant, the like of that which I impart; for great reason there is, that they should vndergoe the licence which themselues challenge, and suffer that in their fames which they would wrongly put vpon others, according to the most indifferent law of the <hi>Talio.</hi> Fare you well.</p>
