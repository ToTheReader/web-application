      <hi>PETER MOVLIN</hi> his Aduertisement to the READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>VR Lord Iesus being tempted by the Scribes and Pharisees with captious questions, satisfied them by the holy Scriptures. We in the like cause and kinde, are questioned, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. But wee easilie come out, and free our selues by the same meanes. For, we cut off with the sword of the Word these knots of intricate Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wreathed of purpose to entangle mens mindes. A farre off, they seeme <hi>Gardian</hi> knots, but at hand no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Spiders webs, not able to endure the least winde or breath of Truth. They catch nothing but Flies, but light and giddy spirits, carryed away with euery first blast of wordly hopes. Master <hi>Cotton,</hi> a man full of questions, hath proposed them in diuers fashions to sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry sorts of spirits. We haue had our part: For hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing often-times shewed his dexteritie in his subtilly-conceiued, and finely-filed questions, they to whom he hath proposed them, haue brought them vnto me, and desired my answere vnto them. I haue alwaies satisfied them: but he suppressing my Answeres, hath still gone on to make new Questions, pleasing himselfe onely in the Office of an Inquisitor.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>There is good sufficiencie required in making good and fit Demands, but more in giuing them apt Answeres. To moue difficulties, without adding any Answeres or Solutions, is like the Sunne in March, which drawes hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, but dissolues them not. It may be because hee is pearched in so high a place (as to be the Kings <hi>Confessor</hi>) he thinks he may securely spit on euery Passenger with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any returne of such a wrong. Or happily he takes delight to cut out worke for idle joke. But it is easier to tye then vntie a knot. Or it may be that the streame and torrent of his worldly or ciuill affayres do draw his minde some other wayes, and that the interposition of the earth doth ecclipse the clearenesse and brightnesse of his spirit. These are the causes of his silence as farre as I am able to deuine: He then following his questioning course to put impediment to Ministers in their better imployments hath lately put into the hands of some Honourable Personages,<note place="margin">Mounsieur de la Forse.</note> 32. Questions, vnanswerable as he accounts them. I haue readily and speedily answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them; and to returne him double pay, I haue sent him 64. other Demands, to see whether he hath as good dexteritie and facilitie in answering as he hath edge and itch in asking and questioning. He shall much deceiue me, if he make any answere. He should also be the first, that hath vndertaken to doe it. At the least, this profit I shall receiue by it, that if he answere not my Demands, I shall be for euer hereafter freed from answering his: and he shall no longer vaunt (as hee hath often done) that we haue nothing to answere him.</p>
   <p>The Answeres to the 22. and 29. Demands are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and much enlarged.</p>
