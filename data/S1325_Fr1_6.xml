   </head>
   <l>CLear was the shadow of the circling yeare</l>
   <l>In th' embleme of an hooped snake: As clear</l>
   <l>Was th' ancient Mystick's ring to represent</l>
   <l>Heav'ns endlesse motion and time's sweet consent:</l>
   <l>This was that reverend ring did conjugate</l>
   <l>Dame <hi>Vesta</hi> to her starre-enamell'd mate.</l>
   <l>For fear time 's harmony through pause should fail,</l>
   <l>The yearly snake in 's teeth doth bite his tail.</l>
   <l>This was that snake which <hi>Naso's</hi> Muse did strive</l>
   <l>By her enchanting numbers to revive.</l>
   <l>Event o'recame her wish; Her ring complete</l>
   <l>She deck'd with native pearls of rich conceit.</l>
   <l>Curs'd be that <hi>Ibis,</hi> whose devouring maw</l>
   <l>Half of this snake ingorg'd, e're that it saw</l>
   <l>Great <hi>Caesars</hi> face: thrice cursed be that wight</l>
   <l>That half this ring deteins in base despite.</l>
   <l>Perhaps this choler's rash: the Glutton Time</l>
   <l>Himself perhaps did act this cursed crime;</l>
   <l>The cormorant forgot ('t is like) what meat</l>
   <l>Was in his jaws, and so himself did eat.</l>
   <l>Hows'ere it was, this losse (w' are sure) will be</l>
   <l>Cause of great grief to all posteritie.</l>
   <l>They say that snakes divided live: O then</l>
   <l>'T were good if that some nectar-steeped pen</l>
   <l>Would cherish this half-fainting Serpent; so</l>
   <l>This living part might for the whole one go.</l>
   <l>This <hi>Gower</hi> hath done: by whose most sovereign skill</l>
   <l>This snake hath stript his Romane skin; whose quill</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="6"/>Hath bravely cloth'd his back with English silk,</l>
   <l>And fill'd his stinglesse mouth with Muses milk.</l>
   <l>Each Ladie now will Cleopatra prove,</l>
   <l>And yet ne'r hurt her self; each Queen will love</l>
   <l>To feel this serpent in her bosome, yet</l>
   <l>Ne'r shrike, but wear 't as some rare amulet.</l>
   <l>Give me a second <hi>Gower,</hi> who thus can frame</l>
   <l>Th' Years perfect ring; to him the coyest Dame</l>
   <l>Would yield, to such a mate the chastest Muse</l>
   <l>For such a ring to wed would not refuse.</l>
   <l>Cease tedious Allegorie, cease, be plain;</l>
   <l>In brief declare what we by <hi>Gower</hi> do gain.</l>
   <l>Good 's better'd by diffus'd communitie,</l>
   <l>Now Caesar's Calendar may th' Shepherds be.</l>
