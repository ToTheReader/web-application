For if the Romans though Heathens, thought it iniustice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne any particular man at the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of a whole nation, before his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers were present and his defence were heard?

<pb facs="2"/> such a one as better knowerh the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions and customes of the Christians, then King Agrippa did of the Iewes.</p>
   <p>VVherfore seeing that of late Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Bel (a fugitiue once from Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants religion, as he is now from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques) hath not only accused, but also malitiously slādered the vniuersal Catholique cause, in a booke which he hath dedicated to your Maiestie, &amp; termed it the <hi>Dovvnefall of Poperie,</hi> and withal challengeth, dareth, yea adiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth (in which case our B.

   <p>Not long after the Apostolike Seat was settled in Rome, S.

Perer appearing to Sainct Laurence Arch-bishop of Canturbury did seuerly rebuke and scourge him because he would abandon the flocke which I (said S. Peter) cōmitted vnto thee. This miracle is so certaine as some Protestāts confesse it, &amp; though <note place="margin">Gadvvin in the life of S.

   <p>Not long before, when the King had built a Monasterie and Church in honor of S. Peter, where now west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster standeth, S.

   <p>This affection and loue towards England was not proper to S. Peter alone, but descended vnto his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.

   <p>Thus your Maiestie seeth how long,
