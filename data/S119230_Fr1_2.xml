   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>THe Lord hath many wayes to bring the enemies of the
Gospel to the loue thereof. Especially he requireth of
vs the defence of his trueth, and earnest prayer that
such defense may reforme the iudgement and conscience
of the aduersarie. For though there were will and labour
for the trueth on both sides (which is to be wished) yet it is
not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth; but in God
that sheweth mercie. This mercie we must pray at Gods
hand, that our planting and watering may receiue of him
daily and great increases. Therefore, good reader, when
this smal, or any great defense of the trueth cometh to thy
hand, reioyce that the trueth is defended, that error and
vanitie is discouered: but ioyne with that ioye a care to
haue him brought into the waye of saluation, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorantly or wilfully wandreth from the same. Hate
his errors, but in compassion pray for his reformation. Who
knoweth whom and when the Lord will call? Moreouer
when thou seest the diligence and boldnes of the enemies
so great in repayring the ruines of Babylon: pray also that
we marking what wisedome they haue in their generation,
may the rather be prouoked to greater diligence &amp; might
infinishing the walles of Ierusalē. Last of al let vs as manie
as professe the Gospel, bring forth fruites worthie of the
Gospel, least the Papists on the one side, and the godlesse
familie of selfeloue on the otherside preuaile more and
more against the trueth, for a iust punishment of our sinnes
in contemning the Gospel, which by doctrine with disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and by mercie with iustice must be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and bring forth fruite to the
glory of God, and the peace
of his Church for euer.
Amen.</p>
