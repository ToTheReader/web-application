         <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
      </gap> articles &amp; the awnsweres therunto, as also of these late conferences had in the Fleet, being come vnto my hands, I thought no lesse then my dutie to impart vnto thee, &amp; publish to the view of all men: 1. that: the true cawses of these controvercies 2. the BBs dealing with Christs poore ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: 3. and cheifly the truth yt self might the sooner be brought to light &amp; appeare. The cawses of controuersie thow maist herby perceaue to be no light or small matters concerning things indifferent or some fewe trifling ceremonies, (as they haue long labored to make the world beleeue (although euen those least litle trifles being brought into &amp; thrust by way of law vpon the church hauing no warrant in the testament of Christ ought not to be suffred for the space of an howre) but most high &amp; vvaightie are these matters, concerning the whole building of the church: whith is affirmed to be altogether out of order from the verie foundation to the top, &amp; not according to the patterne of Christs testamēt either in the people, ministerie, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, vvorship, gouernment, order, al things out of frame, such as can neither stand before the face of Christ, neither may anie of Gods children ioine vnto vvith promise of salvation. Now the course the BBs &amp; their cleargie haue taken, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue themselues vnto all men to be no such deceitfull vvork men theire building to be no such vvood, hay, stubble, hath not beene to bring their vvorkes to the light, &amp; to submit yt &amp; themselues, to be measured by the golden reed of Gods word, therby iustifying thēselues, conuincing and perswading others: But in stead of this, they first imprison all such as make anie scruple or question of theire doings: yea all such as but speake against them, they shut vp in close pryson, there to continewe vvithout bayle or mainprice, all the daies of theire life, except they submit &amp; recant: Some they cast into most noisome &amp; vile dungeons, without ayre, foode, bedds, or so much as strawe to lye vppon, keeping them from theire vvyues, children, trades labours, to the vtter vndoing &amp; affamishment of them, their
<pb facs="3"/>
wyues, &amp; children; Others they lade, with as manie yrons as they can beare; som others they a while produced to the Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, there indicting them as recusants vppon the Statute made for the Papists; publishing them by theire prynt with priuiledg Anabaptists, Hereticks, Schismaticks, Sectories, Donatists, Conuenticlers, seditious, turbulent; sparsing abrode through all the land certeine Articles of theire owne deuising against them, to bring them into hatred vvith the vvhole land. vvher vnto also they haue not spared theire toungs, in theire pulpits, where euery one of theire priests might forge what opinion he lyst against them, &amp; confute it with the same mouth, in theire name: and all this, vvithout once producing them, to anie chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian triall vvhere they might haue place giuen them, to defend themselues, &amp; produce theire reasons, or once endeuoring to perswade or confute them by anie one place of scripture; Yet not content with all this, they can take no rest in themselues, or thincke theire kingdome safe, vntill they haue deuoured the pray they haue taken, &amp; rydd them out of the way, vvhich vvil not bow downe, &amp; vvorship the Beast, &amp; his image. And he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reunto (hauing no hope to accomplish theire bloudy purpose, by the common law of the land, seing they can finde no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siō against these men, except it be in the law of theire God) they of late contriued this new spanish conference, sending certeine of theire select souldiours vnto them into theire prisons, there by way of conference to fish from them som matter, vvherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon they might accuse them to theire holy fathers the BBs, who theruppon might delyuer them, as conuicts of heresie vnto the secular povvers. But blessed be God, that in these points, hath hevved theire hornes shorter in the beginning of her Ma<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. reigne, not allowing that to be heresie, which they should so pronounce, but what they by the scrip. should so proue: againe no heresie to be capitall or punished by death, but what by the first. 4. Councells, &amp; by the scriptures, was so adiudged: els had they by this, shed more innocent &amp; christian bloud, then euer theire predecessors did in this land before them. But now, as they will at no hand, be drawen vnto this peaceable &amp; chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian triall, to haue these matters decided &amp; iudged, by the word of God; so haue they not gayned that they sought by these theire messengers, who (through the power of God) were intangled in theire owne vvords, not being able to spurne against the pricks, or to get such matter at the hands of these prysoners as they sought: Which, they espying, followed not the sute half so hote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they were inioyned, comming but twice, vvhereas they ought to haue com tvvice euery vveeke, at the least: At which
<pb facs="3"/>
tymes, how they behaued themselues, let such as were present report; and also such as read these conferences iudge, vvhat cause they haue to exclaime, &amp; accuse of heresie &amp;c. such as call them to the testament of Christ, &amp; would haue theire whole Church, &amp; all theire proceedings therin, buylt theruppon. Which course they are so far from receauing, as they open theire mouthes bouldly into a most high blasphemie, against God, &amp; his tabernacle, &amp; them that dwel in the heauen; theire handes they haue armed to violēce, theire feete are swift to shed bloud, seeking by all subtile &amp; indirect meanes to suppresse the truth. Wherfore, so much the more is it the dutye of euery true seruāt of Christ, euen by all meanes to publish the same; vvhich hath caused me at this tyme, to exhibit these things vnto the reading &amp; view of all men; not regarding the blame that I ame like to sustaine at all hands therfore, so som may reape anie good ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: Yet see I not whie anie should iustly be offended vvith this my doing, seing therby no vvrong is don to anie man. As for these prysoners that are named, &amp; had to do in this busines, there is no cause they should be offended, seing they vnder theire owne handes haue made relatiō hereof vnto the Church, &amp; haue (for so doing) the practise of the Apost. Acts. 4. ver. 23. as also of owre late martyres in Q. Maries dayes, in the lyke cases. The credit of these vvrytings, I partly refer to the conscience of the men that vvrote them, as they vvill answere the contrarye before that great Iudg; but cheifly, to the testimonie of the vvitnesses present &amp; to the indifferent consideration of anie man, that vvill compare the arguments &amp; answeres, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent subiect of the discourse. As for the other side, if nothing should be published, vntill theire consent were had, there should neuer anie of these things com to light. But if they thinke themselues iniuryed, let them set downe the particulers vvherin, or, for the further satisfying of all men, let them yet at length condiscend to som christian &amp; free conference, where both sides may haue lyberty to produce theire reasons, a true record of them be kept, by faithfull &amp; indifferent notaries, ech side be allowed to haue a copie therof, &amp; time to consider of vvhat is passed accordingly. Thus might the thruth, sone, &amp; peeceablye be knovven, vvhere the vvord of God may be judg betvvixt them: from vvhich, vvho so departeth, &amp; vvil not be reduced, let him to his vvne perill, vndergoe such censures, &amp; iudgments as are due to his error &amp; syn. Only this is sure; <hi>VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is iustified of all her children.</hi>
