day (that is by all the tyme of our lyfe) shewed vnto vs a glasse or
an examplar, whome we shuld nat onely beholde: but also with

incorporatyng or depely knittyng his paynfull passion vnto thy

vnfaynedly folowyng hym. For so saynt Petre teachethe
vs sayng,<note place="margin">1. Pe. 2. D.</note>
      <hi>Christus passus est pro nobis.</hi> Christ suffred for vs. This
is the fyrst thyng, that we shulde diligently beholde with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde

belongyng to a christian, vnfaynedly and truely to folowe his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours
example. And in these two thynges shall stande the hole
sūme of our purpose and of this treatise, which be necessary to be
ofte remembred vnto the Christian. For if the lyues passions
of holy sayntes and martyrs be recounted to man, to induce hym
into deuotion of herte, to contricion for his synnes, to the loue
of god / despisyng of the world and patient sufferance or bearyng
of tribulations and paynes: how moche more than shuld the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Christ be remembred and preached / whiche is moste holy
of al sayntes ye the sanctifier, of al sayntes, lorde and god ouer al,
<pb facs="4"/>
the iudge of quicke, &amp; the resurrection or reasex of the deed? This
passion (I say) shuld be remembred, that men hearyng it myght
knowe how moche god the father hated synne, for the destruction
wherof: he wold haue the preciouse blode of his moste deare belo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
onely son shed vpon the erthe with moste greuouse tormentes
and woundes, and also that man myght knowe, how moche he lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
mankynde, for whose saluacion he wold gyue his only sonne
to so cruell tormentes &amp; paynfull death. Thyrdly that we should
knowe how preciouse and deare a thyng is the kyngdom of heuen
which he wold nat open and gyue vnto mankynd but by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouse
blode and deth of his naturall sonne Iesu Christe. And
fourthly to declare vnto vs howe moche he soueth and reioyceth
in the penaunce of man for the declaration and example wherof,
he wold his deare byloued sonne to be nayled fast vnto the crosse
and spred abrode on y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same as a boke open wherin we myght rede
and lerne howe to do penaunce. What other thyng do signifie vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
vs, his teares or wepyng / his sorow / his woundes / his armes
spred abrode / and his moste swete and godly wordes: but mociōs
and callynges vnto penaunce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> He hath called vs vnto penaūce by
his worde / by his Euangely / and moste of all by his holy lyfe and
example. Therfore behold and loke vpon this examplar &amp; glasse
loke vpon the face of thy sauiour Christ / and worke accordyngly
to the exemplar that is shewed / to the in the mount of Caluarye.<note place="margin">Psal. 83.</note>
And if this spectacle or glasse ought to be beholden at all tymes:
moche more than it shuld be cōsydered this tyme whā the churche
remembreth the passion of our sauiour Christe that by the consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deryng
therof: our soule myght be excited &amp; moued to gyue than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
to god for it / and also to haue cōpassion in our soule of Christ
crucified. For as almyghty god sayth by his prophet Moises.

a christian. Therfore let vs say in signe and token of compassion
that whiche saynt Bernard sayd in his mournyng. <hi>Quis dabit ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piti
