   <head>Vpon the Life and Death of Master Henry Welby.</head>
   <l>IF miracles and wonders with each Nation,</l>
   <l>Doe strike the People there with admiration?</l>
   <l>If it be so with them, tell me I pray,</l>
   <l>Why wee should not admire as well as they?</l>
   <l>Wee have of late seene miracles in Nature,</l>
   <l>Both for old age, some small, some great in stature;</l>
   <l>I thinke wee gap't and star'd enough at those,</l>
   <l>In which we did our folly much disclose:</l>
   <l>And seeing wee have don't so well before,</l>
   <l>Faith let us wonder now a little more;</l>
   <l>For we that were so perfect at it then,</l>
   <l>Doe know the better how to do't agen:</l>
   <l>And furthermore, 'tis such a strange thing, that</l>
   <l>You cannot blame a Man to wonder at:</l>
   <l>Read, and beleeve it, for indeed 'tis true,</l>
   <l>This Picture here presented to your view,</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="5"/>Doth represent the subject of my verse,</l>
   <l>The manner of his life I will rehearse.</l>
   <l>First, having spent abroad full forty yeares,</l>
   <l>Some for his pleasure, mixt with cares and feares:</l>
   <l>Examaning himselfe, he then retyr'd,</l>
   <l>And spent the remnant that were unexpir'd</l>
   <l>In burning flames of zealous contemplation,</l>
   <l>All for Gods glory, and his owne salvation.</l>
   <l>He bought all sorts of bookes, what ere came forth,</l>
   <l>Onely made use of them of greatest worth:</l>
   <l>If any thing amisse therein he spyed,</l>
   <l>He would be sure to lay that booke aside.</l>
   <l>God had increas'd his Basket, and his store,</l>
   <l>And he thereof gave freely to the poore:</l>
   <l>There was to him no greater recreation,</l>
   <l>Than fasting, praying, reading, meditation:</l>
   <l>He closely kept himselfe from all mens sight,</l>
   <l>On all occasions he his minde would write.</l>
   <l>His life he led, for forty yeares and more,</l>
   <l>Besides the forty spoken of before;</l>
   <l>Full foure and forty yeares; 'twas just so many,</l>
   <l>And in that time was never seene by any.</l>
   <l>His haire was growne, as it is figured here,</l>
   <l>That he much like a Hermite did appeare.</l>
   <l>Though he be dead and gone, yet let his name</l>
   <l>For ever live, with never dying fame.</l>
