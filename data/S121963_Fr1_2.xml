   <head>The Author to the Booke.</head>
   <l>IT is no little Cottage that containes</l>
   <l>Wild wandring youth, or giddy headed brains:</l>
   <l>Their soft downe beds at home or daintie fare</l>
   <l>Contents them not, they loue the open Ayre:</l>
   <l>They among themselues expostul<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">

   <l>Shall we like Snailes, liue in our shel<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> Away,</l>
   <l>To Sea for shame, to Ship, let's goe aboord,</l>
   <l>And see what other Countries can affoord▪</l>
   <l>But being pincht with cold, or parcht with heat,</l>
   <l>Ready to die with thirst, or starue for meat,</l>
   <l>When they grow leane and lowsie, tatterd▪ torne,</l>
   <l>When they be curbd, mockt, scoft, contemnd, forlorne,</l>
   <l>Seeing their folly: then they sigh &amp; cry </l>
   <l>Oh what a happy thing it is to die!</l>
   <l>Euen so my gadding Muse, and running braine,</l>
   <l>Not witting what it was to passe the Maine,</l>
   <l>In a mad humor once, or merry fit,</l>
   <l>Would needs goe wander without feare or wit:</l>
   <l>But being tost in the tempestuous Seas,</l>
   <l>Hauing no friend, no comfort, rest or ease,</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>She vow'd if e're shee set a foote on shore,</l>
   <l>Ne're to see Sea, or once take shipping more.</l>
   <l>Like a drownd Mouse at last to land shee got,</l>
   <l>And being wounded, weake, and full of shot,</l>
   <l>Crept in a corner choosing there to lie,</l>
   <l>(Rather then once Peepe out of doore) and die,</l>
   <l>But yet, alas, within a yeare or twaine,</l>
   <l>Newes came, my Muse must to the Sea againe:</l>
   <l>Shee being full of griefe, and quite dismaid,</l>
   <l>Flies vnto me, and cries to me for aid▪</l>
   <l>But all in vaine for succour did she craue,</l>
   <l>I could not helpe her: then selfe doe, selfe haue.</l>
   <l>I told her plaine my minde, what I thought best,</l>
   <l>To arme her selfe and goe, since shee was prest.</l>
   <l>So to the Sea the second time shee went,</l>
   <l>Against all wind and weather being bent.</l>
   <l>Let Critickes crake and crow, let Roysters raile:</l>
   <l>No storme (said she) shall make me now strike saile</l>
   <l>A little wetting shall not make me shrinke▪</l>
   <l>Ile hoyst vp saile, though I be sure to sinke.</l>
   <l>Then to her tacklings did she stoutly stand</l>
   <l>The second voyage, till shee came to land.</l>
   <l>Good gentle Sirs, let me now beg this boone,</l>
   <l>That she ne're passe the Seas, as she hath done:</l>
   <l>The Seas are dangerous, and the Ocean rough,</l>
   <l>And since that shee hath seruice done enough,</l>
   <l>Now let her rest: seeke not her heart to breake▪</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>She's weather-beaten, old, and springs a leake.</l>
   <l>The Pitcher, be it framed ne're so strong,</l>
   <l>Comes broken home, going to water long,</l>
   <l>Now let her rest: giue her a little breath,</l>
   <l>Presse her no more lest shee be prest to death</l>
   <l>But shee is bound the sixth time to the Seas;</l>
   <l>Shee must not lie at harbour or at ease;</l>
   <l>I cannot for my life her voyage stay:</l>
   <l>Shee's bound, and being bound, shee must obey.</l>
   <l>Farewell, deare Muse, I thought ere this to see</l>
   <l>Thee wearie of the World, or that of thee.</l>
