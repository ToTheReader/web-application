      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL the Arts and Sciences which we know, and vse at this day, are come to the ripenesse and flourishing in which they are, by the encouragement that Noble Spirits haue from time to time afforded vnto such, as haue by nature or education been inclined to the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all study and profession of them; It cannot be denied, but there be too few (of rancke and qualitie) which are pleased to cast a louing, and a gracious eye vpon Arts, and Artists, and loue Arts for the Arts themselues; yet the world, neither in this Kingdome, nor abroad, is as yet so farre degenerated, but it daily yeeldes some supply of such worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as are delighted in some liberall Science, or other; And whilst they please themselues, grace, and confirme the good endeauours of others. In which number your selfe (especially of your place and quality) are one of the chiefe, that euer I knew, both for skill, and loue of this poore, though diuine Science, whereof I am a Professour. Indeede this, and all other Arts haue no enemies, but such as know them not; such as know them, can no more choose but loue them, then their owne eyes, or the light. But for your selfe, it is hard for me to say, whether your skill in this Art, among many other, hath made you loue it so much, or your loue of it made you so skilfull in it: Onely this I am sure of, that when I began to bethinke with my selfe to whom to Dedicate these Songs, I could finde none, to whom they might come more welcome then your selfe; none who was like to entertaine them more willingly, could vnderstand them better, or make more true vse of them. Yours therefore they shall be hereafter, they shall call you Patron, and vnder your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection come abroad, if you will be pleas'd (whereof I assure my selfe) to doe him so much honour to accept of them, which so much honours you, and will alwayes rest at your command</p>
