   <head>AN ELOGIE OF LEWIS THE
eleuenth French King.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>EWIS</hi> of Valois only like vnto him-selfe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to all other Kings, was borne at Bourges, and
presented at the font by <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Alancon; he
past his infancy in the ruines &amp; miseries of France,
and the most sensible afflictions of his father, to
whom there was a part of the Crowne remaining.
At eleuen yeares the greatest of the Realme, abusing the innocency of
his first age, to couer their discontentment and ambition, made him
the head of a faction, which was so vniust, vnnaturall &amp; odious vnto
the French, as it was presently abandoned euen by them that were
the Authors, and lasted but nine months. At fourteene yeares hee
was married to the Princesse of Scotland, at fifteene Generall of a
royall Army into Normandy and Languedoc: At twenty one hee
put all Germany in alarum, tooke Mombeliart, besieged Basill, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
sixe thousand Swisses &amp; ouer-run Alsa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ia. The bayes of this
triumph were all couered with bloud, and soone after with tears, by
the death of the Princesse of Scotland his wife.</p>
   <p>The difficuly which hee felt to submit his yong and boyling hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
to the temper of reason, and his will to that of his father, drew
him from the Court, and intertained him some yeares in Dauphine,
whereas he married <hi>Charlotte</hi> of Sauoy, and made warre against the
Duke of Sauoy his father in law, drawing vnto his seruice some by
promises, others by fauour and presents, but most of all by rigour &amp;
seuerity, oppressing his subiects of Dauphine with vnknowne char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
so as the cyment of his designes was tempered with bloud, sweat
&amp; teares. The King, who was not insensible of Complaints, and wept
by his subiects teares, made it knowne that he did loue his estate bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then his sonne. He came into Dauphine, and at the first glance of
his eyes he dispersed the designes of such as would trouble the order
of nature and the Lawes of the Realme.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Lewis,</hi> desiring rather to trust the enemies of his house then his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
bounty, retires to Bruxelles to Duke <hi>Phillip,</hi> wheras he liued six
yeares with <hi>Charlotte</hi> of Sauoy his wife, and there receiued the first
blessing of his marriage, by the birth of his sonne <hi>Ioachim</hi> of Valois,
who dyed presently. All this time taught him a lesson of patience,
being forced to make a vertue of necessity, learning to be wise in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
<pb facs="6"/>
and constant in aduersity. In the end <hi>Charles</hi> gaue him place
and left him the Realme vnited vnder the obedience of one, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
being expelled, and hauing nothing remaining vnto them but
<hi>Calis.</hi> All the forces of this powerfull house of Bourgondy did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
him vntill hee had the Crowne set vpon his head, which
he tooke at Rhemes. Paris receiued him as it were in triumph, and all
France seemed to reuiue againe at the rising of this Starre.</p>
   <p>The contempt of Princes of the bloud, &amp; the change of officers, the
seueritie in searching out things past, with the oppression of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
were the cause of a league which was made against him betwixt
the Duke of Berry his brother, and the dukes of Burgundy, Brittany,
Calabria, and Bourbon, with the greatest of the realme. A powerfull
and famous faction, which abused the simple, made the wicked mad,
and thrust good men into despaire. The bad successe of the Battell of
Montlehery was not able to shake the constancy and fidelitie of the
subiect. Paris, whose motions had alwaies caused the rest of France
to wauer, held firme, and this great storme fel, and was dispersed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her wals. The greatest Cities of the realme, and the chiefe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
cōtinued constant in their duties, &amp; the interest of priuat men
being contented, the pursute of the publike good was staied. These ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
being vnbound, <hi>Lewis</hi> had good meanes to breake them. The
D. of Normandy is forced to quit Roan, &amp; the D. of Brittaine auoids
the storme by his submission. The duke of Burgundy is troubled with
the mutinies of his subiects, who desirous of innouations &amp; change
did more affect the Earle of Charolois then the Duke of Bourgundy.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Lewis</hi> to be reuenged kindles a fire in his estate, and stirs vp them of
Liege, yet making shew that he desired nothing more then the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of the treaty of Conflans: relying too much vpon his wit and
forces, he ingaged himselfe indiscreetly in Peronne, where the Castle
was in show his lodging, and in effect his prison; he saw himselfe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to arme against his friends, &amp; to receiue a law from him to whom
he thought to giue it. The assembly of the estates at Tours iudge of
the iniury of his promises, and cannot yeeld that Normandy (one of
the goodliest flowers of the crowne of France) should be dismembred:
they declare war against the D. of Bourgundy. The King takes the
towne of S. Quintin, then Amiens, and seeing that the Duke of
Burgundy, in the desolation of his affaires, was prest to giue his
daughter in marriage to the Duke of Guienne, he doth not in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie
imbrace the opportunitie, but is content to haue amazed his
<pb facs="6"/>
enemy, and grants him a truce, during the which he sees, as from the
shore, that cruell tempest of England which ouerthrew the house of
Lancaster, whom he fauoured, &amp; assured the Scepter in that of Yorke,
succoured and supported by the D. of Burgundy. The Duke of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennes
death brake the truce and hopes of peace, and brought all them
to the brinke of death and despaire which had followed his fortune,
who were reduced to such misery, as then the most miserable, hearing
the discourse, found therein consolation and amazement. Many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
were ouerthrowne, and that rich and famous house of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magnac
was full of strange tragedies and reuolutions. The warre,
furiously inhumane, began againe, and the Duke of Bourgundy
armed to reuenge his death vpon innocents. The towne of Nesle
saw heapes of dead carkasses in her streets, and streames of bloud
in her Churches: Beauuais stayed the torrent of his fury, and diuerted
it vpon Normandy.</p>
   <p>The D. of Brittany, although he were gouerned by another head,
considering the danger wherein hee was, submitted himselfe to the
stronger, and seeing the K. at Angiers with an army of 50000. men
came vnto him to demand a peace. The King of Sicily was dispos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>est
of his country of Anjou, beeing forced to retire into Prouence with
griefe to suruiue his Son <hi>Iohn</hi> D. of Calabria &amp; Lorraine, &amp; <hi>Nicholas
Marques</hi> of Ponte his grand-child. Hee doth represent the estate of his
age &amp; house in the deuice which he carried of an old stock which had
no greene sprout to make it liue, it was <hi>Rene</hi> D. of Lorraine, Son to <hi>Yo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
of Anjou his daughter. The Constable, who would diuide his
heart in two to nourish &amp; entertaine the warre, thrust the duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy
into fury &amp; the King into distrust of him, &amp; hauing left the path
of moderation &amp; wisedome, he came vnto the king by that of pride &amp;
distrust, refusing to represent himselfe vnto his maiesty but armed, nor
to speake vnto him but by a barre, &amp; vpon a causey well garded with
soldiers.</p>
   <p>The D. of Burgondy not able to liue idly during this Truce seekes
for worke in Germany, passeth to Treues, propounds to change his
dukes Crowne for a Kings, &amp; is offended with the Emperor for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it: He besiegeth Nuze, and seeing that the crosses, which he had
in his affaires proceeded onely from the King, he perswades the K. of
England to passe the seas, to renew the pretensions of his predecessors,
and to make a fatall combustion of all France. But <hi>Lewis</hi> diuerts this
storme, and makes a bridge of gold for this King to repasse the sea, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="7"/>
him home as wel content with peace as he was come resolute to
war. The King reapt both honor &amp; profit, and by his foresight disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the great designes which were laid vnder fauor of this army,
and although it had diuers pretexts, as diuers branches of the same
stock of sedition and ambition, they were all dangerous; all the kinds
of this poison were mortall.</p>
   <p>The Duke of Bourgundy was forced to accept a peace of the king,
against whom he had proclaimed warre: The coale, which entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the fire of discord was quenched, and this head that made the
windes to blow; which caused the quiet of France to tremble, was
cut off at the Greue.</p>
   <p>The Duke of Bourgundy, to reuenge a light iniury done vnto the
Earle of Romond, vndertakes a great warre against the Sui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>les, which
by the vnfortunate euent of three battels, made him to loose his bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
at Granson; his reputation, his forces and his hopes at Morat;
and at Nancy his life, with a part of his estate. The King reapt the
fruit of this warre, hauing fauoured and supported the Duke of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
against the great designes of this Conqueror. Hee seased vpon
both Burgundies, and vpon a part of Artois, and had forced the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
<hi>Maximilian</hi> to leaue the low countries, and to leade the Princesse
his wife into Germany, with repentance of his mariage, if the battell
of <hi>Guinegaste</hi> had not troubled the face of his affaires, and changed
the designes of warre into resolutions of peace, which was confirmed
by the marriage of <hi>Charles</hi> Dauphin of France with <hi>Margaret</hi> of
Austria.</p>
   <p>Age, which neuer comes alone, suffers not the King to vndertake
any long and difficult conque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s, and binds him to thinke vpon the
meanes to leaue his crowne peaceably vnto his Sonne, as it was rich,
mighty, and more assured then hee had receiued it from his father,
hauing beautified it with many goodly flowers, as <hi>Burgundy, Anjou,
Barre, Prouence,</hi> and the recouerie of the Townes in <hi>Picardy,</hi> and of
some in <hi>Artois.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Being prest with troubles of mind as much as with the languishing
of the body, and reduced to an estate more lamentable then lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in the which he could not liue, &amp; would not dye: he straue foure
whole yeares against the force of an incurable disease, and repulst
by strange meanes the approches of death, to retaine life, which was
but too long for his miseries, and infirmities, as it had beene too short
for his designes and hopes. He was forced to yeeld himselfe to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
<pb facs="7"/>
the 30<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. day of August 1483. the 22<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. yeare of his raigne, and
of his age the sixtith. He carried nothing from the place which hee
left, but the proud title to haue freed the Kings of France from subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or wardship, capable to command, not a Realme only, but the
whole world. He was interred at our Lady of <hi>Clery,</hi> hauing obtained
from Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth an excommunication against all such as
would lay his body in any other tombe then in that which hee had
built for himselfe, and <hi>Charlotte</hi> of Sauoy his wife. He did often visit
this last abode, and did lye in it sōmetimes, that by the meditation of
death, he might descend liuing into the graue.</p>
   <p>The triumphant Chariot of the prosperities of his life was drawn
by Wisdome, Iustice, Liberality and Reputation; wisdome made him
victorious ouer his enemies, Iudge of the controuersie betwixt the
Crownes of Castile, and Nauarre: Protector of the liberty of the
Common-weales of Italy: Arbitrator of the peace betwixt Rome and
Florence, and then betwixt Rome and Venice, He added the county
of Prouence to the Crowne: Hee vndertooke strange impossible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes.
Iustice, alwayes in heat by his extreame seuerity, did more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
put the sword of execution into his hand, then the ballance of
due consideration: hee caused many great men to feele his rigour
whose processe he began by the execution.</p>
   <p>Liberality, opened him the hearts and gates of townes, which hee
battered with his money; caused many which were distracted from
him to come like Bees at the sound of a bason: hee vsed it to bind the
English to his friendship, the Suisses to his succors, and the Brittaines
to his seruice: Reputation hath held all the powers of Europe in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of him, and hath made him to bee redoubted of strangers,
and feared of his Subiects.</p>
   <p>Yet the differences betwixt the priuate and publike fortunes of this
Prince were great; his fortunes were of long Time in fauour amidst
his prosperities: In his raigne, he was a wise, happy King, a good and
a bountifull maister, a distrustfull friend, a cruell enemy, and a terrible
neighbour; in his house a bad son, a bad father, &amp; a bad husband: he
had no children by <hi>Margret Steward</hi> his first wife, and by <hi>Charlotte</hi> of
Sauoy, his second, hee had <hi>Ioachim, Charles, Francis, Anne</hi> and
<hi>Ioane.</hi>
