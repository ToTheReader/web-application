   <lg>
      <l>O High incomprehensible and glorious Maiestie,</l>
      <l>Whose luminous beames obtundeth our specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</l>
      <l>O trinehood in persons ô onehood in deity, t</l>
      <l>Of Iherarchiall Iubilists gratulant glorification,</l>
      <l>O piteous purifier of soules and pure perpetuation,</l>
      <l>O deuiant from danger, ô drawer most debonayre,</l>
      <l>From this troublesome vale of vanitie, ô our Exalter.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>O power, ô wisdome, ô goodnes inexplicable,</l>
      <l>Supporte me, teach me, and be my gouernor,</l>
      <l>That neuer my liuing to thee be displicable,</l>
      <l>But that I acquite me to thee as true professor,</l>
      <l>At this beginning good Lord heare my prayer,</l>
      <l>Be nigh with grace for to inforce my will,</l>
      <l>Graunt witt that I may mine intent fulfill.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Most curious Cofer and copious of all treasure,</l>
      <l>Thou art he from whome all goodnes doth discend,</l>
      <l>To man and also to euery creature,</l>
      <l>Thine handy-work therefore vouchsafe to defend,</l>
      <l>That we no time in liuing here mispend,</l>
      <l>With troth here graunt vs our liuing so to winne,</l>
      <l>That into no danger of sinfulnes we rinne.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And forasumch as we haue for thy sake</l>
      <l>Renounced our wills, the world and fleshly lust,</l>
      <l>As thine owne professors vs to thee take,</l>
      <l>Sith in thee onely dependeth all our trust;</l>
      <l>We can no further; to thee incline we must:</l>
      <l>Thy secret treasure vouchsafe vnto vs,</l>
      <l>Shew vs thy secrets and to vs be bounteous.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="12"/>
      <l>And amongst others which be profest to thee,</l>
      <l>I me present as one with humble submission,</l>
      <l>Thy seruant beseeching that I may bee,</l>
      <l>And true in liuing according to my profession,</l>
      <l>In order Chanon Reguler of <hi>Bridlington</hi>;</l>
      <l>Beseeching thee Lord thou wilt me spare,</l>
      <l>To thy true seruants thy secrets to declare.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>In the beginning when thou mad'st all of nought,</l>
      <l>A globous matter and darke vnder confusion,</l>
      <l>By him the beginning marueilously was wrought,</l>
      <l>Conteyning naturally all things without diuision:</l>
      <l>Of which in six dayes he made cleere distinction:</l>
      <l>As Genesis apertly doth record.</l>
      <l>Then heauen and earth were perfected by his word.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>So through his will and power, out of one mas</l>
      <l>Confused; was made each thing that being is,</l>
      <l>But afore in glory as maker he was,</l>
      <l>Now is and shall be without end I wis,</l>
      <l>And purified soules vp to his blis</l>
      <l>Shall come a principle this may be one,</l>
      <l>For the declaring of our precious stone.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>For as of one masse was made all thing,</l>
      <l>Right so in our practize must it be,</l>
      <l>All our secreats of one Image must spring,</l>
      <l>As in Philosophers bookes whoso list to see,</l>
      <l>Our stone is called the lesse world, one and three;</l>
      <l>Magnesa also of sulphure and Mercurie,</l>
      <l>Proportionate by nature most perfectlie.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="12"/>
      <l>But many one marueileth and maruaile may,</l>
      <l>And museth on such a marueilous thing,</l>
      <l>What is our stone; sith Philosophers say</l>
      <l>To such as euer be it in seeking.</l>
      <l>For foules and fisshes to vs doth it bring,</l>
      <l>Euery man it hath, and it is in euery place,</l>
      <l>In thee in me, and in each thing, time and space?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>To this I answere that <hi>Mercurie</hi> it is I wis,</l>
      <l>But not the common called quicksiluer by name,</l>
      <l>But <hi>Mercurie</hi> without which nothing being is,</l>
      <l>All Philosophers record and truely saine the same,</l>
      <l>But simple searchers putteth them in blame,</l>
      <l>Saying they hid it but they be blame worthy,</l>
      <l>Which be no Clearkes and meddle with Philosophy.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But though it <hi>Mercurie</hi> be, yet wisely vnderstand,</l>
      <l>Wherein it is, and where thou shalt it seech,</l>
      <l>Else I counsell thee take not this work in hand,</l>
      <l>For Philosophers flatter fooles with fayre speech:</l>
      <l>But listen to me, for truly I will thee teach,</l>
      <l>Which is this <hi>Mercurie</hi> most profitable,</l>
      <l>Being to thee nothing deceiueable.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>It is more neere in some things than in some;</l>
      <l>Therefore take heede what I to thee write</l>
      <l>For if knowledge to thee neuer come,</l>
      <l>Therefore yet shalt thou me not twite,</l>
      <l>For I will truely now thee excite</l>
      <l>To vnderstand well <hi>Mercuries</hi> three,</l>
      <l>The keyes which of this science bee.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="13"/>
      <l>
         <hi>Raymond</hi> his menstrues doth them call,</l>
      <l>Without which truly no trueth is done:</l>
      <l>But two of them be superficiall,</l>
      <l>The third essentiall of Sunne and Moone,</l>
      <l>Their properties I will declare right soone,</l>
      <l>And Mercurie of mettalls essentiall,</l>
      <l>Is the principle of our stone materiall.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>In Sunne and Moone our Menstrue is not seene,</l>
      <l>It appeareth not but by effect to sight,</l>
      <l>That is the stone of which we meene,</l>
      <l>Who so our writings conceiueth aright,</l>
      <l>It is a soule, a substance bright.</l>
      <l>Of Sunne and Moone a subtill influence,</l>
      <l>Whereby the earth receiueth resplendence.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>For what is Sunne and Moone sayth <hi>Auicen,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>But earth which is pure white and red:</l>
      <l>Take from it the said cleerenes, and then</l>
      <l>That earth will stand but in little stead;</l>
      <l>The whole compound is called our lead:</l>
      <l>The qualitie of clearenes from Sun and Moone dooth come,</l>
      <l>These are our menstrues both all and some.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Bodies with the first we calcine naturally</l>
      <l>Perfect, but none which been vncleene,</l>
      <l>Except one which is vsually</l>
      <l>Named by Philosophers the Lyon greene:</l>
      <l>He is the meane the Sunne and Moone betweene</l>
      <l>Of winning tincture with perfectnes,</l>
      <l>As <hi>Geber</hi> thereunto beareth witnes.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="13"/>
      <l>With the second which is an humiditie</l>
      <l>Vegitable, reuiuing that earst was dead,</l>
      <l>Both principles materials must loosed be</l>
      <l>And formalls, els stand they little in stead:</l>
      <l>These menstrews therefore know I thee reed,</l>
      <l>Without the which neither true calcination</l>
      <l>Done may be, not true dissolution.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>With the third humiditie most permanent,</l>
      <l>Incombustible and vnctuous in his nature,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Hermes</hi> tree vnto ashes is brent,</l>
      <l>It is our naturall fire most sure,</l>
      <l>Our Mercurie, our Sulphur, our tincture pure,</l>
      <l>Our soule, our stone borne vp with winde</l>
      <l>In the earth ingendred, beare this in minde.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>This stone also tell thee I dare,</l>
      <l>Is the vapour of mettalls potentiall,</l>
      <l>How thou shalt get it, thou must beware,</l>
      <l>For inuisible truely is this menstruall,</l>
      <l>Howbeit with the second water philosophicall,</l>
      <l>By separation of Elements it may appeare</l>
      <l>To sight, in forme of water cleare.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>If this menstrue by labour exuberate</l>
      <l>With it may be made Sulphur of nature,</l>
      <l>If it be well and kindly acuate</l>
      <l>And circulate into a spirit pure,</l>
      <l>Then to dissolue thou must be sure,</l>
      <l>Thy base with it in diuers wise,</l>
      <l>As thou shalt know by thy practise.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="14"/>
      <l>That poynt therefore in his due place,</l>
      <l>I will declare with other moe,</l>
      <l>If God will graunt me grace and space,</l>
      <l>And me preserue in life from woe,</l>
      <l>As I thee teach looke thou doe so:</l>
      <l>And for the first ground principall,</l>
      <l>Vnderstand thy waters menstruall.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And when thou hast made <hi>Calcination,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Encreasing not wasting moysture radicall,</l>
      <l>Vntill thy base by oft subtilation,</l>
      <l>Will lightly flowe as wax vpon mettall,</l>
      <l>Then loose it with thy vegetable menstruall,</l>
      <l>Till thou haue oyle thereof in colour bright,</l>
      <l>Then is that menstrue visible to sight.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And oyle is drawne out in colour of golde,</l>
      <l>Or like thereto out of fine red lead,</l>
      <l>Which <hi>Raymond</hi> sayd when he was olde,</l>
      <l>Much more than golde would stand in stead:</l>
      <l>For when he was for age nigh dead,</l>
      <l>He made thereof <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Which him reuiued as men might see.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>For so together may they be circulate,</l>
      <l>That is the base oyle and the vegetable menstruall,</l>
      <l>So that it be by labour exuberate,</l>
      <l>And made by craft a stone celestiall,</l>
      <l>Of nature so firie that we it call,</l>
      <l>Our <hi>Bazeliske</hi> or our <hi>Cockatrice,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Our great <hi>Elixer</hi> most of price.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="14"/>
      <l>Which as the sight of <hi>Bazeliske</hi> his obiect</l>
      <l>Killeth, so sleyeth it crude <hi>Mercurie,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>When thereupon he is proiect,</l>
      <l>In twinckle of an eye most sodainly,</l>
      <l>That <hi>Mercurie</hi> then teineth permanently,</l>
      <l>All bodies to Sunne and Moone perfect,</l>
      <l>Thus guide thy base both red and white.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>
         <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> thus is made,</l>
      <l>Of golde not commonly calcinate,</l>
      <l>But of our tincture that will not fade,</l>
      <l>Out of our base drawn with the menstrue circulate▪</l>
      <l>But naturall calcination must algate</l>
      <l>Be made, ere thy golde dissolued may bee,</l>
      <l>That principle first therefore I will teach thee.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But into chapters this Treatise I will diuide,</l>
      <l>In number twelue with due recapitulation;</l>
      <l>Superfluous rehearsalls Ile lay aside,</l>
      <l>Intending onely to giue true information,</l>
      <l>Both of theorick and practick operation:</l>
      <l>That by my writing whoso guided will bee,</l>
      <l>Of his intent perfectly speede shall hee.</l>
