      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O commend the Art and Practice of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it were vtterly needlesse, for that it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, that all other Sciences are therein v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as in their conuenient and proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, and grounded on supreme vertue, seeing that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it no Kingdome or Common-weale, can either bee or continue in Peace, or defend it selfe, nor offend their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; it being the powerfull Regent in our Modern <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia:</hi> for that it destroyeth Enemies, depresseth Tyrants, chasteneth Rebels, encreaseth Dominions, and is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon make-peace, and Conseruor of tranquillity in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Common-weales. It consisteth of many ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Theoricall and Practicall parts, wherein Knowledge must be the Pylot of Action, or else the action will proue but sillily simple. The Theorick in this (as in all other Sciences) being the fundamentall ground-worke of the practicke part thereof; Therefore Knowing from Doing, must be no more seperated then Letters from Armes: this made the Hebrew, Egiptian, and Persian Souldiers, to be aswell Priests as Gentlemen; and the Grecians to be both Philosophers and Captaines, and the Romaines to be both Souldiers and Schollers; whereby each of them got for their Nation a world of honour. <hi>M. Diggs</hi> said very well, that it fares in this Art, as in Soldiary, and in

Nauigation; for as many a priuate Souldier, whose braines will only reach how to stand Sentinell, and to March to his Guard, yet takes himselfe to be a perfect Souldier, but if once his wit bee capable to become <hi>Corporall of the field,</hi> or <hi>Sargeant Maior,</hi> then he comes to see his former ignorance and wants. Euen so the Common Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, if he can but say his Compasse, furle a Sayle, and take turne at Helme and Lead, doth lesse know his ignorance, then such a Master or Pilot at hath sayled a ship by his Chart, Compasse and Art, round the world; And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in this Art, many silly Gunners that neuer sounded the deepe Channell of this Art, will not sticke to say, they know enough, and scorne to learne more, when they God knowes vnderstand not the first principles of good Art or practise; but if by chance, or mischance, they made a good shott once, though without vnderstanding of the true cause of it, it must vphold their reputation for euer, and be sufficient to make Fooles proud. This may chance to be returned me home, yet I care not, for I hope to escape the name of a Coward (though my purse be cudgelled) for that I haue taken vp those weapons, that with a challenge were laid downe so long agoe; But let them that are enuious commendor come mend it, and so I end.</p>
