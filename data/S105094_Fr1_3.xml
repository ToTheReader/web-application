   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may seeme straunge (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that I haue chosen in the end of my daies to trauaile, and make discription of Countries: whereas the beginning of my youth (and a long while after) I haue haūted the warres, and written somewhat of Martiall Discipline: but as euery season breedeth a seuerall humour, and the humours of men are diuers: (drawing the mynd to sondrie dispositions) so common occasion that commands the iudgement, hath set me a worke, and the warme good will &amp; affection, borne in breast, towards the worthie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of Wales, hath haled me often forward, to take this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in hand, which many before haue learnedly handled. But yet to shewe a difference in writing, and a playnnesse in speech (because playne people affects no florishing phrase) I haue now in as ample a maner (without borrowed termes) as I could, declared my opinion of that sweete Soyle and good Subiects therof, euen at that very instant, when Wales was almost forgotten, or scarce remembred with any great lawdation, when it hath merited to be written of: for son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie famous causes most meete to be honored, and necessary to be touched in. First, the world will confesse (or els it shall do wrong) that some of our greatest Kings (that haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered much) were borne &amp; bred in that Countrey: which Kings in their times, to the glory of England, haue wrought wonders, &amp; brought great benefites to our weale publicke. Among the same Princes, I pray you giue me leaue to place our good Queene Elizabeth, and pardō me withall to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb facs="6"/>
you to the Chronicles, for the seeking out of her Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors noble actions, and suffer me to shewe a little of the goodnesse, gathered by vs, from her Maiesties well doing, and possessed a long season from her princely and iust dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. An act so noble &amp; notorious, that neither can escape immortall fame, nor shall not passe my pen vnresited.</p>
   <p>Now weigh in what plight was our state when she came first to the Crowne, and see how soone Religion was refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, (a matter of great moment) peace planted, and warres vtterly extinguished, as the sequell yet falleth out.</p>
   <p>Then behold how she succoured the afflicted in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> (let the going to <hi>Newhauen</hi> beare witnesse) and chargeably without breaking of League mainteyned her friends and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed her enemies.</p>
   <p>Then looke into the seruice and preseruation of <hi>Scotland</hi> (at the siege of <hi>Leeth</hi>) and see how finely the French were al shipped away (they being a great power) and sent home in such sort, that neuer since they had mynd to returne thether againe, in that fashion and forme that they sayled towards <hi>Scotland</hi> at the first.</p>
   <p>Then consider how bace our money was, &amp; in what short tyme (with little losse to our Countrey) the bad coyne was conuerted to good siluer: and so is like to continue to the end of the world.</p>
   <p>Then in the aduancing of Gods word and good people, regard how <hi>Rochell</hi> was relieued, and <hi>Rone</hi> and other places foūd cause to pray for her life, who sought to purchase their peace and see them in safetie.</p>
   <p>Then thinke on the care she tooke for <hi>Flaunders,</hi> during the first troubles, and how that Countrey had bene vtterly destroyed, if her Highnes helping hand had not propped vp that tottering State.</p>
   <p>Then Christianly cōceiue how many mul<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>itudes of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers she hath giuen gracious countenance vnto, and hath freely licensed them to liue here in peace and rest.</p>
   <p>Then paise in an equall ballance the daungerous estate of <hi>Scotland</hi> once againe, when the Kings owne Subiects kept
<pb facs="6"/>
the Castle of <hi>Edenbrough</hi> against their owne naturall Lord &amp; Maister: which presumptuous part of Subiects, her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse could not abide to behold: wherevpon she sent a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient power to ayde the Kings Maiestie: which power vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly wonne the Castle, and freely deliuered the same to the right owner thereof, with all the treasure and prisoners therein.</p>
   <p>Then regard how honourably she hath dealt with diuers Princes that came to see her, or needed her magnificēt sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation and countenance.</p>
   <p>Then looke throughly into the mightinesse &amp; managing of all matters gone about and put in exercise princely, and yet peaceably since the day of her Highnesse Coronation, and you shalbe forced to confesse that she surmounts a great number of her Predecessors: and she is not at this day no whit inferiour to the greatest Monarke of the world.</p>
   <p>Is not such a peereles Queene then, a comfort to Wales, a glorie to England, and a great reioysing to all her good neighbours? And doth not she daily deserue to haue bookes dedicated in the highest degree of honor to her Highnesse? Yes vndoubtedly, or els my sences and iudgement fayleth me.</p>
   <p>So (good Reader) do iudge of my labours: my pen is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by a band of causes to write as farre as my knowledge may leade: and my duetie hath no end of seruice, nor no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits are set to a loyall Subiect, but to wish and worke to the vttermost of power.</p>
   <p>Within this worke are seuerall discourses: some of the beautie &amp; blessednes of the Countrey: some of the strength and statelynesse of their inpregnable Castles: some of their trim Townes and fine situation: some of their antiquitie, shewing from what Kings and Princes they tooke their first name and prerogatiue. So generally of all maner of matters belonging to that Soyle, as Churches, Monuments, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, Valleys, Waters, Bridges, fayre Gentlemens houses, and the rest of things whatsoeuer, may become a writers pen to touch, or a readers iudgement to knowe. I write not
<pb facs="7"/>
contenciously to find fault with any, or confute the former writers and tyme:<note place="margin">William <unclear>Malmesburie</unclear> de regibus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorum. Dauid Powell a <unclear>late</unclear> writer, yet excellently learned, made a sharp <unclear>inuec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</unclear> against William Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uus and Polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Virgill (&amp; all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices) accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them of lying tongues, enuyous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and veno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, wilfull <unclear>ignorāce</unclear>, dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged enuie, and <unclear>canckered</unclear> mindes, for that thei spake vnreuerently of Arthur, and many other thrise noble Princes. Jeffrey of Monmouth. Matthewe of Westminster, and others are here in like sort to be read &amp; looked on.</note> but to aduaunce and winne credite to the present trueth, agreeing and yeelding to all former tymes and ages, that hath iustly giuen euery Nation their due, and truely without affection hath set downe in plaine words the worthines of plaine people: for I honor and loue as much a true Author, as I hate and detest a reporter of trifeling fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. A true Historie is called the Mistresse of life: and yet all Historyographers in writing of one thing, agree not well one with another: because the writers were not present in the tymes, in the places, nor saw the persons they make mē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of: but rather haue leaned and listned on the common report, than stayed or trusted to their owne experience.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Strabo</hi> a most famous writer findes fault (for the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion) with <hi>Erstaotheus, Metrodorus, Septius, Possidonius,</hi> and <hi>Patrocles</hi> the Geographer: And such discord did arise amōg writers in tyme past, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith against <hi>Appio,</hi> that they reprooued one another by bookes, and all men in generall reprooued <hi>Herodotus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>God shield me from such caueling: for I deliuer but what I haue seene and read: alledging for defence both auncient Authors, and good tryall of that is written. Wherefore (lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Reader) doe rather struggle with those two strong pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of knowledge, than striue with the weaknesse of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention: which to auoyde sharpnesse (and bitter words) is sweetned and seasoned with gentle verses, more pleasant to some mens eares then prose, and vnder whose smooth grace of speech, more acceptable matter is conuayed, then the common sort of people can comprehend. For verses like a familiar friend (with a gallant phrase) rides quietly by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, and dasheth no one person, and galloping cleanly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way merites no rebuke: when prose with a soft pace cannot with such cunning passe vnperceiued. But all is one when in neither of both is found no matter of mistrust, nor speeches to offend, there is no cause of dislike. So crauing thy good opinion, good Reader farewell.</p>
