   <p>To the redresse hereof, Erasmus in these epistles is a ready strong interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour in many necessary places: in all I am not hable to affirme, knowing that he in hys life tyme, was a manne subiecte to infirmitie and imperfeccion accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the naturall condycion of manne: as he himselfe speaketh of the great Doctour.

   <p>And as for my labour in this rude Englishe translacion, I toke it in hande for none other ende, but only to doe at my hartie frendes vndenyable request, a litell parte, whiche learned menne hauyng done certayne seuerall partes of the
