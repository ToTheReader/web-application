So that as a riuer runs precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate &amp; swift, &amp; sometimes dull and slow; now direct, now <hi>per ambages</hi> about; now deepe then shallow; now muddy, then cleere; now broad, then narrow doth my style flowe, now more serious, then light, now more elaborate or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse. Comicall, Satyricall, as the present subiect requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or as at that time I was affected. And if thou vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to read this Treatise, it shall seeme no otherwise to thee, then the way to an ordinary traueller; sometimes faire, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times foule, here Champion, there inclosed; barren in one place, better soile in another; by woods, groues, hills, dales, plaines, &amp;c.

And I doe easily grant, if a rigid censurer should criticize on this which I haue writ, he should not find three faults as <hi>Scaliger</hi> in <hi>Terence,</hi> but 300. euen as many as hee hath done in <hi>Cardans</hi> subtilties, or <hi>Borocius</hi> on <hi>Sacro-Boscus.</hi> If ought be amisse, I require a friendly admonition, no bitter inuectiue, otherwise as in ordinary controuersies, <hi>funem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionis nectamus. sed cui bono?</hi> we may contend, and likely misuse one another, but to what purpose? we are both schollers, say, <q>

      </note> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre you to that which hath beene formerly said. In the

meane time, if any man shall say, <hi>Medice cura teipsum,</hi> or as <hi>Wisdom. 17.8.</hi> it was obiected to those wisards, <hi>They that promised to driue away feare and trouble from the sicke person, were sicke for feare, and worthy to be laughed at.</hi> I replie with <note n="q" place="margin">

   <p>It now remaines, that I make a thankefull remembrance of such friends, to whom I haue beene beholden for their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, or troubled in perusing seuerall parts, or all of this Treatise. For I did impart it to some of our worthiest Physitians, whose approbations I had for matters of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, and to some Diuines, and others of better note in our Vniuersity, as wel as to my more priuate Collegiate friends: whose censures when I had passed, and that with good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to proceed, I was the bolder to hasten it. <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missu superiorum,</hi> to the Presse. I will name no man, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixe as the custome is any Encomiasticke verses, which I thanke my friends haue beene offered, least if either whole or part should be misliked, I should preiudice their iudgment, I ackowledge my selfe much beholding and bound to them: If ought be amisse, I take it wholy to my selfe, and say againe. <q>

            <l>Nec voluit.—</l>
         </lg>
      </q> But I am ouertroublesome, I will conclude, if first I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest a fauourable censure of such faults as are omitted in the Presse. The Copie (as I haue said) was once written and in hast, I could not alwaye be there my selfe; or had I beene still present, <hi>Non omnem molitor quae fluit vnda videt.</hi> The Miller sees not all the water goes by his Mill. Besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny letters mistaken, misplaced, added, omitted as <hi>i</hi> for <hi>y,</hi> or <hi>a</hi> for <hi>e,</hi> or <hi>o,</hi> false points, &amp;c. which are in some copies onely, not throughout: (To point at each particular of which were to picke out the seedes of a foule bushell of corne) some of the chiefest, as thou shalt find them corrected, I desire thee
<pb facs="450"/>
to take notice of. My translations are sometimes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paraphrases, and that onely taken which was to my purpose; quotations are often inserted in the Text, which make the Style more ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>sh, or in the Margine as it hapned. Greeke Authors, <hi>Plato, Plutarch, Athenaeus, &amp;c.</hi> I haue cited out of their interpretors, because the Originall was not so ready &amp;c. I haue indeede mingled <hi>Sacra prophanis,</hi> but I hope not prophaned; and in repetition of Authors names, not according to Chronologie, rancked them <hi>per accidens</hi>; sometimes Neoterickes, before Ancients, as my memory suggested.</p>
   <p>These are the things which I thought good to mention in this Epilogue, the consideration of which I leaue to thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable censure, and withall submissiunesse, as I ought, my selfe and these my labours to a friendly Reader.</p>
