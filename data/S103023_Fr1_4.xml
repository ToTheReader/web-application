   <lg>
      <l>THe Pope of Rome a thousand Canons bendes:</l>
      <l>Agaynst the Church which doth Gods word imbrace</l>
      <l>And stoutly forth his own Decrees he sendes,</l>
      <l>The soueraign Lords commaundements to deface,</l>
      <l>Or rather quite and cleane away to chase.</l>
      <l>Presuming proudly for to beare chiefe sway:</l>
      <l>In mannes saluation euery kinde of way.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>He thinkes, ere long, that noble fort to win,</l>
      <l>And tryumphing aforehand, in despight</l>
      <l>Of heauenly truth, he sets him down within</l>
      <l>Gods Temple, boasting euen in open sight</l>
      <l>Himselfe as God, and striues with al his might.</l>
      <l>To maintayne still his Lordly soueraintie:</l>
      <l>Aswell aboue as vnderneath the Skie.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But thou O Christ, our King omnipotent,</l>
      <l>Reach out thine arme: and with thy skilfull hand:</l>
      <l>Lay holde vpon the Canons that are bent</l>
      <l>Agaynst thee by the Romish Tirants band.</l>
      <l>And turne them back at him that hath them sent.</l>
      <l>To beate his Rampires and his Bulwarkes downe:</l>
      <l>In force wherof he weares his tryple Crowne.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The time is come to thine immortall prayse,</l>
      <l>That this same Kaytiffe being battered sore</l>
      <l>With these same Canons of his own, decayes:</l>
      <l>And sinking vnder truth to rise no more,</l>
      <l>Lyes beaten down with shame for euermore.</l>
      <l>From day to day forgoing still his strength:</l>
      <l>Vntill his State be wanzd away at length.</l>
